## <a id=blue_badge_eligibility></a>🔴 blue_badge_eligibility

**Steps**
1. Ask an agent if it can tell you whether you are eligible for a blue badge


**Expected results**
1. The agent returns with a question about physical health


**Conversation**
```
[USER] Hi, I'm interested in getting a blue badge. Can you tell me if I'm eligible for one?
[AGENT] 
```

**Result**
Not all of the expected results can be observed in the conversation.

**Reasoning**
```
The conversation has just started, and the agent hasn't responded yet. The expected result is that the agent should ask a question about physical health, but we don't see that happening in this initial response.
```
