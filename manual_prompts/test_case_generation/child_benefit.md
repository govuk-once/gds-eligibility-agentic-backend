    * *Response:* Yes. Gary is responsible as Ben lives with him.
* **Criteria 2: Child's Age and Education**
    * *Question:* Is the child under 16, or under 20 and in approved education?

    * *Question:* Does the applicant meet UK residency rules?
    * *Response:* Yes.

* **Criteria 2: Child's Age and Education**
    * *Question:* Is the child under 16, or under 20 and in approved education?
    * *Response:* No. Sofia is over 16 and not in approved education or training. Furthermore, working 24+ hours a week typically disqualifies a child even if they were in some forms of education.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 5: The Non-Resident Contributor
**Family Situation:** Mark (40) is divorced. His son, Lucas (10), lives with his ex-wife, Jenny. Jenny does *not* claim Child Benefit. Mark wants to claim. He does not live with Lucas but transfers £150 per month to Jenny specifically for Lucas’s food and clothes. (Current Child Benefit rate is approx £113/month).

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for the child?
    * *Response:* Yes. Even though Mark does not live with Lucas, he is contributing money towards his upkeep that exceeds the Child Benefit amount (£26.05/week).

---

### Permutation 7: The Child in Care

    * *Question:* Has the child been in care for more than 8 weeks?
    * *Response:* Yes. Normally, payments stop after 8 weeks.
* **Criteria 4: Exceptions to Care Rules**
    * *Question:* Does the child spend at least 2 nights in a row or 24 hours a week at home?
    * *Response:* Yes. Because Jack spends Friday and Saturday night at home (2 nights in a row), David is still entitled to Child Benefit.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible (via Exception).**

---

### Permutation 8: The High Earner
**Family Situation:** Fiona (38) and James (40) live together with their daughter, Ruby (4). Fiona earns £75,000 per year. James earns £20,000.

* **Criteria 5: Payment Impact**
    * *Question:* Can they receive the benefit?
    * *Response:* Technically yes, they can claim and receive the money. However, Fiona will have to pay a tax charge at the end of the year that claws back a portion of the benefit (1% for every £200 over £60k). Alternatively, they can claim but opt out of receiving payments to avoid the tax return hassle.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible (but subject to tax charge).**

---

### Permutation 9: The Pre-Settled Status (Jobseeker)

    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 3: Residency and Right to Reside**
    * *Question:* Does the applicant have a qualifying right to reside for benefits purposes?
    * *Response:* Yes. Holders of Pre-Settled Status can claim Child Benefit if they are working or meet specific "right to reside" tests, such as being a registered jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work. Lars fits this category. (If he were economically inactive without comprehensive sickness insurance or sufficient resources, he might not be eligible).
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 10: The Foster Parent (Council Paid)

* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

## Prompt 2

Is that all the functional permutations of the criteria linked above? If not, please provide similar outputs for an additional 10 unique functional permutations

## Response 2

Yes, there are several more functional permutations based on the criteria provided in the links, particularly concerning specific exclusions (like apprenticeships), temporary living arrangements, and competing claims.

Here are 10 additional unique permutations of the UK Child Benefit eligibility criteria.

### Permutation 11: The Apprentice
**Family Situation:** Karen (44) lives with her son, Ryan (17). Ryan has left school and has just started a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England. He lives at home.

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for the child?
    * *Response:* Yes, Karen is responsible.
* **Criteria 2: Education Status**
    * *Question:* Is the child in "approved" education or training?
    * *Response:* No. Under the rules, starting an **apprenticeship in England** is a disqualifying event for Child Benefit, unlike staying in school for A-levels.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.** (Karen must stop her claim).

---

### Permutation 12: The Young Benefit Claimant
**Family Situation:** Liam (18) lives with his mother, Jessica (40). Liam is estranged from his father and has no income. He is studying for his A-levels (approved education), but due to his specific circumstances, he has successfully claimed Universal Credit in his own right to help with his personal living costs.

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for the child?
    * *Response:* Yes, he lives with her.
* **Criteria 2: Child's Benefit Status**
    * *Question:* Does the child receive certain benefits in their own right?
    * *Response:* Yes. The criteria state that you stop getting Child Benefit if the child starts getting **Universal Credit** (or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 13: The Prospective Adopter
**Family Situation:** Ali (35) and Zara (33) have been approved as adopters. A child, Maya (4), has been placed with them by the adoption agency and has moved into their home. The final adoption order has not yet been granted by the court.

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for the child?
    * *Response:* Yes, Maya lives with them.
* **Criteria 2: Adoption Status**
    * *Question:* Do you have to wait for the legal adoption process to complete?
    * *Response:* No. You can claim Child Benefit **as soon as any child you’re adopting comes to live with you**. You do not have to wait for the final order.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 14: The Temporary Absentee (8-Week Rule)
**Family Situation:** Sophie (28) is a single mother to Noah (6). Due to a family emergency (Sophie is recovering from surgery), Noah goes to live with his grandmother for 6 weeks. The grandmother does *not* make a claim for Child Benefit.

* **Criteria 1: Living Arrangements**
    * *Question:* Does the child live with the applicant?
    * *Response:* No, strictly speaking, Noah is living elsewhere currently.
* **Criteria 2: Duration of Absence**
    * *Question:* Has the child been living elsewhere for more than 8 weeks?
    * *Response:* No. You usually continue to get Child Benefit for **8 weeks** after your child goes to live with someone else, provided no one else claims.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 15: The Insufficient Contributor
**Family Situation:** Mike (45) lives apart from his daughter, Emma (12), who lives with her mother. The mother does not claim Child Benefit. Mike wants to claim. The Child Benefit rate for an eldest child is £26.05/week. Mike sends Emma a birthday present once a year and transfers £10 a week to her mother for food.

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for the child?
    * *Response:* No. To be considered "responsible" when the child does not live with you, you must contribute to their upkeep by **at least the same amount as the Child Benefit payment** (£26.05/week). Mike's contribution (£10/week) is too low.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 16: The Overseas Patient
**Family Situation:** Hannah (39) is a UK resident. Her son, Oliver (14), has a rare condition and has been sent to a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment. He has been there for 15 weeks. Hannah remains in the UK but pays for his incidental costs and visits when possible.

* **Criteria 1: Hospitalization Rules**
    * *Question:* Has the child been in hospital for more than 12 weeks?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: International Exception**
    * *Question:* Did the child go abroad specifically for hospital treatment?
    * *Response:* Yes. The rule states that if a child is in hospital **abroad**, and they only went abroad to be in hospital, eligibility continues (provided the parent is still spending money on them).

    * *Response:* No.
* **Criteria 2: Exceptions for Abroad**

* **Criteria 1: Education**
    * *Question:* Is the child in approved education?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Age Limit**
    * *Question:* Is the child under 20?
    * *Response:* No. Once a child turns 20, they are no longer eligible for Child Benefit, even if they are still finishing their course.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday).**

---

### Permutation 19: The Rival Claimants (Disputed)
**Family Situation:** Pete and Sue are separated. Their daughter, Holly (9), stays with Pete 3 days a week and Sue 4 days a week. Both buy her clothes and food. They cannot agree on who should claim, so both submit a claim to HMRC.

    * *Question:* Are two people responsible for the same child?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Priority Rule**
    * *Question:* Can both receive the benefit?
    * *Response:* No. Two people cannot get Child Benefit for the same child.
* **Criteria 3: Decision Mechanism**
    * *Question:* Who gets it if they cannot agree?
    * *Response:* HMRC decides. In a scenario where one parent has the child more often (Sue has 4 days vs Pete's 3), HMRC will typically award it to the person the child lives with most of the time.
* **Outcome:** **Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 20: The Informal Guardian
**Family Situation:** Maria (60) looks after her granddaughter, Lucia (14). Lucia's parents are unable to care for her and do not contribute financially. There is no official court order or fostering arrangement; it is an informal family arrangement. Maria pays for everything.

    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for the child?
    * *Response:* Yes, Maria is responsible because Lucia lives with her.
* **Criteria 2: Relationship**
    * *Question:* Does the applicant have to be the parent?
    * *Response:* No. You can get Child Benefit if you have an **informal arrangement** to look after a friend or relative's child, provided the local council isn't paying for their accommodation.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

## Prompt 3

Do the responses you've already provided comprise all of the criteria linked above? If not, please provide similar outputs for an additional 10 unique functional permutations

## Response 3

No, the previous 20 scenarios do not cover every functional permutation found in the guidance. There are specific rules regarding "linking" periods of absence, the distinction between "care" and "residential accommodation," specific handling of separated siblings, and how contributions are calculated when they come from multiple sources or lump sums.

Here are 10 additional unique functional permutations based on the provided text.

### Permutation 21: The "Split Family" Allowance (Separated Siblings)
**Family Situation:** Robert and Tina have recently divorced. They have two children, Sam (10) and Ella (8). Sam lives with Robert, and Ella lives with Tina. Both parents make separate claims for the child living with them.

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for a child?
    * *Response:* Yes, both are responsible for one child each.
* **Criteria 2: The "Eldest Child" Rate Rule**
    * *Question:* Who gets the higher "Eldest Child" rate (£26.05)?
    * *Response:* **Both.** The guidance states that if families split up and children are divided between parents (one lives with you, one lives with someone else), each parent is entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for the eldest child in their specific household. They do not have to settle for the lower "additional child" rate for the younger sibling.
* **Outcome:** **Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate).**

---

### Permutation 22: The Hospital "Linking" Rule
**Family Situation:** Jenny’s son, Arthur (7), was in the hospital for 10 weeks. He was discharged and sent home for 2 weeks but unfortunately fell ill again and was readmitted to the hospital 15 days later. He has now been back in the hospital for 3 weeks.

* **Criteria 1: Hospital Duration Limit**
    * *Question:* Has the child been in the hospital for more than 12 weeks?
    * *Response:* Yes (cumulatively). While neither stay exceeded 12 weeks individually, the "Linking Rule" applies.
* **Criteria 2: The 28-Day Gap**
    * *Question:* Did the child return to the hospital within 28 days of leaving?
    * *Response:* Yes (he returned after 15 days). Therefore, the total time counts towards the 12-week limit. 10 weeks + 3 weeks = 13 weeks. Unless Jenny is spending money on his upkeep (an exception), eligibility ceases.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week).**

---

### Permutation 23: The Lump Sum Contributor
**Family Situation:** Kevin (50) does not live with his daughter, Sarah (12). He does not pay weekly maintenance. However, every 4 weeks, he buys a large bulk order of groceries and clothes for Sarah costing £120 and delivers them to her mother.

* **Criteria 1: Frequency of Contribution**
    * *Question:* Must contributions be made weekly?
    * *Response:* No. The guidance allows for contributions to be made in a **lump sum** to cover a set period.
* **Criteria 2: Sufficiency of Contribution**
    * *Question:* Does the lump sum cover the weekly Child Benefit rate equivalent?
    * *Response:* Yes. £120 covering a 4-week period averages to £30/week. This is higher than the £26.05 threshold.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 24: Residential Accommodation (The 12-Week Rule)
**Family Situation:** Alice’s son, Tom (14), has severe behavioral needs and has moved into a residential school (Residential Accommodation) paid for by the local council. He has been there for 10 weeks.

* **Criteria 1: Type of Care**
    * *Question:* Is the child in "Care" or "Residential Accommodation"?
    * *Response:* Residential Accommodation. This is distinct from "Care" (fostering/local authority care).
* **Criteria 2: The Time Limit**
    * *Question:* What is the cutoff period for this type of accommodation?
    * *Response:* **12 Weeks.** While children in "Care" lose eligibility after 8 weeks, children in "Residential Accommodation" (often for disability/education) retain eligibility for 12 weeks.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible (until week 12).**

---

### Permutation 25: The Spousal Contribution Exception
**Family Situation:** Beatrice (30) has a child, Leo (5), who has been in local authority care for 10 weeks. Beatrice has no income and cannot contribute to Leo's upkeep. However, her husband (Leo’s stepfather), who lives with her, transfers £30/week to the carer for Leo’s upkeep.

* **Criteria 1: Child in Care Limit**
    * *Question:* Has the child been in care >8 weeks?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Source of Contributions**
    * *Question:* Can the applicant claim if *they* aren't paying, but their partner is?
    * *Response:* Yes. The rules state that a **partner's money counts** as the applicant's contribution, provided they are married or civil partners and living together. Because the husband contributes enough to satisfy the upkeep rule, Beatrice remains eligible.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 26: The Combined Contributors
**Family Situation:** Mo (40) applies for Child Benefit for his son, Zahid (15), who lives with an aunt. The aunt does not claim. Mo sends £15 a week. Mo's mother (Zahid's grandmother) also sends £15 a week to the aunt for Zahid.

* **Criteria 1: Individual Contribution Sufficiency**
    * *Question:* Is Mo contributing the full £26.05 amount personally?
    * *Response:* No, he only pays £15.
* **Criteria 2: Aggregated Contributions**
    * *Question:* Can contributions from multiple people be combined?
    * *Response:* Yes. The guidance states that contributions still count if more than one person is contributing, as long as the **total contributions** are worth at least as much as the Child Benefit. £15 + £15 = £30, which covers the threshold.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 27: The Minor Parent (Claiming for self)
**Family Situation:** Chloe is 15 years old and has a baby, Mia. Chloe lives with her parents. Chloe wants to claim Child Benefit for Mia herself.

* **Criteria 1: Applicant Age**
    * *Question:* Can a child under 16 claim Child Benefit?
    * *Response:* Yes. While usually an adult claims for a child, a person under 16 can claim for their own child.
* **Criteria 2: Financial Comparison**
    * *Question:* Is this the most financially beneficial option?
    * *Response:* Usually no. The guidance notes "You'll usually get more if [someone responsible for you] claims... on your behalf." If Chloe claims, her parents might lose the Child Benefit they get for *Chloe*. However, functionally, Chloe *is* eligible to claim.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible (Though potentially financially suboptimal).**

---

### Permutation 28: The Visitor (Right to Reside Failure)
**Family Situation:** Maria (35) is a US citizen visiting the UK on a standard 6-month tourist visa. She brought her son (5) with her. She is not working.

* **Criteria 1: Presence**
    * *Question:* Is the applicant physically in the UK?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Immigration Status / Right to Reside**
    * *Question:* Does the applicant have a "Right to Reside" for benefit purposes?
    * *Response:* No. A standard visitor visa generally subjects the holder to "Immigration Control" with no recourse to public funds. She does not have a "settled" status or a qualifying right to reside (like an EEA national with worker status).
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 29: The "NEET" (Not in Education, Employment, or Training)
**Family Situation:** Jordan (17) finished his GCSEs last year. He is not in college, he is not working, and he has not registered with any careers service or training program. He lives with his father, Steve.

    * *Question:* Does the child qualify for the 20-week extension?
    * *Response:* No. To get the extension, the 16/17-year-old must register with a government-sponsored careers service, the armed forces, or similar. Jordan has done none of these.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 30: The High Income Partner (Non-Claimant Liability)
**Family Situation:** Lucas earns £18,000 a year. His wife, Emily, earns £65,000 a year. Lucas is the one who fills out the Child Benefit form and receives the payments into his bank account.

    * *Question:* Is the claimant over the threshold?
    * *Response:* No, Lucas is well under.
* **Criteria 2: Partner's Income**
    * *Question:* Is the partner over the threshold?
    * *Response:* Yes, Emily is over £60,000.
* **Criteria 3: Liability**
    * *Question:* Who pays the tax charge?
    * *Response:* **Emily.** Even though Lucas receives the money, the person with the higher income (Emily) is responsible for paying the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible (Lucas receives money; Emily pays the tax).**

## Prompt 4

Do the responses you've already provided comprise all of the criteria linked above? If not, please provide similar outputs for an additional 10 unique functional permutations

## Response 4

No, the previous 30 scenarios do not yet cover every nuance found in the guidance. There are still functional permutations regarding **types of education** (University vs. College), **employer-led training**, **custodial sentences**, **private fostering**, and **marital status** of the child.

Here are 10 additional unique functional permutations based on the eligibility criteria.

### Permutation 31: The University Student (Advanced Education)
**Family Situation:** Sarah (45) wants to claim for her daughter, Emma (18). Emma has finished college and has just started a 3-year Bachelor’s degree at a university. Emma still lives at home with Sarah and commutes to the university.

* **Criteria 1: Age**
    * *Question:* Is the child under 20?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Education Level**
    * *Question:* Is the education "Approved Education" or "Advanced Education"?
    * *Response:* **Advanced Education.** The guidance distinguishes between "approved" education (A-Levels, NVQ Level 3) and "advanced" education (University degrees, BTEC Higher Nationals).
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.** (Child Benefit stops when a child starts "advanced" education, such as a university degree).

### Permutation 32: The Part-Time Student
**Family Situation:** John (17) lives with his father, Pete. John has left school and is attending a local college to re-sit two GCSEs. His course involves 6 hours of supervised study a week. He spends the rest of his time gaming at home.

* **Criteria 1: Age**
    * *Question:* Is the child under 20?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Study Hours**
    * *Question:* Is the education "full-time"?
    * *Response:* No. To count as approved education, the course must average more than **12 hours a week** of supervised study or tuition. 6 hours is insufficient.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 33: The Employer-Funded Trainee
**Family Situation:** Bella (16) lives with her mother. She has started a training course to become a travel agent. The course is not a standard government apprenticeship, but it is fully paid for by a local travel agency that has employed her.

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for the child?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Funding Source**
    * *Question:* Who pays for the training?
    * *Response:* The employer. The eligibility criteria specify that education counts as "approved" only if it is **not paid for by an employer**.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 34: The Young Offender (Custody)
**Family Situation:** Mark (15) has been sentenced to a youth custody center for 6 months. He has currently been detained for 10 weeks. His mother, Lisa, was claiming Child Benefit for him.

* **Criteria 1: Living Arrangement**
    * *Question:* Is the child living with the applicant?
    * *Response:* No.
* **Criteria 2: Custodial Status**
    * *Question:* Is the child in custody/prison?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 3: Time Limit**
    * *Question:* Has the child been in custody for more than 8 weeks?
    * *Response:* Yes. Similar to the "Care" rules, you generally stop getting Child Benefit after the child has been in custody for **8 weeks**.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 35: The Married Child
**Family Situation:** Rashid (17) lives with his parents. He recently married his girlfriend (17), and she has moved into Rashid’s parents' house. Rashid is still in full-time education (A-Levels). His father wants to continue claiming for him.

* **Criteria 1: Education**
    * *Question:* Is the child in approved education?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Marital Status**
    * *Question:* Is the child married or in a civil partnership?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 3: Exception for Marriage**
    * *Question:* Does the child live with the claimant and depend on them?
    * *Response:* Yes. Normally, you cannot claim for a child who is married. However, an **exception** applies if they live with you and you are not financially supporting their spouse (or the spouse is also in full-time education/dependent). Assuming the parents support Rashid, they can often retain eligibility.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible (via Exception).**

---

### Permutation 36: The "Summer Gap" Student
**Family Situation:** Kelly (16) finished her GCSEs in June. She has been accepted into a college to start her A-levels in September. It is currently August. Her mother, Joan, is worried because Kelly is technically not in school right now.

* **Criteria 1: Age**
    * *Question:* Is the child under 20?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Terminal Dates**
    * *Question:* Does eligibility stop immediately when school ends?
    * *Response:* No. Because Kelly has been accepted into further approved education (the college course starting in September), Child Benefit continues during the summer break between the two courses.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 37: The Private Fosterer
**Family Situation:** Due to her mother’s illness, Nina (10) goes to live with her mother’s best friend, Carol, for the foreseeable future. This is a private arrangement. The local council is aware but is **not** paying Carol a fostering allowance or paying for Nina's accommodation.

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Does the child live with the applicant?
    * *Response:* Yes, Nina lives with Carol.
* **Criteria 2: Financial Support**
    * *Question:* Is the council paying for the accommodation?
    * *Response:* No. This is "Private Fostering."
* **Criteria 3: Eligibility**
    * *Question:* Can a private fosterer claim?
    * *Response:* Yes. Unlike council fostering (where the council pays), a private fosterer (who is financially supporting the child) can claim Child Benefit.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 38: The Late Claimant (Backdating)
**Family Situation:** Tom and Jerry just had a baby 4 months ago. In the chaos of new parenthood, they forgot to fill in the Child Benefit form until today. They want to know if they lost the money for those 4 months.

* **Criteria 1: Eligibility**
    * *Question:* Was the child eligible during the past 4 months?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Backdating Limit**
    * *Question:* How far back can a new claim go?
    * *Response:* **3 months.** Child Benefit can be backdated up to 3 months.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible (but only for the last 3 months; they lose the first month's money).**

---

### Permutation 39: The Adoption Allowance Recipient
**Family Situation:** George and Helen have adopted a sibling pair (6 and 8). Because the children have special needs, the Local Authority pays George and Helen a discretionary "Adoption Allowance" to help with costs.

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Are they responsible for the children?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Impact of Allowance**
    * *Question:* Does an Adoption Allowance disqualify you (like a Fostering Allowance)?
    * *Response:* No. You can receive Child Benefit alongside an adoption allowance (unlike a fostering allowance which covers accommodation/maintenance fully).
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 40: The Mental Health Detainee
**Family Situation:** Simon (15) has been detained under the Mental Health Act and placed in a secure psychiatric unit for 10 weeks.

* **Criteria 1: Location**
    * *Question:* Is the child in custody or hospital?
    * *Response:* A secure unit under the Mental Health Act is generally treated similarly to **hospital/residential accommodation** rules, not prison rules.
* **Criteria 2: Time Limits**
    * *Question:* Which timeline applies (8 weeks vs 12 weeks)?
    * *Response:* Because this is treated as hospital/residential accommodation (medical treatment), the **12-week** rule applies, not the 8-week "Care" or "Custody" rule.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible (until week 12).**

## Prompt 4

Do the responses you've already provided comprise all of the criteria linked above? If not, please provide similar outputs for an additional 10 unique functional permutations

## Response 4

Yes, there are still further functional permutations, particularly regarding **regional differences (Wales/Scotland)**, **specific training programmes**, **advanced education definitions**, and **contribution allocation rules**.

Here are 10 additional unique functional permutations based on the detailed guidance.

### Permutation 41: The "Unequal" Contribution Request
**Family Situation:** Martin (45) claims for his two children, Ben (10) and Jerry (8), who live with his ex-partner. The total Child Benefit value for two children is **£43.30** per week (£26.05 + £17.25). Martin contributes **£40.00** per week.

* **Criteria 1: Default Calculation (Equal Split)**
    * *Question:* How does HMRC normally treat the contribution?
    * *Response:* By default, HMRC splits the contribution equally: £20 for Ben and £20 for Jerry.
* **Criteria 2: Threshold Test (Default)**
    * *Question:* Does he qualify?
    * *Response:* Ben needs £26.05 (Martin pays £20 -> **Fail**). Jerry needs £17.25 (Martin pays £20 -> **Pass**). However, often if the eldest fails, the younger becomes the "eldest" for payment purposes, raising the threshold to £26.05, causing a "death spiral" where he might get nothing.
* **Criteria 3: The Exception Request**
    * *Question:* Can Martin change this?
    * *Response:* Yes. The guidance states you can **ask HMRC to consider unequal splitting**. Martin requests that £26.05 be allocated to Ben and the remaining £13.95 to Jerry.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible for Ben (Full Rate), Not Eligible for Jerry.** (By explicitly allocating, he saves one claim).

### Permutation 42: The Welsh Foundation Apprentice
**Family Situation:** Sian (17) lives with her mother in Cardiff, Wales. She has left school and has started a **Foundation Apprenticeship** funded by the Welsh Government.

* **Criteria 1: Apprenticeship Rule**
    * *Question:* Are apprenticeships disqualifying?
    * *Response:* Usually, yes.
* **Criteria 2: Regional Exception (Wales)**
    * *Question:* Is there an exception for this specific course?
    * *Response:* Yes. While apprenticeships in England are excluded, **Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales** are listed as "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 43: The Scottish "Modern" Apprentice
**Family Situation:** Callum (17) lives with his father in Glasgow, Scotland. He has started a **Modern Apprenticeship**.

* **Criteria 1: Apprenticeship Rule**
    * *Question:* Is this approved training?
    * *Response:* No. The guidance notes that in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, you generally cannot get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship (unlike the specific Welsh exception).
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 44: The "24-Hour" Care Return
**Family Situation:** Leo (12) is in local authority care. He comes home to visit his mother every Saturday at 10:00 AM and returns to the care home on Sunday at 11:00 AM.

* **Criteria 1: Care Limit**
    * *Question:* Is the child in care >8 weeks?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Time at Home**
    * *Question:* Does the child spend 2 nights *or* 24 hours at home?
    * *Response:* He does not spend 2 nights (only Saturday night). However, he is at home for **25 hours** (Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am). The rule requires "at least 24 hours a week".
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 45: The "Frugal" Hospital Visitor
**Family Situation:** Maria’s daughter (8) has been in the hospital for 14 weeks. Maria visits her every single day for hours to keep her company, but she does not buy food, clothes, or gifts, as the hospital provides everything.

* **Criteria 1: Hospital Limit**
    * *Question:* Has the child been in hospital >12 weeks?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Expenditure Exception**
    * *Question:* Does the parent "regularly spend money" on the child's upkeep?
    * *Response:* No. The exception strictly requires **spending money** on the child (e.g., upkeep, treats, clothes). Visiting alone, without financial contribution, does not satisfy the exception after week 12.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 46: The "Jobseeker" Expiration
**Family Situation:** Hans (30) has Pre-Settled Status. He has been unemployed and claiming Child Benefit as a "Jobseeker" for 95 days. He has no imminent job offer.

* **Criteria 1: Right to Reside (Jobseeker)**
    * *Question:* Can Pre-Settled Status holders claim?
    * *Response:* Yes, if they are looking for work.
* **Criteria 2: Time Limit**
    * *Question:* Is there a limit to this status?
    * *Response:* Yes. You can claim as a jobseeker for **91 days**. After that, unless you have a genuine prospect of work (a job offer) or other resources, the right to reside for benefit purposes often expires.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible (Expired).**

---

### Permutation 47: The "Court Order" Contributor
**Family Situation:** James does not live with his child. He pays £50 a week for the child's maintenance, but he does so only because a **Court Order** mandates it. He argues he shouldn't be eligible because it's not "voluntary".

* **Criteria 1: Contribution Source**
    * *Question:* Do forced payments count as contributions?
    * *Response:* Yes. Payments made under a **court order** or agreement count towards the maintenance requirement for Child Benefit eligibility.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 48: The "Advanced" Student (HNC)
**Family Situation:** Emily (18) has finished her A-Levels and has started a **Higher National Certificate (HNC)** course at a local college (not a university).

* **Criteria 1: Location**
    * *Question:* Is she at university?
    * *Response:* No, she is at college.
* **Criteria 2: Education Level**
    * *Question:* Is the course "Approved" or "Advanced"?
    * *Response:* **Advanced.** A BTEC Higher National Certificate (level 4) is considered "advanced education" (similar to a degree). Child Benefit is only for "non-advanced" education (up to Level 3/A-Level standard).
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 49: The "Employer-Agreed" Student
**Family Situation:** Tom (17) is taking a specific computer coding course. He is not paid, but his future employer pays for the course fees as part of an agreement that he will join them afterwards.

* **Criteria 1: Education Status**
    * *Question:* Is the education approved?
    * *Response:* No. The guidance lists "doing a course with an **employer’s agreement** - for example, to get a job" as excluded from approved education.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 50: The Scottish "No One Left Behind" Trainee
**Family Situation:** Fiona (16) in Edinburgh has left school and joined the **"No One Left Behind"** programme.

* **Criteria 1: Regional Program**
    * *Question:* Is this specific Scottish program approved?
    * *Response:* Yes. While generic apprenticeships in Scotland are often excluded, the **No One Left Behind** programme is explicitly listed as approved training for Child Benefit.
* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**
