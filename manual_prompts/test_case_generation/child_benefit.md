    * *Question:* Is the child under 16, or under 20 and in approved education?

* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 5: The Non-Resident Contributor
**Family Situation:** Mark (40) is divorced. His son, Lucas (10), lives with his ex-wife, Jenny. Jenny does *not* claim Child Benefit. Mark wants to claim. He does not live with Lucas but transfers £150 per month to Jenny specifically for Lucas’s food and clothes. (Current Child Benefit rate is approx £113/month).

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for the child?

* **Criteria 5: Payment Impact**
    * *Question:* Can they receive the benefit?
    * *Response:* Technically yes, they can claim and receive the money. However, Fiona will have to pay a tax charge at the end of the year that claws back a portion of the benefit (1% for every £200 over £60k).

* **Outcome:** **Eligible (but subject to tax charge).**

### Permutation 9: The Pre-Settled Status (Jobseeker)

## Response 2

Here are 10 additional unique permutations of the UK Child Benefit eligibility criteria.

### Permutation 11: The Apprentice

    * *Response:* Yes, Karen is responsible.
* **Criteria 2: Education Status**
    * *Question:* Is the child in "approved" education or training?

* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.** (Karen must stop her claim).

---

### Permutation 12: The Young Benefit Claimant
**Family Situation:** Liam (18) lives with his mother, Jessica (40). Liam is estranged from his father and has no income.

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for the child?
    * *Response:* Yes, he lives with her.
* **Criteria 2: Child's Benefit Status**
    * *Question:* Does the child receive certain benefits in their own right?
    * *Response:* Yes. The criteria state that you stop getting Child Benefit if the child starts getting **Universal Credit** (or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 13: The Prospective Adopter
**Family Situation:** Ali (35) and Zara (33) have been approved as adopters. A child, Maya (4), has been placed with them by the adoption agency and has moved into their home. The final adoption order has not yet been granted by the court.

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for the child?
    * *Response:* Yes, Maya lives with them.
* **Criteria 2: Adoption Status**

* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 14: The Temporary Absentee (8-Week Rule)

* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**
    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for the child?
    * *Response:* No. To be considered "responsible" when the child does not live with you, you must contribute to their upkeep by **at least the same amount as the Child Benefit payment** (£26.05/week). Mike's contribution (£10/week) is too low.
* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 16: The Overseas Patient
**Family Situation:** Hannah (39) is a UK resident. Her son, Oliver (14), has a rare condition and has been sent to a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment. He has been there for 15 weeks. Hannah remains in the UK but pays for his incidental costs and visits when possible.

    * *Question:* Is the child in approved education?
    * *Response:* Yes.
* **Criteria 2: Age Limit**

* **Outcome:** **Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible.**

---

### Permutation 20: The Informal Guardian
**Family Situation:** Maria (60) looks after her granddaughter, Lucia (14). Lucia's parents are unable to care for her and do not contribute financially. There is no official court order or fostering arrangement; it is an informal family arrangement. Maria pays for everything.

    * *Response:* Yes, Maria is responsible because Lucia lives with her.
