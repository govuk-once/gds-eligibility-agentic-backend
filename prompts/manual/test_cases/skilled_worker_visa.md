* **Does the salary meet the Going Rate (100%)?** Yes, £85,000 is above the £75,000 going rate.

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** Elena meets the standard criteria without needing to trade points.

---

### Permutation 2: New Entrant (Option E)
**Criteria:** Applicant is "New Entrant" (under 26, recent student/graduate, or in professional training). Salary must be at least **£33,400** **AND** at least **70%** of the standard going rate.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Liam**, a 23-year-old recent graduate from Canada who just finished his Bachelor’s degree in the UK on a Student Visa.
* **Job Offer:** Junior Financial Analyst.
* **Salary Offer:** £35,000 per year.
* **Standard Going Rate for Role:** £42,000 per year (70% of this is £29,400).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is there a valid Sponsor?** Yes.
* **Is the job at the required skill level?** Yes.
* **Does the applicant meet English requirements?** Yes, degree taught in English satisfies this.

* **Does the salary meet the Lower General Threshold (£33,400)?** Yes, £35,000 > £33,400.
* **Does the salary meet the discounted Going Rate (70%)?** Yes, £35,000 is higher than 70% of the going rate (£29,400).

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** Liam qualifies as a New Entrant, allowing him to be paid less than the standard £41,700 and less than the full going rate. *Note: Time on this visa counts toward the 4-year maximum for New Entrants.*

---

### Permutation 3: STEM PhD (Option C)
**Criteria:** Applicant has a relevant PhD in a STEM subject. Salary must be at least **£33,400** **AND** at least **80%** of the standard going rate.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Dr. Aari**, a 29-year-old biological researcher from India with a PhD in Microbiology.
* **Job Offer:** Senior Lab Technician at a pharmaceutical company.
* **Salary Offer:** £34,000 per year.
* **Standard Going Rate for Role:** £38,000 per year (80% of this is £30,400).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is there a valid Sponsor?** Yes.
* **Is the job at the required skill level?** Yes.
* **Does the applicant meet English requirements?** Yes.
* **Does the applicant have a relevant STEM PhD?** Yes, Microbiology is a STEM subject and relevant to the role.
* **Does the salary meet the Lower General Threshold (£33,400)?** Yes, £34,000 > £33,400.
* **Does the salary meet the discounted Going Rate (80%)?** Yes, £34,000 is higher than 80% of the going rate (£30,400).

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** Dr. Aari trades her STEM PhD to meet the lower salary requirements.

---

### Permutation 4: Non-STEM PhD (Option B)
**Criteria:** Applicant has a relevant PhD in a non-STEM subject. Salary must be at least **£37,500** (Note: Higher than the £33.4k floor) **AND** at least **90%** of the standard going rate.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Sarah**, an American historian with a PhD in Modern History.
* **Job Offer:** Historical Consultant for a media production company.
* **Salary Offer:** £35,000 per year.
* **Standard Going Rate for Role:** £36,000 per year (90% of this is £32,400).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is there a valid Sponsor?** Yes.
* **Is the job at the required skill level?** Yes.
* **Does the applicant meet English requirements?** Yes.
* **Does the applicant have a relevant PhD?** Yes.
* **Does the salary meet the Non-STEM PhD General Threshold (£37,500)?** **NO.** The offer is £35,000, which is below the specific £37,500 floor for non-STEM PhD points.
* **Does the salary meet the discounted Going Rate (90%)?** Yes, £35,000 > £32,400.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** Although Sarah meets the "90% of going rate" rule, her total salary is below the £37,500 minimum threshold required for Option B (Non-STEM PhD). She would need a raise of £2,500 to qualify.

---

### Permutation 5: Immigration Salary List (Option D)
**Criteria:** Job is on the Immigration Salary List (ISL). Salary must be at least **£33,400** **AND** at least the **standard (100%)** going rate (no going rate discount).

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Lars**, a stonemason from Norway.
* **Job Offer:** Specialist Stonemason (a role on the ISL).
* **Salary Offer:** £34,000 per year.
* **Standard Going Rate for Role:** £33,500 per year.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is there a valid Sponsor?** Yes.
* **Is the job at the required skill level?** Yes.
* **Does the applicant meet English requirements?** Yes.
* **Is the job on the Immigration Salary List?** Yes.
* **Does the salary meet the Lower General Threshold (£33,400)?** Yes, £34,000 > £33,400. (The standard £41,700 threshold is waived).
* **Does the salary meet the Standard Going Rate (100%)?** Yes, £34,000 > £33,500.

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** The ISL status allows Lars to bypass the £41,700 general threshold, as long as he is paid the full market rate for his role.

---

### Permutation 6: Postdoctoral Position (Specific Science/HE Roles)
**Criteria:** Working in a specific postdoctoral occupation (e.g., 2111, 2311). Salary must be at least **£33,400** **AND** at least **70%** of the standard going rate.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Wei**, a Physicist from China.
* **Job Offer:** Postdoctoral Researcher (Occupation Code 2114) at a UK University.
* **Salary Offer:** £33,500 per year.
* **Standard Going Rate for Role:** £46,000 per year (70% of this is £32,200).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is there a valid Sponsor?** Yes.
* **Is the job at the required skill level?** Yes.
* **Does the applicant meet English requirements?** Yes.
* **Is the role a qualifying Postdoctoral position?** Yes, Code 2114 is eligible.
* **Does the salary meet the Lower General Threshold (£33,400)?** Yes, £33,500 > £33,400.
* **Does the salary meet the discounted Going Rate (70%)?** Yes, £33,500 > £32,200.

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** Wei qualifies for the discount specifically designed for scientific research roles.

---

### Permutation 7: Absolute Fail (Salary Floor)
**Criteria:** Any Permutation.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Kenji**, a Graphic Designer from Japan.
* **Job Offer:** Graphic Designer.
* **Salary Offer:** £30,000 per year.
* **Going Rate:** £29,000.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is there a valid Sponsor?** Yes.
* **English/Skill Level?** Met.
* **Criteria Check:**
    * Does he meet the Standard Threshold (£41,700)? No.
    * Does he meet the Lower Threshold (£33,400)? **No.** Even if he had a PhD or was a New Entrant, £30,000 is below the absolute minimum salary floor of £33,400 for the Skilled Worker route.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** The salary offer is too low for any Skilled Worker permutation (unless he qualifies for a different visa type entirely, like Health and Care if eligible, but for a Graphic Designer, this is a hard refusal).

---

### Permutation 8: Transitional Arrangements (The "Grandfather" Clause)
**Criteria:** Applicant held a Skilled Worker visa *before* April 4, 2024, and is extending or changing employers. The General Salary Threshold is capped at **£29,000** (indexed) rather than the standard £41,700, and going rates are based on the 25th percentile (lower) rather than the 50th percentile (median).

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Priya**, a Marketing Manager who has lived in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022.
* **Job Offer:** Marketing Manager at a new agency.
* **Salary Offer:** £32,000 per year.
* **Standard (New) Going Rate:** £42,000.
* **Transitional (Lower) Going Rate:** £30,000.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is there a valid Sponsor?** Yes.
* **Does she qualify for Transitional Arrangements?** Yes, continuous residence on the route since pre-April 2024.
* **Does the salary meet the Standard Threshold (£41,700)?** **No**, but it does not need to.
* **Does the salary meet the Transitional General Threshold (£29,000)?** Yes, £32,000 > £29,000.
* **Does the salary meet the Transitional Going Rate?** Yes, £32,000 > £30,000.

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** Priya qualifies because she is protected by transitional rules, allowing her to be paid significantly less than a new applicant entering the UK today.

---

### Permutation 9: Health and Care Visa (NHS Pay Bands)
**Criteria:** Job is in a specific Health/Education occupation (e.g., Nurse, Teacher) working for a public authority. Salary must meet the **National Pay Scale** for that role. The General Threshold is ignored in favor of the Banding.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Miguel**, a registered nurse from the Philippines.
* **Job Offer:** Band 5 Nurse at an NHS Trust.
* **Salary Offer:** £28,407 (Standard NHS Band 5 entry).
* **Standard Skilled Worker Threshold:** £41,700.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the job eligible for Health & Care Visa?** Yes.
* **Does the salary meet the General Threshold (£41,700)?** **No.**
* **Does the salary meet the National Pay Scale requirement?** Yes, it matches the official NHS Band 5 rate.

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** Jobs on National Pay Scales are exempt from the high general salary thresholds. As long as the salary matches the legal band for the role, it is approved.

---

### Permutation 10: Care Worker Regulatory Fail (CQC)
**Criteria:** Job is Care Worker (6135) or Senior Care Worker (6136). The employer **must** be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Samuel**, a care assistant from Ghana.
* **Job Offer:** In-home private carer for a wealthy family via a recruitment agency.
* **Salary Offer:** £45,000 (Very high for the sector).
* **Employer Status:** The agency is a licensed visa sponsor, but they are *not* CQC registered (they act only as an introduction service).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is there a valid Sponsor?** Yes.
* **Does the salary meet the threshold?** Yes, exceeds all limits.
* **Is the job eligible?** Yes (Code 6135).
* **Is the employer CQC Registered?** **No.**

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** Despite the high salary and valid sponsorship license, the specific rule for Care Workers requires the employer to be CQC registered to prevent exploitation. Private household direct employment is generally banned on this route.

---

### Permutation 11: The "Going Rate" Trap (High Earner)
**Criteria:** Applicant meets the General Threshold (£41,700) but fails the specific "Going Rate" for a high-paying occupation.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Claire**, a US executive.
* **Job Offer:** Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a small UK start-up.
* **Salary Offer:** £55,000 per year.
* **Standard Going Rate for CEO (Code 1115):** £78,000 per year.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Does the salary meet the General Threshold (£41,700)?** Yes (£55k > £41.7k).
* **Does the salary meet the Going Rate?** **No.** The going rate for a CEO is £78,000. She is being underpaid relative to the UK market for CEOs.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** You must meet the *higher* of the two numbers. Even though £55k is a "good" wage, it is too low for a CEO role under immigration rules.

---

### Permutation 12: Part-Time "Pro-Rata" Floor Failure
**Criteria:** The "Going Rate" can be pro-rated (calculated by hour), but the **General Threshold (£41,700 or £33,400)** is usually a hard floor that cannot be pro-rated (unless in a specific Health/Transitional group).

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Amara**, an Architect from Nigeria who wants to work 3 days a week (22.5 hours) to study privately.
* **Job Offer:** Architect.
* **Hourly Rate:** £30/hour (Equivalent to £58,500 full-time).
* **Actual Gross Annual Salary:** £35,100.
* **General Threshold Required:** £41,700 (Option A).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Does the hourly rate meet the Going Rate?** Yes (Pro-rated, her hourly wage is high).
* **Does the actual gross salary meet the General Threshold (£41,700)?** **No.** She will only earn £35,100.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** Under Option A (Standard), she must earn at least £41,700 *actual gross* per year. Her high hourly rate does not save her; she would need to increase her hours or salary to hit the absolute floor.

---

### Permutation 13: "New Entrant" 4-Year Cap Hit
**Criteria:** "New Entrant" discounts (Option E) are only available for a maximum combined total of 4 years, including time spent on Student/Graduate visas.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Tariq**, who spent 3 years on a PhD Student Visa and 1 year on a Graduate Visa.
* **Job Offer:** Junior Data Analyst.
* **Salary Offer:** £34,000 (Relies on the 70% New Entrant discount).
* **Visa Request:** 2 years.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the salary eligible for New Entrant option?** Yes (£34k > £33.4k floor).
* **Does the applicant have "New Entrant" time remaining?** **No.** Tariq has already utilized 4 years of "time spent" that counts toward this limit (Time on Student visa does not always count, but *Graduate* visa time definitely does, and the rule prohibits granting a visa that takes the *total* time on Graduate/New Entrant skilled worker past 4 years).
    * *Correction/Nuance:* Time on a *Student* visa usually doesn't count toward the 4 years, but time on a *Graduate* visa does. If he has only used 1 year of Graduate visa, he theoretically has 3 years left.
    * *Revised Scenario for Failure:* Tariq has spent **3 years and 6 months** on a **Graduate Visa** (hypothetically extending via exceptional assurance or similar) or previously held a Skilled Worker visa as a new entrant for 3.5 years. He applies for a new 2-year visa.

**Revised Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED (or Restricted).** He cannot be granted a 2-year visa as a New Entrant because it would exceed the 4-year maximum limit for this specific salary discount. He must apply under Option A (full salary) to stay longer.

---

### Permutation 14: New Entrant via "Professional Qualification"
**Criteria:** Applicant is over 26 and not a recent student, but qualifies as a "New Entrant" because they are working towards a recognized professional qualification (e.g., Chartered Accountant) or are in a regulated postdoctoral training.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **John**, aged 32, switching from a dependent visa.
* **Job Offer:** Trainee Chartered Accountant.
* **Salary Offer:** £34,000.
* **Standard Going Rate:** £46,000.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is he under 26 or a recent student?** No.
* **Is he working toward a recognized professional qualification?** Yes (ACCA/ICAEW).
* **Does this grant New Entrant status?** Yes.
* **Does salary meet the 70% discount threshold?** Yes, £34,000 > 70% of £46k (£32.2k).

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** John qualifies for the salary discount despite his age because of the specific nature of his professional training.

---

### Permutation 15: Skill Level Mismatch (RQF Fail)
**Criteria:** The job must be at RQF Level 3 or above.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Lina**, a hospitality expert.
* **Job Offer:** Hotel Concierge.
* **Salary Offer:** £45,000 (High salary).
* **Job Occupation Code:** 6219 (Badges and insignia makers... wait, Concierge is often lower skilled). Let's use **Construction Labourer**.
* **Job Code:** 9120 (Elementary construction occupations).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is there a valid Sponsor?** Yes.
* **Does the salary meet the threshold?** Yes.
* **Is the job at RQF Level 3?** **No.** Construction Labourer is RQF Level 1 or 2 (Lower Skilled).

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** You cannot get a Skilled Worker visa for a lower-skilled job, regardless of how high the salary is.

---

### Permutation 16: Irrelevant PhD (Option C Fail)
**Criteria:** Applicant has a PhD, but the sponsor cannot credibly justify that the qualification is "relevant" to the job role.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Dr. Smith**, holding a PhD in Astrophysics.
* **Job Offer:** HR Manager.
* **Salary Offer:** £35,000.
* **Standard Going Rate:** £40,000.
* **Strategy:** Using "STEM PhD" (Option C) to trade salary down to £34k.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Does the applicant have a STEM PhD?** Yes.
* **Is the PhD relevant to the job?** **No.** An HR Manager role does not require Astrophysics expertise. The Home Office caseworker will likely flag this as not "relevant to the job."

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** The PhD salary discount is not a blanket pass; the qualification must be relevant to the duties performed. Smith must meet the standard salary for an HR Manager.

---

### Permutation 17: Supplementary Work (Permissible)
**Criteria:** A Skilled Worker wants to take a second job. The second job must be either in the *same* occupation code as the main job, OR in a shortage occupation (Immigration Salary List), and no more than 20 hours/week.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Yuki**, currently sponsored as a Graphic Designer (Standard Visa).
* **Scenario:** She wants to take a weekend job (10 hours/week).
* **Second Job:** Bartender.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the main visa valid?** Yes.
* **Is the second job in the same occupation code (Graphic Design)?** No.
* **Is the second job on the Immigration Salary List?** No.

**Expected Outcome:**
**ILLEGAL WORK.** This scenario does not lead to a visa *application*, but it is a critical functional permutation of the visa's *conditions*. Yuki cannot legally take this job. If she took a freelance Graphic Design gig instead, it would be **PERMITTED**.

---

### Permutation 18: The "Guaranteed Pay" Filter (Variable Salary)
**Criteria:** Only **guaranteed basic gross pay** counts towards the salary threshold. Allowances, bonuses, overtime, and commission cannot be included to meet the minimum £41,700 (or applicable lower) threshold.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Julian**, a Sales Director from Argentina.
* **Job Offer:** Sales Director.
* **Salary Offer:** £35,000 Base Salary + £20,000 Guaranteed Commission + £10,000 Performance Bonus (Total package £65,000).
* **Standard Threshold:** £41,700.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is there a valid Sponsor?** Yes.
* **Does the "Total Package" meet the threshold?** Yes (£65k).
* **Does the *Eligible* Salary meet the threshold?** **No.** Only the £35,000 base salary is counted. The commission, even if "guaranteed" by contract, is often excluded or scrutinized heavily if not strictly "basic pay," and performance bonuses are definitely excluded.
    * *Note:* Even if the £20k is fixed, if it is labeled "allowance" or "commission," it is risky. If it is purely base salary, he passes. In this scenario, let's assume it's structured as a "target earning."

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** The Home Office calculates the salary based on the £35,000 guaranteed base. Julian falls short of the £41,700 standard threshold.

---

### Permutation 19: The "Routine Role" Third-Party Ban
**Criteria:** A Skilled Worker cannot be sponsored to work for a third party (a client of the sponsor) if the role involves filling a routine permanent position at the client organization (acting like an agency worker). The sponsor must retain full responsibility for the worker's duties.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Ravi**, an IT Consultant from India.
* **Job Offer:** System Administrator.
* **Sponsor:** "TechRecruit Ltd" (A consultancy).
* **Work Location:** Ravi will work 100% of the time at "Bank Corp," a client of TechRecruit, reporting to Bank Corp managers indefinitely.
* **Salary:** £50,000 (Meets all thresholds).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Does salary meet threshold?** Yes.
* **Is the job skilled?** Yes.
* **Is the role genuine employment by the Sponsor?** **No.** This violates the "contracting out" rule. The sponsor is effectively acting as a recruitment agency supplying labor to a third party.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** The Home Office will determine that the sponsor is not the entity requiring the role, but is merely supplying labor to a third party.

---

### Permutation 20: Care Worker Dependent Ban
**Criteria:** Applicants under occupation codes **6135 (Care Workers)** and **6136 (Senior Care Workers)** are eligible for the visa but **cannot** bring dependents (partners/children) to the UK (rule effective from March 2024).

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Mary**, a qualified carer from Zimbabwe.
* **Job Offer:** Senior Care Worker at a residential home (CQC Registered).
* **Salary:** £29,000 (Meets the specific Health & Care threshold).
* **Family:** She applies with her husband and two children.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the main applicant eligible?** **Yes.** Mary meets the salary and skill requirements for the Health & Care visa.
* **Are the dependents eligible?** **No.** The specific rules for code 6136 prohibit dependents.

**Expected Outcome:**
**SPLIT DECISION.** Mary’s visa is **AWARDED**, but her family’s dependent visas are **REFUSED**. Mary must decide whether to move to the UK alone.

---

### Permutation 21: Student Switching (Course Completion)
**Criteria:** A student switching to a Skilled Worker visa from inside the UK must have **completed** their course, or (for PhD students) completed at least 24 months of it. They cannot switch mid-course (unless applying for a start date *after* course completion).

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Leo**, a Master's student from China.
* **Current Status:** Student Visa (Course ends September 2026).
* **Timeline:** It is currently December 2025. He has a job offer starting January 2026.
* **Job Offer:** Marketing Executive.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the job eligible?** Yes.
* **Is the applicant eligible to switch?** **No.** Leo has not completed his degree (he is only halfway through the academic year) and is not a PhD student.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** Leo cannot switch to the Skilled Worker route from inside the UK until he has completed his studies (or at least all exams/coursework). He would need to leave the UK and apply from overseas (Entry Clearance) if he wants to drop out of the course to take the job.

---

### Permutation 22: The 48-Hour Salary Cap
**Criteria:** When calculating if an applicant meets the minimum salary threshold, the Home Office only considers salary earned in the first **48 hours** of the week. You cannot use a 60-hour work week to artificially inflate a low hourly wage to meet the threshold.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Ahmed**, a Chef.
* **Job Offer:** Head Chef.
* **Contracted Hours:** 60 hours per week.
* **Hourly Rate:** £13.50 per hour.
* **Total Annual Salary:** £42,120 (60 hrs * £13.50 * 52 weeks).
* **Standard Threshold:** £41,700.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Does the gross salary meet the threshold?** Technically yes (£42,120).
* **Does the *Assessable* salary meet the threshold?** **No.** The Home Office caps the calculation at 48 hours.
    * Calculation: 48 hours * £13.50 * 52 weeks = **£33,696**.
* **Is £33,696 above the threshold?** No, it is below £41,700.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** The assessable salary is too low. The sponsor must raise the *hourly* rate, not just the hours.

---

### Permutation 23: Allowances (Accommodation/Transport)
**Criteria:** Allowances (such as housing, car, or cost-of-living allowances) **cannot** be included in the salary calculation. Only the gross basic salary counts.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Elara**, a specialized Engineer.
* **Job Offer:** Structural Engineer.
* **Base Salary:** £38,000.
* **Car Allowance:** £5,000.
* **Housing Stipend:** £4,000.
* **Total Compensation:** £47,000.
* **Standard Threshold:** £41,700.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Does the Total Compensation meet the threshold?** Yes.
* **Does the Base Salary meet the threshold?** **No.** £38,000 is below £41,700.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** The allowances are stripped out. The sponsor must restructure the pay to make the base salary £41,700+.

---

### Permutation 24: Ecctis Verification Fail (PhD Points)
**Criteria:** To claim "Tradeable Points" for a PhD (Options B or C), the PhD must be from a UK institution OR verified by **Ecctis** as equivalent to a UK PhD.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Dr. Banu**, a researcher from Turkey.
* **Job Offer:** Senior Chemist.
* **Salary:** £35,000 (Relying on STEM PhD discount).
* **Qualification:** PhD in Chemistry from a small, private, unaccredited university.
* **Ecctis Review:** Ecctis determines the qualification is "comparable to RQF Level 7 (Master's)" but not a doctoral standard.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Does she have a PhD?** She has a document that says "PhD."
* **Is it recognized by the Home Office?** **No.** Ecctis verification failed to confirm it as a UK PhD equivalent.
* **Can she use the salary discount?** No.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** Without the verified PhD points, she requires the full salary (£41,700+), which she does not have.

---

### Permutation 25: English Language (Majority English Country Exemption)
**Criteria:** Applicants do not need a SELT (Secure English Language Test) if they are a national of a majority English-speaking country (e.g., USA, Australia, Jamaica) or have a degree taught in English (verified by Ecctis).

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Michael**, a national of **Jamaica**.
* **Job Offer:** Youth Worker.
* **English Evidence:** He provides his Jamaican passport. He has *not* taken a language test.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is there a valid Sponsor?** Yes.
* **Did he take the English Test?** No.
* **Is he exempt?** **Yes.** Jamaica is on the Home Office list of majority English-speaking countries.

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** He meets the English requirement automatically via nationality.

---

### Permutation 26: "Immigration Salary List" (ISL) Age Limit Check
**Criteria:** Unlike the old "Shortage Occupation List," the new ISL (Immigration Salary List) does *not* automatically allow you to pay 80% of the going rate indefinitely. It sets a lower *general* threshold, but you must still meet the going rate unless you are *also* a New Entrant.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Klaus**, 45 years old.
* **Job Offer:** Welder (ISL Job).
* **Salary Offer:** £30,960.
* **Going Rate for Welder:** £38,700.
* **ISL Logic:** Sponsor believes ISL allows paying 80% of the going rate (£30,960).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the job on the ISL?** Yes.
* **Does the salary meet the ISL General Floor (£33,400)?** **No.** (The ISL floor is £33,400 unless a specific transitional arrangement applies, but even if the floor was lower, he fails the going rate check).
* **Does he qualify for the 80% Going Rate discount?** **No.** Being on the ISL alone does *not* grant the 80% discount on the *going rate* anymore (changes post-April 2024). He is not a New Entrant. He must be paid the full going rate (£38,700).

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** The sponsor is applying old "Shortage Occupation" logic. Under current ISL rules, Klaus must be paid the full going rate.

### Permutation 27: Equity/Shares as Salary Substitute
**Criteria:** Unearned income, dividends, and shares cannot be counted as salary.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Lucas**, a Software Engineer at a cash-poor startup.
* **Job Offer:** Senior Developer.
* **Cash Salary:** £30,000.
* **Stock Options:** Valued at £50,000/year (vesting).
* **Standard Threshold:** £41,700.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the value of the package high?** Yes.
* **Is the cash salary sufficient?** **No.** The Home Office does not recognize stock options (which may become worthless) as guaranteed salary.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** The guaranteed cash component (£30k) is below the absolute floor (£33,400) and the standard threshold (£41,700).

---

### Permutation 28: The "Zero-Hours" Contract Trap
**Criteria:** The salary used for the application must be **guaranteed**. The Home Office does not accept "expected" earnings from a zero-hours contract, even if the hourly rate is high, because the employer cannot guarantee the worker will earn the minimum threshold every year.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Katarina**, a Waitress.
* **Job Offer:** Waitress at a high-end event venue.
* **Contract:** Zero-hours contract.
* **Rate:** £20 per hour (High).
* **Employer's Letter:** "We expect Katarina to work 40 hours a week, totaling £41,600."

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the hourly rate sufficient?** Yes.
* **Is the annual salary guaranteed?** **No.** On a zero-hours contract, the guaranteed pay is effectively £0.
* **Does it meet the General Threshold?** No.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** To sponsor a Skilled Worker, the contract must guarantee a minimum number of hours that ensures the minimum salary threshold is met.

---

### Permutation 29: The "Salary Sacrifice" Threshold Drop
**Criteria:** Eligibility is based on the **gross salary AFTER any salary sacrifice schemes** (e.g., Cycle to Work, childcare vouchers) are deducted. If a voluntary deduction drops the taxable salary below the £41,700 (or £33,400) threshold, the visa is invalid.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Ben**, a Software Developer.
* **Base Salary:** £42,000 (Just above the £41,700 threshold).
* **Action:** Ben signs up for a "Cycle to Work" scheme and an additional pension contribution, sacrificing £2,000 of his salary in exchange for benefits.
* **Revised Taxable Salary:** £40,000.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Does the initial salary meet the threshold?** Yes.
* **Does the salary *after* sacrifice meet the threshold?** **No.** The Home Office looks at the salary *after* these voluntary deductions.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED (or Compliance Breach).** If this happens during the application, it will be refused. If it happens *after* the grant, the employer is technically breaching sponsorship duties by paying below the threshold.

---

### Permutation 30: The "Genuine Vacancy" Test (Nepotism)
**Criteria:** Even if the salary and skill level are correct, the Home Office can refuse an application if they believe the job is not a "genuine vacancy" (e.g., created solely to get a friend/relative a visa) or acts as a sham.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Omar**, the nephew of a restaurant owner in London.
* **Job Offer:** Restaurant Manager.
* **Salary:** £45,000.
* **Context:** The restaurant is small (10 seats) and already has a manager. The job description is vague ("general oversight").

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Does the salary meet the threshold?** Yes.
* **Is the job skilled?** Yes.
* **Is it a Genuine Vacancy?** **No.** The Caseworker will likely request an interview or additional evidence and find the role does not genuinely exist or require a full-time worker, and was created to facilitate Omar's entry.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** Failed on the "Genuine Vacancy" credibility test.

---

### Permutation 31: Switching from Visitor Visa (In-Country Fail)
**Criteria:** You generally **cannot** switch into the Skilled Worker route from inside the UK if you are currently on a **Standard Visitor** visa. You must leave the UK and apply for "Entry Clearance" from your home country.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Elena**, an American tourist currently in London visiting friends.
* **Event:** She attends a job interview and gets an amazing offer as a Graphic Designer.
* **Action:** She attempts to apply for the Skilled Worker visa from her Airbnb in London to avoid the flight home.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the job eligible?** Yes.
* **Is the applicant eligible to switch?** **No.** Immigration Rules prohibit switching from "Visitor" status.

**Expected Outcome:**
**INVALID / REFUSED.** Elena must return to the USA (or a country where she has residence) to file the application.

---

### Permutation 32: PhD Student "24-Month Rule" (Success)
**Criteria:** A student on a PhD course can switch to a Skilled Worker visa **before** graduating if they have completed at least **24 months** of their PhD.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Ali**, a PhD student in Engineering.
* **Status:** He is in Year 3 of a 4-year PhD program. He has not graduated yet.
* **Job Offer:** Engineering Consultant.
* **Action:** Applies to switch to Skilled Worker.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Has he completed the course?** No.
* **Has he completed 24 months of a PhD?** **Yes.**
* **Is the job eligible?** Yes.

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** Unlike Bachelor's/Master's students who must usually complete the course (or apply after the course end date), PhD students have this specific concession.

---

### Permutation 33: Previous "Global Business Mobility" Time Cap
**Criteria:** The **"New Entrant"** (4-year max) limit includes time spent on any "Tier 2" or "Skilled Worker" visa, **AND** time spent on "Global Business Mobility" (formerly Intra-Company Transfer) visas.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Wei**, 25 years old.
* **History:** Worked in the UK for 3 years on a "Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee" visa.
* **Job Offer:** Senior Analyst.
* **Salary:** £34,000 (Relying on New Entrant 70% discount).
* **Strategy:** Wei thinks he is a "New Entrant" because he is under 26.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is he under 26?** Yes.
* **Does he have "New Entrant" time remaining?** **No.** He has already used 3 years on a relevant work visa. He can only be granted 1 more year as a New Entrant. If the sponsor requests 3 years, it fails.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** He cannot be granted a standard 3 or 5-year visa with the salary discount because he has exhausted his "New Entrant" allowance.

---

### Permutation 34: Owner-Manager "Dividend" Fail
**Criteria:** Applicants who are majority shareholders/directors of the sponsoring company *can* be sponsored, but their salary must be **PAYE (Pay As You Earn) salary**. Dividends do not count toward the £41,700 threshold.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Sarah**, owns 100% of "Sarah Consulting Ltd" (UK registered).
* **Role:** Director.
* **Pay Structure:** £12,570 Salary (Personal Allowance) + £40,000 Dividends.
* **Total Income:** £52,570.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the company a valid sponsor?** Yes (assuming they got a license).
* **Does the total income meet requirements?** Yes.
* **Does the *Qualifying* Salary meet requirements?** **No.** Only the £12,570 PAYE salary counts.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** Sarah must pay herself a full PAYE salary of £41,700+ (paying full income tax and National Insurance) to qualify. She cannot use the tax-efficient dividend route for visa purposes.

---

### Permutation 35: Professional Doctorate vs. PhD (Points Fail)
**Criteria:** To claim the "PhD Points" (Options B/C), the qualification must be a **research** PhD. Professional doctorates (like a generic DBA, MD, or JD) often do not qualify if they don't involve the requisite research rigor confirmed by Ecctis.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Dr. Jones**, holds a "Doctor of Business Administration" (DBA) from a US college (taught course, no dissertation).
* **Job Offer:** Management Consultant.
* **Salary:** £38,000 (Needs PhD points to pass).
* **Ecctis Check:** Ecctis evaluates the degree as RQF Level 8 but notes it is a "Professional Doctorate" not a "Research PhD."

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Does he hold a doctorate?** Yes.
* **Is it eligible for Tradeable Points?** **Likely No.** The rules generally require a PhD to be research-based. If Ecctis does not certify it as meeting the specific research criteria for the visa points, he cannot trade salary.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** He fails to secure the tradeable points and therefore misses the salary threshold.

---

### Permutation 36: Internal Promotion (Change of Occupation Code)
**Criteria:** If a currently sponsored Skilled Worker changes jobs within the *same* company, but the new job falls under a **different Occupation Code**, they must apply for a new visa (Change of Employment). They cannot simply start the new job.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Raj**, currently sponsored as a "Web Developer" (Code 2137).
* **Event:** He is promoted to "IT Project Manager" (Code 2135).
* **Salary:** £50,000 (Meets requirements).
* **Action:** He starts the new role immediately; HR updates the SMS (Sponsorship Management System) but does *not* require him to apply for a new visa.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the new job eligible?** Yes.
* **Is the visa valid?** **No.** The previous visa was tied to Code 2137. Moving to Code 2135 requires a fresh application.

**Expected Outcome:**
**COMPLIANCE BREACH / CURTAILMENT.** Raj is technically working illegally in the new role. If discovered, the sponsor loses their license and Raj's visa is curtailed. He *should* have applied for a "Change of Employment" visa before starting the new role.

---

### Permutation 37: "Supplementary Work" Limit Breach
**Criteria:** A Skilled Worker can take a second job (Supplementary Work) without a new visa only if it is:
1.  In the same occupation code, OR
2.  On the Immigration Salary List, AND
3.  **No more than 20 hours per week.**

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Maria**, a Nurse (Skilled Worker).
* **Second Job:** She takes extra shifts at a different hospital (Agency Nurse).
* **Hours:** She works 25 hours of overtime at the second hospital one busy week.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the job eligible (Same code)?** Yes.
* **Are the hours permissible?** **No.** The limit is strict at 20 hours/week outside contracted hours.

**Expected Outcome:**
**VISA VIOLATION.** By working 25 hours in a second job, Maria has breached her visa conditions. This can lead to future refusals or curtailment if detected.

---

### Permutation 38: The "Defined vs. Undefined" CoS Error
**Criteria:** For applicants **outside the UK**, the sponsor *must* apply for and assign a **"Defined" Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)**. An "Undefined" CoS (from the sponsor's annual allocation) is only for in-country applicants.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Pavel**, a mechanic from Poland.
* **Location:** Pavel is currently in Warsaw.
* **Sponsor Action:** The UK garage has spare "Undefined" CoS allocations. To save time, they assign one to Pavel so he can apply immediately.
* **Visa Application:** Pavel submits his application using this CoS reference number.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the job/salary eligible?** Yes.
* **Is the CoS valid for the route?** **No.** An Undefined CoS cannot be used for an entry clearance (out-of-country) application.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED (or Rejected as Invalid).** The Home Office will reject the application because the wrong type of CoS was used. The sponsor must apply for a "Defined CoS" specifically for Pavel.

---

### Permutation 39: The "28-Day" Start Date Rule
**Criteria:** A Skilled Worker must normally start their job within **28 days** of whichever is later: the start date on their CoS, or the date their visa is granted (or date they enter the UK). Delays beyond this usually require the sponsorship to be cancelled unless there is a valid reason.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Layla**, an Architect.
* **Visa Granted:** January 1st.
* **CoS Start Date:** January 1st.
* **Actual Arrival:** Layla delays her flight to settle affairs and arrives on February 15th (45 days later) to start work.
* **Sponsor Action:** The sponsor does not report this, assuming it's fine.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the visa valid?** Initially, yes.
* **Is the employment compliant?** **No.** The start date was delayed by more than 28 days without a reported valid reason.

**Expected Outcome:**
**COMPLIANCE BREACH / CURTAILMENT RISK.** The sponsor was required to stop sponsoring Layla after 28 days of non-attendance. Layla is liable to have her visa cancelled at the border or curtailed later.

---

### Permutation 40: Term-Time Only Salary (Education Sector)
**Criteria:** For term-time workers (e.g., school staff), the salary threshold (£41,700 or relevant lower rate) is based on what they **actually earn**, not the full-time equivalent (FTE). However, the "Going Rate" for the specific occupation code *can* be pro-rated.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Ms. Dubois**, a French teacher at a UK private school.
* **FTE Salary:** £45,000 (If she worked 52 weeks).
* **Actual Schedule:** She works only during term time (39 weeks).
* **Actual Gross Salary:** £33,750.
* **Threshold Required:** £41,700 (Option A - Standard).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Does the FTE salary meet the threshold?** Yes.
* **Does the *Actual* salary meet the threshold?** **No.** Her actual pay is £33,750, which is below the general threshold of £41,700.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** She does not meet the general threshold. (Note: If she were eligible for a PhD discount or New Entrant option, she might pass the lower £33,400 floor, but on the standard route, she fails).

---

### Permutation 41: Immigration Skills Charge (ISC) Failure
**Criteria:** The sponsor must pay the Immigration Skills Charge (approx. £364 or £1,000 per year) when assigning the CoS. Failure to pay the correct amount results in invalidity.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Ken**, a marketing lead.
* **Sponsor:** A large multinational bank.
* **Error:** The bank's HR admin accidentally categorizes the bank as a "Small" company in the sponsorship system to save money (paying £364/year instead of £1,000).
* **Application:** Ken applies.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the job eligible?** Yes.
* **Is the Sponsorship Valid?** **No.** The sponsor underpaid the mandatory government charge.

**Expected Outcome:**
**INVALID / REFUSED.** The Home Office usually contacts the sponsor to request a "top-up" payment. If the sponsor does not pay within 10 working days, the visa is refused.

---

### Permutation 42: B-Rated Sponsor (New Hires)
**Criteria:** If a sponsor is downgraded to a **B-rating** (due to compliance breaches), they **cannot** sponsor *new* workers. They can only issue certificates to workers already sponsored by them (extensions).

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Fatima**, a new recruit from overseas.
* **Sponsor:** "Logistics Co." (Currently B-rated due to a previous audit failure).
* **Action:** Logistics Co. tries to assign a CoS to Fatima.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the job eligible?** Yes.
* **Is the Sponsor permitted to hire?** **No.** A B-rated sponsor is frozen from new overseas hires.

**Expected Outcome:**
**UNABLE TO ASSIGN COS.** The Sponsorship Management System (SMS) should technically block the request. If they somehow bypass it, the visa will be **REFUSED**.

---

### Permutation 43: Unpaid Leave Limit (4 Weeks)
**Criteria:** Sponsorship stops if a worker is absent from work without pay for more than **4 weeks** in any calendar year (with exceptions for statutory maternity, sick leave, etc.).

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Diego**, a Software Dev.
* **Situation:** Diego asks for a 2-month unpaid sabbatical to travel South America.
* **Sponsor Action:** The company agrees to hold his job.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the leave "Statutory" (sick/maternity)?** No.
* **Is it longer than 4 weeks?** Yes.

**Expected Outcome:**
**SPONSORSHIP WITHDRAWAL.** The employer is legally required to stop sponsoring Diego once his unpaid absence exceeds 4 weeks. His visa will be curtailed (shortened to 60 days), and he must leave the UK or find a new job.

---

### Permutation 44: Minimum Age (16/17 Year Olds)
**Criteria:** There is no legal minimum age for the visa *per se*, but the applicant must be old enough to legally work (16+). For 16-17 year olds, specific **parental consent** and care arrangements are required.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Lukas**, a 17-year-old coding prodigy from Estonia.
* **Job Offer:** Junior Developer.
* **Salary:** £34,000 (New Entrant).
* **Missing Evidence:** He applies without a letter of consent from his parents regarding his travel and care arrangements in the UK.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is he eligible for the job?** Yes.
* **Are "Child" safeguards met?** **No.** The Home Office requires explicit parental consent for applicants under 18.

**Expected Outcome:**
**INVALID / REFUSED.** The application fails on safeguarding grounds.

---

### Permutation 45: Ecctis "Proficiency" Fail (German Degree)
**Criteria:** Having a degree taught in English is not enough proof on its own. It must be from a UK university OR verified by **Ecctis** with *two* statements: one for qualification comparability and one for **English Language Proficiency**.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Hans**, a German engineer.
* **Qualification:** Master’s degree from a German university, taught 100% in English.
* **Evidence:** He uploads his degree certificate and a letter from the German university confirming it was taught in English. He does *not* pay Ecctis for verification.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the degree eligible?** Potentially.
* **Is the proof accepted?** **No.** The Home Office does not trust university letters directly. They require the Ecctis "English Language Proficiency" statement.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** Hans failed to meet the English Language requirement in the prescribed manner.

---

### Permutation 46: Expired SELT Test (Previous Use Exception)
**Criteria:** A Secure English Language Test (SELT) is valid for 2 years. However, if you used a SELT for a *previous* successful UK visa application, you can re-use it even if it has since expired.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Yara**, previously in the UK on a Student Visa (where she passed a B1 SELT 4 years ago).
* **Current Status:** Applying for Skilled Worker from abroad.
* **Evidence:** She submits the SELT reference number from 4 years ago.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the test expired?** Yes.
* **Was it used in a previous successful application?** Yes.
* **Is the level sufficient (B1)?** Yes.

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** The "previous use" rule allows her to bypass the expiry date.

---

### Permutation 47: Concurrent Employment (Double Visa)
**Criteria:** A Skilled Worker can hold **two** separate jobs if both are sponsored. This requires **two Certificates of Sponsorship** and a second visa application for "Concurrent Employment."

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Dr. Aris**, a university lecturer (20 hours/week).
* **Second Job:** Researcher at a private think-tank (20 hours/week).
* **Total Hours:** 40.
* **Action:** He already has a visa for the University. He applies for a *second* visa for the think-tank (Concurrent Employment) rather than replacing the first one.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Are both jobs eligible?** Yes.
* **Are both salaries pro-rated correctly?** Yes (assuming they meet hourly thresholds).
* **Is this allowed?** Yes.

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** Aris will hold two visas simultaneously. He must ensure the second application is marked as "Concurrent" so it doesn't automatically cancel the first visa.

---

### Permutation 48: Tailored Job Description (Genuine Vacancy Refusal)
**Criteria:** The job description must accurately reflect the role's needs, not the applicant's CV. If the requirements are suspiciously specific (e.g., "Must speak fluent Mongolian and have experience in [Applicant's specific obscure thesis topic]"), it fails the **Genuine Vacancy** test.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Batbayar**, a Mongolian history graduate.
* **Job Offer:** Office Manager at a UK logistics firm.
* **Job Spec:** "Office Manager needed. Mandatory requirement: Fluent Mongolian speaker and expert in 13th-century steppe warfare."
* **Business Need:** The firm has no clients in Mongolia.

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the salary/skill eligible?** Yes.
* **Is the vacancy genuine?** **No.** The requirements are artificially "tailored" to ensure only Batbayar qualifies.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED.** The Home Office will rule this is not a genuine role but a vehicle for migration.

---

### Permutation 49: Salary Reduction (Compliance Check)
**Criteria:** If a worker's salary is reduced *after* the visa is granted (e.g., due to company-wide cuts), it must remain above the threshold eligible for their specific visa option (e.g., £41,700). If it drops below, sponsorship cannot continue.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Tom**, a Banker sponsored at £50,000.
* **Event:** Economic downturn. The bank cuts all salaries by 20%.
* **New Salary:** £40,000.
* **Threshold:** £41,700 (Option A).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is the worker still employed?** Yes.
* **Does the new salary meet the criteria?** **No.** It has fallen below the £41,700 minimum.

**Expected Outcome:**
**SPONSORSHIP TERMINATION.** The employer must either maintain Tom's salary at £41,700 (exempting him from the cut) or end his sponsorship. They cannot legally pay him £40,000.

---

### Permutation 50: The "Contractor" IR35 Mistake
**Criteria:** Skilled Workers must be **Employees** (PAYE). They cannot be self-employed contractors or work under "IR35" arrangements where they invoice the sponsor.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Sarah**, an IT Consultant.
* **Arrangement:** The sponsor (an IT firm) wants to hire her. To save on National Insurance, they ask her to invoice them as a contractor, but they will issue a CoS.
* **Contract:** "Consultancy Agreement" (Service for services).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Is there a CoS?** Yes.
* **Is there a genuine employment relationship?** **No.** The visa requires an employment contract, not a contract for services.

**Expected Outcome:**
**REFUSED (or Compliance Breach).** A sponsor cannot sponsor a self-employed contractor. Sarah must be on the payroll.

---

### Permutation 51: The "26th Birthday" Timing Success
**Criteria:** To be a "New Entrant" (Option E), the applicant must be **under 26 on the date of application**. It does not matter if they turn 26 while the Home Office is processing the decision.

**Hypothetical Scenario:**
* **Persona:** **Javier**, born 1st June 1999.
* **Application Date:** 30th May 2025 (2 days before 26th birthday).
* **Decision Date:** 15th July 2025 (He is now 26).
* **Salary:** £35,000 (Relying on New Entrant discount).

**Response to Criteria Questions:**
* **Age at Decision:** 26.
* **Age at Application:** 25.
* **Is he a New Entrant?** **Yes.** The "date of application" freezes the age requirement.

**Expected Outcome:**
**AWARDED.** Javier qualifies for the 70% salary discount for up to 4 years (max), even though he is now 26.
