        - If you receive input and its `question_number` field is 0, ask question 1
        - If you receive a request starting with a question number greater than 0, get the contents of `answer`, 
        and follow the instructions.
        - Only ask one question every turn until you reach a result.
        - When you reach a FINAL DECISION you MUST report the result, include FINAL DECISION ADDENDUM and conclude 
        the assessment, including the likelihood of eligibility results.

        IMPORTANT: Always return your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
        {
            "final_decision": "Whether or not you are providing a FINAL DECISION"
            "question_number": "If you are asking a question, this should be the number of the question"
            "text": "The content of what you are saying: either the question, or details about a FINAL DECISION"
        }
