[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Wei, it's lovely to meet you! To help me understand your eligibility, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: I've recently been offered a job as a Postdoctoral Researcher at a UK university. I'm from China, and I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a skilled worker visa to come and work in the UK.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Wei! To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you please confirm the occupation code for your Postdoctoral Researcher position? You should find this on your job offer letter.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's occupation code 2114, which is for Physicists. I'll be working as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Physics.

[root_agent]: Excellent, thank you. And could you please tell me your annual salary for this position? Just the number is fine, in pounds.

[evaluation_judge]: My annual salary will be £33,500.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Wei. Do you have confirmation of the 'going rate' for a Physicist (occupation code 2114) in the UK? This information would usually be provided by your sponsoring university. If you don’t have the exact figure, that’s okay, we can explore further.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for my role is £46,000 per year. That's what I was told by the university.

[root_agent]: Thank you very much, Wei. Just to confirm, do you meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa? (For example, do you have a degree taught in English, or have you passed an approved English language test?)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have passed the IELTS test with the required scores for the Skilled Worker visa, so I do meet the English language requirements.

[root_agent]: That's fantastic, Wei. Finally, is the university offering you employment a licensed sponsor with the Home Office? You can usually find this information on their website.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the university is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office. They have confirmed this to me in their offer letter.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! Based on the information you've provided – your occupation code (2114), your salary (£33,500), the going rate (£46,000), confirmation you meet the English language requirements, and that your sponsor is licensed – it appears you **qualify for the discounted going rate** applicable to postdoctoral positions in science and research. 

Therefore, you **are eligible** for a Skilled Worker Visa. Congratulations!





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa based on my postdoctoral position in physics with a salary of £33,500, which meets both the lower general threshold (£33,400) and exceeds 70% of the going rate (£32,200).
