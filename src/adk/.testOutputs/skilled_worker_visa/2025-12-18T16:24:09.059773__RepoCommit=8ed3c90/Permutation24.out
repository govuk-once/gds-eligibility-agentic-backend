[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Banu and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Banu, it's lovely to meet you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you tell me what benefit you are hoping to qualify for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm hoping to qualify for a visa to work in the UK. I've been offered a job as a Senior Chemist with a salary of £35,000. I have a PhD in Chemistry from Turkey and I'm wondering if I'm eligible for the Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Banu. The Skilled Worker visa sounds like the right route to explore. 

To assess your eligibility, could you please tell me - does your PhD come from a university located *within* the United Kingdom?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my PhD in Chemistry is from a university in Turkey. It's from a small private university there.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Since your PhD is from a university outside of the UK, was your qualification assessed by Ecctis to confirm if it's equivalent to a UK PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I had it assessed by Ecctis. They sent me a report saying my qualification is "comparable to RQF Level 7 (Master's)" but they didn't confirm it as being at a doctoral standard.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. So, Ecctis did not verify your PhD as equivalent to a UK PhD. 

To confirm, the job you have been offered is for a Senior Chemist, and the salary is £35,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I've been offered a position as a Senior Chemist with a £35,000 salary.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided, and the requirements for the Skilled Worker visa, it appears you would unfortunately be **refused** at this time.

Without a PhD verified by Ecctis as equivalent to a UK PhD, you wouldn’t be eligible for the salary discount that would allow a salary of £35,000. The standard salary threshold for a Senior Chemist role is above £35,000.



I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or discuss alternative options?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd really appreciate if you could explain this in more detail. I was really counting on using my PhD to qualify. What exactly is the standard salary threshold I would need to meet without the PhD discount?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker visa allows for a lower salary threshold if you have a PhD that meets specific criteria - either from a UK university, or verified by Ecctis as equivalent to a UK PhD. This is because a PhD is considered a valuable skill. This is sometimes referred to as 'tradeable points'.

Because Ecctis determined your PhD is comparable to a Master's level qualification rather than a doctoral-level qualification, you don't qualify for those tradeable points, and therefore don’t meet the criteria for the reduced salary.

The current general salary threshold for a Skilled Worker visa is £38,700 per year. However, for jobs considered to be in a 'shortage occupation' (which I don't believe Senior Chemist currently is), or for new entrants to the profession, the threshold can be lower. 

For a Senior Chemist role *without* a qualifying PhD, you would generally need to earn at least £41,700 per year to meet the Skilled Worker visa requirements. This figure is based on the going rate for the occupation, as listed by the Home Office.

Does that explanation make sense? I can provide information on how the going rate is calculated if you'd like.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that explanation makes sense, thank you. So without the PhD qualification, I would need a salary offer of at least £41,700, but I only have an offer for £35,000. I understand now why I wouldn't qualify. Is there any way I could appeal the Ecctis assessment or are there any other visa options I might be eligible for?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome. You've understood the situation perfectly. Unfortunately, the Ecctis assessment is very difficult to appeal. They are considered the official body for qualification assessment, and the Home Office gives their decisions a great deal of weight. You *can* request a review from Ecctis, but you would need to provide significant new evidence demonstrating that your qualification *is* equivalent to a UK PhD, and reviews are not always successful. Information on how to request a review can be found on their website (though I am unable to provide a direct link).

Regarding other visa options, the Skilled Worker visa is generally the most straightforward route for someone with a job offer. However, depending on your circumstances, you *might* want to explore the following (though I can't assess your eligibility for these without further questions):

*   **Global Talent Visa:** This visa is for leaders or potential leaders in academia, research, arts, and culture, and digital technology. It requires endorsement from a recognised endorsing body.
*   **High Potential Individual Visa:** This visa could be an option if you graduated from a top university within the last five years (as defined by the UKVI).
*   **Dependant Visa:** If you have a family member who already holds a UK visa, you might be eligible to apply as a dependant.

Would you like me to ask you some questions to explore whether you might be eligible for any of these other visa routes? Or, would you prefer to research them independently?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd be interested to learn more about the Global Talent visa option, particularly for academics. Could you ask me questions about that to see if I might be eligible? I've been working as a researcher for about 5 years since completing my PhD, with some publications in chemistry journals.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Global Talent visa is a good avenue to explore given your research background. To assess your potential eligibility under the academic route, let's start with a few questions.

First, have you received any significant awards or recognition for your research work? This could include prizes, fellowships, or grants.

[evaluation_judge]: I haven't received any major international prizes or fellowships. I did get a small research grant from a Turkish scientific foundation about two years ago to conduct some work on sustainable chemical processes, but it wasn't particularly large or prestigious.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. While large, prestigious awards are helpful, they aren’t the only factor.

Next, could you tell me roughly how many peer-reviewed articles you have published in recognized chemistry journals? An approximate number is fine for now.

[evaluation_judge]: I have published about 8 peer-reviewed articles in chemistry journals. Three of them were in mid-tier international journals, and the rest were in Turkish journals. I'm the first author on five of them, and I was cited around 30 times total across all my publications.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know, Banu. Eight peer-reviewed articles with 30 citations is a solid start. 

To continue assessing your eligibility for the Global Talent Visa, are you currently affiliated with a UK higher education institution or research institute – either with a confirmed offer of employment or a formal invitation to collaborate on research? This is important, as endorsement often requires a connection to the UK academic community.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any current affiliations with UK institutions. The job offer I have is with a private chemical company, not a university or research institute. I haven't collaborated with any UK researchers or institutions so far in my career.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Unfortunately, without a current or pending affiliation with a UK research institution or a highly prestigious portfolio of achievements (like significant awards or a very high number of citations), securing endorsement under the Global Talent visa – particularly the academic route – would likely be very challenging.

The endorsing bodies for the academic route generally look for individuals who are already recognized leaders or potential leaders in their field *within* the UK academic community. Your research experience is valuable, but doesn’t currently meet the high bar for endorsement without a UK connection.

Given this, it appears the Skilled Worker visa, with a salary meeting the £41,700+ threshold, remains the most viable option. 

Would you like me to provide information about finding higher-paying jobs in the UK, or perhaps explore the other visa options we briefly discussed earlier?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, thank you for that explanation. It seems like my current situation doesn't qualify me for either the Skilled Worker visa or the Global Talent visa. Could you briefly tell me about the High Potential Individual visa you mentioned? You said something about graduating from a top university - would my master's degree that I got before my PhD be considered for this, or does it only look at my most recent qualification?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome. It’s good to have a clear understanding of your options.

The High Potential Individual (HPI) visa is designed for recent graduates from a list of highly-ranked global universities. It allows you to come to the UK to work, look for work, or found a business without a specific job offer.

Regarding your question, the HPI visa **only considers your most recent qualification** - which in your case is your PhD. However, the university *must* be on the UKVI’s approved list of global universities. This list is based on rankings in the QS World University Rankings, Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and Academic Ranking of World Universities.

To be eligible, you must have graduated within the last five years from a university that consistently appears in the top 50 of at least two of those rankings, or within the top 100 of all three.

Do you happen to know if the university in Turkey where you obtained your PhD appears on those lists? I can also help you check if you provide the university's name.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. My PhD is from a small private university in Turkey called "Anatolian Science University" (I just made that up for this scenario). It's definitely not on any of those rankings lists. I completed my Master's at Istanbul Technical University, which is much better known, but it sounds like that wouldn't be considered for this visa since my PhD is my most recent qualification.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct. Even though Istanbul Technical University is a well-regarded institution, the HPI visa focuses solely on your most recent qualification – your PhD from Anatolian Science University. And, as you suspected, a university not featured on the UKVI’s approved list unfortunately makes you ineligible for this visa route.

It appears, based on the information you've shared, that the Skilled Worker visa with a qualifying salary remains the most realistic path forward.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, or would you like me to provide resources for job searching in the UK, focusing on roles that meet the salary requirement for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for all your help and explanations. I think I understand my situation now - I would need to find a job offer with a salary of at least £41,700 to qualify for the Skilled Worker visa. I'll focus on looking for better-paying opportunities. I appreciate the time you've taken to explain all the different options to me.

✗ The agent was correct that I would be refused for the Skilled Worker visa without meeting the salary threshold, but failed to clearly explain the specific reason why. They should have explicitly stated that since my PhD was assessed as equivalent to a Master's and not a doctoral qualification by Ecctis, I couldn't claim tradeable points for the PhD, which is why the full salary threshold applies.
