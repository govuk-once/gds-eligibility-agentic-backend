[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Kenji, a graphic designer from Japan looking for information about UK visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Kenji and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Kenji, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. 

To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hello, thank you for speaking with me. I've just received a job offer as a graphic designer in the UK, and I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. The company is offering me £30,000 per year. I currently live in Japan and would need to relocate. Could you help me understand if I would qualify?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Kenji, I can help you with that! A Skilled Worker visa sounds like a good fit given your job offer. 

To assess your eligibility, let's start with your salary. Do you know what the 'going rate' for a Graphic Designer is in the UK, as determined by the government? This is an important factor for the visa.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the company told me the going rate for graphic designers in the UK is around £29,000. My offer is slightly above that at £30,000. Is that sufficient for the Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Kenji. While your offer is above the going rate, there are minimum salary thresholds for the Skilled Worker visa. 

To clarify, do you have a PhD degree that is relevant to your field, or are you considered a 'new entrant' to the job market? (A new entrant generally means you have less than 3 years of relevant work experience).

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a PhD. I've been working as a graphic designer for about 6 years in Japan, so I wouldn't be considered a new entrant either. I just have a bachelor's degree in graphic design.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Kenji.

Given that you do not have a PhD and are not a new entrant, the Skilled Worker visa has specific salary requirements. Do you understand that there is a general salary threshold, and a slightly lower threshold for those with a PhD or who are new entrants?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand there are different salary thresholds depending on qualifications and experience. What are these thresholds exactly? And would my £30,000 salary offer be enough to qualify for the Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: Okay, Kenji, let me explain the current salary thresholds. As of April 4th, 2024, the general threshold for the Skilled Worker visa is £38,700 per year. However, there's a lower threshold of £33,400 for some eligible occupations. 

Unfortunately, even though your offered salary of £30,000 is above the 'going rate' of £29,000, it is below *both* of these thresholds.

Therefore, based on the information you've provided, your application for a Skilled Worker visa would be **REFUSED** due to the salary not meeting the minimum requirement.



Would you like me to explain anything further, or perhaps discuss other potential visa options, although I suspect the Skilled Worker visa is the most appropriate for your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so my offer is not high enough for any variation of the Skilled Worker visa. That's disappointing to hear. Is there any way I could still qualify with this salary? Or would the company need to increase their offer to at least £33,400 for me to have a chance?

[root_agent]: You are correct, Kenji, with the current salary of £30,000, it wouldn't be possible to qualify for the Skilled Worker visa, even with variations for experience or qualifications.

And yes, you are also correct in your assessment. The company would need to increase your salary offer to at least £33,400 per year for you to meet the minimum requirements and have a chance at qualifying for the Skilled Worker Visa. 

Alternatively, you could investigate if your specific graphic design role falls under any eligible occupation codes that *might* have a different, lower going rate—but this is unlikely. The £33,400 floor is quite firm.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming. It seems clear that with my current offer, I won't qualify for the Skilled Worker visa. I'll need to discuss this with the company to see if they can increase the offer to at least £33,400. I appreciate your help in explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Kenji! I'm glad I could provide some clarity for you. It's a good idea to discuss this with the company – hopefully they will be able to adjust the offer. 

If you have any further questions down the line, or if the situation changes, please don't hesitate to reach out. I wish you the best of luck!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be refused for the Skilled Worker visa since my £30,000 salary is below the absolute minimum salary floor of £33,400, matching the expected outcome.
