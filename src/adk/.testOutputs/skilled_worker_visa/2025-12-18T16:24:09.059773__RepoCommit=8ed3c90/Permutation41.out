[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Ken, a marketing lead who is applying for a visa and needs to understand his eligibility. I'll engage with the agent and then evaluate their response against the expected outcome.

Hi, i'm Ken and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Ken, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility. To start, could you tell me what benefit you are enquiring about?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a work visa. I've been offered a marketing lead position at a multinational bank in the UK. They've already started the sponsorship process, but I'm not sure if everything is in order. Can you help me understand if I'll be eligible?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ken. I can definitely help with that. To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, let's start with some basic questions. 

First, can you confirm if your sponsoring bank has assigned you a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they've told me they've assigned me a Certificate of Sponsorship. The HR department mentioned they've completed that part of the process already. They're a large multinational bank if that helps.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Ken. A large multinational bank sponsoring you is helpful information. 

Now, did the bank mention anything about the Immigration Skills Charge (ISC) when they discussed the Certificate of Sponsorship with you? Perhaps whether it had been paid, or the amount paid?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I did overhear something that concerned me. Someone in HR mentioned they classified the bank as a "small company" when processing the documents to save on costs. I think they said they paid £364 per year instead of a larger amount. Does that matter for my application?

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Ken. Yes, that *does* potentially matter for your application. 

A large multinational bank is generally expected to pay the standard Immigration Skills Charge of £1,000 per year. Paying the lower rate of £364, intended for smaller companies, could cause issues with the validity of your sponsorship.

To clarify, can you confirm that the bank classified itself as a "small" company when assigning your Certificate of Sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's what I understood from the conversation I overheard. They specifically mentioned classifying the bank as a "small" company in the sponsorship system to save money, paying the £364 rate per year instead of the £1,000 rate. I was worried this might cause problems with my visa application. Will this affect my eligibility?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Ken. Unfortunately, this does appear to affect your eligibility.

Because the bank incorrectly classified itself as a "small" company and paid the lower Immigration Skills Charge, your sponsorship is likely invalid. The Home Office typically requires the correct ISC to be paid. They will likely contact the bank to request a "top-up" payment. If the bank doesn't pay within 10 working days, your visa application would likely be **refused**. 

I understand this is concerning. Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, can you explain a bit more about what this means? Is my application definitely going to be refused? Is there anything I can do about this situation?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ken. Let me explain further. The Immigration Skills Charge is a fee the government requires sponsors to pay annually for each Skilled Worker they employ. The amount depends on the size of the sponsoring company – larger companies pay a higher rate.

Because your sponsoring bank appears to have intentionally underpaid this charge by classifying themselves incorrectly, it creates a significant problem with the validity of your sponsorship. The Home Office scrutinizes these payments carefully.

While I can't guarantee a refusal, it is **very likely** your application will be refused if the correct amount isn’t paid. The Home Office will likely contact the bank to request the outstanding amount (£636 per year, assuming this is the first year of sponsorship).

**What can you do?** 

The most important thing is to bring this to the attention of your HR department *immediately*. They need to rectify the situation with the Home Office. Ideally, they should proactively contact the Home Office to explain the error and arrange to pay the difference. 

You could also politely flag this to your HR contact, expressing your concern about the potential impact on your visa application. It's their responsibility to resolve this issue.

Do you understand this explanation, Ken? Would you like me to clarify anything?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very clear, thank you. So basically, the bank needs to pay the correct fee or my visa will likely be refused. I'll definitely contact HR right away to let them know about this issue and ask them to fix it with the Home Office. Just to confirm - if they pay the correct amount within the timeframe when requested, would my application then be valid? Or is the damage already done?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ken – I'm glad I could clarify things.

You are exactly right: the bank needs to pay the correct fee to avoid a refusal.

And to answer your question, if they pay the correct amount *within the 10 working day timeframe the Home Office provides*, your application can likely be made valid again. The Home Office generally allows for corrections of this nature. It’s not ideal, and it does cause a delay, but it doesn’t necessarily mean the "damage is already done" if they act swiftly.

However, a delay in rectifying the situation could lead to a refusal. The key is prompt action from the bank's HR department.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, Ken? Perhaps you'd like me to summarise the situation for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, a summary would be helpful so I can properly explain this to HR when I contact them.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ken. Here’s a summary you can use when speaking with HR:

“I’m contacting you regarding a potential issue with my Skilled Worker Visa sponsorship. I overheard a conversation suggesting the company was classified as a ‘small’ company in the sponsorship system to reduce the Immigration Skills Charge (ISC) to £364 per year.

As a large multinational bank, the correct ISC is £1,000 per year. Paying the incorrect amount makes my sponsorship invalid and could result in my visa application being refused by the Home Office.

I understand this may have been an oversight, but it’s crucial this is rectified immediately. The Home Office will likely contact the company requesting the difference. If the outstanding amount is paid within 10 working days of their request, my application should be able to proceed.

Could you please investigate this issue and take the necessary steps to ensure the correct Immigration Skills Charge is paid to the Home Office as soon as possible?”

Does that summary accurately reflect the situation and feel helpful for your conversation with HR, Ken?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's perfect. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly. I'll use this summary to explain the situation to HR right away. It sounds like my application will be refused unless the bank pays the correct fee within the timeframe provided by the Home Office.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ken! I'm truly glad I could help. You’ve understood the situation perfectly. 

I sincerely hope HR resolves this quickly for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if any further questions arise. I wish you the best of luck with your application and your new role at the bank. Is there anything else at all I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that the visa application would be invalid/refused due to the sponsor incorrectly classifying themselves as a small company and underpaying the Immigration Skills Charge. They accurately explained that the Home Office would request a top-up payment and if not paid within 10 working days, the visa would be refused.
