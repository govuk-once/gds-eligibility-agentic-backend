[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ali and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ali, nice to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me, are you currently completing a PhD?


[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently in my third year of a 4-year PhD program in Engineering. I haven't graduated yet, but I've been studying for over two years now.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. And just to confirm, have you already secured a job offer with a role that is considered a skilled occupation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have received a job offer as an Engineering Consultant. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa from my current student visa before I complete my PhD.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear! As you're in your third year of a four-year PhD, have you completed at least 24 months of your PhD studies so far?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have definitely completed more than 24 months of my PhD studies. I'm well into my third year now.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Based on the information you've provided – you are currently completing a PhD, you have a job offer for a skilled occupation as an Engineering Consultant, and you have completed over 24 months of your PhD – you appear to be eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa *before* completing your PhD. 

**AWARDED.**



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for confirming my eligibility to switch to a Skilled Worker visa before completing my PhD. This is really helpful for my planning.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ali! I'm glad I could help. Best of luck with your application and your new role as an Engineering Consultant. If you have any further questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa before completing my PhD because I have completed more than 24 months of my PhD program, matching the expected outcome.
