[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Michael, a Jamaican national seeking information about visa eligibility, particularly regarding English language requirements.

Hi, i'm Michael and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Michael, it's lovely to meet you! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you tell me what benefit you are enquiring about?





[evaluation_judge]: I've received a job offer as a Youth Worker here in the UK, and I want to know if I qualify for the Skilled Worker visa. I'm specifically concerned about the English language requirement, since I haven't taken any formal English tests. I'm from Jamaica, if that matters.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear about the job offer, Michael! The Skilled Worker visa is definitely something we can explore.

You're right to ask about the English language requirement. Being from Jamaica *does* matter in this case. 

Just to confirm, you have a Jamaican passport, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a Jamaican passport. I was born and raised in Jamaica and it's my nationality.

[root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming, Michael. 

Based on your nationality, you may be exempt from needing to provide evidence of English language proficiency through a Secure English Language Test. 

Just to be absolutely certain, and to help me confirm this for you – do you have a degree that was taught in English? (Don’t worry if you don’t, this is just to cover all bases!)

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a degree. I've got work experience in youth support but no university education. Will that be a problem for my application? I've only got my Jamaican passport as proof of my English ability.

[root_agent]: That’s perfectly alright, Michael, thank you for letting me know. Not having a degree doesn’t change things in your case!

Because you are a national of Jamaica, which is a majority English-speaking country recognised by the Home Office, you are exempt from providing a Secure English Language Test. Your Jamaican passport *is* sufficient evidence of your English ability for the Skilled Worker visa.

So, regarding the English language requirement, you meet the criteria! Does that put your mind at ease?





[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's such a relief! I was worried I'd have to go through the hassle of taking an English test. So my Jamaican passport is all I need for the language requirement? That makes things so much easier. Thank you for confirming that.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Michael! I'm delighted I could reassure you.

Yes, that’s correct – your Jamaican passport is all you need to satisfy the English language requirement for the Skilled Worker visa. It really does simplify things, doesn't it?

Now, to assess your eligibility further, would you mind telling me if you have a valid sponsor for your Youth Worker role? (Meaning, a UK employer who is licensed by the Home Office to sponsor visas)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a valid sponsor. The youth center that offered me the job is licensed by the Home Office to sponsor visas. They've already provided me with a certificate of sponsorship. So that part is all sorted out.

[root_agent]: That's fantastic news, Michael! Having a valid sponsor and a Certificate of Sponsorship is a crucial step.

So just to recap, you have a job offer as a Youth Worker, a sponsor with a valid license, and you meet the English language requirement through your nationality. 

To confirm, the job offer is at the required skill level (RQF level 3 or above)? Does the job code match the list of eligible occupations for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the job is classified at RQF level 3. The employer confirmed this when they offered me the position, and they said the occupation code for Youth Workers is on the eligible list for the Skilled Worker visa. They've already checked all that when preparing my certificate of sponsorship.

[root_agent]: That's excellent to hear, Michael! It sounds like you've been very thorough and your employer is well-prepared.

Based on the information you've provided – a valid sponsor, a Certificate of Sponsorship, meeting the English language requirement through your Jamaican nationality, and the job being at RQF level 3 with an eligible occupation code – it appears you **meet the initial eligibility requirements** for the Skilled Worker visa.

However, there are other criteria, like salary and financial stability, that also need to be met. But regarding the points we've discussed so far, you are looking good!



Would you like me to briefly outline some of those other criteria, or would you prefer to focus on something else at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I meet the English language requirement due to my Jamaican nationality, confirming that my Jamaican passport is sufficient evidence without needing a language test.
