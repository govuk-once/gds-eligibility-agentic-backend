[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Aris and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Aris, it's nice to meet you! To help me understand your situation and assess your eligibility, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a university lecturer currently working 20 hours per week on a Skilled Worker visa. I've been offered a research position at a private think-tank for another 20 hours per week. I want to know if I can accept this second job while keeping my university position, and what the visa implications would be.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Aris. That's very helpful. 

To confirm, are both of these jobs eligible for sponsorship under the Skilled Worker visa? In other words, do both roles meet the skill and salary requirements for the visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both positions meet the skill and salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa. My university lecturer role is already sponsored, and the think-tank is willing to sponsor me for the research position. Both jobs are paying above the minimum salary thresholds even though they are part-time positions.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear! Just to be absolutely clear, have you received, or are you expecting to receive, a Certificate of Sponsorship from the think-tank for this research position?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the think-tank has confirmed they will provide me with a Certificate of Sponsorship for the research position. They're ready to move forward with the process once I confirm that it's legally possible for me to take on this second role.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Knowing that you have a Certificate of Sponsorship (or will have one shortly) is very helpful. 

To confirm, do you want to continue working at the university *while* also taking on this new research position, essentially having two sponsored jobs simultaneously?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I want to continue my university lecturer position (20 hours per week) and simultaneously take on the think-tank research position (another 20 hours per week). I'd like to maintain both roles concurrently if that's permitted.

[root_agent]: Okay, Aris, that clarifies everything. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you *are* eligible to hold both positions concurrently with two separate Skilled Worker visas. 

You would need to apply for a second visa specifically for the research position at the think-tank, and it's important to mark this application as being for "Concurrent Employment" so it doesn't automatically cancel your existing visa from the university.

Therefore, the outcome is **AWARDED**.

Do you have any other questions about this process, or anything else I can help you with?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! Just to make sure I understand the process correctly, I don't need to get permission from my university employer for this, do I? And will I need to pay the full visa application fee and Immigration Health Surcharge again for the second visa?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask those clarifying questions, Aris!

No, you do not need permission from your university employer for this – the key is that both jobs are sponsored and meet the visa requirements. Your existing visa is tied to your employment with the university, and the second visa will be tied to your employment with the think-tank.

Regarding the fees, yes, unfortunately you will need to pay the full visa application fee and the Immigration Health Surcharge *again* for the second visa application. It is treated as a separate application, even though it's for concurrent employment.



Does that answer your questions, or is there anything else I can clarify?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that answers my questions perfectly. Thank you for confirming I can hold both positions concurrently with separate Skilled Worker visas, and for clarifying the application process and fees. I'll make sure to mark my second application as "Concurrent Employment" as you advised.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Aris! I'm glad I could help. 

It was my pleasure assisting you. If you have any further questions in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Best of luck with your new research position!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome of "AWARDED" and accurately explained that I am eligible to hold two separate Skilled Worker visas simultaneously through the Concurrent Employment option, with the important detail about marking the second application as "Concurrent" to prevent cancellation of the first visa.
