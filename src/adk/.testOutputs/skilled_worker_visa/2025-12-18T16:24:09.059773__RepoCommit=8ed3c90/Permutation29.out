[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ben and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ben, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your eligibility, could you tell me what kind of benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in understanding if I'm eligible for a skilled worker visa. I'm a software developer with a job offer in the UK.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Ben! The Skilled Worker visa can be a good option for software developers. 

To start, could you please tell me your gross annual salary for this job offer – that is, your salary *before* any deductions are made?

[evaluation_judge]: My base salary is £42,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ben. That's helpful. 

Do you make any voluntary deductions from your salary, such as contributions to a pension scheme, or through schemes like "Cycle to Work" or childcare vouchers?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do actually. I've signed up for the Cycle to Work scheme and I also make additional pension contributions. Together they amount to about £2,000 per year in salary sacrifice.

[root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know, Ben. So, after these deductions, what is your remaining taxable salary per year? (That is, £42,000 minus the £2,000 sacrifice).

[evaluation_judge]: That would be £40,000 after the deductions.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Ben. 

Just to be clear, the current salary threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa is £41,700, or £33,400 for eligible occupations. Since your salary after the salary sacrifice is £40,000, it unfortunately falls below the general threshold. 

Based on this information, your application may be refused, or your employer could be in breach of their sponsorship duties if this situation occurred after a visa was granted. Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would like you to explain why my application might be refused. I thought as long as my base salary was above the threshold, it would be fine. Why does it matter if I choose to put money into these benefit schemes?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask for clarification, Ben. It's understandable to think the base salary is all that matters.

The Home Office assesses eligibility based on your *taxable* salary – that's the amount you actually receive after any voluntary deductions are made. Schemes like Cycle to Work and additional pension contributions are considered 'salary sacrifice' because you're effectively exchanging part of your salary for a benefit.

The rules state that the Skilled Worker Visa requires a salary *at or above* the threshold *after* these sacrifices. Even though your initial salary is above £41,700, reducing it through voluntary deductions to £40,000 means you no longer meet the requirement. 

Essentially, the Home Office looks at the actual amount of money you’re being paid and taxed on, rather than the initial advertised salary. This is to ensure skilled workers are earning a fair wage and contributing to the UK economy at the required level *after* considering their choices regarding benefits.



Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So if I understand correctly, I would need to either reduce my salary sacrifice amounts or increase my base salary to ensure I stay above the threshold after deductions. If I kept my base at £42,000 but reduced my salary sacrifice to only £300, would that work since I'd still be above the £41,700 threshold?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Ben! 

Yes, reducing your salary sacrifice to bring your taxable income back above £41,700 would resolve the issue. If you reduced your salary sacrifice to £300, your taxable income would be £41,700 (£42,000 - £300), and you would then meet the threshold. 

Alternatively, as you mentioned, an increase to your base salary would also ensure you remain eligible. 

It's a good idea to carefully calculate the impact of any salary sacrifice schemes on your overall eligibility for the visa. Are you considering making adjustments to your salary sacrifice, or discussing a salary increase with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I'll discuss reducing my salary sacrifice amount rather than asking for a higher base salary. It seems simpler. If I just reduce the cycle to work contribution or my additional pension amount, I can still get some benefits while keeping my taxable income above the threshold.

Thanks for explaining this clearly. It's frustrating I can't use these benefits fully, but at least I understand the rules now.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ben! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It’s definitely sensible to explore adjusting your salary sacrifice – finding a balance that allows you to utilise some benefits while remaining eligible for the visa is a good approach.

It *is* frustrating when rules have nuances like this, but being aware of them upfront is the best course of action.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the Skilled Worker visa, or any other related questions you might have?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think you've answered all my questions. I understand now that I need to keep my taxable salary above £41,700 to qualify for the visa. I'll work with my employer to adjust the salary sacrifice to make sure I stay eligible. Thanks for your help!

[root_agent]: Excellent! I’m very pleased to hear that, Ben. I'm glad I could help you understand the requirements and plan accordingly. 

If you do have any further questions in the future, feel free to reach out. I wish you all the best with your visa application and your new role as a Software Developer in the UK!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa is based on my gross salary AFTER salary sacrifice schemes, and that my application would be refused since my revised taxable salary of £40,000 falls below the £41,700 threshold. This matches the expected outcome of REFUSED or Compliance Breach.
