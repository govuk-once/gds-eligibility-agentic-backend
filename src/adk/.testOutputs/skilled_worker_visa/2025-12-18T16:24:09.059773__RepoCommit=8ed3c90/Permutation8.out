[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of a UK resident seeking benefits information.

Hi, i'm Priya and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Priya, it's lovely to meet you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me if you currently hold a visa that allows you to work in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a visa. I've been working in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022. I'm actually looking to change jobs soon to a new marketing agency, and I want to make sure I'm still eligible to stay in the UK with my new employment.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you've been working in the UK since 2022! And it's wise to check your eligibility with a job change. 

To help me assess your situation, could you please confirm if your current Skilled Worker visa was issued *before* April 4th, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My Skilled Worker visa was issued back in 2022, so definitely before April 4th, 2024. I've been working continuously in the UK since then.

[root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming. That's a helpful detail.

Could you tell me the annual salary offered to you by the new marketing agency?

[evaluation_judge]: The new marketing agency has offered me an annual salary of £32,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And to clarify, is the company offering you this new position a licensed sponsor with the UK Visas and Immigration?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've checked and the new marketing agency is a licensed sponsor with UK Visas and Immigration.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know. Finally, do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Marketing Manager role is, as determined by the UK government? There are actually two rates to consider, and it's okay if you don't know them offhand – I just need to understand which one applies to your situation. Do you know if the going rate they are using is £42,000 or £30,000?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe there are two different rates. From what I understand, the standard going rate for Marketing Managers is around £42,000, but there's a lower rate of about £30,000 that might apply to people like me who were already on a Skilled Worker visa before the recent changes. I'm not entirely sure which one would apply to my situation.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to point that out – that shows you've done your research! Because your Skilled Worker visa was issued before April 4th, 2024, and you’ve been continuously employed under that visa, you *do* qualify for the transitional arrangements. This means the lower going rate of £30,000 is the relevant one for assessing your eligibility.

Based on the information you’ve provided:

**You are AWARDED.**

Here's why: You meet all the criteria. Your salary of £32,000 is above both the transitional general threshold of £29,000 *and* the transitional going rate of £30,000. Because you qualify for transitional arrangements, the standard salary thresholds don’t apply to your case.



Is there anything else I can help you with today, Priya?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for that information, that's a relief! So just to be clear, I can accept this new marketing job with the £32,000 salary and maintain my immigration status under the transitional arrangements? That's really helpful to know.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Priya! And yes, that's absolutely correct. You can accept the new marketing job with the £32,000 salary and maintain your immigration status under the transitional arrangements. 

As long as the company remains a licensed sponsor, and you continue to meet the requirements of the Skilled Worker visa, you should be able to transition smoothly.

I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Do you have any other questions at all, or is there anything else I can assist you with?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you so much for your help and for explaining how the transitional arrangements apply to my situation. It's been very helpful!

✓ The agent correctly determined that I qualify for the Skilled Worker visa under the transitional arrangements. They accurately identified that my £32,000 salary exceeds both the transitional general threshold (£29,000) and the transitional going rate (£30,000), leading to the correct "AWARDED" outcome.
