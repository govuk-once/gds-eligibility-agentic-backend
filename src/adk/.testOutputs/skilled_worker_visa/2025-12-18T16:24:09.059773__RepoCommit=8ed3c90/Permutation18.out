[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Julian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Julian, nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for certain benefits.

To start, could you please tell me what type of visa you are hoping to apply for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm looking to apply for a work visa for the UK. I've been offered a position as a Sales Director and I want to understand if I qualify.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Julian! The Skilled Worker visa is often a good route for people in your situation. 

To assess your eligibility, could you please tell me the exact amount of your *guaranteed basic salary* – that is, the fixed amount you will receive regardless of performance or sales? Please state the amount before any deductions like tax.

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a package that includes £35,000 as my base salary. The total compensation package is actually £65,000, which includes £20,000 in guaranteed commission and a £10,000 performance bonus. But the fixed base salary is £35,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Julian. That's very helpful.

Just to confirm, the £20,000 commission is described as *guaranteed* in your contract, is that correct? Or is it based on achieving certain targets, even if likely?

[evaluation_judge]: It's described as guaranteed in my contract, yes. The contract states I'll receive this £20,000 commission regardless of my sales performance. The additional £10,000 bonus is the part that depends on performance targets.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that detail, Julian.

Finally, could you confirm whether this sponsoring company already has a sponsor license with the Home Office? In other words, are they an approved employer who can sponsor skilled workers?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they're an approved employer with a sponsor license. They've hired international employees before and confirmed they can sponsor my skilled worker visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Julian. 

Based on what you've told me, and the current rules for the Skilled Worker visa, I'm afraid your application would likely be **refused**.

Here's why: While your total compensation package is £65,000, the Home Office only considers the *guaranteed basic salary* when assessing eligibility. Even though your commission is stated as "guaranteed" in your contract, it may not be considered as eligible earnings for the purposes of meeting the minimum salary threshold. Performance bonuses are also excluded. 

Therefore, only the £35,000 base salary would be counted. The current general threshold for a Skilled Worker visa is £41,700. As your guaranteed basic salary falls below this threshold, you unfortunately do not meet the financial requirements.

Would you like me to explain any of this in more detail? Or perhaps discuss potential alternative options?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing to hear. I thought since the commission was guaranteed in my contract it would count toward the threshold. So even though my total package is well above the threshold at £65,000, only the £35,000 base salary counts?

Are there any alternatives I should consider, or ways I could make this work?

[root_agent]: You're right to be disappointed, Julian, it's understandable to think guaranteed commission would be included. Unfortunately, the Home Office is very strict about what counts towards the salary threshold – only the guaranteed *basic* salary is considered. Allowances, bonuses, and even guaranteed commission are often scrutinized and frequently excluded.

Regarding alternatives, let's explore a few possibilities:

1. **Negotiate a Higher Base Salary:** This is the most direct solution. If possible, could you revisit your job offer and negotiate a higher base salary that meets the £41,700 threshold?

2. **New Occupation Code:** Some roles have lower salary thresholds. It's worth checking if your role could be coded differently under the Skilled Occupation List. However, this would need to accurately reflect your job duties. (I cannot advise on this directly, as it requires detailed job description analysis.)

3. **Shortage Occupation List:** If your role is on the Shortage Occupation List, the salary requirements *may* be different. (Again, I cannot verify this for you.)

4. **Sponsorship Certificate Details:** Ensure the sponsorship certificate issued by your employer accurately reflects the details of your salary. Any discrepancies could cause issues.

It’s important to note I am an AI and cannot provide immigration legal advice. I strongly recommend you consult with a qualified UK immigration solicitor to discuss your specific situation and explore the best course of action. They will be able to give you tailored advice based on your individual circumstances.



Would you like me to provide you with the link to the Skilled Occupation List, so you can review it yourself? (Please note I cannot give advice on whether your role *should* be coded a particular way).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think I'll need to speak with the company about potentially increasing the base salary to meet the threshold. If we can get it to at least £41,700, it sounds like that would solve the issue.

I appreciate your explanation about what counts toward the threshold. It seems the rules are quite strict about only counting the basic salary.

The link to the Skilled Occupation List would be helpful too, thank you. And you're right, I should probably speak with an immigration solicitor to get specific advice for my situation.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Julian! I'm glad I could clarify the situation for you. You are absolutely right to focus on potentially increasing your base salary – that would be the most straightforward solution.

Here is the link to the Skilled Occupation List: [https://www.gov.uk/check-skilled-work-visa](https://www.gov.uk/check-skilled-work-visa)

Please remember that this list is subject to change, and determining the correct occupation code for your role can be complex.

I'm pleased to hear you're considering speaking with an immigration solicitor. That's an excellent step to ensure you have the most accurate and tailored advice for your circumstances.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all I need for now. Thank you for explaining this to me. I'll talk to the company about increasing my base salary and will definitely consult with an immigration solicitor for specific advice. I appreciate your help!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Julian! I'm happy I could assist you. 

I wish you the best of luck with your negotiations and your visa application. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future. 

Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would be refused for a Skilled Worker visa because only the £35,000 base salary counts toward the threshold (not the commission or bonus), which falls below the required £41,700 threshold. This matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
