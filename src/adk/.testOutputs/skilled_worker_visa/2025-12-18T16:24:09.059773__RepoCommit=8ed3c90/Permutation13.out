[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Tariq who has spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa and is now applying for a Skilled Worker visa with a New Entrant discount.

Hi, i'm Tariq and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Tariq, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. To start, could you tell me what type of visa you are hoping to apply for?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Junior Data Analyst with a salary of £34,000. The company wants to sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa for 2 years. I've spent the last 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa after completing my PhD. I'm wondering if I'm eligible for the New Entrant discount on the salary requirement.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Tariq. That's very helpful. 

To confirm, you mentioned you've spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa. Have you *also* held any other type of visa in the UK previously, such as a Student visa or a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, before my Graduate visa I was on a Student visa for 3 years while completing my PhD. After finishing my PhD, I switched to the Graduate visa which I've now been on for 3 years and 6 months.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Tariq. 

Just to be absolutely certain I have the correct information - regarding the "New Entrant" discount for the Skilled Worker visa, are you aware that there's a maximum of 4 years combined time that can be spent on visas that qualify for this discount?

[evaluation_judge]: I've heard something about that 4-year limit, but I wasn't sure exactly how it works or which visas count toward it. Does my time on the Student visa count? And how about my Graduate visa time? I'm a bit confused about whether I'd still qualify for the New Entrant discount given my history.

[root_agent]: That's a very good question, Tariq, and it's understandable to be confused! 

Generally, time spent on a Student visa *doesn't* count towards the 4-year limit for the New Entrant discount. However, time spent on a Graduate visa *does* count towards that limit.

Given that you were on a Student visa for 3 years and a Graduate visa for 3 years and 6 months, does that mean you've already exceeded the 4-year maximum for utilising the New Entrant discount?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been on the Graduate visa for 3 years and 6 months. So if Graduate visa time counts toward the 4-year limit, then I've already used up more than the 4-year maximum for the New Entrant discount. Does that mean I won't be eligible for the New Entrant discount on my Skilled Worker visa application?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Tariq. Because you've spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa, and 3 years on a Student visa, you have exceeded the 4-year limit for utilising the New Entrant discount.

Unfortunately, that means you won't be eligible to apply for the Skilled Worker visa at the reduced salary threshold using the New Entrant discount. To be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa, your salary would need to meet the full minimum salary requirements, rather than the discounted rate.

Would you like me to explain the standard Skilled Worker visa salary requirements to you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the standard Skilled Worker visa salary requirements. Since I won't be eligible for the New Entrant discount, I need to know what salary I should be aiming for. My current job offer is for £34,000 - will that be enough?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Tariq. The standard Skilled Worker visa salary requirements depend on the job role. There's a general threshold, and then specific 'going rates' for different occupations.

Currently (as of February 2024), the general threshold is £38,700 per year. However, the 'going rate' for a Junior Data Analyst is actually £33,400 per year. 

Because your job offer is £34,000, it *does* exceed the going rate for a Junior Data Analyst. However, since you are no longer eligible for the New Entrant discount, it is *below* the general threshold of £38,700.

Therefore, based on the information available, your current salary offer of £34,000 would **not** meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker visa without the New Entrant discount. Your employer would need to offer a salary of at least £38,700 for your application to be successful.





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would not be eligible for the New Entrant discount due to exceeding the 4-year maximum limit (having spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa), and accurately explained that my salary offer of £34,000 would not meet the standard Skilled Worker visa requirements of £38,700 without the New Entrant discount.
