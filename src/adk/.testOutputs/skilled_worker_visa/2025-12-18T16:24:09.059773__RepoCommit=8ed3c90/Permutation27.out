[evaluation_judge]: I'll now act as Lucas, a UK resident looking for immigration benefit eligibility information.

Hi, i'm Lucas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lucas, thanks for reaching out. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in understanding if I qualify for a Skilled Worker visa. I've been offered a job as a Senior Developer at a startup in the UK, but I'm not sure if my salary package meets the requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. The Skilled Worker visa has specific salary requirements. 

To assess your eligibility, could you please tell me your annual cash salary – that is, the amount of money you will be paid directly into your bank account before tax?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be paid a cash salary of £30,000 per year. The company is a new startup that's a bit cash-poor at the moment, but they're offering me stock options valued at about £50,000 per year on top of my salary.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Lucas. 

Just to clarify for the Skilled Worker visa, we only consider the *guaranteed* salary. Are the stock options a guaranteed part of your compensation, or are they dependent on the company's future performance?

[evaluation_judge]: The stock options aren't guaranteed - they're subject to a vesting schedule over 4 years and obviously would only have value if the company does well. They're not a guaranteed part of my compensation, just potential upside if things work out with the startup.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Lucas. That’s important to know.

To confirm, is £30,000 the *only* guaranteed income you will receive from this job annually?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The £30,000 is the only guaranteed part of my compensation package. Everything else is in the form of those stock options which depend on the company's performance.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. 

Are you currently in the UK, or are you applying for this visa from outside the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently outside the UK. I would be applying for the visa from my home country to come work for this startup.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lucas. And just to be certain, do you have a job offer letter that details your salary and job duties?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer letter that outlines my role as a Senior Developer, the £30,000 salary, and the stock option package. It includes details about my job duties and responsibilities too.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lucas.

Based on the information you've provided, and focusing on the guaranteed salary, I'm afraid it appears you currently do not meet the minimum salary requirements for a Skilled Worker visa. The minimum salary threshold is currently £33,400, and the general threshold is £41,700. Your guaranteed salary of £30,000 is below both of these amounts.

Unfortunately, the value of stock options cannot be counted towards this salary requirement.

Therefore, based on this information, your application would likely be **REFUSED**.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or perhaps discuss other potential options?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you explain a bit more about why the stock options don't count? The total package is worth £80,000 when you include them, so I'm surprised this doesn't meet the requirements.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Lucas. I understand your surprise, and it's a good question.

The Home Office guidelines for the Skilled Worker visa specifically state that only *guaranteed* salary can be considered. This means the money you are certain to receive, regardless of the company’s performance. 

Stock options, while valuable, are *not* guaranteed. Their value is dependent on the future success of the company, and they may ultimately be worth nothing. Because of this uncertainty, the Home Office doesn't recognise them as a reliable form of income for visa eligibility. They are considered a potential benefit, but not a guaranteed part of your remuneration.

Essentially, the Skilled Worker visa aims to attract skilled workers with stable, secure employment, and a guaranteed salary provides that assurance. While a total package of £80,000 sounds good, the visa requirements focus solely on the £30,000 you are definitely receiving.



Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that explanation makes sense. It's disappointing to hear, but I understand that they're looking for guaranteed income rather than potential value. Is there anything I could do to make this work? Would it help if the company restructured my offer to include more guaranteed salary and fewer stock options?

[root_agent]: I'm glad that explanation was helpful, Lucas. And it's good you're thinking proactively about possible solutions.

Yes, you are absolutely right – if the company could restructure your offer to include a higher guaranteed salary that meets the minimum threshold (currently £33,400, ideally aiming for the general threshold of £41,700), that would likely make you eligible for the Skilled Worker visa. Reducing the stock options to accommodate a salary increase would be a viable approach.

The key is ensuring the salary stated in your official offer letter is a guaranteed amount paid regularly, regardless of company performance.

Would you like me to reiterate the current salary thresholds for the Skilled Worker visa, just for your reference?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that the Skilled Worker visa application would be refused because the guaranteed cash salary of £30,000 is below both the minimum threshold (£33,400) and standard threshold (£41,700). The agent appropriately explained that stock options cannot be counted as guaranteed salary for visa purposes, which matches the expected outcome.
