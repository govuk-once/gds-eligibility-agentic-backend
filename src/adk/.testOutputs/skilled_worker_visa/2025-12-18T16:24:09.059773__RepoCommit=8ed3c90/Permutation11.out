[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by roleplaying as Claire, a US executive with a CEO job offer in the UK, to test the agent's knowledge of UK immigration salary requirements.

Hi, i'm Claire and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Claire, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help.

To start, could you tell me, do you have a job offer in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer in the UK. I've been offered a position as CEO at a small startup company there. They're offering me £55,000 per year. I'm currently living in the US and trying to understand if I'll be eligible for a work visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you have a job offer as CEO! 

To assess your eligibility, could you please confirm if your annual salary is £55,000 *before* tax?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The annual salary is £55,000 before tax. It's a small startup so they can't offer me a huge salary yet, but I'm excited about the opportunity.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, thank you.

To help me understand your situation better, are you aware of the current general salary threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I've heard there's some kind of minimum salary requirement, but I'm not sure exactly what it is. I thought £55,000 would be enough since it seems like a decent salary, but I want to make sure I'll be eligible before proceeding with the visa application process.

[root_agent]: You're right to check! There *is* a minimum salary requirement. Currently, the general threshold is £38,700, but there's also a salary requirement specific to your job role. 

Could you please confirm the specific code for your job role as listed on the UK government's occupations list? It's a 4-digit code. If you don't have it to hand, we can try to find it together, but knowing it will really help me assess your eligibility.

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have the code on hand, but I know I'd be coming as a Chief Executive Officer (CEO). If there's a specific code for that role, I'd appreciate if we could find it together.

[root_agent]: Certainly! Let me look that up for you. 

The standard occupation code for a Chief Executive Officer is 1115.

Now, knowing this, do you know what the 'going rate' is for a CEO (code 1115) under the Skilled Worker Visa rules?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't know what the 'going rate' is for a CEO under the UK visa rules. What is that rate, and how does it affect my application?

[root_agent]: The 'going rate' is the minimum salary you need to be paid for your specific job role to be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. For a CEO (code 1115), the going rate is currently £78,000 per year.

Unfortunately, your offered salary of £55,000 is below this going rate. While it exceeds the general threshold of £38,700, the higher of the two – the going rate – *must* be met.



Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, your application would likely be **refused**. Do you have any questions about this?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I'm surprised to hear that. I thought £55,000 was a good salary. So even though it's above the general threshold of £38,700, I still wouldn't qualify because of this 'going rate' requirement for CEOs specifically? Is there any way around this, or would the company need to increase their offer to at least £78,000 for me to be eligible?

[root_agent]: You're absolutely right to be surprised, and it's a very common misunderstanding! Many people assume meeting the general threshold is enough. However, the Skilled Worker Visa rules require you to meet the *higher* of the general threshold *or* the going rate for your specific occupation.

And yes, you are correct again. Currently, there isn’t a straightforward way around this requirement. The company would need to offer you a salary of at least £78,000 per year to meet the going rate for a CEO and make you eligible for the visa. 

Would you like me to explain anything further about the going rates or the Skilled Worker Visa requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really helpful information. I didn't realize the going rate would be so much higher than the general threshold. I'll need to discuss this with the company to see if they can increase their offer to meet the £78,000 requirement.

Just to be sure I understand completely - there are no exceptions to this rule, even for smaller companies or startups? And is the going rate reviewed regularly, or is it likely to stay at £78,000 for the foreseeable future?

[root_agent]: You're very thorough in your questioning, which is excellent!

You're right to ask about exceptions. Unfortunately, there are very few exceptions to the going rate requirement. While there are some niche situations involving 'new entrants' to the labour market (and those on specific training schemes), these generally don’t apply to someone with experience as a CEO. The rules are quite strict on this point.

Regarding the going rate, it *is* reviewed regularly by the UK government, usually twice a year – in spring and autumn. The rates are based on labour market data, so they can change. However, it's difficult to predict whether it will increase or decrease. You can find the latest rates on the government website, but it's always best to base your application on the current published rate at the time of application.

Is there anything else I can help clarify for you at this stage?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa because my £55,000 salary offer falls below the £78,000 "going rate" for CEO positions, even though it exceeds the general threshold of £38,700. The agent accurately explained that applicants must meet the higher of the two requirements and identified that my application would be refused.
