[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Pavel and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Pavel, lovely to meet you! I'm here to help assess your eligibility. 

To start, could you please tell me, are you currently located within the United Kingdom?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm currently in Warsaw, Poland. I have a job offer from a garage in the UK who wants to bring me over as a mechanic. They've already given me a Certificate of Sponsorship number to use on my visa application.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you have a job offer! 

To clarify, was the Certificate of Sponsorship assigned to you as a "Defined" CoS, or an "Undefined" CoS? Knowing this will help me understand your situation better.

[evaluation_judge]: They mentioned it was an "Undefined" CoS from their annual allocation. They said they had some spare ones and wanted to save time so I could apply right away. Is there a difference?

[root_agent]: Yes, there is a difference, and that's a very important detail! 

Since you are currently in Warsaw, Poland – outside of the UK –  a "Defined" Certificate of Sponsorship is required for your application. An "Undefined" CoS is generally used for people who are *already* in the UK and applying to switch visa categories. 

Unfortunately, using an "Undefined" CoS in your case could lead to your application being rejected. 

Would you like me to explain this in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I'd really appreciate more details. What should I do now? Is there a way to fix this?

[root_agent]: Certainly. As you're applying for the Skilled Worker visa from *outside* the UK – specifically from Poland – the Home Office requires a "Defined" CoS. These are specifically requested for each individual applicant. 

"Undefined" CoS are part of a sponsor's annual allocation and are intended for applicants who are *already in* the UK and switching visa types, or extending their stay. Because they’re pre-allocated, they can be assigned quickly, but they aren’t valid for initial applications from abroad.

To fix this, your sponsoring garage in the UK needs to apply for a "Defined" CoS specifically for you. This will involve providing more detailed information about your role and qualifications to the Home Office. Once they have this Defined CoS, you’ll need to use *that* reference number on your visa application instead of the one you have now.

It might cause a slight delay, but it's essential to ensure your application is processed correctly. Would you like me to summarise this, or is there anything else I can clarify?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for explaining. So if I understand correctly, I shouldn't submit my application with this current "Undefined" CoS because it will be rejected? And instead, I should ask the garage to apply for a "Defined" CoS specifically for me?

How long does that typically take? I was hoping to move quite soon.

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly! Yes, you are absolutely correct – submitting your application with the current "Undefined" CoS will almost certainly result in a rejection, or at least be considered invalid. It's best to wait and use the reference number from a "Defined" CoS assigned specifically to you.

Regarding how long it takes to get a Defined CoS, it can vary. The Home Office states that sponsors usually receive a decision within 8 working days, but it can sometimes take longer – up to 28 working days in complex cases. It's best to encourage the garage to apply as quickly as possible.

I understand you were hoping to move soon, and this is frustrating. However, applying with the incorrect CoS will only cause further delays and potential complications. It's always best to get it right the first time.

Is there anything else I can help you with at the moment, perhaps regarding the other requirements for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really helpful, thank you. I'll contact the garage right away and ask them to apply for a "Defined" CoS for me instead. I'd rather wait a few more weeks than have my application rejected.

I think that answers my main question for now. I appreciate your time and clear explanation of the difference between the types of CoS.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Pavel! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It's a smart decision to wait for the Defined CoS – it will save you potential headaches down the line. 

If you have any further questions as you go through the application process, please don’t hesitate to ask. I'm here to assist in any way I can. 

Wishing you all the best with your application and your move to the UK!

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks again for your help! Have a great day.

✓ The agent correctly identified that since I'm outside the UK (in Poland), an "Undefined" CoS would lead to my application being refused. The agent accurately explained that my sponsor must apply for a "Defined" CoS for my application to succeed, which matches the expected outcome of refusal with the current CoS type.
