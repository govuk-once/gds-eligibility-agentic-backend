[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Sarah, an IT consultant looking to understand her eligibility for a skilled worker visa.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you tell me if you have a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) from a UK employer?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a Certificate of Sponsorship from a UK IT firm. They're looking to bring me on as an IT consultant. I'm just trying to understand if I'll be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with the arrangement they've proposed.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, thank you.

To clarify, will you be employed by the IT firm and paid through PAYE (Pay As You Earn), or will you be providing your services as a contractor and invoicing them directly?

[evaluation_judge]: They've actually suggested that I work as a contractor and invoice them directly. They mentioned it would be better for them in terms of National Insurance costs. We'd have a Consultancy Agreement rather than an employment contract. They said they'd still provide the Certificate of Sponsorship though. Is that going to be an issue?

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that, Sarah. Yes, that arrangement could potentially be an issue for a Skilled Worker visa. 

The Skilled Worker visa requires a genuine employment relationship where you are paid through PAYE as an employee. Invoicing the company directly as a contractor, even with a CoS, doesn’t typically meet these requirements. 

To help me understand your situation better, could you confirm whether the agreement you have with the IT firm is a contract *of* employment, or a contract *for* services (like a consultancy agreement)?

[evaluation_judge]: It's definitely a contract *for* services - a consultancy agreement. They were quite clear that I'd be invoicing them monthly for my services rather than being on their payroll. They said they preferred this arrangement for flexibility and to save on employer costs, but they assured me they could still sponsor me with a CoS.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Sarah. 

Unfortunately, a consultancy agreement where you invoice for services is unlikely to be compatible with the Skilled Worker visa requirements. The visa is for employed positions, and this arrangement appears to be more akin to self-employment. Even with a CoS, the Home Office will look at the actual working arrangement.

To be clear, are you receiving payment directly into a bank account in your name, and are you responsible for your own tax and National Insurance contributions?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I would be paid directly into my business account, and I'd be responsible for handling my own tax and National Insurance contributions. They specifically mentioned this was a benefit for them as they wouldn't need to pay employer's National Insurance. They seemed to think the Certificate of Sponsorship would still work fine with this arrangement though.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Sarah.

Based on what you've described – invoicing the company, being responsible for your own tax and National Insurance, and having a contract *for* services – it appears this arrangement wouldn’t currently meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker visa. The visa requires a genuine employer-employee relationship with PAYE deductions. 

The Certificate of Sponsorship confirms they *want* to sponsor you, but it doesn't override the fundamental requirement for genuine employment.

I'm afraid, in this situation, your application would likely be **refused**, or potentially flagged as a compliance breach for the sponsoring company.

Would you like me to explain any of this in more detail? Perhaps we could discuss what changes to the arrangement would be necessary to potentially meet the visa requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: So if I understand correctly, even though they're offering me a Certificate of Sponsorship, the fact that they want me to work as a contractor with a consultancy agreement rather than as an employee would mean my Skilled Worker visa application would be refused? That's very concerning as they seemed quite confident this would work.

What changes would need to happen for this to meet the visa requirements?

[root_agent]: You understand correctly, Sarah. Yes, even with a Certificate of Sponsorship, the arrangement of working as a contractor with a consultancy agreement is unlikely to be approved for a Skilled Worker visa. Their confidence may stem from a misunderstanding of the rules.

To meet the visa requirements, several changes would need to happen:

1. **Employment Contract:** You would need a formal, written contract *of* employment with the IT firm, not a consultancy agreement. This contract should clearly outline your role, responsibilities, working hours, and salary.

2. **PAYE Payroll:** You would need to be added to the company’s PAYE payroll. This means they would deduct Income Tax and National Insurance contributions directly from your salary.

3. **Genuine Employee Status:** The Home Office will assess whether there is a genuine employer-employee relationship. Factors they consider include control over your work, integration into the company, and who bears the financial risk. Simply having a contract isn’t enough – the reality of the working arrangement must reflect employment.

Essentially, you would need to be treated as a regular employee, not a self-employed contractor. The company would need to be willing to take on the responsibilities of an employer, including paying employer’s National Insurance.



Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining this clearly. It sounds like they need to make me a proper employee with PAYE if they want to sponsor me for the Skilled Worker visa. I'll need to go back to them and explain that their proposed arrangement won't work.

I appreciate your help in clarifying this - it's saved me from potentially having a visa application refused. I'll tell them they need to offer me a proper employment contract and put me on their payroll if they're serious about sponsoring me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah! I'm so glad I could help clarify things and potentially save you from a frustrating and costly visa application refusal. 

It's excellent that you're going to discuss this with the IT firm. Explaining the requirements clearly should help them understand the necessary changes. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you the best of luck in your discussions and with your visa application process!
