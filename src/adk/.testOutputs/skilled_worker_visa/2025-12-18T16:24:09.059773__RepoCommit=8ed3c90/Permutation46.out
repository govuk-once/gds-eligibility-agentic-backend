[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Yara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Yara, it's nice to meet you. I'm root_agent, and I can help you with that.

To start, could you tell me if you have already taken a Secure English Language Test (SELT)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have taken a SELT before. I passed a B1 level test about 4 years ago when I applied for my Student Visa. I still have the reference number from that test.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, thank you. 

Is that previous SELT test associated with a *successful* UK visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it is. I used that B1 SELT test for my Student Visa application which was approved, and I completed my studies in the UK with that visa. Now I'm applying for a Skilled Worker visa from abroad.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. 

Just to confirm, is the SELT test you took now expired – meaning it is more than 2 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the SELT test is expired. As I mentioned, I took it about 4 years ago for my Student visa application.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. 

Based on the information you've provided – that your SELT test is expired, but was used for a previous successful UK visa application (your Student Visa) and was at the B1 level – it appears you *do* meet the requirements regarding English language proficiency for the Skilled Worker visa, despite the expiry date.



Do you have any other questions for me?

[evaluation_judge]: So I can use my expired B1 SELT test for my Skilled Worker visa application because I used it successfully before, even though it's 4 years old now? That's great news! I was worried I might need to take another test. I don't have any other questions right now. Thank you for clarifying this for me.

[root_agent]: You are very welcome, Yara! 

Yes, that is correct. Because you successfully used the B1 SELT for your Student Visa application, you can reuse it for your Skilled Worker visa application even though it is now 4 years old. You don't need to take another test.

I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. If you think of anything else, feel free to ask. Good luck with your Skilled Worker visa application!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the clarification! This is really helpful for my application. I appreciate your time and assistance.

✓ The agent correctly informed me that I meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker visa despite having an expired SELT test (4 years old) because I used it for a previous successful UK visa application (Student Visa). This matches the expected outcome.
