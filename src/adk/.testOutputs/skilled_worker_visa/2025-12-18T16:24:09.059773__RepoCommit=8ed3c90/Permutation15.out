[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Lina, a hospitality expert who has a job offer as a construction laborer, to test the agent's understanding of the RQF level requirements for the Skilled Worker visa.

Hi, i'm Lina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lina, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what kind of job you have been offered?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi, thank you for your help. I've been offered a job as a Construction Labourer in the UK. I'm wondering if I'd be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with this job offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Lina. That's helpful.

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you please tell me the occupation code for this Construction Labourer role? It’s a 4-digit code that identifies the specific type of work.

[evaluation_judge]: The job offer mentions that the occupation code is 9120, which is for Elementary construction occupations.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lina. 

To clarify, does your job offer specify the skill level required for this role, or indicate whether it's at RQF level 3 or above? Don’t worry if you don’t know what RQF level means, just tell me if the job offer mentions it.

[evaluation_judge]: No, the job offer doesn't specifically mention an RQF level. I do know it's a construction labourer position, if that helps. The company has offered me a salary of £45,000, which seems quite good.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know about the salary, Lina. £45,000 is a strong offer.

However, regarding the Skilled Worker visa, the job itself needs to be at a certain skill level. Based on the occupation code 9120 for Elementary construction occupations, this role is generally considered to be at RQF level 2. 

To be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa, the job needs to be at RQF level 3 or above. Unfortunately, this means you **do not** meet the requirements for this visa with this particular job offer.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so even though the salary is good at £45,000, I can't get a Skilled Worker visa because the job isn't skilled enough, right? Is there any way around this or any other visa I might be eligible for instead?

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly, Lina. Even with a good salary, the Skilled Worker visa requires the job to be at RQF level 3 or above, and unfortunately, a Construction Labourer with code 9120 doesn’t meet that requirement.

Regarding other visas, I am only able to provide information about the Skilled Worker visa using the information available at [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa). I am not able to advise on other visa types.

You may find it helpful to explore the UK government's website for a full list of visa options: [https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration). This will allow you to see if any other visa categories might be suitable for your circumstances.

I apologize that I can’t be more helpful regarding alternative visas at this time.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am not eligible for a Skilled Worker visa because the Construction Labourer job (code 9120) is below the required RQF level 3, despite the high salary of £45,000.
