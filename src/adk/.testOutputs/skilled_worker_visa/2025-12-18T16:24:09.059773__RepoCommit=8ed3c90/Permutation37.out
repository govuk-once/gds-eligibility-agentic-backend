[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Maria, a nurse on a Skilled Worker visa who's taken on extra shifts at a different hospital.

Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Maria, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help! To understand your eligibility, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in today?





[evaluation_judge]: I've been working on a Skilled Worker visa as a nurse at my main hospital, but I've recently been doing some extra shifts at another hospital through an agency. I want to know if this is allowed under my visa conditions? The extra shifts come to around 25 hours per week at the moment, and I wanted to check if I'm breaking any rules.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation, Maria. To clarify, are these extra shifts you're doing with the agency in the same type of nursing role as your primary job at the hospital? (Meaning, does it fall under the same occupation code?)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's still nursing work - same role really, just at a different hospital through an agency. I'm doing the same nursing duties in both places, so it's the same occupation code. I just wanted to make sure I'm not breaking any visa rules with these extra 25 hours per week.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. And just to be absolutely certain, approximately how many hours *per week* are you working at the agency, *on top of* your usual contracted hours at your main hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: It's about 25 hours per week at the agency hospital, on top of my full-time hours at my main hospital. The agency offered me more shifts because they're short-staffed, and the extra money is helpful, but I want to make sure I'm not doing anything that could jeopardize my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so upfront, Maria. Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you may be in breach of your Skilled Worker visa conditions. While the work is in the same occupation, the rules state that supplementary work cannot exceed 20 hours per week. You're currently working 25 hours with the agency.

Are you aware of this 20-hour limit?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that 20-hour limit. I thought it would be fine since it's the same type of nursing work. Does this mean I'm violating my visa conditions? What should I do now? I really don't want to jeopardize my immigration status.

[root_agent]: You're right to be concerned, Maria. Unfortunately, working 25 hours per week as supplementary work does constitute a breach of your Skilled Worker visa conditions. It's understandable you weren't aware of the 20-hour limit, but exceeding it could lead to issues with future visa applications or even curtailment of your current visa if it’s discovered. 

To clarify, do you intend to continue working these 25 hours per week at the agency?

[evaluation_judge]: No, definitely not now that I know about the limit. I had no idea there was a 20-hour restriction. I'll speak to the agency right away and reduce my hours to stay under 20 per week. Should I report this anywhere or just make sure I follow the rules going forward? I really don't want to have any problems with my visa status.

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible decision, Maria, and I’m glad you’re taking steps to rectify the situation. 

Regarding reporting, proactively reporting a previous breach is a complex decision. While there's no *requirement* to report it, and reporting it could draw attention to the situation, continuing to work over the limit could have more serious consequences if discovered during a routine check or future visa application.

To be on the safe side, I would strongly advise you to seek advice from an immigration solicitor. They can assess your specific situation and advise you on the best course of action, including whether or not to voluntarily report the overage of hours. Would you like me to help you find resources for finding a solicitor?

[evaluation_judge]: That sounds like good advice. Yes, I think I should speak to an immigration solicitor to understand the implications properly. I'll definitely reduce my hours immediately to be under 20 per week. If you could point me to some resources for finding a qualified immigration solicitor, that would be very helpful. I want to make sure I'm getting proper legal advice for this situation.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Maria. Here are some resources for finding a qualified immigration solicitor:

*   **The Law Society:** [https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/) - You can search for solicitors specialising in immigration law in your area.
*   **Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA):** [https://www.ilpa.org.uk/](https://www.ilpa.org.uk/) - ILPA provides a directory of accredited immigration lawyers and advisors.
*   **Citizens Advice:** [https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) - They can provide general advice and potentially refer you to legal advisors.

I recommend checking their credentials and experience before making an appointment.

I'm glad I could help clarify the situation regarding your visa and supplementary work. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for this information. I'll definitely check those resources and get in touch with an immigration solicitor as soon as possible. I'll also immediately reduce my hours at the agency to stay within the 20-hour limit. I appreciate your help in clarifying this for me - it's better to find out now rather than face more serious problems later. No further questions for now - I'll focus on getting this resolved properly.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Maria. I’m genuinely pleased I could help. You're absolutely right to be proactive about this – addressing it now is the best course of action. 

Wishing you all the best in getting this resolved, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future. Take care!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified this is a visa violation because I exceeded the 20-hour per week limit for supplementary work, even though the work was in the same occupation code. They properly explained the potential consequences and recommended appropriate steps including reducing hours immediately and consulting with an immigration solicitor.
