[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on this role and interact with the agent to test their knowledge about B-rated sponsors.

Hi, i'm Fatima and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Fatima, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility. To start, could you tell me what benefit you are hoping to apply for?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello! I recently received a job offer from a company in the UK called Logistics Co. They've told me they want to sponsor me for a work visa, and I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible. I'm currently overseas and this would be my first job in the UK. I'm a bit confused about the visa process and whether everything is in order with their sponsorship.

[root_agent]: Hello Fatima, thank you for explaining! It's good you're being proactive and checking. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me what type of job you have been offered with Logistics Co.? Specifically, what is the job title and a brief description of the role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Supply Chain Analyst. The role involves analyzing supply chain data, optimizing logistics routes, and coordinating with warehouses across the UK. It's a full-time position with a salary of £32,000 per year. Logistics Co. mentioned they have a sponsor license and would be providing me with a Certificate of Sponsorship to apply for my work visa.

[root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you. Now, to clarify something regarding Logistics Co., are you aware of their current rating with the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)? Specifically, do you know if they have a current sponsor license rating of A, B, or C?

[evaluation_judge]: They didn't specifically tell me their rating, but I recently heard from a friend who works in HR that Logistics Co. had some issues during a recent audit and was downgraded to a B-rating. They assured me it wouldn't affect my hiring process, but I'm concerned about what this means for my visa application. Is this something that could affect my eligibility?

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Fatima. It's good you were able to find that out. Yes, a B-rating *does* potentially affect your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa in your situation, as you're a new recruit. 

Could you confirm if Logistics Co. has *already* assigned you a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS), or are they in the process of doing so?

[evaluation_judge]: They haven't assigned me a Certificate of Sponsorship yet. They said they're in the process of preparing it and will assign it to me soon. They've sent me an employment contract and asked me to start preparing my visa application documents. Should I be concerned about this?

[root_agent]: Yes, you are right to be concerned. Because Logistics Co. is currently a B-rated sponsor, they are restricted from assigning Certificates of Sponsorship to *new* hires. They can only issue CoS for existing employees who are applying for extensions.

To be clear, have they already *started* the process of assigning you a CoS within the Sponsorship Management System (SMS)? Or is it just a verbal confirmation that they will do so?

[evaluation_judge]: They've only given me a verbal confirmation that they'll assign me a CoS. They haven't started the actual process in the system yet, as far as I know. They did say they're working with their immigration team to "sort things out," but I haven't received any confirmation numbers or anything official from the UK government. Does this mean they won't actually be able to sponsor me?

[root_agent]: That’s right, Fatima. Based on what you’ve told me, it’s highly likely they will be **unable to assign you a CoS** at this time. A B-rated sponsor is currently frozen from sponsoring new workers. 

While they may be attempting to find a solution, their current rating prevents them from doing so. If they *were* to somehow assign you a CoS, your visa application would likely be **refused**.

Would you like me to explain a little more about why a B-rating impacts new sponsorships?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please do explain more about why a B-rating impacts new sponsorships. I'm quite worried now as I was planning to move soon. Also, is there anything that can be done in this situation? Would I need to find another employer, or could Logistics Co. fix their rating quickly?

[root_agent]: Certainly. A B-rating is given to sponsors who have had compliance issues – meaning they haven't followed the rules set by UKVI when sponsoring workers. As a result, UKVI restricts their ability to sponsor *new* workers to prevent further non-compliance. They can still support existing employees who need to extend their visas.

Essentially, UKVI doesn't trust that Logistics Co. will properly fulfill their responsibilities as a sponsor for someone new to the UK. 

Regarding what can be done: unfortunately, a sponsor rating isn’t something an organisation can ‘fix’ quickly. They need to demonstrate sustained compliance with the sponsorship rules. It often involves significant internal changes and further audits by UKVI.

Therefore, it's very likely you would need to find another employer who holds an A-rated sponsor license to be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. I understand this is disappointing, especially with moving plans already in place.



Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: This is very disappointing news, but I appreciate your honesty. So to be clear, even if Logistics Co. tries to proceed with my sponsorship, the system would block it, and even if they somehow got around that, my visa would be refused anyway?

How long does it typically take for a company to upgrade from B-rating back to an A-rating? And is there any alternative visa route I could consider in the meantime, or is finding another A-rated sponsor my only real option?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct. Even if Logistics Co. attempts to assign you a CoS, the Sponsorship Management System (SMS) *should* block the request. And, as you rightly point out, even if they bypassed the system, your visa application would almost certainly be refused.

Regarding the time it takes to upgrade from a B-rating to an A-rating, it's difficult to give a precise timeframe. It depends on the severity of the initial compliance issues, how quickly Logistics Co. addresses them, and how well they demonstrate ongoing compliance to UKVI. It typically takes *at least* several months, and often a year or more, with no guarantee of success. Regular audits are required.

As for alternative visa routes, given your situation as a new recruit with a skilled job offer, the Skilled Worker Visa is generally the most appropriate. There aren’t typically other visa routes readily available for this scenario. Therefore, finding another employer with an A-rated sponsor license is realistically your best option.

I understand this isn't the news you wanted to hear, and I'm sorry about that. Would you like me to point you towards information on how to find a list of licensed sponsors?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would appreciate that information about finding licensed sponsors. This is very frustrating as I was quite excited about this position, but I understand the rules are there for a reason. I'll need to start looking for opportunities with A-rated sponsors instead. Thank you for being so clear about my situation.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Fatima. I'm glad I could provide clarity, even though it wasn't the answer you hoped for. It's sensible to focus on A-rated sponsors now.

While I can't provide direct links, you can find a list of licensed sponsors on the UK government website. Search for "UKVI sponsor list" on [https://www.gov.uk/](https://www.gov.uk/). This will take you to a searchable database where you can look for companies licensed to sponsor workers in your profession. You can filter by occupation code and location.

I wish you the best of luck in your job search and with your visa application with a new sponsor! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that as a B-rated sponsor, Logistics Co. cannot sponsor new hires like me, and accurately explained that any CoS assignment would be blocked or the visa application refused. The information provided matched the expected outcome that a B-rated sponsor cannot issue CoS to new workers.
