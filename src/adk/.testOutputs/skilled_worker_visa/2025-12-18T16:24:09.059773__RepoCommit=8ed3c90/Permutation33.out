[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Wei, it's good to speak with you! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you please confirm your current age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 25 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Wei.

Have you previously lived and worked in the UK under any type of visa? If so, could you please tell me which visa(s) you held and for how long?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've worked in the UK for 3 years on a "Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee" visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Wei. 

Are you currently employed in the UK, or are you applying for a new role? If it's a new role, do you have a job offer already?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm applying for a new role as a Senior Analyst. I already have a job offer with a salary of £34,000.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear about the job offer, Wei! £34,000 is a good salary.

Just to clarify, is this Skilled Worker visa application your first time applying for a Skilled Worker visa, or have you held one previously?

[evaluation_judge]: This is my first time applying for a Skilled Worker visa. Previously I only had the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa for 3 years.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Wei. 

Knowing you previously held a Global Business Mobility visa for 3 years is important. To assess your eligibility further, are you aware of the rules regarding how long you can use the 'New Entrant' discount for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I should qualify as a New Entrant because I'm under 26 years old. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Wei, and it's a common assumption! Being under 26 *is* part of the New Entrant criteria, but there's also a time limit to consider.

To be precise, the "New Entrant" limit is a maximum of 4 years, and this includes any time you've *already* spent in the UK on a Global Business Mobility visa (or previously, a Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visa).

Given you've already spent 3 years on the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa, does that change your understanding of how much "New Entrant" time you might have remaining?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I wasn't aware of that. So that means I've already used 3 years of my 4-year New Entrant limit. So I would only have 1 year remaining as a New Entrant?

[root_agent]: You are exactly right, Wei. Your understanding is correct. Because you’ve already spent 3 years on the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa, you have only 1 year remaining under the New Entrant rules.

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, and considering the New Entrant rules, a standard 3 or 5-year Skilled Worker visa with the New Entrant salary discount wouldn’t be possible in your case.

I'm afraid, based on these criteria, your application would likely be **REFUSED** if it requested the full 3 or 5 year visa with the discount.

Would you like me to explain this further, or discuss other possible options?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so my application for a Skilled Worker visa at £34,000 would likely be refused because I've already used up most of my New Entrant time allowance. That's disappointing to hear.

What are my other options? Would I need a higher salary to qualify for a regular Skilled Worker visa without the New Entrant discount?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Wei, and I'm sorry to deliver disappointing news.

Yes, you are correct. To qualify for a Skilled Worker visa without relying on the New Entrant discount, you would generally need to meet the minimum salary requirement for the specific occupation code of your Senior Analyst role.

Currently (as of November 2023), the general threshold is £38,700 per year. However, there are some exceptions and the exact amount can vary. You can find more information about current salary thresholds here: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/salary-requirements](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/salary-requirements)

Since your current salary is £34,000, it is below the general threshold. You would need to negotiate a salary increase with your employer to meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker visa without the New Entrant discount.

Alternatively, your employer could explore if your specific role qualifies for a lower salary threshold based on a shortage occupation list. 

Would you like me to help you find information about shortage occupation lists, or would you prefer to discuss anything else about your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly stated that my application would be refused because my Global Business Mobility visa time counts toward my New Entrant limit, leaving me with only 1 year remaining (not enough for the standard 3 or 5-year visa). They accurately explained that without the New Entrant discount, I would need a higher salary to qualify.
