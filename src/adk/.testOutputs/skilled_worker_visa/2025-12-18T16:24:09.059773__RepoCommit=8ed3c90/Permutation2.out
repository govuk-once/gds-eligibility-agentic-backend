[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Liam, a 23-year-old recent graduate from Canada seeking information about visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Liam, it's great to speak with you! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you please confirm your current age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 23 years old. I recently graduated with my Bachelor's degree here in the UK. I was on a Student Visa while studying.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Liam. That's helpful to know. 

Could you please tell me what type of job you have been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Junior Financial Analyst. The company is offering me a salary of £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Liam. That's good information. 

To clarify, do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Junior Financial Analyst role, according to the government's official list? (Don’t worry if you don’t know exactly, just an approximate figure is fine).

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for this role is around £42,000 per year. The company mentioned this when they made the offer, saying my salary as a new graduate would be less than the standard rate but still above what's needed for the visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's very helpful, Liam. Thank you.

Just to confirm, was your Bachelor's degree taught in English?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my degree was taught entirely in English here in the UK.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. And just to be certain, is the company offering you the job a licensed sponsor with the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they confirmed they are a licensed sponsor with the Home Office. They've sponsored international employees before.

[root_agent]: Excellent. One final question for now, Liam. Is the job itself at the required skill level – meaning is it at least a RQF level 3 (A-level equivalent) or above?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they mentioned the job is classified as RQF level 6, which requires my bachelor's degree qualification.

[root_agent]: Thank you very much for all of that information, Liam. 

Based on what you've told me – your age of 23, recent graduation from a UK Bachelor's degree while on a Student Visa, a job offer as a Junior Financial Analyst with a salary of £35,000, a going rate of £42,000, a degree taught in English, and a licensed sponsor – it appears you **would likely be awarded** the Skilled Worker Visa under the New Entrant rules.

Your salary meets both the £33,400 threshold and is above 70% of the going rate. Being a recent graduate switching from a Student Visa also means you qualify as a 'New Entrant'.

However, please remember this is an initial assessment based on the information you’ve provided. The Home Office will make the final decision. Do you have any questions about this, or would you like me to clarify anything?





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would be awarded the Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately recognized my New Entrant status (under 26, recent graduate), verified that my £35,000 salary exceeds both the lower threshold (£33,400) and 70% of the going rate (£29,400), and confirmed all other eligibility criteria were met.
