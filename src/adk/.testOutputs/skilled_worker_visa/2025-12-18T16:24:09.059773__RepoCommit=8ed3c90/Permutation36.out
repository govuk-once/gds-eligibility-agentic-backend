[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Raj, nice to meet you! I'm here to help. To best understand which benefits you might be eligible for, could you tell me what your current employment status is? Are you currently working in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently working in the UK. I'm on a Skilled Worker visa with a company that has been sponsoring me for the past couple of years. I was originally sponsored as a Web Developer, but I've just been promoted to an IT Project Manager role within the same company. My salary has increased to £50,000. The HR department has updated some system called SMS, but they told me I don't need to apply for a new visa since I'm staying with the same employer. I just wanted to check if that's correct or if I need to do something else.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Raj. That's very helpful. To clarify, do you know the specific occupation code listed on your current Skilled Worker visa? (It will be a four-digit number).





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my current visa lists occupation code 2137, which is for Web Developer. My new role as IT Project Manager would fall under code 2135. The HR team said since it's the same company, I just needed an internal update in their system, but I want to make sure I'm following the proper immigration rules.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Raj. Just to be absolutely clear, did you apply for and receive a new Skilled Worker visa *before* starting your new role as IT Project Manager (occupation code 2135)?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I didn't apply for a new visa. HR told me that since it's the same employer, I could just start the new role immediately after they updated their system. I've actually been working in the IT Project Manager role for about two weeks now. They said something about updating the SMS (Sponsorship Management System), but they didn't tell me I needed to apply for a new visa myself. Was I supposed to?

[root_agent]: Thank you for being honest about that, Raj. Based on the information you've provided, it appears there may be a compliance issue. Because your new role has a different occupation code (2135) than the one on your current visa (2137), you were required to apply for a new visa – specifically a 'Change of Employment' visa – *before* starting the IT Project Manager position, even though you remained with the same employer. 

Would you like me to explain the potential implications of this further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the potential implications. I'm quite concerned now as I thought everything was being handled properly by HR. What does this mean for my visa status and what should I do about it?

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, Raj. Unfortunately, working in a role with a different occupation code than the one listed on your visa is considered a breach of immigration rules. This could lead to several serious consequences.

Firstly, your visa could be **curtailed**, meaning it is cancelled before the original expiry date. Secondly, your employer's sponsorship license could be **revoked**, which would prevent them from sponsoring other workers in the future. And finally, if you overstay after your visa is curtailed, it could impact your ability to obtain future visas to enter or remain in the UK. 

Because you've been working in the new role for two weeks, it’s important to address this as soon as possible. I strongly recommend that you:

1. **Speak to your HR department immediately:** Explain your concerns and ask them to seek urgent legal advice from an immigration solicitor to rectify the situation.
2. **Consider seeking independent legal advice:** It's a good idea to get a second opinion from a qualified immigration solicitor to understand your options and the best course of action.

Do you understand what I've explained, and would you like me to reiterate any part of it?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand what you've explained and it's very concerning. I had no idea that changing roles within the same company could have such serious consequences. I'll speak to HR first thing tomorrow morning and explain what you've told me. I'll also look into getting independent legal advice from an immigration solicitor.

Just to be clear - even though it's the same employer and they've updated their sponsorship system, I still needed to apply for a new visa before starting the new role because the occupation code is different? And this means I'm technically working illegally right now?

[root_agent]: You are exactly right, Raj. Even with the same employer and updates to their sponsorship system (SMS), a change in occupation code *requires* a new visa application – in this case, a 'Change of Employment' application – *before* you begin working in the new role. 

And unfortunately, yes, technically you are currently working in breach of your visa conditions, and therefore considered to be working illegally. That’s why it’s so important to address this quickly with your employer and potentially an immigration solicitor. 

You’ve understood the situation perfectly. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really concerning to hear. I'll make this a priority first thing tomorrow morning. I had no idea the occupation code change was so significant - I thought since it was just a promotion with the same company, it would be fine.

Is there any specific documentation or forms I should mention to HR that need to be completed? And roughly how long does a 'Change of Employment' application typically take to process? I'm worried about my status in the meantime.

[root_agent]: It’s completely understandable that you weren’t aware of the significance of the occupation code change – many people are surprised by this rule! It’s good you’re taking action.

Regarding documentation, you should ask HR to prepare for a new Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) for the IT Project Manager role (occupation code 2135). This is the key document needed for your new visa application. You’ll also need to ensure they have all the necessary information to assign you a new CoS, including your salary and job details. The application itself will involve completing the standard Skilled Worker visa application form online.

As for processing times, it currently takes the Home Office roughly 8 weeks to process a 'Change of Employment' application, but this can vary. You can find the latest estimated processing times on the government website (I’m unable to provide a direct link).

In the meantime, while your application is being processed, your situation is technically in breach. It’s crucial to be upfront with the Home Office if you apply and explain the circumstances. Your employer’s cooperation and a strong legal case explaining the reasonable belief that a new visa wasn’t needed (even if incorrect) will be important.

Do you want to discuss any part of this in more detail? Perhaps you’d like me to summarise the key things you need to raise with HR tomorrow?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please summarize the key points I need to raise with HR tomorrow. I want to make sure I'm fully prepared when I talk to them. This is really stressful, and I want to fix my situation as soon as possible.

[root_agent]: Absolutely, Raj. Here's a summary of the key points to raise with HR tomorrow:

1. **Explain the issue:** Clearly state that you understand your current visa (occupation code 2137) does not cover your current role as IT Project Manager (occupation code 2135) and that you have been working in breach of your visa conditions for the past two weeks.
2. **Request a new Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):** Specifically ask them to assign you a new CoS for the IT Project Manager role (code 2135) as *soon as possible*. This is the first step towards applying for a new visa.
3. **'Change of Employment' application:** Explain that you need to apply for a 'Change of Employment' visa as a result of the occupation code change.
4. **Urgency & Legal Advice:** Emphasize the urgency of the situation and request that they seek legal advice from an immigration solicitor *immediately* to ensure they handle the process correctly and minimize potential negative consequences for both you and the company.
5. **Transparency with the Home Office:** Discuss the possibility of being transparent with the Home Office about the situation when you apply, explaining that you acted on their advice in good faith.
6. **Potential Impact:** Gently remind them of the potential consequences of non-compliance, including visa curtailment and revocation of their sponsorship license.

Essentially, you want to convey that you’ve become aware of an issue and need their full support to rectify it quickly and legally.

I understand this is stressful, Raj. You’re doing the right thing by addressing it proactively. Remember to remain calm and focused during the conversation with HR. Good luck, and please feel free to come back if you have any other questions.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for this comprehensive summary. I'll definitely use these points when speaking with HR tomorrow morning. It's very worrying to learn that I've been unknowingly working in breach of my visa conditions, but I'm grateful to have discovered this now rather than later. I'll make sure to emphasize the urgency of the situation and the need for proper legal advice. Thanks again for clarifying everything - I now understand that changing occupation codes requires a new visa application even within the same company.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Raj. I’m glad I could help clarify the situation and provide you with a clear plan of action. It’s certainly better to address this now. 

I wish you the best of luck with your conversation with HR tomorrow. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns as you navigate this process. I hope everything gets resolved quickly and smoothly for you.

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly advised me. According to the scenario, my situation should result in "COMPLIANCE BREACH / CURTAILMENT" since I'm technically working illegally in the new role by changing occupation codes without applying for a new visa. While the agent correctly identified this as a compliance issue and explained I needed a "Change of Employment" visa before starting the new role, they never explicitly stated the expected outcome of "COMPLIANCE BREACH / CURTAILMENT" that would occur if discovered. The agent advised on next steps but didn't clearly indicate that my current situation constitutes a clear breach that would lead to curtailment if discovered.
