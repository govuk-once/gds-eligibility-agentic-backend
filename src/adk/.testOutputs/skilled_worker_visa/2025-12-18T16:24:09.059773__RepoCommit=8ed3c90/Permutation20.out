[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Mary from Zimbabwe who's looking to understand her eligibility for a Health and Care visa for herself and her family.

Hi, i'm Mary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Mary, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for UK benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me what kind of job you have been offered in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Senior Care Worker and I've been offered a job at a residential care home in the UK. The care home is CQC registered and they're offering me £29,000 per year. I'm hoping to bring my husband and two children with me from Zimbabwe when I move.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mary. That's very helpful.

To confirm, is this job offer for the specific role of *Senior* Care Worker? (Occupation code 6136)





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The role is specifically for a Senior Care Worker, and I believe the occupation code is 6136 on their job offer letter.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Mary. 

Just to be absolutely clear, are you applying for the visa *with* your husband and two children as dependents?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I want to apply for the visa with my husband and our two children as dependents. We want to move to the UK together as a family.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Mary.

Given that you are applying as a Senior Care Worker (occupation code 6136), and you wish to bring your husband and children as dependents, I need to inform you of a recent change to the rules. 

As of March 2024, individuals in this occupation code are eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa, but are **not** permitted to bring dependents with them.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this to me in more detail. I wasn't aware of this rule. Does this mean I can get a visa but my family cannot come with me at all?

[root_agent]: You are right to ask for more detail, Mary, and I apologise for delivering potentially upsetting news. 

Yes, that is correct. Due to recent policy changes specifically affecting the Health and Care visa route, those applying as a Senior Care Worker (code 6136) are able to obtain the visa themselves, but applications for dependent visas for spouses and children are currently not being approved.

This means you *would* be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa, but your husband and children would not be granted visas to join you at this time. It's a difficult situation, and I understand this is likely not what you were hoping for.



Does this make sense? Would you like me to reiterate anything?

[evaluation_judge]: This is very upsetting news. I was planning to move as a family. So just to be absolutely clear - I would get the visa because I meet all the requirements with my job offer and salary, but my husband and children would not be allowed to come with me at all because I'm a Senior Care Worker? Is there any way around this or any other visa they could apply for?

[root_agent]: I completely understand your upset, Mary, and I'm very sorry to be the bearer of this news. It is a very difficult situation when family plans are affected.

You are absolutely correct in your understanding. You *would* be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa based on your job offer and salary, but your husband and children would not be granted dependent visas *specifically because* your occupation code is 6136 (Senior Care Worker).

Regarding other visa options, unfortunately, there isn’t a straightforward alternative visa route for your family to join you *as dependents* under these circumstances. They would need to explore independent visa routes, should they qualify – for example, a visa based on their own skills and employment, or as students. However, these would be separate applications with their own requirements.

I can provide you with a link to the general government website for all UK visas if you would like to explore options for your family independently: [https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration)

However, please note that I can only assess eligibility based on the Skilled Worker Visa and the information provided, and I am not qualified to give immigration advice. It might be beneficial to consult with an immigration lawyer to explore all potential options for your family.



Would you like me to clarify anything about the Skilled Worker Visa process for yourself, given this new information?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. Thank you for explaining. So the bottom line is that I would be eligible for the Health and Care visa on my own, but my family cannot join me as dependents due to new rules specific to care worker roles. I don't think I need any more information about the visa process for myself right now - I need to reconsider my plans given this situation.

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Mary. It is indeed the case that you are eligible for the Health and Care Visa individually, but your family cannot join you as dependents due to the recent changes affecting care worker roles.

I am truly sorry that this is the outcome, and I understand you needing time to reconsider your plans. It's a very difficult decision. 

If you do have any further questions about the Skilled Worker Visa itself at a later date, or if anything else comes to mind, please don't hesitate to reach out. I wish you all the best in navigating this challenging situation.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I (Mary) would be eligible for the Health and Care visa as a Senior Care Worker, but my dependents (husband and children) would be ineligible due to the specific ban on dependents for occupation codes 6136, effective March 2024. This matches the expected outcome of a split decision where my visa would be awarded but my family's visas would be refused.
