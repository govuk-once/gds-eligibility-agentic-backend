[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Dr. Jones and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Dr. Jones, it's lovely to meet you. To help me understand your eligibility, could you please tell me what kind of doctorate you hold? For example, is it a PhD, a professional doctorate, or something else?





[evaluation_judge]: I have a Doctor of Business Administration degree, a DBA, from a university in the United States. I completed it about 3 years ago. It was mostly coursework-based with some case studies, but no major research dissertation like you'd see in a traditional PhD program.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Dr. Jones. That's helpful.

To clarify, did your DBA involve a substantial, independently researched dissertation, or was it primarily focused on taught coursework and case studies?

[evaluation_judge]: It was primarily focused on taught coursework and case studies. There was a final capstone project, but it wasn't an extensive independent research dissertation like you'd see in a PhD program. It was more about applying business concepts to real-world scenarios through case analysis and developing practical solutions. The program was designed for working professionals looking to advance in business leadership roles rather than pursuing academic research.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that, Dr. Jones.

Have you had your DBA assessed by Ecctis to determine its comparability to UK qualifications? If so, do you have a statement of comparability from them?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I did have my degree assessed by Ecctis. They evaluated it as being equivalent to RQF Level 8 in the UK system, but they specifically noted in their assessment that it's classified as a "Professional Doctorate" rather than a "Research PhD." I have their statement of comparability with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Dr. Jones, and for letting me know about the Ecctis assessment. 

Could you please tell me the salary of the job you have been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Management Consultant with a salary of £38,000 per year. I'm hoping to move to the UK for this role.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Dr. Jones. Based on what you've told me – holding a Professional Doctorate (DBA) assessed by Ecctis as RQF Level 8 but *not* a Research PhD, and a job offer of £38,000 – I'm afraid you likely wouldn't currently meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa.

The rules require a higher salary, or tradeable points, to compensate for not having a traditional PhD. As your doctorate is a professional doctorate and not a research-based PhD, it doesn’t qualify for the tradeable points. Therefore, the salary of £38,000 is below the current threshold.



I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing to hear. So my professional doctorate doesn't count the same way as a research PhD would for immigration purposes, even though Ecctis rated it as Level 8? And because of that, my salary isn't high enough to qualify me for the visa?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Dr. Jones. Yes, that's correct. While Ecctis has assessed your DBA as equivalent to RQF Level 8 – demonstrating its academic level – the Skilled Worker Visa specifically requires a *research* PhD to unlock the tradeable points that can offset a lower salary. 

Because your doctorate is classified as a "Professional Doctorate" and not a "Research PhD" by Ecctis, those points aren’t available to you. Consequently, your salary of £38,000 doesn’t meet the minimum threshold without those points. The visa requirements differentiate between the two types of doctorates.

I'm very sorry that's the case. Would you like me to clarify any aspect of this further?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think you've made it quite clear. It seems my professional doctorate doesn't qualify in the same way as a research PhD would, even though they're both at the same academic level. Since I can't claim those points, my £38,000 salary falls short of the threshold. I appreciate your honesty about my situation. I might need to look into other visa options or see if the company can increase their salary offer.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Dr. Jones. You've summarized the situation accurately. Exploring other visa options or discussing a salary increase with the company are both sensible next steps. 

I wish you all the best in your endeavors. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for your help. I'll look into those options.

✓ The agent gave the correct outcome that I would be refused for the visa because my professional doctorate (DBA) doesn't qualify for the tradeable PhD points, and my £38,000 salary is below the threshold without those points. The agent accurately differentiated between a professional doctorate and a research PhD for immigration purposes.
