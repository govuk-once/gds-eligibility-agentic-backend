[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you test the agent by playing the role of Sarah who owns her consulting company and wants to understand visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in the Skilled Worker visa. I own my own company, Sarah Consulting Ltd, and I'd like to know if I can sponsor myself for a visa as the company director.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Sarah. It's good to know you're interested in the Skilled Worker visa and that you're a director of Sarah Consulting Ltd. 

To assess your eligibility, could you please tell me roughly what your annual salary is from Sarah Consulting Ltd? (Just the salary, *before* any other income like dividends are considered).

[evaluation_judge]: I currently pay myself a salary of £12,570 per year, which is the tax-free personal allowance. I then take £40,000 in dividends annually from the company. So my total income is £52,570, but my actual PAYE salary is £12,570.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Sarah. That's very helpful. 

Just to confirm, is the £12,570 salary you receive from Sarah Consulting Ltd paid to you through the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) system, meaning income tax and National Insurance contributions are deducted?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the £12,570 salary is paid through PAYE with the appropriate National Insurance contributions deducted. The rest of my income comes from dividends, which is the more tax-efficient way of paying myself as the owner of the company.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Sarah. 

To help me understand your situation fully, could you please confirm that you own 100% of Sarah Consulting Ltd?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I own 100% of Sarah Consulting Ltd. I'm the sole shareholder and director of the company.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Sarah.

Given that you own 100% of Sarah Consulting Ltd and are applying as a director, and your current PAYE salary is £12,570, I need to inform you that unfortunately, based on the current requirements for the Skilled Worker visa, your application would likely be refused. 

The Skilled Worker visa requires a minimum salary of £41,700. While your total income from salary and dividends is above this threshold, only the PAYE salary counts towards this requirement. Dividends are not considered.



Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this in more detail. I'm a bit confused because my total compensation is well above £41,700 when you include my dividends. Why don't dividends count towards the salary requirement?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Sarah. I'm happy to explain further.

The Skilled Worker visa rules specifically state that the £41,700 salary threshold (or the going rate for the specific job code, if higher) must be met through **genuine PAYE salary**. This means income that has had income tax and National Insurance contributions deducted. 

The reason dividends don't count is because they are considered a distribution of company *profits* to the owner, rather than *earnings* from employment. The Home Office views this differently to a standard salary, as it isn’t subject to the same tax and National Insurance contributions. They want to ensure individuals are genuinely employed and contributing to the UK tax system in the same way as other workers.

Essentially, even though your total income is over £41,700, only the £12,570 PAYE salary is considered for visa purposes. To be eligible, you would need to increase your PAYE salary to at least £41,700 and pay income tax and National Insurance on the full amount.



Does that make things a little clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make it clearer. So even though I own the company, if I want to sponsor myself for a Skilled Worker visa, I would need to pay myself a proper PAYE salary of at least £41,700 instead of the more tax-efficient salary/dividend split I'm currently using. Is there no way around this requirement?

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly, Sarah. Yes, to sponsor yourself under the Skilled Worker visa while owning the company, you would need to adjust your pay structure to a PAYE salary of at least £41,700.

Unfortunately, there isn’t a way around this requirement. The rules are very specific about needing a genuine PAYE salary to meet the financial threshold when the applicant is a majority shareholder or director of the sponsoring company. The dividend route cannot be used to fulfil the salary requirements for visa purposes.

It’s designed to prevent individuals from artificially meeting the salary threshold through dividends rather than through actual employment earnings.



Would you like me to reiterate anything, or are you happy with this explanation?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand now. So my options are either to pay myself a higher PAYE salary of at least £41,700 if I want to qualify for the Skilled Worker visa, or look into other visa options that might better suit my situation. This is quite different from what I was expecting, but I appreciate you clarifying it for me. Thank you for your help.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah. You've summarised the situation perfectly. Paying yourself a PAYE salary of at least £41,700 is the route to qualify under the Skilled Worker visa in your situation, or exploring alternative visa options would be the next step.

I'm glad I could clarify things for you, and I apologise that it wasn't the news you were hoping for. If you do decide to explore other visa routes and would like some initial guidance on where to find information, please don't hesitate to ask – although I am limited to information regarding the Skilled Worker visa.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that my application would be refused because only my PAYE salary of £12,570 counts toward the £41,700 threshold requirement, not my dividend income. The agent accurately explained that as a 100% owner-director, I must pay myself through PAYE to qualify, and dividends don't count for visa purposes.
