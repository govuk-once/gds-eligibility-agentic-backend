[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi John, it's lovely to meet you! I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a benefit.

To start, could you please tell me your age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 32 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, John. 

Have you recently completed a full-time course of study? (For example, a bachelor's degree, or a postgraduate qualification).

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't. I finished university some years ago. I'm actually looking to switch careers now and just received a job offer as a Trainee Chartered Accountant.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear about the job offer, John! Congratulations!

Are you currently working towards a recognised professional qualification, such as ACCA or ICAEW?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I'll be working towards my chartered accountancy qualification through ICAEW as part of this trainee position.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! And to clarify, is this training part of a formal, recognised professional development programme?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a formal training program with my employer where I'll work while studying for the ICAEW professional qualification. It's a structured program that will lead to me becoming a Chartered Accountant.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent, John. 

Could you please tell me what your offered annual salary is for this Trainee Chartered Accountant position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Finally, do you happen to know what the standard going rate is for a qualified Chartered Accountant in your role and location? If not, that's perfectly alright and I can try to find out, but any information you have would be helpful.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for a qualified Chartered Accountant is around £46,000, at least that's what I was told during the interview process.

[root_agent]: Thank you very much for providing all of that information, John.

Based on what you've told me – your age of 32, having completed your studies some time ago, undertaking a recognised professional qualification with ICAEW as a Trainee Chartered Accountant, an offered salary of £34,000 against a standard going rate of £46,000 – it appears you **qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa with the New Entrant salary discount.**

Your salary meets the requirement of being at least 70% of the standard going rate (£34,000 is greater than 70% of £46,000 which is £32,200). The fact you’re pursuing a professional qualification allows for this discount despite your age.



Does this information answer your question, and would you like me to explain anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly the information I was looking for! So even though I'm 32, I still qualify for the New Entrant discount because I'm working towards a professional qualification with ICAEW. And my salary of £34,000 is above the 70% threshold of the going rate. That's very helpful, thank you!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, John! I'm delighted I could help clarify things for you. 

You've understood perfectly - you *do* qualify for the New Entrant discount thanks to your ICAEW training, and your salary meets the necessary threshold. 

I wish you all the best with your new role as a Trainee Chartered Accountant! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thanks for the clear explanation and confirmation about my eligibility. I appreciate your help!

✓ The agent correctly determined I qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa with New Entrant status despite being over 26, because I'm working towards a recognized professional qualification (ICAEW). They confirmed my £34,000 salary exceeds the required 70% threshold (£32,200) of the standard going rate (£46,000).
