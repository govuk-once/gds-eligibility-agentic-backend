[evaluation_judge]: I'll now take on the role of Dr. Aari, a biological researcher from India with a PhD in Microbiology who is inquiring about visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Aari and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Aari, it's lovely to meet you! I'm root_agent, and I can help you with understanding your eligibility for different benefits. 

To start, could you please confirm if you have a valid sponsor for your visa application? This means a UK employer who is licensed to sponsor workers.





[evaluation_judge]: Hi, yes I do have a valid sponsor. I've received a job offer from a pharmaceutical company in the UK. They're registered to sponsor workers, and they've offered me a position as a Senior Lab Technician.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic to hear, Aari! Knowing you have a valid sponsor is a great first step.

Now, is the job you’ve been offered at the required skill level – which generally means it's at least RQF level 3 (equivalent to A-levels)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the position of Senior Lab Technician is definitely at the required skill level. I believe it's actually above RQF level 3 - it's a professional position in a pharmaceutical company that requires specialized knowledge and training.

[root_agent]: Excellent! That confirms another important requirement. 

Next, can you confirm that you meet the English language requirements for the visa? Do you have a recognized English language qualification, or have you previously studied in English?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. I completed my PhD thesis and dissertation entirely in English, and I've also taken the IELTS exam where I scored above the required threshold. My entire academic career at the doctoral level was conducted in English.

[root_agent]: That's wonderful, Aari! Having a PhD completed in English and a strong IELTS score definitely demonstrates you meet the English language requirements.

Now, I understand you have a PhD. Is your PhD in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics) subject?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my PhD is in Microbiology, which is definitely a STEM subject. I completed it in India three years ago, focusing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their mechanisms - research that's directly relevant to pharmaceutical development work.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Aari! Microbiology is indeed a STEM subject and sounds very relevant to your role.

To assess your eligibility further, could you please tell me what your offered annual salary is for the Senior Lab Technician position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £34,000 per year for the Senior Lab Technician position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Aari. That's helpful. 

Do you know what the standard going rate is for a Senior Lab Technician role in the UK? Knowing this will help me assess your salary against the requirements.

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for a Senior Lab Technician role is around £38,000 per year in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Aari. That's very helpful.

So, based on the information you’ve provided, your salary of £34,000 meets the Lower General Threshold of £33,400. Also, 80% of the standard going rate of £38,000 is £30,400, and your salary is higher than that.

Considering all the criteria – a valid sponsor, the job being at the required skill level, meeting English language requirements, holding a relevant STEM PhD, and meeting both the general salary threshold and the discounted going rate – it appears you **would be AWARDED** the Skilled Worker Visa.



Is there anything else I can help you with today, Aari?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for confirming that! It's a relief to know that my PhD in Microbiology helps with meeting the salary requirements. I was concerned about whether my £34,000 offer would be enough, so it's reassuring to hear that I qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa. I think that answers all my questions for now.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that Dr. Aari would be awarded the Skilled Worker Visa. The agent accurately assessed all relevant criteria: valid sponsor, appropriate skill level, English proficiency, relevant STEM PhD, salary meeting both the lower threshold (£33,400) and exceeding 80% of the going rate (£30,400).
