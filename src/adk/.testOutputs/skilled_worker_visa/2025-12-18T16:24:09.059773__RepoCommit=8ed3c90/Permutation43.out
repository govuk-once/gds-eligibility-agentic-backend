[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Diego and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Diego, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in exploring your eligibility for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in understanding about my work visa situation. I'm on a sponsored visa as a software developer, but I want to take an unpaid sabbatical to travel South America for about 2 months. My employer said they would hold my job, but I'm not sure how this affects my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Diego. That's very helpful. 

To understand your situation better, could you please confirm how long in weeks your planned sabbatical would be? (Approximately, if you don't know the exact number of weeks).

[evaluation_judge]: It would be approximately 8 weeks. I'm planning to travel through a few countries in South America, so I'd need about 2 months of time.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Diego. 

Just to be clear, is this period of leave you're planning considered statutory leave – meaning is it related to sick leave or maternity leave?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's not statutory leave. It's just an unpaid sabbatical for personal travel. My company has agreed to hold my job for me, but it's completely voluntary time off.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Diego. 

To clarify, would you be receiving any pay during these 8 weeks of leave, even partial pay?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I won't be receiving any pay at all during the 8 weeks. It's completely unpaid leave.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Diego.

Just so I fully understand, are you aware of any exceptions to the rules regarding unpaid leave that might apply to your situation? For example, are there any specific agreements with your sponsor beyond simply holding your job?

[evaluation_judge]: No, there aren't any special agreements or exceptions. My employer has just agreed to hold my position for me when I return, but there's nothing formal beyond that. It's just a standard unpaid sabbatical that they've approved.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Diego.

Based on what you've told me, and the rules around the Skilled Worker visa, taking 8 weeks of unpaid leave could unfortunately lead to your sponsorship being withdrawn. The rules state that sponsorship stops if a worker is absent from work without pay for more than 4 weeks in a calendar year, unless it's for statutory leave. 

Do you understand what I've explained so far?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. So you're saying that because I want to take 8 weeks of unpaid leave, which is more than the 4-week limit, my sponsorship could be withdrawn? That's concerning. What exactly would happen in that case?

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly, Diego. Yes, because your planned leave exceeds the 4-week limit for unpaid leave, your sponsorship is at risk of being withdrawn.

If your sponsorship is withdrawn, your visa would be curtailed. This means it would be shortened, giving you 60 days to either leave the UK or find a new sponsor for a Skilled Worker visa. Essentially, you would need to find a new employer willing to sponsor you within those 60 days if you want to remain in the UK legally.

Would you like me to explain any part of that in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very concerning. I had no idea about this rule. So just to be completely clear - if I take this 8-week unpaid sabbatical that my company approved, they would legally have to withdraw their sponsorship of my visa, and then I'd only have 60 days to either leave the UK or find a new sponsor? Is there any way around this, like splitting up the leave or taking some of it as paid leave instead?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to seek clarification, Diego, and it’s good you’re exploring options. Yes, your understanding is correct – if you take the 8-week unpaid sabbatical, your employer would be legally obligated to withdraw their sponsorship, and you’d have 60 days to leave the UK or find a new sponsor.

Regarding ways around this, you’ve hit on some potential solutions. Splitting up the leave so that you don't exceed 4 weeks of *unpaid* leave in a calendar year would be one option. For example, you could take two periods of 2 weeks unpaid leave, with time worked in between.

Alternatively, if possible, negotiating with your employer to take some of the sabbatical as annual leave (paid leave) would also help you stay within the 4-week unpaid limit.

Have you discussed these possibilities with your employer yet? It would be best to explore these options with them as soon as possible.

[evaluation_judge]: I haven't discussed these options yet since I just learned about this rule. I'll definitely need to go back to my employer and see if we can either split the sabbatical with work periods in between, or convert some of it to paid annual leave. This is really helpful information - I could have accidentally lost my visa status if I'd gone ahead with the original plan. Thank you for explaining the situation to me. I'll talk to my HR department right away about restructuring my leave to stay within the 4-week unpaid limit.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Diego! I'm glad I could help clarify the situation and prevent a potentially difficult outcome. It's excellent that you plan to discuss these options with your HR department – proactive communication is key. 

I'm happy to have been of assistance. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Wishing you the best of luck in working this out with your employer and enjoying your travels to South America!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for your help! I appreciate it.

✓ The agent correctly advised that my sponsorship would be withdrawn if I took an 8-week unpaid sabbatical, as it exceeds the 4-week limit for unpaid absence in a calendar year. They accurately explained the consequences (60-day visa curtailment) and suggested appropriate alternatives to avoid losing my sponsorship.
