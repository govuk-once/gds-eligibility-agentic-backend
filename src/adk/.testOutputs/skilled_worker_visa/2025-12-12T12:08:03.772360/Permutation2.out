[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Liam, a 23-year-old recent Canadian graduate from a UK university who's seeking information about visa eligibility for a job offer as a Junior Financial Analyst.

I'll interact with the agent under test until they provide an eligibility determination, then evaluate whether their conclusion matches the expected outcome of "AWARDED" based on the provided scenario.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s start. To help me assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa, could you please confirm if there is a valid sponsor for this job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a valid sponsor for my job offer. I recently graduated from university in the UK with my Bachelor's degree, and I've been offered a position as a Junior Financial Analyst with a salary of £35,000. I'm really hoping I can stay in the UK to work after finishing my studies.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now, let’s talk about the job itself. Can you tell me what skill level this Junior Financial Analyst role falls under?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe it's a skilled position that meets the required skill level for the visa. It's a Junior Financial Analyst role that requires my degree in finance. I just finished my Bachelor's degree here in the UK on my Student Visa, and now this company wants to hire me.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And to clarify, do you feel you meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I definitely meet the English language requirements. I just completed my entire Bachelor's degree in the UK, and all the courses were taught in English. I'm originally from Canada, so English is my first language anyway. I'm pretty confident about that part of the application.

[root_agent]: Alright. Now, let’s consider your situation as a recent graduate. Are you currently under 26 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm 23 years old. I just finished my Bachelor's degree here in the UK on a Student Visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And to confirm, you’re switching from a Student Visa to a Skilled Worker Visa, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I've been on a Student Visa while completing my degree, and now I want to switch to a Skilled Worker Visa for this job offer as a Junior Financial Analyst.

[root_agent]: Okay. Let’s move on to the salary. What is the annual salary being offered for the Junior Financial Analyst position?

[evaluation_judge]: The company has offered me £35,000 per year for the Junior Financial Analyst position.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, let’s find out the standard going rate for this type of role. Could you tell me what the standard going rate for a Junior Financial Analyst is currently?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for this Junior Financial Analyst role is £42,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, £42,000 per year. And to confirm, 70% of that standard going rate is £29,400, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. 70% of the standard going rate (£42,000) would be £29,400.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Finally, could you confirm that your annual salary of £35,000 is above the lower general threshold of £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £35,000 is above the lower general threshold of £33,400.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for providing all of that information. Based on your age (23), your recent graduation, switching from a Student Visa, your salary of £35,000 which is above £33,400, and the standard going rate of £42,000 where your salary is more than 70% of that rate, I’m pleased to confirm that you are eligible for the New Entrant route of the Skilled Worker Visa.

**AWARDED.**

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that Liam is eligible for the visa and gave the correct outcome of "AWARDED." They accurately identified him as qualifying for the New Entrant route based on his age (under 26), recent graduation, and that his salary of £35,000 meets both requirements of being above £33,400 and above 70% of the going rate.
