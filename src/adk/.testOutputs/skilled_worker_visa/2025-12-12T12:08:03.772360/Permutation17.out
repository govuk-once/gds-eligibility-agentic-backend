[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Yuki, a Skilled Worker visa holder working as a Graphic Designer who's interested in taking on a weekend bartending job. I'll interact with the agent until they provide an eligibility determination, then evaluate if their outcome matches the expected result.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s start. Hello Yuki, thank you for speaking with me today. To help me understand your situation, could you tell me what your current job as a Graphic Designer involves?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! I'm working full-time as a Graphic Designer for a marketing agency in London. I create visual concepts for their clients' marketing campaigns, design logos, work on website layouts, and produce various digital and print materials. I've been with them for about a year now on my Skilled Worker visa. I'm interested in picking up a weekend bartending job at a local pub to earn some extra money - they're offering around 10 hours per week, mostly on Friday and Saturday evenings.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Yuki. To confirm, you’re currently employed as a Graphic Designer for a marketing agency in London, and you’ve held your Skilled Worker visa for approximately a year.

Now, regarding the bartending job you’re considering – could you please tell me what the advertised salary for that position is?

[evaluation_judge]: The bartending position pays £12 per hour, so for the 10 hours per week, I'd be making about £120 weekly. It's just a local pub near my flat that needs weekend help. I thought it would be a nice way to make some extra money and meet people in the neighborhood since my design job is mostly remote. I'd still be doing my full-time graphic design job during the week - this would just be something additional on weekends.

[root_agent]: Okay, Yuki. Thank you for providing that information.

Let’s talk about the job itself. Could you tell me what specific tasks and duties you would be performing as a bartender at the pub?

[evaluation_judge]: As a bartender, I would be taking drink orders, mixing cocktails, pouring beers, serving customers, handling cash and card payments, keeping the bar area clean, restocking supplies, and occasionally helping with simple food orders. It's a pretty standard bartending role - nothing specialized. The pub manager mentioned they're particularly busy on weekend evenings, which is why they need the extra help for those specific shifts. I'd be working alongside other bartenders during those busy periods.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Yuki. That’s very helpful to understand the role.

Now, let’s focus on the job’s relationship to your primary role as a Graphic Designer. Could you tell me what occupation code your Graphic Designer role falls under? You can usually find this information on your Skilled Worker visa endorsement letter or online via the Home Office website.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe my Graphic Designer role falls under the occupation code 3421 "Graphic designers" on my Skilled Worker visa. That's what was on my Certificate of Sponsorship when my company sponsored me. I know the bartending job would be completely different - it has nothing to do with design work. It would just be a completely separate part-time job to earn some extra income on weekends.

[root_agent]: Okay, Yuki. Thank you for confirming that your Graphic Designer role is classified as 3421 “Graphic designers”.

Let's move on to the Immigration Salary List. Could you confirm if the £12 per hour you mentioned for the bartending job is above the minimum salary threshold for shortage occupations listed on the Immigration Salary List? You can view the list here: [https://www.gov.uk/immigration-salary-list](https://www.gov.uk/immigration-salary-list)

[evaluation_judge]: I just checked the Immigration Salary List, and bartending doesn't appear to be on there at all. It's not listed as a shortage occupation. The £12 per hour is just the standard rate they're offering - it's not related to any special immigration category or shortage occupation list. I think bartending would fall under a completely different occupation code than my current graphic design work.

[root_agent]: Thank you for checking that, Yuki.

So, to summarise: you’re currently employed as a Graphic Designer (occupation code 3421), you’re considering a part-time bartending job paying £12 per hour, and bartending is not listed as a shortage occupation.

Based on this information, it appears this scenario is **ILLEGAL WORK**. Do you have any questions about this assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: So you're saying I can't take the bartending job? That's disappointing. Can you explain why exactly? Is it because it's not related to graphic design? I thought since it was just a few hours on weekends it might be okay.

[root_agent]: You’re right to be disappointed, Yuki. Let me explain. While taking a small part-time job isn’t automatically prohibited, your Skilled Worker visa has specific conditions. One of those conditions is that you can only work in a role that’s *directly* related to your endorsed occupation – in this case, Graphic Design.

Because the bartending job is completely different from your Graphic Designer role, and it's not on the Immigration Salary List as a shortage occupation, it doesn’t meet the criteria for permissible supplementary work under your visa.

Essentially, your visa allows you to undertake additional work *only* if it aligns with your main occupation, or if it's a role identified as a shortage occupation.

Do you understand why this is the case?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. So if I wanted some extra work, I would need to find something in graphic design, like maybe freelance design projects? Or something that's specifically on the shortage occupation list? And in either case, I need to keep it under 20 hours per week as supplementary work, right?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Yuki. You’ve grasped the key points perfectly.

Yes, if you were seeking supplementary work, you would need to find a role directly related to Graphic Design, either through a full-time position or suitable freelance projects. Alternatively, you could explore roles listed on the Immigration Salary List as shortage occupations, provided they meet the 20-hour per week limit.

Is there anything else you’d like to explore regarding your visa conditions or supplementary work options?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that the bartending job would be ILLEGAL WORK under Yuki's Skilled Worker visa. They accurately explained that supplementary work must either be in the same occupation code as the main job (graphic design) or be on the Immigration Salary List (shortage occupations), which bartending is not. They also confirmed that permitted supplementary work would need to be under 20 hours per week.
