[evaluation_judge]: I'll help test the agent by role-playing as Mary, a care worker from Zimbabwe who wants to bring her family to the UK. I'll engage with the agent until they provide an eligibility outcome, then assess if their conclusion matches the expected outcome.

[root_agent]: Hello Mary, thank you for reaching out. I understand you’re looking into a Skilled Worker Visa. To help me assess your situation, could you tell me a little about your current occupation? Specifically, what specific tasks do you perform as a care worker?

[evaluation_judge]: I work as a Senior Care Worker at a residential home in Zimbabwe. I've been offered a job at a CQC registered care home in the UK. My responsibilities include administering medication, creating and monitoring care plans, supervising junior care staff, providing personal care to elderly residents, and coordinating with healthcare professionals like nurses and doctors. I've been working in this field for 5 years now. The UK position offers a salary of £29,000. I'm hoping to move with my husband and two children - they're 8 and 12 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that detailed information, Mary. It sounds like you have valuable experience. Just to confirm, you’re currently working as a Senior Care Worker in Zimbabwe, and you’ve been offered a Senior Care Worker position in the UK, correct?

And you mentioned a salary of £29,000 for this role. To help me check this against the requirements, could you tell me what occupation code your role falls under – is it 6135 or 6136?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm currently a Senior Care Worker in Zimbabwe and I've been offered the same role at a UK care home. My new employer confirmed that my role falls under occupation code 6136 (Senior Care Workers). The salary they're offering is £29,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mary. I appreciate the clarification. Just one more question for now – could you confirm that the care home you’ll be working for is CQC registered?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've checked with my employer and they confirmed that the care home is definitely CQC registered in the UK.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s excellent to hear. Now, let’s move on to considering your family. You mentioned you’d like to bring your husband and two children with you.

Could you tell me the ages of your husband and children, please?

[evaluation_judge]: My husband is 36 years old. My daughter is 12 years old and my son is 8 years old. We're all currently living together in Zimbabwe and hope to move to the UK as a family when I take this new position.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mary. I’m processing this now…

Considering your role as a Senior Care Worker (occupation code 6136), your salary of £29,000, and the fact that the care home is CQC registered, I can tell you that you *are* eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa.

However, due to the specific rules in place as of March 2024, dependents – including your husband and children – would not be eligible for dependent visas alongside your application.

Therefore, the outcome is a **SPLIT DECISION**. Your Skilled Worker Visa will be **AWARDED**, but your family’s dependent visas will be **REFUSED**.

Would you like me to explain the reasoning behind this decision in more detail, or would you like to explore any possible options for your family’s future move to the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing news about my family. Could you please explain why they wouldn't be eligible? I thought dependents were normally allowed with Skilled Worker visas. Is this specific to my job role?

[root_agent]: You’re right to be surprised, Mary, and it’s understandable to feel disappointed. Let me clarify the specific rules.

As I mentioned earlier, we’re looking at a specific restriction for applicants in occupation codes 6135 (Care Workers) and 6136 (Senior Care Workers). This rule came into effect on March 2024.

Essentially, individuals in these roles are not permitted to bring dependents (partners or children) to the UK. It’s not dependent on the job role itself, but rather the listed occupation codes.

You can find more details about this specific rule on the UK government website here: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa) – specifically, on the section about prohibited occupations.

Does that explanation help to clarify why your family wouldn’t be eligible for dependent visas alongside your Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand now. It's a specific restriction for my occupation code that came into effect in March 2024. That makes sense, even though it's disappointing news. It means I would need to decide whether to come to the UK alone without my husband and children, or look for a different type of job that might allow them to join me. Thank you for explaining this clearly.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Mary. I’m glad I could clarify things for you. It’s a difficult situation, and I understand your concerns about your family. 

If you’d like to explore alternative job options that might be suitable for your husband and children, I can certainly help you research roles and qualifications that might be a better fit. Or, if you’d like to focus on your own visa application, I can assist with that too. 

Would you like me to explore any of those options with you now?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified the split decision outcome - that Mary would be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa as a Senior Care Worker (code 6136) with a £29,000 salary, but her husband and children would not be eligible as dependents due to the specific restriction for care worker occupation codes implemented in March 2024. The agent provided accurate information without any errors.
