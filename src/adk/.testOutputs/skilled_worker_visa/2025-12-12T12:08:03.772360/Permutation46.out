[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Yara, a person who previously studied in the UK on a Student Visa and is now applying for a Skilled Worker visa from abroad. I'll interact with the agent to see if they correctly determine my eligibility regarding my expired SELT test.

[root_agent]: Okay, Yara, it’s lovely to speak with you today. Let’s start with the basics. Could you confirm your full name for me, please?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello! My name is Yara Ahmadi. I'm applying for a Skilled Worker visa to come back to the UK. I previously studied there about 4 years ago.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Yara. It’s good to know that you’re looking to return to the UK. To help me understand your situation, could you tell me what type of visa you held when you were previously in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I was on a Student Visa when I was in the UK before. I completed my degree there about 4 years ago.

[root_agent]: Okay, a Student Visa. And you mentioned you took a Secure English Language Test (SELT) while you were studying. Could you confirm that you passed a SELT at the time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I passed a B1 level SELT exam for my Student Visa 4 years ago.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Yara. Now, if I understand correctly, you’re applying for a Skilled Worker visa from outside the UK, and you’re providing a reference number for an SELT you took 4 years ago? Is that accurate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I'm applying for a Skilled Worker visa from abroad, and I'm planning to use the SELT reference number from the test I passed 4 years ago for my previous Student Visa application.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Just to be absolutely certain, could you tell me when you took the SELT exam? Specifically, what year did you pass it?

[evaluation_judge]: I took and passed the SELT exam in 2020, so it was 4 years ago.

[root_agent]: Right, you took the SELT in 2020. And the reference number you’re providing is linked to that exam. Just one more quick question – can you confirm that the exam you took was at a B1 level?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the SELT exam I took and passed in 2020 was at B1 level.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Yara. Let me just check something quickly. Is the test expired?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the test is expired now. SELT tests are usually valid for 2 years, and mine was from 4 years ago.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that it’s expired. Now, could you tell me if you used that same SELT for a previous successful UK visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I used this SELT for my Student Visa application 4 years ago, which was approved. I successfully completed my studies in the UK using that visa.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for that information, Yara. Just one final question: Was the level of the SELT you took B1?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the SELT I took was at B1 level.

[root_agent]: Okay, Yara. Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you’ve provided – that the SELT was expired, but used in a previous successful application, and that it was a B1 level test – I’m pleased to inform you that you are eligible to proceed with your Skilled Worker visa application using this reference number. 

**AWARDED.** The “previous use” rule allows you to bypass the expiry date.

Do you have any questions about this, or would you like me to explain anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm eligible for the Skilled Worker visa despite my expired SELT test, correctly applying the "previous use" rule that allows me to use my expired B1 test from my successful Student visa application.
