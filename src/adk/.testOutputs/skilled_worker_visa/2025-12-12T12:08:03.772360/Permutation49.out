[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Tom, a banker who has just experienced a salary reduction due to an economic downturn. I'll engage with the agent to see if they correctly identify that my sponsorship must be terminated since my new salary falls below the required threshold.

[root_agent]: Okay Tom, I understand. Let’s start with the basics. Can you confirm that you are currently still employed by the bank?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm still employed by the bank. They've just announced company-wide salary cuts due to the economic downturn, and my salary has been reduced by 20%.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Tom. To help me understand the situation fully, could you tell me what your original salary was before the reduction?

[evaluation_judge]: My original salary was £50,000 before the reduction. Now with the 20% cut, it's been reduced to £40,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tom. And just to be clear, this salary reduction of 20% happened *after* your Skilled Worker Visa was initially granted, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I was initially sponsored with a salary of £50,000 when my visa was granted. This reduction to £40,000 is happening now, after my visa was already approved and I've been working here.

[root_agent]: Okay, Tom. Thank you for clarifying. Now, could you tell me what your visa option is? Is it Option A, Option B, or another option?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe I'm on Option A for my Skilled Worker Visa. The bank sponsored me under that option when I first got my visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tom. I appreciate that information. Just to confirm, Option A has a salary threshold of £41,700, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The threshold for Option A is £41,700.

[root_agent]: Okay, Tom. Thank you. Based on the information you’ve provided – that your salary has been reduced to £40,000 *after* your visa was granted under Option A, with a threshold of £41,700 – it appears your sponsorship would need to be terminated. Is that an accurate understanding?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's what I understood might be the case, but I wanted to confirm. So you're saying that because my salary has dropped below the Option A threshold of £41,700, my sponsorship can't continue? What does this mean for my visa status?

[root_agent]: Yes, Tom, that’s correct. Because your salary has fallen below the £41,700 threshold for Option A of your Skilled Worker Visa, your employer is unable to continue sponsoring you. This would likely result in the termination of your visa.

Do you want me to elaborate on what steps your employer would need to take to address this situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please explain what options I have now? Does my employer need to either restore my salary to at least £41,700 or terminate my employment? I'm worried about my immigration status.

[root_agent]: Okay, Tom, let’s address your concerns. You’ve correctly identified the primary options. According to the Skilled Worker Visa rules, if your salary drops below the threshold after sponsorship, your employer must either:

1.  **Maintain your salary at or above the threshold:** They would need to find a way to ensure your salary remains at £41,700 or higher.
2.  **Terminate your sponsorship:** If they cannot meet the salary requirement, they must end your sponsorship.

This would likely result in the end of your current visa and you would need to explore other visa options or leave the UK.

Are you wanting me to outline the potential steps your employer might take to try and avoid sponsorship termination, or would you like me to focus on what *you* might do in this situation regarding your visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you tell me what my options are personally? If my employer decides not to exempt me from the salary cut, how long would I have to find another sponsor or leave the UK? And are there any other visa options I could consider?

[root_agent]: Okay, Tom, let’s look at your personal options. If your employer decides not to exempt you from the salary cut, you would typically have 30 days to either find a new sponsor or cease your employment. After 30 days, your visa would likely lapse.

Regarding other visa options, it’s important to note that your specific circumstances will determine what's possible. Here are a few potential routes, but you’d need to assess your eligibility for each:

*   **Innovator Founder Visa:** If you have a viable business idea, this route could be an option.
*   **Global Talent Visa:** If you’re recognized in a ‘world leading’ or ‘highest potential’ global field, this could be suitable.
*   **Investor Visa:** If you meet the financial investment requirements, this could be an option.

However, these options often require significant upfront investment or specific qualifications. 

It’s strongly recommended that you seek advice from an immigration lawyer to discuss your individual situation and explore the best course of action. Would you like me to provide you with some resources for finding an immigration lawyer?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly stated I would have 30 days after my sponsorship ends before my visa lapses. For Skilled Worker visas, the correct timeframe is 60 days from when the Home Office is notified of sponsorship termination. This is a significant error that could affect my planning.
