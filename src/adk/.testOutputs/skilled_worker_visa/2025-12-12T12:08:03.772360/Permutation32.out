[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Ali, a PhD student in Engineering who's exploring whether he can switch to a Skilled Worker visa before graduating. I'll interact with the agent and evaluate whether they provide the correct outcome according to the scenario details.

I'll need to see if the agent correctly identifies that as a PhD student who has completed at least 24 months of study (I'm in Year 3 of a 4-year program), I should be eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa before graduation, as this is a special concession for PhD students.

Once the conversation concludes, I'll evaluate whether the agent's guidance matches the expected outcome of "AWARDED" and provide my assessment with justification.

I'm ready to begin the role-play whenever the agent is introduced.

[root_agent]: Hello Ali, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me how long you’ve been studying for your PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been studying for my PhD in Engineering for just over 3 years now. I'm in the third year of a 4-year program at the university.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And to clarify, you’re still currently enrolled in the PhD program, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm still enrolled and working on my PhD. I haven't graduated yet - I still have about a year left before completion.

[root_agent]: Alright. Just to confirm, you’re a PhD student, and you’re currently in your third year of a four-year program, meaning you haven’t yet completed your studies?

[evaluation_judge]: That's correct. I'm in my third year of the four-year PhD program, so I haven't completed my studies yet. I'm still working on my research and thesis.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Now, could you tell me approximately how many months you’ve been actively engaged in your PhD research – essentially, how many months have you been working on your thesis and research?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been actively engaged in my PhD research for about 38 months now. I started my program in September 2021, so it's been just over 3 years of continuous study and research work.

[root_agent]: Okay, 38 months. And just to be absolutely clear, you haven’t yet received your PhD degree, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right, I haven't received my PhD degree yet. I'm still in the process of completing my research and writing my thesis. I won't graduate until next year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Let me check something for you. Considering you’ve been studying for your PhD for approximately 38 months, and you’re still enrolled, are you eligible for a Skilled Worker visa before graduation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly what I'm wondering about. I've been offered a job as an Engineering Consultant, and I'd like to know if I can switch from my student visa to a Skilled Worker visa before I actually graduate with my PhD.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. According to the Skilled Worker visa criteria, PhD students can switch to this visa before graduating if they’ve completed at least 24 months of their PhD. Given that you’ve been studying for approximately 38 months, you meet that requirement.

Therefore, I believe you *are* eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa before graduating.

Would you like me to explain that further, or would you like me to explore any other aspects of the Skilled Worker visa process?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! So I can actually switch to the Skilled Worker visa now even though I haven't completed my PhD yet? And this is specifically because I've already completed more than 24 months of my program?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct. The Skilled Worker visa route offers a concession for PhD students who have completed at least 24 months of their course. Because you’ve completed more than 24 months, you are eligible to apply for a Skilled Worker visa before graduating.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or perhaps about the next steps in the application process?

[evaluation_judge]: That's perfect! No further questions for now. I'll get started on my application. Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible to switch to the Skilled Worker visa before completing my PhD.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Ali! I’m glad I could help. Best of luck with your application. If you have any further questions down the line, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that as a PhD student who has completed more than 24 months of study (38 months in this case), I am eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa before graduation, which matches the expected "AWARDED" outcome.
