[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Ken, a marketing lead applying for a UK visa with sponsorship from a large multinational bank, where the HR admin incorrectly categorized the bank as a "small" company when paying the Immigration Skills Charge.

I'll interact with the agent under test to see if they correctly identify that this situation would lead to an invalid/refused application due to the underpayment of the Immigration Skills Charge.

Let me know when the agent is ready for me to begin the conversation.

[root_agent]: Okay, I’m ready when you are. Let’s begin.

First, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’re applying for? Specifically, what is your job title and what are the main responsibilities of your role?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello there. I'm Ken, and I've been offered a position as a Marketing Lead at a large multinational bank here in the UK. I'll be responsible for developing marketing strategies, managing campaigns, overseeing a team of marketing specialists, and coordinating with other departments to ensure brand consistency. I'm excited about the opportunity, but I'm a bit concerned about my visa application. My HR contact mentioned they've already assigned my Certificate of Sponsorship, but I heard there might be an issue with how they processed some of the payments.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Ken. That sounds like a fantastic opportunity!

To help me understand the situation fully, could you tell me the name of the bank you’re working for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm going to be working for Global Financial Partners, they're quite a large multinational bank with headquarters in London and offices across several countries. They employ over 10,000 people worldwide with around 3,000 staff in the UK. I was recruited directly by their talent acquisition team.

[root_agent]: Okay, Global Financial Partners – that’s helpful to know.

Now, regarding the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) you mentioned, can you confirm whether the HR team paid the Immigration Skills Charge on your behalf?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I was told by my HR contact that they've paid the Immigration Skills Charge when they assigned my Certificate of Sponsorship. However, they mentioned something that concerned me. Apparently, to save on costs, they categorized the bank as a "small" company in the sponsorship system, so they only paid £364 per year instead of the £1,000 per year that I believe large companies are supposed to pay. They didn't seem to think it was a big issue, but I'm worried this might affect my application. Is this something I should be concerned about?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Ken. That’s a really important detail.

Based on what you’ve told me – that the bank categorized themselves as a “small” company to pay £364 instead of the correct £1,000 for the Immigration Skills Charge – it does appear there’s a potential problem with the sponsorship validity. 

Could you confirm whether you’ve received a Certificate of Sponsorship for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have received my Certificate of Sponsorship. The HR department sent me the reference number and confirmation that they've assigned it to me. They mentioned all the paperwork is in order and that I should proceed with my visa application. But given what I just explained about how they paid the lower Immigration Skills Charge rate, I'm wondering if this will affect the validity of my application.

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, Ken. Thank you for confirming you’ve received the CoS.

Given that the sponsor is paying a reduced rate for the Immigration Skills Charge, it’s highly likely that the sponsorship will be invalid. The correct rate is £1,000 per year.

To be absolutely clear, would you agree that the bank incorrectly categorized themselves as a “small” company to pay a lower fee for the Immigration Skills Charge?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. The HR person specifically mentioned they categorized the bank as a "small" company when paying the Immigration Skills Charge, even though Global Financial Partners is definitely a large multinational with thousands of employees. They openly admitted they did this to save money by paying £364 per year instead of the £1,000 per year rate that should apply to a company of their size. They didn't seem to think it would be a problem, but I'm getting worried now.

[root_agent]: Okay, Ken. Thank you for confirming that detail.

Based on this information – the bank categorizing themselves as a “small” company to pay a reduced rate for the Immigration Skills Charge – the sponsorship is almost certainly invalid. The Immigration Skills Charge is a mandatory payment, and failure to pay the correct amount will result in the CoS being invalid.

I’m afraid I have to conclude that your visa application would likely be **INVALID / REFUSED.**

Would you like me to explain why this is the likely outcome, or would you like me to outline what steps the sponsor would typically need to take to resolve this issue?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please do explain why this would lead to my application being refused and what could potentially happen next.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s break down why this situation leads to an invalid application and what typically happens next.

**Why it leads to an Invalid Application:**

The Immigration Skills Charge is a legal requirement for sponsors assigning Certificates of Sponsorship (CoS). The amount owed depends on the size of the sponsoring company. Paying a lower amount – like £364 instead of £1,000 – demonstrates a failure to comply with immigration regulations. The Home Office takes this very seriously. Because the charge wasn’t paid correctly, the CoS becomes invalid. This means the visa application cannot proceed.

**What Usually Happens Next:**

1.  **Home Office Contact:** The Home Office will usually contact the sponsor (Global Financial Partners) to request a “top-up” payment for the outstanding Immigration Skills Charge – in this case, the difference between £364 and £1,000, totaling £636.

2.  **Top-Up Payment Deadline:** The sponsor has 10 working days to make this top-up payment.

3.  **Refusal if No Payment:** If the sponsor does not pay the top-up payment within 10 working days, the visa application will be refused. The refusal letter will state that the sponsorship is invalid due to the incorrect Immigration Skills Charge.

4.  **Potential for Appeal (Rare):** In very rare circumstances, the sponsor might appeal the refusal, but this is uncommon.

Essentially, the sponsorship needs to be corrected with the correct payment before the visa application can be reconsidered.

Do you have any further questions about this process, Ken?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining that so clearly. I'll need to speak with the HR department at Global Financial Partners right away and let them know they need to correct this issue by paying the full amount required for a large company. I understand now that if they don't make this top-up payment within the 10 working day window after being contacted by the Home Office, my visa application will be refused.

This is definitely concerning, as it seems the bank's attempt to save money could jeopardize my entire employment opportunity. I appreciate your help in clarifying this situation.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that the visa application would be invalid/refused due to the sponsor underpaying the Immigration Skills Charge by incorrectly categorizing themselves as a small company. They accurately explained that the Home Office would contact the sponsor for a top-up payment and that failure to pay within 10 working days would result in refusal, which matches the expected outcome.
