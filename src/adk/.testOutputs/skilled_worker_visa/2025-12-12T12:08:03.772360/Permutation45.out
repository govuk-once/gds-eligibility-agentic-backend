[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Hans, a German engineer with a Master's degree from a German university that was taught entirely in English. I'll engage with the agent about UK visa eligibility, focusing on the English language requirement.

[root_agent]: Hello Hans, it’s nice to speak with you. I understand you’re looking into visa options.

To start, could you tell me the name of the university where you earned your Master’s degree?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello! Yes, I'm interested in moving to the UK for work. I obtained my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich. It was a great program - completely taught in English, which was very convenient for international students like myself.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Hans. That’s very helpful to know.

To clarify, could you confirm that the Technical University of Munich is a university located in the United Kingdom?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the Technical University of Munich is not in the United Kingdom. It's in Munich, Germany. It's one of Germany's leading technical universities. My entire Master's program was taught in English though, which is quite common for technical and engineering programs in Germany these days.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that.

Just to be completely sure, could you tell me whether your degree was awarded by a UK university?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my degree was not awarded by a UK university. It was awarded by the Technical University of Munich, which is a German university. I received my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from there after completing the full program in Germany.

[root_agent]: I understand.

Since your degree wasn’t awarded by a UK university, and it was taught entirely in English, does the university you attended provide Ecctis verification for English Language Proficiency?

[evaluation_judge]: The university gave me a letter confirming that my entire program was taught in English. But I haven't obtained any Ecctis verification for English Language Proficiency. I wasn't aware I needed that. The university letter states clearly that all coursework, exams, and my thesis were completed in English. Is this Ecctis verification something I would need to get separately?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Just to double-check, do you have any evidence, such as a reference number or confirmation, from the university regarding the English language proficiency of your course?

[evaluation_judge]: I have an official letter from the Technical University of Munich on university letterhead. It states that my Master's program in Mechanical Engineering was taught 100% in English, including all lectures, coursework, exams, and my thesis. The letter is signed by the head of the department. But I don't have any special reference number or Ecctis confirmation - just the university's official letter confirming the language of instruction was English.

[root_agent]: Okay, Hans. Thank you for providing that information.

Based on the information you’ve given me, and the current requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa, the Home Office doesn't accept university letters directly confirming that a degree was taught in English. They require verification from Ecctis. 

Would you be interested in learning more about the Ecctis verification process?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please tell me more about this Ecctis verification process. I wasn't aware that my university letter wouldn't be sufficient. What exactly do I need from Ecctis, and how do I go about getting it?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Hans. Let’s talk about Ecctis.

Ecctis is a service that verifies the comparability of qualifications from outside the UK. Crucially, for Skilled Worker Visa applicants, they also need to confirm English Language Proficiency.

To get an Ecctis statement, you’ll need to pay a fee. You’ll submit your degree certificate to Ecctis. They then provide two statements:

1.  **Qualification Comparability Statement:** This assesses whether your degree is equivalent to a UK degree.
2.  **English Language Proficiency Statement:** This confirms you met the English language requirements for your degree.

Since your degree was taught entirely in English by a German university, the English Language Proficiency statement is essential.

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the Ecctis website so you can find out more about the process and fees? [https://www.ecctis.org/](https://www.ecctis.org/)

[evaluation_judge]: That would be very helpful, thank you. So if I understand correctly, I need both statements from Ecctis - one to confirm my degree is equivalent to a UK degree, and another specifically for English Language Proficiency. Just having the university letter saying my degree was taught in English isn't enough for the UK Home Office?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Hans. You’ve understood perfectly. The university letter confirming the English language of instruction is helpful, but it’s not sufficient proof for the UK Home Office. They *require* the two Ecctis statements – one for qualification comparability and one for English Language Proficiency – to fully assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Is there anything else you’d like me to clarify about the Ecctis process, or perhaps about the Skilled Worker Visa requirements in general?

[evaluation_judge]: So just to be absolutely clear about my current situation - without the Ecctis verification for English Language Proficiency, my application for a Skilled Worker Visa would be refused, even though my degree was taught completely in English? The university letter is not accepted as sufficient proof by the Home Office?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit the nail on the head, Hans. Yes, exactly. Without the Ecctis English Language Proficiency statement, your Skilled Worker Visa application would be refused. The Home Office doesn’t accept university letters directly as proof of English language competency. They require the verification provided by Ecctis.

I understand this might be a bit disappointing, but it’s important to adhere to the specific requirements outlined by the Home Office.

Given this, I’m afraid I must conclude that your application, in its current state, would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa.

Do you have any questions about this conclusion, or would you like me to explain anything in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That is a bit disappointing since I thought the university letter would be sufficient. So to summarize what you've told me: my Master's degree from the Technical University of Munich, even though it was taught entirely in English, is not acceptable proof of English language proficiency for the UK Home Office without the specific Ecctis verification. I would need to pay for and obtain both the Qualification Comparability Statement and the English Language Proficiency Statement from Ecctis before applying for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Thank you for explaining this to me. It seems I have more steps to take before I can apply.

[root_agent]: You’ve got it perfectly summarized, Hans. Yes, that’s a correct understanding of the situation. It’s understandable to feel a little disappointed, but you’ve gained valuable clarity now.

I’m glad I could help clarify the requirements. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or would you like me to stop here?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that a university letter confirming English-medium instruction is not sufficient proof for UK visa purposes. They accurately informed me (as Hans) that I need both the Qualification Comparability Statement and the English Language Proficiency Statement from Ecctis, and that without these, my application would be refused. This matches the expected outcome.
