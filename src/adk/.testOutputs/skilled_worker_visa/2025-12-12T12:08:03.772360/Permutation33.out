[evaluation_judge]: I'll role play as Wei, a 25-year-old who has worked in the UK for 3 years on a Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa and is now applying for a Skilled Worker visa as a Senior Analyst with a salary of £34,000. I'm planning to interact with the agent as if I believe I qualify as a New Entrant based on my age.

Let me begin the conversation with the agent.

Hello, I need some advice about my visa application. I'm 25 years old and I've been offered a job as a Senior Analyst with a salary of £34,000. I've previously been in the UK for 3 years on a Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa. My employer wants to sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa for 3 years, and I think I qualify for the New Entrant rate since I'm under 26. Can you tell me if that's correct?

[root_agent]: Hello Wei, thanks for reaching out for advice. I understand you’re 25 years old and have worked in the UK for three years on a Global Business Mobility visa, and you're hoping to qualify for the New Entrant route to a Skilled Worker visa.

To help me assess your situation, could you tell me, how much time have you spent on any Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visas during those three years you were on the Global Business Mobility visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I haven't been on any Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visas before. I've only been in the UK on the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa for the past 3 years. This would be my first application for a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. So, to confirm, you haven't held any Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visas before, and your entire three years in the UK have been on the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa?

Just to be completely clear, are you aware of the “New Entrant” rule which states that time spent on Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visas counts towards your maximum eligible New Entrant period?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I've only been on the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa for 3 years total. I've never held a Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visa before.

I've heard about the New Entrant rules, but I thought it only applied to time spent on Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visas. Since I'm under 26, I thought I would qualify automatically for the New Entrant rate. Is there something I'm missing about how the rules work?

[root_agent]: You’ve raised a really important point, and it’s good you’re asking for clarification! It’s understandable to think the New Entrant rules only apply to those specific visas. 

Let’s go back to the core of the rules. The “New Entrant” status has a maximum limit of 4 years. This limit includes *all* time spent on Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visas, plus the time on your initial Global Business Mobility visa. 

Considering you’ve been on the Global Business Mobility visa for 3 years, that already counts towards your total eligible time.

To help me fully understand your situation, could you tell me, has it been three full years, or has some of that time been spent part-time, for example?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's been three full years on the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa. I came to the UK right after finishing my degree back home and have been working full-time for the company since then. 

I didn't realize that my time on the Global Business Mobility visa would count toward the New Entrant 4-year limit. So what does that mean for my new job offer and visa application? I was hoping to get a 3-year Skilled Worker visa with the lower salary threshold.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that it’s been three full years on the Global Business Mobility visa – that’s helpful.

Given that you've already spent 3 years in the UK, and those years are now counted towards your New Entrant eligibility, you currently have only one year remaining to qualify for the New Entrant rate. 

Because you’re applying for a 3-year Skilled Worker visa, and your employer is requesting 3 years, and you don’t have a full New Entrant year remaining, the application would likely be unsuccessful.

Would you like me to explain why the salary discount wouldn’t apply in this situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why the salary discount wouldn't apply to me. I thought since I was under 26, I would qualify for the New Entrant rate regardless of my previous time in the UK. This is quite concerning as my job offer is based on the lower salary threshold.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to be concerned – it’s understandable to feel that way. Let me explain why the salary discount wouldn’t apply, even though you’re under 26.

The New Entrant rate offers a salary discount because it’s intended for individuals who are genuinely new to the UK labour market. Once you’ve accrued a certain amount of time on a qualifying visa – in your case, 3 years – you no longer meet the criteria for the discount.

The salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa is reduced for New Entrants, but that reduction only applies if you *do* qualify for the New Entrant status. Because your time on the Global Business Mobility visa has used up your eligibility, you’re no longer considered a ‘new entrant’ and therefore aren’t entitled to the lower salary threshold, regardless of your age.

Essentially, the 3-year timeframe on the Global Business Mobility visa counts against your ability to use the New Entrant benefits, even though you’re still under 26.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to outline the different visa options available to you, given your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it makes sense now. I didn't understand that my Global Business Mobility visa time counted toward the New Entrant limit. So even though I'm under 26, I've already used 3 years of my 4-year maximum New Entrant eligibility.

Since my job offer is for 3 years but I only have 1 year of New Entrant eligibility left, my application would be refused. That's really disappointing as my salary offer is based on the New Entrant rate.

Yes, I'd appreciate if you could tell me what options I have now.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, and it’s frustrating to have your plans potentially disrupted. It’s a complex situation, but let's explore your options.

Given that you’ve used up your New Entrant eligibility, here are a few potential routes you could consider:

1.  **Apply for a Standard Skilled Worker Visa:** This would require you to meet the standard salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa. However, you wouldn't receive the New Entrant salary discount.

2.  **Seek a Sponsorship from a Different Employer:** If you're willing to explore other job opportunities, you could look for a sponsor who can offer a Skilled Worker visa with a longer duration.

3.  **Consider a different visa route:** Depending on your circumstances and qualifications, an Innovator Founder visa or Start-up visa might be suitable options, though these have their own criteria and requirements.

To help me narrow down the best course of action for *you*, could you tell me:

*   What is the exact salary being offered in your current job offer?
*   Are you open to exploring other job opportunities with different employers?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining my options. My current job offer is for £34,000 as a Senior Analyst. I was really excited about this opportunity as it's with a company I've been hoping to work for. 

I would prefer to stay with this job offer if possible, but I understand I might need to look elsewhere. Before I make any decisions, could you tell me what the standard salary threshold would be for my role without the New Entrant discount? That way I can see how much more I would need to earn to qualify for the Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Let’s look at the standard salary threshold for a Senior Analyst.

According to the current Skilled Worker visa requirements, the standard salary threshold for a Senior Analyst role is £38,740 per year. 

Therefore, to qualify for a Skilled Worker visa without the New Entrant discount, you would need to earn at least £38,740 per year.

Given your current job offer of £34,000, you would need to earn an additional £4,740 to meet the standard salary threshold. 

Does that clarify the financial implications of applying for a Skilled Worker visa without the New Entrant discount? Would you like me to explore any of the other visa options we discussed, or perhaps delve deeper into what’s involved in securing a higher-paying role?

[evaluation_judge]: I see - so there's a £4,740 gap between my current offer of £34,000 and the standard threshold of £38,740. That's quite significant. 

I think I'll need to speak with my prospective employer to see if they're willing to increase the salary to meet the standard threshold. If not, I may need to look for other opportunities.

This has been really helpful information. I had no idea that my time on the Global Business Mobility visa would affect my New Entrant status. It's definitely changed my understanding of my situation.

[root_agent]: I completely understand. It’s a significant difference, and it’s wise to discuss it with your prospective employer. 

I’m glad I could shed some light on the situation and clarify how your previous visa history impacts your eligibility for the New Entrant rate. It's common to be unaware of these intricacies, and it’s good you’re taking a proactive approach to understanding your options.

If you do need to seek alternative employment, I wish you the very best in your search. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions down the line.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that Wei would be refused a Skilled Worker visa as a New Entrant. They accurately explained that time spent on the Global Business Mobility visa counts toward the 4-year New Entrant limit, leaving Wei with only 1 year of eligibility remaining, which means he cannot be granted a standard 3-year visa with the salary discount.
