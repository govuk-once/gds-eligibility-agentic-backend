[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Julian, a Sales Director from Argentina with the job offer details you've provided, and test the agent's understanding of UK visa salary threshold requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Julian. It’s nice to speak with you. To start, could you tell me, what is your current annual guaranteed basic gross pay?

[evaluation_judge]: My job offer in the UK is for a Sales Director position with a base salary of £35,000 per year. On top of that, I have £20,000 in guaranteed commission and a performance bonus of up to £10,000. So the total package is worth £65,000. I'm from Argentina, and I'm trying to understand if this is enough for my visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Julian. Just to be perfectly clear, when you say “guaranteed commission,” is this commission guaranteed by a formal contract, or is it more of an estimated potential?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the £20,000 commission is guaranteed by my formal contract. It's written as a guaranteed minimum commission regardless of performance. The additional £10,000 bonus would be based on my actual performance, but the £20,000 is guaranteed to be paid.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that detail. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me, is the £35,000 base salary you mentioned a fixed, guaranteed amount, or is it subject to any changes or potential deductions?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the £35,000 base salary is a fixed, guaranteed amount. It's my basic annual salary that will be paid regardless of performance or any other factors. The commission and bonus are on top of this amount.

[root_agent]: Alright, Julian. Thank you for confirming that. Just one more question regarding your salary – are there any allowances or other payments you receive that aren't included in the £35,000 base salary, such as company car expenses or phone allowances?

[evaluation_judge]: No, there are no additional allowances for things like a company car or phone. The compensation package is structured exactly as I described: £35,000 fixed base salary, £20,000 guaranteed commission, and up to £10,000 performance bonus. That's the complete package.

[root_agent]: Okay, Julian. Thank you for providing all of that information. Based on the £35,000 base salary, and considering the rules regarding only guaranteed basic gross pay, I need to determine if this meets the standard threshold.

Do you happen to know what the current standard salary threshold is for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard threshold is £41,700, but I'm not entirely sure. That's one of the things I was hoping you could confirm for me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Julian. I’ve just checked, and the standard salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa is indeed £41,700.

Now, considering your base salary of £35,000, and with only the guaranteed basic pay included, does your total annual salary fall below £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, if only my base salary of £35,000 counts, then I would be below the £41,700 threshold. Does this mean I'm not eligible even though my total guaranteed package with the commission is £55,000?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct to point that out, Julian. My apologies for the oversight. You are correct – with just the £35,000 base salary, you would fall below the £41,700 threshold.

Therefore, based on the information you've provided, I must regrettably inform you that you are not currently eligible for the Skilled Worker visa.

Thank you for your patience and for clarifying all the details. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome that I am not eligible for the Skilled Worker visa. They correctly identified that only my basic salary of £35,000 counts toward the threshold, not the guaranteed commission or bonus, and that this falls below the £41,700 requirement.
