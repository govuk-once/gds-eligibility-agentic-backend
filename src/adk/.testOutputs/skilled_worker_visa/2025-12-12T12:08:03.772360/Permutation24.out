[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by roleplaying Dr. Banu from Turkey seeking information about UK visa eligibility based on this scenario. I'll interact with the agent and evaluate whether their final determination matches the expected outcome.

I'll begin the conversation as Dr. Banu.

Hello, I need some help regarding my UK visa application. I have a job offer as a Senior Chemist in the UK with a salary of £35,000. I have a PhD in Chemistry from a university in Turkey, and I'm wondering if I'll be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: Hello Dr. Banu, thank you for contacting me. I’d be happy to help you explore your options.

To start, could you please tell me the name of the university where you obtained your PhD in Chemistry?

[evaluation_judge]: My PhD in Chemistry is from Anatolian Science University, which is a small private university in Turkey. It's not one of the major universities there. I completed my doctorate program 3 years ago.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Could you tell me whether Anatolian Science University is accredited by a recognized accreditation body?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, Anatolian Science University is not accredited by any of the major international accreditation bodies. It's quite a small, private institution. I did have Ecctis evaluate my qualification, and they determined it's "comparable to RQF Level 7 (Master's)" but not to a doctoral standard in the UK system.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that.

Just to confirm, you’ve had Ecctis review your PhD qualification, and they assessed it as being equivalent to a Master’s level qualification rather than a PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Ecctis reviewed my PhD qualification and their assessment stated that it's "comparable to RQF Level 7 (Master's)" rather than a doctoral level qualification in the UK system. I was disappointed with this result since I completed what was called a "PhD program" at my university, but apparently the standards don't match up to UK doctoral requirements.

[root_agent]: I understand. 

To help me assess your situation fully, could you tell me – does your university issue a document explicitly stating that you have earned a PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a formal certificate from Anatolian Science University that explicitly states I have earned a "PhD in Chemistry." The document has all the official university seals and signatures. It's just that when Ecctis evaluated it, they determined that despite being called a PhD, the qualification itself is only equivalent to a Master's level in the UK system.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Dr. Banu.

Given that Ecctis has confirmed your qualification is only considered equivalent to a Master’s degree in the UK, and not a recognised PhD, are you aware of any other verification processes that might be available to potentially elevate your qualification’s status?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not aware of any other verification processes that could change this assessment. I went through Ecctis because I understood they were the official UK agency for evaluating international qualifications. I was hoping their assessment would confirm my PhD as equivalent to a UK PhD so I could qualify for the STEM PhD discount on the Skilled Worker visa salary requirement. Is there any other option I could pursue for this?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Dr. Banu. Let’s consider the Skilled Worker visa requirements.

You mentioned you have a job offer as a Senior Chemist with a salary of £35,000.  Could you confirm that this salary is based on the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) PhD discount, as you were hoping to utilise?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The employer offered me £35,000 because we both thought I could use the STEM PhD salary discount, since Chemistry is a STEM field. The company was expecting that my PhD would qualify me for the reduced salary threshold. They mentioned that without this discount, they would need to offer a higher salary to meet visa requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided – that your PhD is not recognised as a UK PhD by Ecctis and therefore doesn't qualify for the STEM PhD discount – and relying on the standard salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa, it seems unlikely you would meet the requirements. 

Therefore, I must advise that, at this time, you likely would not be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa with the current job offer and qualification details.

Is there anything else I can help you understand about the visa requirements, or perhaps explore alternative visa routes that might be suitable given your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: So if I understand correctly, since my PhD is not recognized as equivalent to a UK PhD by Ecctis, I cannot use the STEM PhD discount, and my £35,000 salary offer is not enough to meet the standard Skilled Worker visa salary threshold?

What is the standard salary threshold I would need to meet without the PhD discount?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood correctly. 

As of today, the standard salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa is £38,700.

Do you want me to explain any other aspects of the Skilled Worker visa requirements, or perhaps discuss alternative visa options that might be available?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So the standard threshold is £38,700, and my offer is only £35,000. So I'm £3,700 short because I can't use the PhD discount.

One more question to be absolutely certain - is there any appeal process for the Ecctis evaluation? Or would I need to ask my employer if they can increase my salary offer to at least £38,700 to meet the standard threshold?

[root_agent]: That’s a very astute observation, Dr. Banu. 

Regarding the Ecctis evaluation, unfortunately, there isn’t a formal appeal process directly with Ecctis. Their assessment is considered final.

However, you are correct to explore options with your employer. Discussing the shortfall, and the possibility of an increased salary offer to meet the £38,700 threshold would certainly be a worthwhile conversation. 

Would you like me to help you formulate some points to raise with your employer during that discussion, focusing on the potential impact of the visa requirements on your ability to take the role?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for clarifying that. So I have two options: either ask my employer to increase the salary to £38,700 or look for a different visa category.

I think I understand my situation now. Based on my current job offer at £35,000 and without my PhD being recognized as equivalent to UK standards by Ecctis, I would not qualify for the Skilled Worker visa. I would need the employer to increase the salary by at least £3,700 to meet the threshold.

[root_agent]: You’ve summarised the situation perfectly, Dr. Banu.

Given your current circumstances, it appears that, regrettably, you are not eligible for the Skilled Worker visa under these conditions. 

I’m glad we’ve been able to clarify your situation. If you have any further questions or would like to discuss alternative visa routes in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

Thank you for speaking with me today.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be refused for the Skilled Worker visa. They accurately explained that without Ecctis verification confirming my PhD as equivalent to UK doctoral standards, I couldn't use the STEM PhD discount for the salary requirement. They correctly identified that my £35,000 salary offer falls below the standard threshold of £38,700, making me ineligible for the visa under current circumstances.
