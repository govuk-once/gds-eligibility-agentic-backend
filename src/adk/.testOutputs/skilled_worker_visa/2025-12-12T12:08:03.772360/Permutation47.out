[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Dr. Aris, a university lecturer on a Skilled Worker visa who is seeking to take on a second job as a researcher at a private think-tank while maintaining my current visa. I'll evaluate the agent's guidance on concurrent employment visa requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, Dr. Aris, welcome! It’s good to speak with you today. To start, could you tell me a bit about the work you currently do as a university lecturer? Specifically, what are the typical hours you work per week?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently working as a university lecturer for 20 hours per week. I have a Skilled Worker visa that was sponsored by the university. I've been teaching economics courses for the past year. I recently received an offer to work as a researcher at a private think-tank for an additional 20 hours per week, and I'm wondering if this is allowed under my current visa situation or what steps I need to take to make this possible.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Dr. Aris. It sounds like you’re already working 20 hours a week lecturing. So, to confirm, you’re seeking to take on an additional role as a researcher at a think-tank for another 20 hours a week, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I'd like to continue my 20 hours per week as a university lecturer, and then add another 20 hours per week as a researcher at this private think-tank. So in total, I would be working 40 hours per week across these two professional roles. I'm not sure if this is permitted under my current Skilled Worker visa or if I need to apply for something new.

[root_agent]: Okay, Dr. Aris. That’s very helpful to know. Just to be clear, you’re saying you currently hold one Skilled Worker visa sponsored by the university, and you’re now seeking to add a *second* sponsored role at the think-tank, meaning you'd be working a total of 40 hours across both jobs?

[evaluation_judge]: That's precisely right. I have one Skilled Worker visa currently sponsored by the university for my lecturer position (20 hours), and I want to add another position as a researcher at the think-tank (20 more hours), bringing my total to 40 hours per week. I want to keep both jobs, not replace one with the other. The think-tank is willing to sponsor me, but I'm not sure what the process is since I already have one Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Alright. It sounds like you’re aiming to hold two separate sponsored jobs simultaneously. To clarify, you’re saying that the think-tank is prepared to sponsor you for a *second* Skilled Worker visa, allowing you to work both your lecturing role and the researcher position, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. The think-tank is willing to sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa. They've told me they can provide a Certificate of Sponsorship. So I'd have two separate sponsors - the university for my current job, and the think-tank for this new researcher position. I'm just unsure about the proper procedure since I already have one Skilled Worker visa. Do I need a second visa? Is this arrangement even allowed under UK immigration rules?

[root_agent]: Okay, Dr. Aris. Thank you for clarifying. Given that both the university and the think-tank are willing to sponsor you for Skilled Worker visas, and you’re seeking to hold two separate jobs concurrently, it appears this *is* allowed under the rules. This is sometimes referred to as “concurrent employment.” 

To confirm my understanding, are both jobs in the same sector, or are they quite different?

[evaluation_judge]: Both jobs are in a similar field of expertise. My university lecturer position is in economics, and the think-tank research position would also be focused on economic policy research and analysis. So while they're at different organizations, they're drawing on the same professional knowledge base and qualifications. I have a PhD in Economics that qualifies me for both positions.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent to hear, Dr. Aris. Knowing that both roles leverage your PhD in Economics strengthens the case for concurrent employment. 

To ensure we’re on the right track, could you tell me, are both employers willing to provide a “Certificate of Sponsorship” for your new role, as required for concurrent employment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the university has already provided a Certificate of Sponsorship for my current lecturer position, which I've been working under for about a year now. And the think-tank has confirmed they are willing to issue a new Certificate of Sponsorship for the researcher position. They understand I want to maintain both positions concurrently and are supportive of this arrangement.

[root_agent]: Great news, Dr. Aris! It sounds like you’ve taken a significant first step. With both employers providing Certificates of Sponsorship, and both roles being eligible for concurrent employment, it’s highly likely this arrangement will be approved.

Just one final question to confirm: Do you understand that you’ll need to apply for a *second* Skilled Worker visa, specifically marked as “Concurrent Employment,” to hold both jobs simultaneously?

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't entirely clear about that specific process. So I need to apply for a second Skilled Worker visa that's specifically marked as "Concurrent Employment"? That makes sense, but I wanted to be sure this was the correct procedure rather than having to modify my existing visa or apply for a completely different type of visa. Will this second visa application process be similar to my first one? And will I need to pay the full visa fees and healthcare surcharge again for this concurrent employment application?

[root_agent]: That’s a very astute question, Dr. Aris. You’re absolutely right to seek clarification. Yes, you will need to apply for a *second* Skilled Worker visa, specifically designated as “Concurrent Employment.”

The application process will be broadly similar to your initial visa application, but it will require you to provide evidence of sponsorship from both the university and the think-tank, and you will indeed need to pay the full visa fees and the healthcare surcharge again.

Based on what you’ve described, it certainly seems like you’re on the right path to being able to hold both positions concurrently. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the application process, such as the required supporting documents?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for that clear explanation. I think I understand the overall process now. So just to confirm - I'll keep my existing visa for the university position, and will apply for a second visa marked as "Concurrent Employment" using the Certificate of Sponsorship from the think-tank. I'll need to pay the full fee and healthcare surcharge again.

One last question: When I submit this second application, is there anything special I need to do to make sure my first visa doesn't get automatically cancelled? I've heard sometimes new visa applications can supersede existing ones, and I don't want to lose my current position.

[root_agent]: That’s a very important point, Dr. Aris, and a wise concern to have. You’re correct – a new visa application *can* sometimes supersede an existing one. 

To avoid any potential issues with your existing visa, it’s crucial that when you submit the “Concurrent Employment” visa application, you clearly indicate that you intend to *maintain* both your current role and the new role simultaneously. Specifically, you should highlight the concurrent employment aspect in the application comments and ensure that both Certificates of Sponsorship explicitly state this arrangement. 

Essentially, you want to make it unequivocally clear to the Home Office that you are seeking to continue holding both positions concurrently, rather than replacing one with the other. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. I'll make sure to clearly indicate on the application form that this is for concurrent employment, and I'll add detailed comments explaining that I intend to maintain both positions simultaneously. I'll also double-check with both sponsors that their Certificates of Sponsorship clearly state this arrangement.

Thank you so much for explaining this process. It seems I'm eligible to hold both positions with two separate Skilled Worker visas through the concurrent employment route, as long as I follow the proper application procedures and make it clear I'm not replacing my current visa.

[root_agent]: Excellent, Dr. Aris! I’m very glad we’ve clarified the process and that you feel confident moving forward. It sounds like you’ve thoroughly assessed the situation and are prepared to follow the correct procedures. 

Based on the information you've provided, it certainly appears you’ll be awarded the ability to hold both positions concurrently. You’ve successfully navigated the requirements for “Concurrent Employment” under the Skilled Worker visa. 

Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or would you like me to summarise the key steps you’ll need to follow?

[evaluation_judge]: I think you've explained everything very clearly, and I now understand what I need to do. Just to confirm my understanding:

1. I keep my existing Skilled Worker visa for my university lecturer position
2. I apply for a second Skilled Worker visa marked specifically as "Concurrent Employment" using the Certificate of Sponsorship from the think-tank
3. I need to pay the full visa fees and healthcare surcharge again for this second application
4. I need to clearly indicate on the application that I intend to maintain both positions simultaneously
5. Both Certificates of Sponsorship should explicitly state this concurrent arrangement

Thank you for your guidance. I feel confident now about proceeding with my application for concurrent employment.

[root_agent]: You’ve got it exactly right, Dr. Aris! That’s a perfect summary of the steps involved. I’m delighted to hear you feel confident and well-prepared to proceed with your application. 

It was a pleasure assisting you today. If you have any further questions or need any clarification as you move forward, please don’t hesitate to ask. Good luck with your application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided correct information that matches the expected outcome. They accurately explained that concurrent employment is allowed with two separate Skilled Worker visas, confirmed I need a second visa application specifically marked as "Concurrent Employment," and correctly advised that both jobs need separate Certificates of Sponsorship. The guidance aligned perfectly with the expected outcome that I would be awarded two visas simultaneously.
