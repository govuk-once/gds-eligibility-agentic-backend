[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Javier who is asking about skilled worker visa eligibility. I'll converse with the agent until they provide an eligibility outcome, then evaluate if it matches the expected outcome.

[root_agent]: Okay Javier, thanks for reaching out about the Skilled Worker Visa. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me your date of birth?

[evaluation_judge]: My date of birth is June 1, 1999.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Javier. And could you please confirm the date you submitted your Skilled Worker Visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: I submitted my application on May 30th, 2025.

[root_agent]: Alright, Javier. Just to be clear, you submitted your application on May 30th, 2025. And what is your current salary?

[evaluation_judge]: My current salary is £35,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Javier. Let me just double-check a few details to assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa. Could you tell me what job you’re applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm applying for a software developer position.

[root_agent]: Okay, a software developer position. Thank you. Just one more question for now – are you currently employed?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have been offered employment by a UK company with a sponsor license. This will be my first job in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Javier. That’s very helpful. Now, I need to confirm a key detail to determine your eligibility. Could you please tell me your date of birth?

[evaluation_judge]: My date of birth is June 1st, 1999.

[root_agent]: Okay, Javier. Thank you. Let me just confirm – you were born on June 1st, 1999. I’m now checking your application date, which you stated was May 30th, 2025. 

Based on this information, you were under 26 on May 30th, 2025. Therefore, you qualify as a “New Entrant” for the Skilled Worker Visa.

**AWARDED.** You are eligible for the 70% salary discount for up to 4 years (max), even though you are now 26. Would you like me to explain how this discount works in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the New Entrant discount because I was under 26 at the date of application (May 30th, 2025), even though I turned 26 during processing. The agent properly awarded the visa with the 70% salary discount.
