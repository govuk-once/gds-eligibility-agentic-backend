[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Ravi and interact with the agent to test their knowledge about the third-party working rules for the Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s begin. Hello Ravi, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the specific duties you would be performing as a System Administrator at Bank Corp?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello! I'll be working as a System Administrator at Bank Corp. My duties will include managing their IT infrastructure, network security, user access management, system updates, and troubleshooting technical issues for Bank Corp staff. I'll be reporting directly to the IT manager at Bank Corp, and I'll be based full-time at their office. TechRecruit Ltd is my sponsor and employer, but all my work will be at Bank Corp's premises.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Ravi. That’s very helpful. Just to clarify, you’ll be working directly for the IT manager at Bank Corp, and your primary place of work will be at Bank Corp’s office – is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'll be working full-time at Bank Corp's office and reporting directly to their IT manager. TechRecruit Ltd is the company sponsoring my visa and technically employing me, but I'll be placed at Bank Corp indefinitely to handle their systems administration needs.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Let me ask this: Does TechRecruit Ltd have the responsibility for managing your day-to-day work and assessing your performance, or will Bank Corp be handling that directly?

[evaluation_judge]: Bank Corp will be handling my day-to-day management and performance assessment directly. Their IT manager will assign my tasks, monitor my work, and conduct my performance reviews. TechRecruit Ltd is just handling my payroll and visa sponsorship, but all my actual work supervision comes from Bank Corp since I'll be working at their site full-time and indefinitely.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi. That’s very important information. Just one more question for now – could you describe TechRecruit Ltd’s role – beyond sponsorship – in relation to Bank Corp? Are they involved in any of the actual work you’ll be doing, or do they simply provide you as a resource to Bank Corp?

[evaluation_judge]: TechRecruit Ltd is essentially just providing me as a resource to Bank Corp. They don't have any involvement in the actual IT work I'll be doing. Their role is limited to handling my visa sponsorship, processing my payroll, and maintaining my employment contract. They won't be involved in project management, technical oversight, or any aspects of the actual system administration work. It's basically an arrangement where TechRecruit recruits IT professionals like me and places us with their clients like Bank Corp, who need our skills for their ongoing operations.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi. Based on this information, I need to investigate further. I’m going to need to determine if TechRecruit Ltd is acting as a third party supplying labor to Bank Corp. Could you tell me a bit about how TechRecruit Ltd is structured – are they a recruitment agency, or do they have a more direct operational role with Bank Corp?

[evaluation_judge]: TechRecruit Ltd is primarily an IT consulting and staffing company. They don't have a direct operational role with Bank Corp beyond providing skilled IT professionals. They have contracts with various companies in the UK, including Bank Corp, to supply IT specialists for extended periods. 

From what I understand, TechRecruit specializes in finding professionals like me from overseas, handling our visa process, and placing us with their clients who need technical expertise. They handle the administrative aspects of my employment, but they don't provide technical oversight or get involved in the actual IT operations of their clients.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Ravi. Based on your description, it appears TechRecruit Ltd is functioning as a recruitment agency supplying labor to Bank Corp. This aligns with the “contracting out” rule under the Skilled Worker visa criteria.

I’m afraid to tell you that, unfortunately, I must refuse your application at this time. The Home Office would likely determine that TechRecruit Ltd is acting as a recruitment agency, rather than Bank Corp requiring the role directly.

Do you have any questions about this assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: So my application won't be successful? That's disappointing. I thought since TechRecruit would be my official employer and paying my salary that it would be acceptable. Are there any alternatives or changes I could make to this arrangement that would make it eligible for a Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Ravi. Let’s explore potential options, though it’s important to be realistic.

While your current arrangement with TechRecruit Ltd does fall under the “contracting out” rule, there are very limited circumstances where it *might* be possible to secure a Skilled Worker visa. However, it would require a significant shift in the working arrangements.

Specifically, the sponsor (in this case, TechRecruit Ltd) would need to retain full responsibility for your duties and the role would need to be genuinely held by TechRecruit Ltd, not simply a supply of labor to Bank Corp. 

Could you tell me a little bit about any potential involvement TechRecruit Ltd might have in the day-to-day management of your work, beyond just payroll and sponsorship? For example, do they have any contact with Bank Corp regarding your work, or do they hold any authority over your tasks?

[evaluation_judge]: To be honest, TechRecruit Ltd doesn't have any real involvement in my day-to-day work management. From what I understand about the arrangement, they would only handle administrative aspects like processing my pay and maintaining my employment paperwork. 

They don't have technical oversight of my work or authority over my tasks - all of that would come directly from Bank Corp's IT manager. TechRecruit doesn't assign projects or evaluate the quality of my technical work. They might have occasional check-ins about my placement, but they don't have any substantive role in managing what I do at Bank Corp or how I do it.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Ravi. That confirms my initial assessment – TechRecruit Ltd’s limited involvement effectively aligns with the “contracting out” rule.

Unfortunately, without a significant change in the arrangement where TechRecruit Ltd genuinely holds responsibility for the role and manages your day-to-day duties, it would be highly unlikely that your Skilled Worker visa application would be approved.

I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this with me, and I wish you the best of luck in exploring alternative options for your employment.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that this arrangement violates the third-party "contracting out" rule for Skilled Worker visas and refused the application. The agent accurately explained that TechRecruit Ltd was acting as a recruitment agency supplying labor to Bank Corp rather than genuinely employing Ravi, which matches the expected outcome of refusal provided in the scenario.
