[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Kenji, a graphic designer from Japan with a job offer in the UK at £30,000 per year. I'll interact with the agent to determine if I'm eligible for a UK Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Hello Kenji, it’s nice to speak with you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your job offer? Specifically, what is the job title you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello! Thank you for speaking with me today. I've been offered a job as a Graphic Designer with a company in the UK. I'm really excited about this opportunity as I've been working in this field in Japan for several years now.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s great to hear. And what is the annual salary you’ve been offered for this Graphic Designer position?

[evaluation_judge]: The company has offered me £30,000 per year for the Graphic Designer position. This seems like a good opportunity for me, but I'm not sure if it's enough to qualify for a UK work visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just to clarify, are you currently residing in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm currently living in Japan. This would be my first time working in the UK, so I would need to apply for the appropriate visa to move there for this job opportunity.

[root_agent]: Okay, understood. And could you confirm your highest level of education achieved?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design that I completed in Japan. I graduated about 5 years ago and have been working in the industry since then.

[root_agent]: Alright. Now, to help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me what type of English language proficiency you have – for example, do you have a recognized English language test certificate, such as IELTS?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I took the IELTS test last month and received an overall score of 7.0. I made sure to prepare for it thoroughly since I knew it would be required for working in the UK.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news – a score of 7.0 on the IELTS is certainly a strong foundation. Now, regarding the salary, the Skilled Worker visa has specific requirements. To check this fully, could you confirm your anticipated annual gross salary for this Graphic Designer role, before any deductions?

[evaluation_judge]: My annual gross salary would be £30,000 before any deductions. That's what was stated in my job offer letter from the UK company.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Let me check the criteria for the Skilled Worker visa… Okay, it appears there’s a minimum salary requirement. Currently, that’s £41,700. Could you confirm if your sponsor – the company offering you the job – is a licensed sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they told me they are a licensed sponsor for UK work visas. They have experience bringing in workers from outside the UK before.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Just one more question regarding the salary – is this a fixed salary, or is there potential for it to increase based on performance or other factors?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a fixed salary of £30,000. They did mention there might be performance-based bonuses after my first year, but the base salary would remain at £30,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Kenji. I’ve reviewed all the information you’ve provided, including the salary, your IELTS score, your sponsor status, and your education. Based on the current criteria for the Skilled Worker visa, which requires a minimum salary of £41,700, your salary of £30,000 unfortunately does not meet the threshold. 

Therefore, I must inform you that based on this assessment, you would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa at this time.

**REFUSED.**

Do you have any questions about this decision, or would you like me to explore alternative visa options, though I must emphasize that the Skilled Worker visa is currently unavailable to you given the salary requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand that my application for a Skilled Worker visa would be refused based on the salary requirements. Thank you for explaining this to me.

✗ The agent incorrectly assessed my eligibility. While they correctly determined I would be refused, they stated the minimum salary requirement is £41,700 without mentioning that even if I qualified for exceptions (like the lower threshold or new entrant rate), my salary of £30,000 is still below the absolute minimum salary floor of £33,400 for any Skilled Worker visa permutation.
