[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Amara, an architect from Nigeria looking to work part-time in the UK while studying. I'll interact with the agent to determine if I'm eligible for a work visa based on my circumstances.

[root_agent]: Okay, Amara, it’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about your current employment situation? Specifically, what is the typical number of hours you’d be working per week under this new role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as an architect in the UK. The company has agreed that I can work part-time at 3 days per week, which would be 22.5 hours weekly. This arrangement will allow me to dedicate some time for my private studies. The company is offering me £30 per hour, which works out to an annual salary of £35,100. I'm from Nigeria and hoping to move to the UK with this job.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Amara. That’s very helpful. Now, to ensure I understand correctly, are you earning £30 per hour, or is that a rate that’s expected to increase over time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct - I'll be earning £30 per hour. This is the fixed rate they're offering me for the position. At 22.5 hours per week, this works out to £675 per week, which comes to approximately £35,100 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, Amara. And just to confirm, this £30 per hour rate is a consistent rate you’ll be receiving throughout the year, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the £30 per hour rate is consistent throughout the year. It's a fixed rate in my contract. My employment agreement clearly states this rate for my part-time architect position of 22.5 hours per week, resulting in the annual salary of £35,100.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Amara. Let’s move on to salary requirements. According to the Skilled Worker Visa criteria, there are two thresholds: £33,400 and £41,700. Which of these thresholds are you referring to as the one you’re interested in for this visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand there are two salary thresholds. My employer mentioned I would need to meet the general threshold of £41,700 for the visa. They said something about this being the "Option A" route. I'm just trying to understand if my part-time salary of £35,100 will be sufficient, or if there are any provisions for part-time workers like me.

[root_agent]: Okay, Amara. Thank you for clarifying. Let’s talk about that salary threshold. Could you tell me, does your actual gross annual salary meet the £41,700 threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my actual gross annual salary doesn't meet the £41,700 threshold. I'll be earning £35,100 per year working 22.5 hours per week. Though I should mention that if I were working full-time (37.5 hours per week), my salary at the same hourly rate would be equivalent to about £58,500 per year. I was wondering if there's any consideration for part-time workers where the hourly rate might be taken into account rather than just the total annual amount?

[root_agent]: That’s a really important point, Amara. Thank you for bringing that detail about the full-time salary to my attention. Let’s consider this carefully. Regarding the salary thresholds, the Skilled Worker visa generally requires meeting a fixed threshold of £33,400 or £41,700. It sounds like your current salary of £35,100 doesn't quite meet the £41,700 threshold.

Now, let me check the rules again to see if there are any exceptions for part-time workers. One moment, please.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for looking into this. Yes, my total annual salary is £35,100, which is less than the £41,700 threshold, even though my hourly rate would equate to a much higher salary if I were working full-time hours. I'm really hoping there might be some flexibility or pro-rating allowance for part-time professionals like myself.

[root_agent]: You’re welcome, Amara. I appreciate you reiterating that. Let me just confirm – you’re stating that your *actual gross annual salary* is £35,100, correct? And you’re concerned that this falls below the £41,700 threshold required for the Skilled Worker Visa?

I’m now thoroughly reviewing the criteria to see if there’s any provision for pro-rating the salary based on the number of hours worked. Just one moment while I consult the official guidelines.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. My actual gross annual salary is £35,100, which falls below the £41,700 threshold required. I am concerned about this, even though my hourly rate of £30 per hour is quite high and would equate to around £58,500 if I were working full-time. I'm hoping there might be some accommodation in the visa rules for part-time professionals like me who have a high hourly wage but work fewer hours.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Amara. I’ve now carefully reviewed the Skilled Worker Visa criteria, focusing on the salary thresholds and any provisions for part-time workers.

It appears that while there’s a general requirement for meeting the £41,700 threshold, there *is* a rule regarding “Going Rates.” The rule states that the “Going Rate” can be pro-rated (calculated by hour), but the General Threshold is usually a hard floor that cannot be pro-rated unless in a specific Health/Transitional group.

Based on your hourly rate of £30, your salary *could* be pro-rated. However, the crucial point is that your *actual gross annual salary* of £35,100 still does not meet the £41,700 General Threshold.

Therefore, unfortunately, based on the current criteria, I must advise that you would be **REFUSED** for a Skilled Worker Visa under Option A (Standard).

Do you understand, and would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. That's disappointing news, but I appreciate you explaining the situation clearly. So even though my hourly rate is high enough that I'd earn well above the threshold if I worked full-time, the actual annual salary is what matters for the General Threshold, and mine falls short at £35,100. 

Would there be any options for me? Perhaps I could negotiate with my employer to increase my hours, or would I need to look at a different visa category altogether?

[root_agent]: That’s a very insightful question, Amara. You’re absolutely right to explore those options.

Let’s discuss potential next steps. Firstly, you could certainly try to negotiate with your employer to increase your hours and, therefore, your salary. However, I must reiterate that the minimum salary requirement for the Skilled Worker Visa remains £41,700.

Regarding alternative visa categories, there are a few possibilities to consider. The Health and Care Worker visa might be relevant, depending on the specifics of your architectural role. There’s also the Global Talent visa, which could be considered if you are recognised as a leader or finalist in your field – this would require demonstrating exceptional talent. 

However, these alternatives would require further investigation to determine if you meet their specific criteria. 

Would you like me to briefly outline the key requirements for the Health and Care Worker visa or the Global Talent visa, or would you prefer to explore those options independently?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I'd like to discuss my options with my employer first about potentially increasing my hours to meet the £41,700 threshold. Architecture isn't typically in the health and care sector, so I don't think that visa would apply to me. And while the Global Talent visa sounds interesting, I'm not sure if I would qualify as a leader in my field yet.

Thank you for explaining the situation so clearly. It helps me understand what I need to do next if I want to pursue working in the UK.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Amara. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. It sounds like a productive next step is to discuss increasing your hours with your employer. 

If you decide to pursue the Global Talent visa down the line, you’ll want to carefully document your achievements and how they align with the criteria.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future. I wish you the very best with your plans to work in the UK!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for your help and advice. I'll speak with my employer about possibly increasing my hours to meet the salary threshold. Have a good day!

Based on my evaluation of the conversation, I give the agent a ✓. The agent correctly determined that I would be refused for the Skilled Worker Visa since my actual gross annual salary of £35,100 does not meet the required General Threshold of £41,700, even though my hourly rate is high. The agent accurately explained that while the "Going Rate" can be pro-rated, the General Threshold is a hard floor that cannot be pro-rated in my situation.
