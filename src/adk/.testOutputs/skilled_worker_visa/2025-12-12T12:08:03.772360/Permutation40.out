[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Ms. Dubois, a French teacher at a UK private school who is seeking information about whether she's eligible for a visa based on her salary. I'll interact with the agent until I receive an eligibility determination, then evaluate their response against the expected outcome.

[root_agent]: Hello Ms. Dubois, it’s lovely to speak with you. To start, could you tell me what type of work you do?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a French teacher at a private school here in the UK. I've been teaching for several years, but I only work during term time - so about 39 weeks per year rather than the full year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. And to confirm, your current gross annual salary is £33,750, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. My gross annual salary is £33,750. If I worked the full year, it would be £45,000, but since I only work during term time (39 weeks), my actual salary is £33,750.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Just to be absolutely clear, are you currently employed as a teacher in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently working as a French teacher at a private school in the UK. I'm a French citizen and I'm trying to find out if my salary is sufficient for a skilled worker visa.

[root_agent]: Alright. And could you please confirm your occupation code – the specific job title you hold?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a French teacher, so I believe my occupation code would fall under the category of "Secondary education teaching professionals" - I think that's code 2314. I teach at a private secondary school.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Let me just double-check that information. So, you’re a “Secondary education teaching professionals” – occupation code 2314.  Could you tell me what your FTE (Full Time Equivalent) salary would be if you were working the standard full-time hours for that role?

[evaluation_judge]: My Full Time Equivalent (FTE) salary would be £45,000 if I worked the full year instead of just term time. But since I only work during the 39 school weeks rather than 52 weeks, my actual gross salary is £33,750.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Let me quickly check the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa regarding term-time only salaries for this occupation. Just one moment please.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please take your time. I'm quite anxious to know if my term-time only salary will be sufficient for the visa requirements.

[root_agent]: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Dubois. Thank you for your patience.

Okay, I’ve reviewed the criteria. It appears that for term-time workers like yourself, the salary threshold is based on what you *actually* earn, not the full-time equivalent. However, the “Going Rate” for your specific occupation code (2314 - Secondary education teaching professionals) *can* be pro-rated.

Does the *actual* salary you earn (£33,750) meet the standard threshold of £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my actual salary of £33,750 doesn't meet the standard threshold of £41,700. I understand there's a difference between the full-time equivalent and what I actually earn, but I was hoping there might be some accommodation for teachers who only work during term time.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to bring that up. Thank you for pointing that out.

Let me confirm: Your actual salary of £33,750 does not meet the standard threshold of £41,700.

Based on this information, I must unfortunately inform you that you do not currently meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Would you like me to explain anything further about the requirements, or perhaps discuss any alternative routes that might be available, such as the lower £33,400 floor for PhD discounts or New Entrants?

[evaluation_judge]: I would be interested to know if I qualify for any of those alternative routes you mentioned, like the PhD discount or New Entrant option. I've been teaching for several years but I don't have a PhD. What exactly is the New Entrant option?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s explore those options then.

Regarding the New Entrant route, it’s designed for individuals who have recently qualified for a role in a shortage occupation. As a French teacher, it’s currently not considered a shortage occupation that qualifies for this route.

However, let’s discuss the PhD discount. Since you don’t have a PhD, that option wouldn’t apply to you.

To assess your eligibility for the New Entrant scheme, we'd need to confirm a few things. Could you tell me when you completed your initial teacher training, and what your gross annual salary is *before* any deductions?

[evaluation_judge]: I completed my teacher training about 6 years ago in France, and then moved to the UK where I've been teaching since. My gross annual salary before deductions is £33,750 - that's the total amount I earn for the 39 weeks of term time work.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Ms. Dubois. Let me just quickly verify that…

Okay, so you completed your teacher training approximately six years ago and your gross annual salary before deductions is indeed £33,750.

Given that the New Entrant scheme isn't applicable to your situation, and your current salary still falls below the standard Skilled Worker Visa threshold (£41,700), I’m afraid you wouldn’t currently meet the eligibility requirements for that visa route.

Do you have any further questions about the Skilled Worker Visa, or would you like me to summarise the key reasons why your salary doesn’t currently align with the criteria?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I don't meet the Skilled Worker Visa criteria. They accurately explained that for term-time workers, the actual salary (£33,750) must meet the threshold (£41,700), not the FTE salary. They also correctly identified that I don't qualify for alternative routes like the PhD discount or New Entrant scheme.
