[evaluation_judge]: I'll assume the role of Klaus, a 45-year-old welder with a job offer. I'll interact with the agent to see if they correctly determine my eligibility for a UK work visa under the Immigration Salary List (ISL) rules.

Hello, I'm Klaus. I'm 45 years old and I've been offered a job as a welder in the UK. The company has offered me £30,960 per year. They told me this should be fine since welding is on something called the Immigration Salary List. Can you tell me if I'm eligible for a work visa?

[root_agent]: Hello Klaus, thank you for reaching out. I understand you’ve been offered a job as a welder and are wondering about your visa eligibility.

To start, could you tell me if this welding job is listed on the Immigration Salary List (ISL)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been told by the company that welding is on the Immigration Salary List. They said that's why they're able to offer me the salary of £30,960. They mentioned something about this being 80% of the usual rate, which they said was fine because of the ISL.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that.

To help me assess your situation fully, could you please tell me what the going rate for a welder in the UK is currently?

[evaluation_judge]: The company told me that the going rate for welders in the UK is £38,700, but they said since welding is on the Immigration Salary List, they can pay me 80% of that rate, which is why they're offering £30,960. I'm not sure if that's correct, but that's what they explained to me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Klaus.

Let’s take a look at the ISL rules. Does the salary of £30,960 meet the ISL General Floor, which is currently £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't think so. The salary they're offering me is £30,960, which seems to be below the £33,400 you just mentioned. The company didn't tell me about this general floor - they just said that because welding is on the Immigration Salary List, they only need to pay me 80% of the going rate.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Klaus. My apologies for not bringing that up sooner. 

The ISL does have a general floor of £33,400. Since your salary of £30,960 is below that threshold, it makes it ineligible under the ISL rules. 

To be clear, are you eligible for the New Entrant route?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't think I'm eligible as a New Entrant. I'm 45 years old and I've been working as a welder for many years. I don't think I qualify as a "New Entrant" in any way. The company just told me that the lower salary was fine because welding is on the Immigration Salary List.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Klaus.

Based on the information we’ve discussed – that the job is on the ISL, the salary is below the general floor of £33,400, and you aren’t eligible for the New Entrant route – it appears that the sponsorship would be refused under current ISL rules. 

Do you understand that the sponsor is applying outdated logic relating to the Shortage Occupation List rather than the current ISL rules?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. No, I didn't realize they were using outdated information. They just told me that since welding is on the Immigration Salary List, they could pay me 80% of the going rate. I didn't know the rules had changed. So you're saying that even though welding is on the Immigration Salary List, I would still need to be paid the full going rate of £38,700 unless I was a New Entrant, which I'm not. And also that I would need to meet the general floor of £33,400 regardless?

[root_agent]: That’s a perfect summary, Klaus. Yes, you’ve grasped the situation correctly.

Under current ISL rules, even though the job is on the list, you would need to be paid the full going rate of £38,700, and your salary must meet the general floor of £33,400. Since your offered salary of £30,960 doesn’t meet either of those requirements, the sponsorship would be refused.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding this situation?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. So my application would be rejected because my offered salary doesn't meet the requirements - it's below both the general floor of £33,400 and the full going rate of £38,700. 

I should probably go back to the company and explain that they're using outdated rules from the old Shortage Occupation List system, and that under the current ISL rules, they would need to offer me at least the full going rate of £38,700. 

Thank you for explaining this to me. I think I have all the information I need about my eligibility.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Klaus. I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. It’s always a good idea to double-check information with your employer, especially when it comes to immigration rules. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be refused for a work visa based on the current ISL rules. They accurately explained that being on the ISL doesn't automatically allow for the 80% going rate reduction (which was the old Shortage Occupation List rule), that I don't qualify as a New Entrant, and that my salary of £30,960 meets neither the general floor of £33,400 nor the full going rate requirement of £38,700.
