[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Dr. Aari, a PhD researcher seeking information about visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Aari and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Aari, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please confirm your age?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm 29 years old. I recently received a job offer in the UK and I'm trying to understand if I qualify for a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your age. That's helpful!

You mentioned a job offer - that's great! To assess your eligibility, could you please tell me, does this job have a sponsor license? In other words, is the employer approved by the UK government to sponsor workers?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the employer does have a sponsor license. They're a pharmaceutical company offering me a position as a Senior Lab Technician.

[root_agent]: That's excellent to hear! Knowing they have a sponsor license is a very important first step.

Now, is the job of Senior Lab Technician at the required skill level - that is, is it at least RQF level 3 (A-level equivalent) or above?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe it is. I actually have a PhD in Microbiology, and the role is for a Senior Lab Technician at the pharmaceutical company. It requires specialized knowledge in my field.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic – a PhD in Microbiology certainly indicates a role at the required skill level.

To continue, could you please confirm that you meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. I've completed my education with English as the medium of instruction.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! That simplifies things. 

Now, could you please tell me, what is the annual salary offered to you for the Senior Lab Technician position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £34,000 per year for the Senior Lab Technician position.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And do you know what the standard going rate is for a Senior Lab Technician role in your specific area of the UK? If not, an estimate is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for this role is around £38,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Finally, could you please confirm that your PhD is in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics) subject?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my PhD is in Microbiology, which is definitely a STEM subject. It's also directly relevant to my role as a Senior Lab Technician in a pharmaceutical company.

[root_agent]: Excellent! Based on the information you’ve provided – your age, a sponsored job at the correct skill level, meeting the English language requirements, having a relevant STEM PhD, a salary of £34,000, and a standard going rate of £38,000 – it appears you **would be AWARDED** the Skilled Worker visa under the STEM PhD criteria.

Your salary meets both the lower general threshold of £33,400 and is above 80% of the going rate (£30,400).



Is there anything else I can help you with today, Aari?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I would be awarded the Skilled Worker visa. They accurately identified that my salary (£34,000) meets both the lower general threshold (£33,400) and exceeds 80% of the going rate (£30,400), while correctly recognizing the relevance of my STEM PhD for the special eligibility pathway.
