[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lars and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lars, nice to meet you. I'm here to help! To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for a UK work visa. I've received a job offer as a specialist stonemason in the UK, and I want to understand if I'm eligible for this visa with my current offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lars, that's great to hear. The UK has a Skilled Worker visa which might be suitable for you. 

To assess your eligibility, let's start with your salary. Could you please tell me your annual salary offer in pounds sterling?

[evaluation_judge]: My salary offer is £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lars. That's helpful. 

Now, do you know what the standard going rate is for a Specialist Stonemason in the UK? (Please provide the amount in pounds sterling, if you know it).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the standard going rate for a Specialist Stonemason is £33,500 per year.

[root_agent]: Excellent, Lars. Thank you for that information.

Is the job offer you've received from a company that is approved by the Home Office to sponsor workers? In other words, do they have a Sponsor Licence?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company has a Sponsor Licence and is approved by the Home Office to sponsor workers.

[root_agent]: Great. And just to confirm, does this role require a skill level of RQF level 3 or above? (Essentially, is it considered a skilled role?)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a skilled role at RQF level 3 or above.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lars. Finally, do you meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker visa? (For example, do you have a recognised English language qualification, or are you a national of a majority English-speaking country?)

[evaluation_judge]: I'm from Norway, so I'm not from a majority English-speaking country, but I do have a recognised English language qualification that meets the requirements.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! Based on the information you've provided – your job as a Specialist Stonemason is on the Immigration Salary List, your salary of £34,000 meets both the £33,400 threshold *and* the standard going rate of £33,500, you have a sponsoring employer, the job is at the required skill level, and you meet the English language requirements – it appears you **are eligible** for the Skilled Worker visa.



Essentially, because your job is on the Immigration Salary List, you don’t need to meet the usual higher salary threshold of £41,700.



Would you like me to summarise this, or do you have any other questions?

[evaluation_judge]: That summary is really clear, thank you! So I understand that because my job as a Specialist Stonemason is on the Immigration Salary List, I only need to meet the lower salary threshold of £33,400 rather than the usual £41,700. And since my salary of £34,000 exceeds both that threshold and the going rate of £33,500, I'm eligible for the visa. That's great news! I don't have any other questions right now.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Lars! I'm delighted I could provide clarity and good news. If you do have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Best of luck with your visa application and your move to the UK!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly assessed that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker visa. They accurately explained that since my job is on the Immigration Salary List, I only need to meet the lower threshold of £33,400 (not the standard £41,700), and my salary of £34,000 exceeds both this threshold and the going rate of £33,500.
