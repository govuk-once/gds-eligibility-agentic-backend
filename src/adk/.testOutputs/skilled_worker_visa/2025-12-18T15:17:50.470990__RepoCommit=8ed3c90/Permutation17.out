[evaluation_judge]: I'll now role-play as Yuki, a UK resident with a Skilled Worker visa who wants to understand if she can take a second job.

Hi, i'm Yuki and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Yuki, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you please confirm if your current Skilled Worker visa is still valid?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my Skilled Worker visa is valid. I'm currently working as a Graphic Designer with a company that sponsors my visa. I'm just wondering if I can take on a weekend job as a bartender for about 10 hours per week to earn some extra money. Is that allowed under my visa conditions?

[root_agent]: That's good to know your visa is valid. Thank you for explaining your situation.

Now, is the second job – the bartending role – in the *same* occupation code as your main job as a Graphic Designer?

[evaluation_judge]: No, bartending is completely different from my main job as a Graphic Designer. They're definitely not in the same occupation code. I was just thinking it might be a good way to earn some extra money on weekends when I'm not doing my regular work.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. 

Is the job of a bartender currently listed on the UK government's Immigration Salary List of shortage occupations? This list is sometimes referred to as the 'Immigration Skills Shortage List'.

[evaluation_judge]: I don't believe bartending is on any shortage occupation list. It's just a regular hospitality job. I just thought since it's only 10 hours a week on weekends it might be okay, but I want to make sure I don't violate my visa conditions.

[root_agent]: You are right to check, it's important to be sure!

Based on the information you've provided – your main job is as a Graphic Designer, your second job would be as a Bartender, it isn’t in the same occupation code, and it isn’t on the shortage occupation list – unfortunately, taking on this second job would not be permitted under the conditions of your Skilled Worker visa.





[evaluation_judge]: I see. So I can't take the bartending job even though it's just for 10 hours on weekends? That's disappointing. Is there any type of second job I could take legally with my current visa situation?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment. You are correct, even 10 hours a week wouldn't be permitted in this case.

However, there *is* a possibility. Would you be able to take on additional work as a Graphic Designer, perhaps freelance work, alongside your current role? This would need to be within the same occupation code as your main job.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's helpful to know! So if I found some freelance graphic design work instead, that would be allowed since it's the same occupation as my main job? Would there still be an hour limit on how much I could do per week?
