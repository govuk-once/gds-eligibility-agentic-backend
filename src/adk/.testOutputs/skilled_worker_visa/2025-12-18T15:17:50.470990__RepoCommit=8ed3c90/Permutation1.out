[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Elena and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Elena, nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please confirm your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 35 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Elena. And could you please tell me your nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm Brazilian.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Do you have a job offer in the UK currently?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer as a Senior Engineering Manager at a fintech firm in London.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear! Approximately what is the salary offered in this role, per year?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary offer is £85,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Senior Engineering Manager role in London, according to official UK government sources? (Just an approximate figure is fine if you don't have the exact number.)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the standard going rate for this role is £75,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And just to confirm, does the company offering you this position have a UK Sponsor Licence, allowing them to sponsor workers?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the fintech firm is a licensed sponsor.

[root_agent]: Great. Is the job offer at a skill level of RQF level 6 or above? (This usually means a degree or equivalent).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the job is at RQF Level 6.

[root_agent]: Perfect. Finally, have you taken a Secure English Language Test (SELT) and met the required standard for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I passed the SELT with distinction.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Elena. Based on what you’ve told me – your age, nationality, a job offer as a Senior Engineering Manager with a salary of £85,000, a going rate of £75,000, a licensed sponsor, the job being at RQF level 6, and passing the SELT – you appear to **meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa** without needing to use the tradeable points system.

**AWARDED.**



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I meet all the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa and awarded eligibility, matching the expected outcome without providing any erroneous information.
