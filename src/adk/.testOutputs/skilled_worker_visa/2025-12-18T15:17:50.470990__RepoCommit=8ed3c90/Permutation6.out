[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Wei, it's nice to meet you! I understand you'd like to understand your eligibility for a benefit. 

To start, could you please confirm if you have a job offer from a UK employer who is a licensed sponsor?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer from a UK University as a Postdoctoral Researcher. They are a licensed sponsor.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Wei! 

Is the job offer at the required skill level – specifically, is it at a Regulated Qualification Framework (RQF) level 3 or above?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm a physicist and the role is a Postdoctoral Researcher position. It's definitely above RQF level 3 - it's a high-skilled research position.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Do you meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker visa? This generally involves passing a Secure English Language Test (SELT) to the required standard.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements for the visa.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Wei.

Your job title is Postdoctoral Researcher. Is that correct, and does your job fall under the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code 2114?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My job title is Postdoctoral Researcher in physics, and it falls under the Standard Occupational Classification code 2114.

[root_agent]: Wonderful. Now, could you please tell me your annual salary for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: My annual salary offer for this position is £33,500.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Wei. Do you know what the standard going rate is for a Postdoctoral Researcher (SOC code 2114) in your specific area of the UK? This information should be available from your sponsoring university.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for this role is £46,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Wei. Based on everything you've told me, it appears you qualify for a discounted salary threshold due to your role as a Postdoctoral Researcher in a qualifying scientific field. 

To confirm, 70% of the standard going rate of £46,000 is £32,200. Your salary of £33,500 is above both the general threshold of £33,400 *and* the discounted rate of £32,200.

Therefore, based on the information provided, you are **AWARDED** – you appear to meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa under the discounted salary rates for postdoctoral positions.





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa with my postdoctoral researcher position. They accurately checked that my salary (£33,500) meets both the general threshold (£33,400) and the 70% discounted going rate requirement (£32,200), leading to the correct "AWARDED" outcome.
