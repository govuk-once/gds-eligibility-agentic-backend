[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Claire, a US executive looking to understand benefit eligibility in the UK.

Hi, i'm Claire and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Claire, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start with, could you tell me which benefit you are interested in exploring your eligibility for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I've recently been offered a CEO position at a small start-up in the UK. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with the salary I've been offered. They're offering me £55,000 per year, which seems good, but I want to make sure it meets the requirements before I proceed with the application process.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's great to know, Claire. Thank you for providing that information. 

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, I need to ask you a few questions. 

Firstly, are you currently a citizen of a country outside of the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm a US citizen currently living in the United States. I don't have UK citizenship or permanent residency.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Claire. 

Now, has the UK start-up that offered you the CEO position already obtained a Sponsor Licence? This is required for them to sponsor you for a Skilled Worker visa.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they've confirmed that they have a valid Sponsor Licence already in place. They mentioned they're all set up to sponsor international employees.

[root_agent]: That's excellent news, Claire. Knowing they have a Sponsor Licence is a very important step.

To continue assessing your eligibility, could you please confirm the specific job title that will be listed on your Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)? The official job title is important for determining the correct salary requirements.

[evaluation_judge]: The job title will be Chief Executive Officer (CEO). It's to lead their small tech start-up that's expanding into the UK market.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Claire. That’s helpful.

Now, to confirm, your annual salary for this Chief Executive Officer position is £55,000, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: That's correct. The offered salary is £55,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Claire.

To assess your eligibility further, are you aware of the 'going rate' for a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in the UK? This is a specific salary level set by the Home Office for immigration purposes, and it may be higher than your offered salary.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure about the specific 'going rate' for CEOs in the UK according to the Home Office. I've heard it's something I need to meet, but I don't know the exact figure. Is £55,000 sufficient?

[root_agent]: That's a very good question, Claire. You're right to ask about the 'going rate'. 

According to the current guidance, the going rate for a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) – specifically, SOC code 1115 – is £78,000 per year.

Therefore, your offered salary of £55,000 is unfortunately below the required going rate for this position.





[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. So even though £55,000 seems like a good salary to me, it's actually below what's required for a CEO position in the UK. Does that mean I wouldn't qualify for the Skilled Worker visa with this offer?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood correctly, Claire. Unfortunately, that is the case. 

Even though your salary exceeds the general threshold of £38,700 (which was updated April 4th 2024), the Skilled Worker visa requires you to meet *both* the general threshold *and* the 'going rate' for your specific job role. 

Since your salary of £55,000 is below the going rate of £78,000 for a CEO (SOC code 1115), your application would likely be refused.



I understand this might be disappointing news. Would you like me to explain anything further about the requirements for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: That is disappointing. Could the company possibly adjust my title to something that has a lower going rate, or would I need the full £78,000 to qualify? I'm just wondering if there are any alternatives that might work with the current salary.

[root_agent]: That's a sensible question to ask, Claire.

While the company *could* potentially adjust your job title, it would need to accurately reflect your actual duties and responsibilities. The Home Office scrutinizes job titles and descriptions carefully to prevent abuse of the system. Simply changing the title to one with a lower going rate wouldn’t be sufficient if your responsibilities still align with those of a CEO.

Furthermore, the job title must also align with the duties listed on the Certificate of Sponsorship.

Essentially, to qualify with your current salary, the company would need to offer a genuinely different role with a lower going rate that accurately reflects what you’d be doing. They couldn’t simply re-title your CEO position to circumvent the salary requirements.

To qualify for the Skilled Worker visa with your current salary, the company would need to increase it to at least £78,000 per year, which is the current going rate for a CEO (SOC code 1115).

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. It seems I either need a genuinely different role that matches the salary, or the company would need to increase the salary offer to at least £78,000 to meet the requirements for a CEO position. Thanks for explaining this so clearly - it helps me understand what options I might have moving forward.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Claire! I’m glad I could clarify things for you. It’s good you have a clear understanding of your options now. 

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the Skilled Worker visa or any other UK benefits today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that covers everything I needed to know about my eligibility. I'll discuss these requirements with the company and see if they're willing to increase the salary or if we need to reconsider the position. Thank you for your help today.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Claire. I wish you the best of luck with those discussions! Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with a £55,000 salary as a CEO, since it fails to meet the required "going rate" of £78,000 for this occupation (SOC code 1115), despite meeting the general threshold. The information provided matched the expected outcome of refusal.
