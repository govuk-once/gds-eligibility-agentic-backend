[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi John, nice to meet you! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 32 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And have you recently completed any studies, such as a degree or postgraduate course? By 'recently' I mean within the last six months.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't recently completed any studies. I've been working for several years now.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. What is the job you have been offered? Specifically, what is the job title?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Trainee Chartered Accountant.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Are you, or will you be, working towards a recognised professional qualification as part of this role, such as ACCA or ICAEW?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'll be working towards my ACCA qualification as part of this role.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Could you please tell me what your offered annual salary is for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: My offered salary is £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Do you know what the 'going rate' is for this role – a Trainee Chartered Accountant – according to official sources? This is also sometimes referred to as the 'standard occupational salary'.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for this role is £46,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, John. Based on what you’ve told me, it appears you may be eligible for a salary discount related to being a ‘New Entrant’ due to your professional qualifications. 

To confirm, are you currently in the UK on a different type of visa, such as a dependent visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently in the UK on a dependent visa and looking to switch to my own visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you've provided – your age, the fact you're not a recent student, your role as a Trainee Chartered Accountant working towards a recognised professional qualification (ACCA), a salary of £34,000 against a going rate of £46,000, and that you are switching from a dependent visa – it looks like you **would be AWARDED** the Skilled Worker Visa with the salary discount.

Your salary meets the requirements as it is above 70% of the going rate (£32,200). The fact you’re pursuing a professional qualification allows for the New Entrant discount despite being over 26.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker visa with the New Entrant salary discount due to my professional qualification, despite being over 26. The agent confirmed my salary (£34,000) exceeds the required 70% of the going rate (£32,200).
