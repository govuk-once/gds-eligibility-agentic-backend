[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Tariq in this scenario, interacting with an agent who is helping determine benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Tariq and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Tariq, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for different benefits.

To start, could you tell me what type of work you will be doing with this benefit in mind?

[evaluation_judge]: I've recently been offered a job as a Junior Data Analyst in the UK with a salary of £34,000. I was previously on a PhD Student Visa for 3 years, then on a Graduate Visa for 3 years and 6 months. My employer wants to sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa for 2 years, and they mentioned something about using a New Entrant discount for the salary requirements. I just want to know if I'm eligible for this.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details, Tariq. That's very helpful.

To clarify, you mentioned you were on a Graduate Visa for 3 years and 6 months. Could you confirm if you’ve *already* started working as a Junior Data Analyst under the Skilled Worker visa, or is this a brand new application?

[evaluation_judge]: This would be a brand new application for a Skilled Worker visa. I'm currently still on my Graduate visa, which is about to expire. I've been in the UK for about 6.5 years total (3 years on Student visa during my PhD, followed by the 3.5 years on Graduate visa). My potential employer is now looking to sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Tariq. 

Just to be certain, when you refer to the "New Entrant" discount, are you aware of the time limits associated with using it? Specifically, that time spent on Student and Graduate visas can count towards a maximum of 4 years total when utilizing this discount?

[evaluation_judge]: I've heard something about time limits, but I'm not entirely clear on the details. My employer just mentioned that they wanted to use the New Entrant discount for my salary requirements. I didn't realize that time on my Graduate visa would count toward some 4-year maximum. Could you explain how this works and whether I'm still eligible?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Tariq. Let me explain.

The "New Entrant" discount allows employers to pay you slightly less than the usual salary requirement for the Skilled Worker visa. However, this discount has a condition: you can only benefit from it for a combined total of 4 years, including any time you've *already* spent on a Student or Graduate visa.

You mentioned being on a PhD Student Visa for 3 years and a Graduate Visa for 3 years and 6 months. That means you've already accumulated 6 years and 6 months of time that could potentially count towards this 4-year limit.

Therefore, applying for a 2-year Skilled Worker visa *using* the New Entrant discount would unfortunately exceed that 4-year limit.

Do you understand how this applies to your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so because I've already been on a Graduate visa for 3.5 years, and that time counts toward the 4-year New Entrant limit, I can't be granted a 2-year visa using the New Entrant discount because it would exceed the 4-year maximum. Is that correct?

So what are my options now? Would I need to be paid the full salary amount without the discount to qualify for the Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Tariq. That’s a perfect understanding of the situation. Because you've already spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa, applying for a 2-year Skilled Worker visa with the New Entrant discount would go over the 4-year limit.

And yes, your primary option would be to be paid the full salary amount, meeting the standard salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa *without* relying on the New Entrant discount. This would allow you to be sponsored for the 2-year visa.

Would you like me to explain the standard salary requirements for a Junior Data Analyst to confirm if that's a viable option for you and your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. What would be the standard salary requirements without the New Entrant discount for a Junior Data Analyst position? My employer has offered £34,000 currently.

[root_agent]: Okay, Tariq. Let's look at the standard salary requirements.

As of April 4th, 2024, the general threshold for Skilled Worker visas is £38,700 per year. However, a "new entrant" salary (which is what you would need to meet without the discount, since you've exceeded the 4-year limit) has a minimum of £33,900.

Since your offered salary is £34,000, it *does* exceed the £33,900 new entrant threshold, but is below the general threshold. 

Therefore, if your employer adjusts your salary to meet the general threshold of £38,700, or if they are willing to sponsor you at the standard rate without relying on the New Entrant discount at your current £34,000 salary after assessment, you would be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit confused now. You just said that the "new entrant" salary minimum is £33,900, and my offer is £34,000, which exceeds that. But then you said I would need to meet the general threshold of £38,700. Which one applies to me? 

If I've exceeded the 4-year limit for the New Entrant discount, does that mean I automatically need to meet the general threshold of £38,700?

[root_agent]: You are right to ask for clarification, Tariq – my apologies for the confusion! You’ve pinpointed the core issue perfectly.

You are correct. Since you’ve used more than 4 years under the New Entrant provisions (through your Student & Graduate visas), you *no longer qualify* for the New Entrant salary rate of £33,900.

This means you **must** now meet the general salary threshold for a Skilled Worker visa, which is currently **£38,700 per year**.

My previous statement mentioning exceeding the £33,900 was a holdover from discussing the New Entrant route, which as we’ve established, is no longer available to you.

Essentially, exceeding the 4-year New Entrant limit means you lose access to the lower salary band and *must* be paid the general threshold to be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa.

Is that clearer now?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's much clearer. So because I've already used up my 4-year New Entrant period with my 3.5 years on a Graduate visa, I would need a salary offer of at least £38,700 to qualify for the Skilled Worker visa, not the £34,000 I've been offered. 

This is really helpful information - I'll need to discuss this with my potential employer to see if they can increase their salary offer to meet this threshold.

[root_agent]: You've got it exactly right, Tariq. That’s a perfect summary of the situation. 

I’m very glad I could help clarify things for you. It's a good idea to discuss this with your potential employer as soon as possible. 

If you have any further questions as you continue the process, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to assist you.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for all your help explaining this. I appreciate having a clear understanding of my situation now.

✓ The agent correctly identified that I would not be eligible for the New Entrant discount since I've already spent 3.5 years on a Graduate visa, which would exceed the 4-year maximum when adding a 2-year Skilled Worker visa. They accurately explained I would need to meet the general salary threshold of £38,700 instead of the £34,000 I was offered.
