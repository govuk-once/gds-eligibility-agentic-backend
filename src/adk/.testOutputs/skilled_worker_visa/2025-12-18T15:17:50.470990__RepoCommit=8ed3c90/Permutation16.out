[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi John, nice to meet you! I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant. To help me understand your eligibility, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in understanding if I can apply for a Skilled Worker visa. I've been offered a job as an HR Manager in the UK with a salary of £35,000, but I'm not sure if that's enough. I have a PhD in Astrophysics, if that makes any difference.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, John. That's very helpful. 

To start, could you please confirm if the job you’ve been offered is from a company that is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office? You can check the register of licensed sponsors here: [https://www.gov.uk/licensed-sponsors](https://www.gov.uk/licensed-sponsors) (though I can't directly access that link myself). Knowing this will be an important first step.





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've checked and the company is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office. They've already gone through all the proper checks and have confirmed they can sponsor me for this HR Manager position.

[root_agent]: That's excellent news, John! Knowing they are a licensed sponsor is a key requirement.

Now, to understand your salary in relation to the Skilled Worker visa requirements, could you tell me what the 'going rate' is for an HR Manager role in the UK, as determined by the Home Office? This information is generally found using salary lists. Do you happen to know what the going rate is for that specific role?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for an HR Manager in the UK is £40,000, according to what I've been told. My offer is £35,000, which is below this going rate. That's why I was wondering if my PhD might help with the salary requirements, even though it's in Astrophysics.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, John. It’s good you’ve researched the going rate.

You mentioned having a PhD in Astrophysics, and that you were hoping it might help with the salary requirements. To clarify, are you aware that having a PhD in a relevant STEM field *can* sometimes allow for a lower salary than the standard going rate, under certain conditions?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've heard that having a PhD in a STEM field might allow for a lower salary requirement. I know my PhD is in Astrophysics which is definitely a STEM field, but I wasn't sure if it would count since I'd be working as an HR Manager. I was wondering if I could use this option to qualify for the visa even though my salary offer is below the standard rate.

[root_agent]: That's a very insightful question, John. You're right to question whether it applies in your situation.

To be clear, the PhD exception *does* require the PhD to be relevant to the job role. Considering your PhD is in Astrophysics and the job is in HR Management, do you believe there’s a clear and direct connection between your PhD studies and the duties of an HR Manager? In other words, could a Home Office caseworker reasonably argue that the PhD is *relevant* to the job?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't think there's a clear and direct connection between my PhD in Astrophysics and an HR Manager position. While I gained some transferable skills during my PhD like problem-solving and analysis, I can't honestly say that studying astrophysics is directly relevant to human resources work. I'm guessing this means I probably can't use my PhD qualification to meet the salary requirement, right?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, John. You've assessed the situation very accurately. 

Because your PhD in Astrophysics isn't directly relevant to the role of HR Manager, you wouldn’t be able to use it to meet the Skilled Worker visa salary requirements. You would need to meet the £40,000 going rate for the position.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears your application would likely be **REFUSED** as your salary offer is below the standard going rate and your PhD doesn’t meet the relevance criteria for a salary discount.



Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you’d like to discuss options with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to understand. Thank you for clarifying that I wouldn't be eligible for the visa with the current offer.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be refused because my PhD in Astrophysics is not relevant to the HR Manager role, meaning I can't use the PhD discount and would need to meet the standard going rate of £40,000.
