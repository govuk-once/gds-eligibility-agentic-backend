[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Kenji in this scenario. I'll begin the conversation and evaluate the agent's response based on whether they correctly identify that Kenji is not eligible for a Skilled Worker visa due to the salary being below the absolute minimum floor of £33,400.

Hi, i'm Kenji and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Kenji, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I've recently been offered a job in the UK as a Graphic Designer. The company says they can sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa, but I'm not sure if I'm eligible with the salary they're offering. They want to pay me £30,000 per year. I'm currently living in Japan.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Kenji. That's good to know the company is willing to sponsor you. To assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa, could you please confirm if you have a bachelor's degree or equivalent?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from a university in Tokyo. I've also been working as a graphic designer for about 4 years now.

[root_agent]: That's excellent, Kenji. Having a bachelor's degree and four years of experience is very helpful. 

To continue assessing your eligibility, could you tell me if you have already checked the 'going rate' for a Graphic Designer in the UK, as listed in the official government occupation codes?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the company told me the going rate is around £29,000 for a Graphic Designer in the UK. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Kenji. And yes, £29,000 is within the reported range for a Graphic Designer.

To help me determine your eligibility, could you please confirm the exact salary offered to you in your job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: The exact salary they're offering me is £30,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification, Kenji. 

I've reviewed the Skilled Worker visa requirements, and unfortunately, with a salary of £30,000, you do not currently meet the minimum salary threshold for this visa. The current minimum salary is £33,400 per year. Even with your degree and experience, the salary needs to be at least this amount to qualify.

Therefore, based on the information provided, your application for a Skilled Worker visa would be **REFUSED** at this time. Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or discuss other potential visa options?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So even though my offered salary of £30,000 is above the going rate for my job, it's still below the minimum threshold of £33,400? Is there no way around this, even with my qualifications and experience?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Kenji. Even though £30,000 is above the 'going rate' for a Graphic Designer, the Skilled Worker visa now has a general salary threshold of £33,400 that *must* be met, regardless of the going rate.

Unfortunately, there are very few ways around this. The rules have recently changed, and unless you fall under a specific exemption (such as being eligible for the Health and Care Worker visa, or meeting the requirements for a New Entrant, which has its own specific, higher salary requirements), the £33,400 threshold applies. Your qualifications and experience are valuable, but they don’t override this minimum salary requirement within the Skilled Worker route. 

I understand this may be disappointing news. Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official government guidance on salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa, so you can review the details yourself? (I can’t *provide* a link directly, but I can tell you where to find it on gov.uk if you wish). Alternatively, we could explore if any other visa categories might be a better fit for your circumstances.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate knowing where to find the official guidance on the government website. And if there are any other visa options that might work for my situation, I'd be interested to hear about those too.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Kenji. You can find the official guidance on the Skilled Worker visa salary requirements here: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/salary-requirements](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/salary-requirements)

Regarding other visa options, it's a bit more complex as a Graphic Designer. The Skilled Worker visa is generally the most straightforward route for sponsored employment. Other possibilities, though potentially less suitable, could include:

*   **High Potential Individual (HPI) Visa:** This is for recent graduates from top universities globally, and doesn't require sponsorship. However, it doesn't lead to settlement directly.
*   **Global Talent Visa:** This is for leaders or potential leaders in specific fields, including digital technology. It’s highly competitive and requires endorsement from a recognised body. Graphic Design may fall under the digital technology category, but it's not guaranteed.
*   **Start-up or Innovator Founder visa:** If you have a viable business idea, you could potentially establish a business in the UK.

These alternative visas have different requirements and may not be as applicable to your current situation as the Skilled Worker visa. I would recommend reviewing the details of each visa on the gov.uk website to determine if any might be a suitable option for you.

Would you like me to provide the links for those, or would you prefer to focus on understanding the Skilled Worker visa requirements in more detail first?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for the information and those alternatives. I think I'll review the Skilled Worker visa requirements first since my potential employer was planning on that route. Maybe I can discuss with them about increasing the offered salary to meet the threshold. 

One more question - if the company were to increase my salary offer to meet the £33,400 threshold, would I then be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa based on everything else you know about my situation?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Kenji. That sounds like a sensible plan - discussing a salary increase with your employer is a good step.

And yes, *if* the company were to increase your salary offer to at least £33,400 per year, and *assuming* all other requirements are met (valid sponsor license, your English language ability, your degree is assessed as equivalent to a UK bachelor's, and your job aligns with the skilled occupation code), then you *would* likely be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa based on the information you’ve provided so far. 

Essentially, meeting the salary threshold removes the primary obstacle to your eligibility in this scenario. However, it’s important to remember that the Home Office will still assess all aspects of your application thoroughly.



Is there anything else I can help you with at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you for clarifying everything about the Skilled Worker visa requirements. I'll talk to the company about possibly increasing my salary to meet the threshold.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Kenji! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. I wish you the best of luck in your discussions with the company, and I hope you're able to secure a salary that allows you to pursue the Skilled Worker visa.

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would be refused for a Skilled Worker visa because my £30,000 salary is below the absolute minimum threshold of £33,400, regardless of meeting the going rate for my occupation. The information provided was accurate and matched the expected outcome.
