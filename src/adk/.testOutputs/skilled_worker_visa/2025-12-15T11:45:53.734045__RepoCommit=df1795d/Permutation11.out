[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Claire, a US executive, who has a job offer as a CEO in the UK for £55,000 per year. I'll interact with the agent to determine my eligibility for a work visa and then evaluate if they correctly identify that I should be refused due to not meeting the going rate requirement.

Hi, i'm Claire and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Claire, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m here to help you explore your options. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the type of job you’ve been offered in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, thanks for helping me out. I've been offered a position as a Chief Executive Officer at a small start-up in the UK. I'm currently based in the US, and I'm trying to figure out if I would qualify for a work visa with this job offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s excellent information. And could you tell me what salary you’ve been offered for this role as Chief Executive Officer?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £55,000 per year for this CEO role. It seems like a decent offer to me, but I'm not sure if it's enough for the UK visa requirements.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just to confirm, you’re being offered £55,000 per year as a Chief Executive Officer? Now, let’s look at the typical salary for this type of role. Could you tell me what the ‘Going Rate’ is for a CEO in the UK, according to the official guidelines?

[evaluation_judge]: To be honest, I'm not sure what the 'Going Rate' is for a CEO in the UK. That's part of what I'm trying to figure out. I know £55,000 seems like a good salary, but I don't know how it compares to standard rates for my position in the UK or what's required for visa purposes.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Let me quickly check the official information. According to the Skilled Worker Visa requirements, the ‘Going Rate’ for a Chief Executive Officer (Code 1115) is £78,000 per year. Do you understand that the salary you’re being offered, £55,000, is lower than the standard ‘Going Rate’ for this occupation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. I didn't realize the going rate was that high. So my offer of £55,000 is lower than the standard rate of £78,000 for a CEO position. What does this mean for my visa application?

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on the information we’ve discussed, your salary of £55,000 falls below the ‘Going Rate’ of £78,000 for a Chief Executive Officer. This means that, unfortunately, you wouldn’t currently meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa. 

Would you like me to explain in more detail why this is the case, or perhaps explore if there are any other visa options that might be available, although they may be less likely given this situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd like to understand why my salary being below the going rate is a problem, even though £55,000 still seems like a good salary to me. And if there are any alternatives or exceptions I might qualify for, that would be helpful to know too.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The ‘Going Rate’ is a key component of the Skilled Worker Visa. It’s designed to ensure that individuals on a Skilled Worker Visa are paid fairly for their skills and experience, aligning with the UK market rate. When your salary is below the ‘Going Rate’, it suggests you’re being underpaid relative to similar roles in the UK, and the visa aims to prevent this.

While the ‘Going Rate’ is a significant hurdle, there are a few potential, although less common, routes we could investigate. However, they’d require a very strong case to demonstrate exceptional skills or contributions that justify a salary outside the standard ‘Going Rate’. 

Could you tell me a little about your specific experience and qualifications as a CEO? Specifically, could you describe the scale and complexity of the business you oversee, and the impact you’ve had on the company’s performance?

[evaluation_judge]: I have about 12 years of experience in executive roles, with the last 4 years as a VP of Operations at a mid-sized tech company in California. I have an MBA from Stanford and specialized experience in scaling SaaS businesses.

This UK startup has about 15 employees and has just secured Series A funding. They're looking for someone with my background to help them expand into international markets, particularly North America where I have extensive contacts. In my previous role, I helped grow company revenue by 30% year-over-year and led a team of about 50 people.

I understand this is a smaller company than what I currently work for, which might explain the lower salary, but I was excited about the growth potential and the equity package they offered alongside the base salary.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detailed information, Claire. That’s a very impressive background with significant experience and achievements. I appreciate you outlining the company’s situation and the potential for growth.

Let’s revisit the ‘Going Rate’ for a CEO. As we established, it's £78,000. Considering your experience, MBA, and specific expertise in scaling SaaS businesses – particularly your proven track record of revenue growth – it’s certainly understandable why you believe £55,000 is a reasonable offer. However, based on the Skilled Worker Visa criteria, that salary is still below the required ‘Going Rate.’

Given your strong qualifications and the company’s growth potential, it’s a difficult situation. While exploring alternative visa routes is possible, they would likely require demonstrating exceptional value that substantially exceeds the standard ‘Going Rate’.

Based on our conversation, I must conclude that you are unlikely to be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa at this time, primarily due to the salary not meeting the ‘Going Rate’ requirement. 

Would you like me to summarise the key points of our conversation, or perhaps explore some general information about other visa options that might be applicable, even if the chances of success are lower?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, a summary of the key points would be helpful, and I'd be interested in hearing if there are any other visa options I could explore, even if they're less likely to work out.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s summarise the key points of our conversation:

*   **Job Offer:** You’ve been offered a role as Chief Executive Officer at a small UK startup.
*   **Salary:** The offered salary is £55,000 per year.
*   **‘Going Rate’:** The ‘Going Rate’ for a CEO in the UK is £78,000, as per the Skilled Worker Visa requirements.
*   **Eligibility:** Your current salary of £55,000 falls below the ‘Going Rate’, making you ineligible for a Skilled Worker Visa at this time.
*   **Your Background:** You have extensive executive experience, including an MBA and a proven track record of growth and team leadership.

Now, regarding alternative visa options, while the Skilled Worker Visa is the most straightforward route, there are a few others you could potentially investigate, though they are more complex and less likely to be successful:

*   **Global Talent Visa:** This visa is for leaders or potential leaders in specific fields (science, humanities, engineering, arts, digital technology). Given your experience and skills, it *might* be worth exploring, but it’s highly competitive and requires demonstrating exceptional talent.
*   **Innovator Visa:** This visa is for entrepreneurs who want to set up a new business in the UK. Since you’ve been offered a CEO role, this option wouldn’t be suitable.

It's important to note that these alternative routes would require a thorough assessment of your qualifications and potentially significant additional documentation and legal advice.

Would you like me to provide more detail on any of these alternative visa options, or would you prefer to simply conclude our conversation for today?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that covers everything I needed to know. It's clear that with my current salary offer, I wouldn't qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa since I'm below the going rate, even though I meet the general threshold. I'll discuss this with the company to see if they can increase their offer to meet the £78,000 requirement, or I'll look into the Global Talent Visa option you mentioned.

Thank you for your help in explaining these requirements to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Claire. I’m glad I could clarify the requirements and explore some potential options with you. It sounds like a sensible next step to discuss the salary with the company or investigate the Global Talent Visa. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I wish you the best of luck with your decision-making process.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would be refused for a Skilled Worker Visa because my £55,000 salary is below the going rate of £78,000 for a CEO position, even though it exceeds the general threshold of £41,700.
