[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Elena, it’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me, what is your current nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm Brazilian. I'm currently living in Brazil but I've been offered a job in London.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. And to confirm, you are a 35-year-old software engineering manager, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm 35 and I've been working as a software engineering manager for several years. I have about 10 years of experience in the field overall.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear. Now, regarding your experience, do you hold a PhD or any other postgraduate qualifications?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a PhD. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and various professional certifications, but no postgraduate qualifications.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Let’s move on to your job offer. Could you tell me the specific job title you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Senior Engineering Manager at a fintech company in London.

[root_agent]: Alright. And can you confirm the specific salary you’ve been offered for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £85,000 per year for this role.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, I need to check the standard going rate for this type of role. Could you tell me what level of qualification this job requires, according to the UK’s standard occupational classifications (RQF)?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe it's a RQF Level 6 position. The company mentioned that this is considered a graduate-level role that requires substantial experience.

[root_agent]: Okay, a RQF Level 6 position. And to confirm, the standard going rate for a Senior Engineering Manager in London is currently £75,000 per year, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The standard going rate for this position is £75,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Perfect. Finally, could you confirm that the company offering you the job is a licensed sponsor under the Skilled Worker Visa scheme?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they confirmed they are a licensed sponsor under the Skilled Worker Visa scheme.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And to ensure we’re covering all bases, can you confirm that you meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa – typically demonstrated through a Secure English Language Test (SELT) with a good level of proficiency?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do. I've passed the SELT with distinction actually.

[root_agent]: Fantastic! Thank you for providing all of that information, Elena. Based on the salary (£85,000), the going rate (£75,000), and the fact that you're working for a licensed sponsor, and you’ve met the English language requirements, I’m pleased to confirm that you *are* eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. 

**AWARDED.** Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official UK government website for more information about the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: That's wonderful news! Yes, a link to the official website would be very helpful as I start preparing my application. Thank you for confirming my eligibility.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! Here’s the link to the official UK government website for the Skilled Worker Visa: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa).  Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed for now. Thank you for your help in confirming my eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa. I'll check out that website and start preparing my application.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa based on meeting all criteria: licensed sponsor, job at RQF Level 6, meeting English requirements, salary (£85,000) above both the general threshold (£41,700) and going rate (£75,000).
