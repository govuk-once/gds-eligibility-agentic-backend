[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Priya and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya. It’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me when you initially obtained your Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been living in the UK on my Skilled Worker visa since 2022. I'm now looking at taking a new job with a different company.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Priya. That’s helpful to know. And to clarify, when you say “since 2022,” were you holding the visa *before* April 4th, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, definitely. I've had my Skilled Worker visa since 2022, so well before April 4th, 2024.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And could you please confirm that you are looking to extend your current visa or change employers?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm looking to change employers. I've been offered a Marketing Manager position at a new agency.

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya. Thank you for confirming. Let’s talk about the job itself. What is the salary being offered for this Marketing Manager position?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary offer is £32,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, I want to check something about the standard going rate for Marketing Managers in the UK. The standard going rate is currently capped at £41,700. Does the salary you’ve been offered fall within that £41,700 threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my offer is £32,000, which is below the £41,700 standard threshold you mentioned.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Let’s move on to the transitional arrangements. The going rate for Skilled Worker visas granted before April 4th, 2024, is based on the 25th percentile, which is currently £30,000. Does your new job offer a salary of £32,000 or more?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my job offer is for £32,000, which is above the £30,000 transitional going rate you mentioned.

[root_agent]: Great. Just to confirm, are you seeking to extend your current visa or change employers?

[evaluation_judge]: I want to change employers. I'm moving from my current company to a new marketing agency.

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya. Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you held a Skilled Worker visa before April 4th, 2024, and are changing employers – you likely qualify for the transitional arrangements. Would you agree?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that sounds right. I've been on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022 and I'm changing employers now.

[root_agent]: Fantastic. I’m pleased to confirm that you do qualify for the transitional arrangements.  Is there anything else you’d like me to clarify regarding your eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: Can you just explain what this means for my visa application overall? Am I eligible to continue on the Skilled Worker route with this new job?

[root_agent]: Certainly. Because you held a Skilled Worker visa prior to April 4th, 2024, and are changing employers, you’re eligible to continue on the Skilled Worker route with this new role. However, due to the transitional arrangements, your general salary threshold is capped at £29,000, and your going rate is based on the 25th percentile, which is £30,000. This means your salary of £32,000 will be considered within the permitted range for the transitional arrangements. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense! So to confirm, my application for a Skilled Worker visa with this new employer should be successful because my £32,000 salary exceeds both the £29,000 general threshold and the £30,000 going rate under the transitional arrangements?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Priya. Your application for a Skilled Worker visa with this new employer should be successful based on those criteria. Congratulations! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's all I needed to know. Thank you for the clear explanation!

✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for a Skilled Worker visa under the transitional arrangements, as my salary of £32,000 exceeds both the transitional general threshold (£29,000) and the transitional going rate (£30,000) for someone who held a Skilled Worker visa before April 4, 2024.
