[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Aari and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Dr. Aari. It’s lovely to speak with you. To start, could you please tell me what your current job role is?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a biological researcher with a PhD in Microbiology. I've recently received a job offer as a Senior Lab Technician at a pharmaceutical company here in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. And to confirm, you have a PhD in Microbiology, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I completed my PhD in Microbiology in India before coming to the UK.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful. And could you tell me what salary you’ve been offered for this Senior Lab Technician role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £34,000 per year for the role.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, could you please tell me what the standard going rate for a Senior Lab Technician role in the UK is?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for this role is about £38,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Alright. And just to be clear, 80% of that standard going rate would be approximately £30,400, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. 80% of the £38,000 going rate would be £30,400.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Now, do you currently have a sponsor in place who can support your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the pharmaceutical company that offered me the job is a licensed sponsor and they're willing to sponsor my visa.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news! And just to confirm, you are applying for a Skilled Worker Visa, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm looking to apply for a Skilled Worker Visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Let’s move on to English language requirements. Do you feel you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe I do. I completed my PhD in English and I've taken the required English language tests as well.

[root_agent]: Okay, fantastic. Finally, could you confirm that your PhD is in a STEM subject, specifically Microbiology?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my PhD is in Microbiology, which is definitely a STEM subject. It falls under the biological sciences category.

[root_agent]: Great! Thank you for providing all of that information, Dr. Aari. Let’s summarize: You have a relevant STEM PhD (Microbiology), a job offer as a Senior Lab Technician at a licensed sponsor, a salary of £34,000 per year, and you meet the English language requirements. Your salary meets the lower general threshold of £33,400 and is also above 80% of the standard going rate (£30,400).

Based on this, I can confirm that you are eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa.

**AWARDED.**

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I was eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately recognized that my STEM PhD allowed me to qualify for the lower salary threshold, and confirmed my salary of £34,000 exceeded both the lower general threshold (£33,400) and the discounted going rate (£30,400).
