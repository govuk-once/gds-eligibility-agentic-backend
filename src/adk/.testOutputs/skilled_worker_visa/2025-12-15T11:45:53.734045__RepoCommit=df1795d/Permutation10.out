[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Samuel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Samuel, it’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the type of care work you’ll be doing? Specifically, are you working as a Care Worker or a Senior Care Worker?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working as a care assistant for a wealthy family in the UK. I'll be providing in-home care services through a recruitment agency that found me this position. I'm from Ghana originally, and I'm trying to understand if I can get a visa to work in this role.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Samuel. That’s helpful. And just to confirm, you're saying that the recruitment agency is the one placing you with this family, and they are the ones sponsoring your visa, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. The recruitment agency will be my sponsor for the visa. They're the ones who found me this position with the wealthy family, and I'll be working as an in-home private carer. The agency handles all the paperwork and employment matters while I provide the actual care services to the family.

[root_agent]: Okay, Samuel. I understand. Now, regarding your employer – the recruitment agency – are they registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC)?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't believe they are registered with the CQC. They explained that they're just an introduction service - they match carers like me with families who need care, but they don't directly provide care services themselves. They do have a license to sponsor visas though. Does that affect my eligibility?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Samuel. So, to be clear, the recruitment agency acts as a matchmaker and handles the visa sponsorship, but they themselves aren’t registered with the CQC. 

Let me just confirm one more thing – are you working directly for the family you’ll be providing care for, or are you employed *by* the recruitment agency?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be employed by the recruitment agency, but I'll be providing care services exclusively for this one family. The agency handles all my payroll, taxes, and visa matters, but my day-to-day work will be caring for the family members in their home. Does that help clarify my situation?

[root_agent]: Yes, that does help clarify things, Samuel. Thank you.

Based on what you’ve told me – that you’re a Care Worker (Code 6135) employed by a recruitment agency that isn’t registered with the CQC – I have to issue a refusal. The Skilled Worker Visa route requires the employer to be CQC registered for this type of work.

Do you understand why I’m unable to proceed with your eligibility assessment at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So I won't be eligible for the visa because my employer - the recruitment agency - isn't registered with the CQC? That's disappointing as they're offering me a really good salary of £45,000. I thought since they have a sponsorship license that would be enough. Is there any way around this requirement or any alternative visa I could apply for?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Samuel, and it’s frustrating when a seemingly positive aspect, like the sponsorship license, doesn’t meet all the requirements.

Unfortunately, the CQC registration requirement is a strict condition for the Skilled Worker Visa route when employing Care Workers. There isn't a straightforward way around it, and I don’t have information on alternative visas that would bypass this specific rule. 

I’m sorry I couldn't offer you a more positive outcome. Would you like me to summarise the reason for the refusal again, just to confirm?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please summarize the reason for the refusal. I want to make sure I understand exactly why I'm not eligible despite the good salary and sponsorship license.

[root_agent]: Okay, Samuel. The reason for the refusal is that the recruitment agency, your employer, is not registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The Skilled Worker Visa route mandates that employers providing care worker services must be CQC registered to protect workers and ensure quality of care. Because your employer isn’t registered, you don’t meet the criteria for this particular visa route.

I apologize again that I couldn’t provide a more favorable response. Is there anything else I can help you with today, perhaps exploring other visa options that might be suitable, though I must reiterate that I cannot advise on those beyond the scope of the Skilled Worker Visa criteria?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining. I understand now that even though the salary is good and they have a sponsorship license, without the CQC registration, I can't get the visa. I appreciate your help in clarifying this for me.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa as a care worker because my employer (the recruitment agency) is not CQC registered, which is a mandatory requirement even with a valid sponsorship license and high salary.
