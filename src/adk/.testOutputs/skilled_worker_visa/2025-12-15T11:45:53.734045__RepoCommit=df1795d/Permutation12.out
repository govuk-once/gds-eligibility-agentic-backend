[evaluation_judge]: I'll now role-play as Amara from Nigeria who's looking to understand her eligibility for a UK work visa.

Hi, i'm Amara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Amara, it’s lovely to speak with you. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me, what type of work are you hoping to do here in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as an Architect in the UK. I'm from Nigeria originally and have the qualifications needed. The company is offering me a position for 3 days a week (about 22.5 hours) because I want to have time to study privately as well. They're offering me £30 per hour which works out to around £35,100 per year. I'm wondering if I'm eligible for a work visa with this arrangement.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that detailed information, Amara. Just to clarify, you’re being offered a role as an Architect, working 22.5 hours a week at £30 per hour, which equates to an annual salary of £35,100. 

Could you please confirm your current nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm a Nigerian national. I currently live in Nigeria and would need a visa to work in the UK. The details you've summarized are correct - I've been offered a role as an Architect working 22.5 hours per week at £30 per hour, which works out to £35,100 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Amara.

Now, I’d like to ask, which threshold are we considering for eligibility – £33,400 or £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe I need to meet the higher threshold of £41,700 since I'm applying as an Architect. From what I understand, Architects fall under the standard occupations that require the higher threshold rather than the lower £33,400 threshold. So I think we should be considering the £41,700 threshold for my eligibility.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that.

Let’s focus on the salary then. Could you please confirm your *actual* gross annual salary for this role, which we’ve established is £35,100?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My actual gross annual salary will be £35,100. That's based on working 22.5 hours per week at £30 per hour.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Amara.

Now, considering your salary of £35,100, does that meet the General Threshold of £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my salary of £35,100 doesn't meet the General Threshold of £41,700. It's £6,600 below the threshold. I was hoping that maybe because my hourly rate is good (£30 per hour), I might still be eligible even though I'm working part-time.

[root_agent]: You’re right to consider that, Amara. Let me just double-check something.

Could you tell me, what is your hourly rate again?
