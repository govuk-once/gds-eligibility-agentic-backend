[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Lars, a stonemason from Norway who wants to check his eligibility for a UK work visa.

Hi, i'm Lars and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Lars, it’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me what kind of job you’ve been offered in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Specialist Stonemason at a restoration company in the UK. It's a good opportunity and I'd like to move from Norway to take it up. The company is offering me £34,000 per year. I'm not sure if I'll be eligible for a work visa though.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lars, that’s excellent to hear! And thank you for clarifying. To help me assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa, could you tell me, is there a valid sponsor – a UK company – offering you this position?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company offering me the position is a registered sponsor in the UK. They're a restoration company that specializes in historical buildings. They've assured me they can sponsor my visa application.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic news, Lars! Knowing you have a sponsoring employer simplifies things considerably. Now, regarding the job itself, can you tell me what skill level this Specialist Stonemason role falls under?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not exactly sure about the specific skill level classification in the UK system. I know that I have formal qualifications as a stonemason from Norway and several years of experience. The company mentioned that the Specialist Stonemason role meets the required skill level for the visa, but I don't know the exact classification they're using.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lars. Let’s clarify that then. To confirm, does this Specialist Stonemason role appear on the Immigration Salary List (ISL)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they told me that Specialist Stonemason is on the Immigration Salary List. That's why they thought I would be eligible for the visa despite the salary being below the main threshold they mentioned.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And could you tell me what the standard going rate is for a Specialist Stonemason, according to the company offering you the job?

[evaluation_judge]: They mentioned that the standard going rate for a Specialist Stonemason in the UK is £33,500 per year. My offer is £34,000, so they said it's above the going rate.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that detail, Lars. Now, let’s check the salary requirements. Could you confirm that your annual salary is at least £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary is £34,000 per year, which is above the £33,400 figure you mentioned.

[root_agent]: Great. And finally, just to be absolutely sure, does your salary meet the standard going rate (100%) for the Specialist Stonemason role, which is £33,500?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary is £34,000, which is above the standard going rate of £33,500 for the Specialist Stonemason role.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lars. Based on the information you’ve provided – a sponsoring employer, a role on the Immigration Salary List, a salary of £34,000 which exceeds both the lower general threshold of £33,400 and the standard going rate of £33,500 – it appears you **AWARDED** for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this assessment, or would you like me to provide any further information about the Skilled Worker Visa requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am awarded the Skilled Worker Visa because my job (Specialist Stonemason) is on the Immigration Salary List, my salary (£34,000) exceeds both the lower threshold (£33,400) and the going rate (£33,500), and I meet all other requirements.
