[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi John, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and assess your eligibility, could you please tell me your age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 32 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Have you recently completed any form of full-time education, such as a degree or postgraduate course? (By 'recently' I mean within the last 6 months)

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't completed any full-time education recently. I'm actually looking to switch from a dependent visa. I've got a job offer as a Trainee Chartered Accountant with a salary of £34,000.

[root_agent]: That's helpful to know, thank you. Are you currently working towards a recognised professional qualification, like ACCA or ICAEW, as part of this Trainee Chartered Accountant role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am working towards my ACCA qualification as part of my trainee role.

[root_agent]: Great. Do you know what the standard going rate is for a Chartered Accountant in your role? (This is the typical salary for the job, regardless of your specific training agreement).

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate is around £46,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Just to confirm, is the professional qualification you're working towards a regulated postgraduate training programme, or a recognised professional qualification like Chartered Accountancy?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a recognised professional qualification - I'm training to become a Chartered Accountant through the ACCA programme.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you may be eligible for a salary discount due to being a new entrant working towards a recognised professional qualification.

To confirm, are you aware that this discount allows a salary below the usual minimum if it meets 70% of the going rate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm aware that new entrants can get a salary discount to 70% of the going rate. I just wanted to make sure I meet the criteria since I'm 32 and not a recent graduate.

[root_agent]: That's excellent - you're right to check, and you've provided all the information I need.

Based on your age (32), the fact you are not a recent student, your job offer as a Trainee Chartered Accountant, a salary of £34,000, and a standard going rate of £46,000, it appears you **qualify for the salary discount** because you are working towards a recognised professional qualification. £34,000 is above 70% of £46,000 (£32,200).

Therefore, you would be **AWARDED** eligibility in this scenario.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I would be awarded eligibility. They understood that despite being over 26 and not a recent student, I qualify as a "New Entrant" due to working toward a recognized professional qualification (ACCA), and my salary of £34,000 exceeds the 70% threshold of the going rate (£32,200).
