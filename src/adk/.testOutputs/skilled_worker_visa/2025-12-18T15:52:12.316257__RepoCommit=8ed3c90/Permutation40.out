[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sophie and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sophie, nice to meet you! I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant. To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in exploring your eligibility for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in understanding my eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa. I'm a French teacher at a private school in the UK, and I'm not sure if my current salary meets the requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. To assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa, could you please tell me your *full-time equivalent* (FTE) annual salary – that is, what you would earn if you worked for 52 weeks a year?



Don't worry if you don't know this figure exactly, an estimate is fine for now.

[evaluation_judge]: My full-time equivalent salary would be £45,000 if I worked for 52 weeks a year. However, I actually only work during term time, which is 39 weeks, so my actual gross salary is £33,750 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, your actual gross salary, reflecting the 39 weeks you work, is £33,750 per year. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My actual gross salary is £33,750 per year for the 39 weeks I work during term time.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Do you know the specific occupation code for your role as a French teacher? This is a six-digit code, often starting with 22. It helps determine the 'going rate' for your profession.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not exactly sure of the specific occupation code. I believe it would be something like 231107 for "Secondary education teaching professionals" or similar, but I don't know the exact code.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful! We can work with that general idea. Just so I have a complete picture, are you currently holding a Skilled Worker visa, or would this be your first time applying?

[evaluation_judge]: This would be my first time applying for a Skilled Worker visa. I've been working at the school under a different arrangement until now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Do you have a PhD qualification in a relevant subject?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a PhD qualification. I have a Master's degree in French Language and Literature, but not a doctorate.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Based on the information you've provided – a current salary of £33,750, an FTE salary of £45,000, being a first-time applicant, and not having a PhD – it appears you unfortunately do not meet the current salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa. 

The general threshold is £41,700, and your actual salary is below that. While your FTE salary is above the threshold, the Home Office assesses eligibility based on what you actually earn when working term-time only.



I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to quickly summarise the key points, or are you happy with this explanation?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you please summarize the key points? I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe since I work in education, there might be some special considerations.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here's a summary of the key points regarding your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa:

* **Salary Threshold:** The Skilled Worker visa generally requires a minimum salary of £41,700 per year.
* **Term-Time Workers:** For those working term-time only (like you as a teacher), the salary assessment is based on your *actual* earnings, not your full-time equivalent (FTE) salary.
* **Your Situation:** Your actual annual salary is £33,750, which is below the £41,700 threshold. Your FTE salary of £45,000 is not considered for eligibility assessment in your case.
* **No PhD:** You don't have a PhD, which would have allowed access to a lower salary threshold.
* **First-Time Applicant:** Being a first-time applicant doesn't change the minimum salary requirement.

While working in education *does* mean the 'going rate' for your occupation code can be pro-rated, this doesn't affect the general salary threshold itself. Because your actual salary falls below £41,700, you currently don’t meet the requirements for the visa.

Does that make things a little clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes it clearer. So even though I work in education, the £41,700 threshold still applies based on my actual earnings, not my FTE salary. And since I earn £33,750, I'm below that threshold. I understand now why I wouldn't qualify for the Skilled Worker visa. Thank you for explaining.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could clarify things for you. It can be a little complex, especially with the term-time working rules. 

If your circumstances change in the future – for example, if your salary increases – you might want to revisit your eligibility. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. I'll speak with my school about the possibility of increasing my salary if I want to pursue this visa in the future. Thank you for your help today.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sophie. That sounds like a good plan. I wish you the best of luck with your discussions with the school. 

If you have any further questions later on, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome. They accurately explained that I would be REFUSED for the Skilled Worker visa because my actual salary of £33,750 falls below the required threshold of £41,700, and for term-time workers like teachers, the assessment is based on actual earnings rather than FTE salary.
