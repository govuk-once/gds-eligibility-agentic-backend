[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Layla and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Layla, nice to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you please tell me the date your Skilled Worker visa was granted?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. My visa was granted on January 1st. I'm an architect and I've just arrived in the UK to start my new job.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear you’ve arrived! And January 1st is good to know. Could you please tell me what the start date listed on your Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) was?

[evaluation_judge]: The start date listed on my Certificate of Sponsorship was also January 1st.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And what date did you actually arrive in the UK and begin working?

[evaluation_judge]: I actually just arrived on February 15th. I had to delay my flight to sort out some personal affairs back home before moving to the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. So, just to clarify, you arrived on February 15th, after your visa was granted on January 1st and your CoS start date was also January 1st. 

To help me understand your situation better, are you currently working?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I just started working after I arrived on February 15th. My employer didn't seem concerned about the delay - they were quite understanding about me needing time to settle my affairs before moving.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It's good your employer was understanding. However, there's a rule about Skilled Worker Visas relating to the timeframe between when your visa is granted (or your CoS start date, whichever is later) and when you actually start work. 

Were you aware that you generally need to start your job within 28 days of the later of your visa grant date or CoS start date?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that rule. No one mentioned it to me - neither the visa officials nor my employer. Is this going to be a problem? I genuinely didn't know there was a time limit.

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, and it’s unfortunate that this wasn’t communicated to you clearly. Unfortunately, yes, this could be a problem. As you started work 45 days after both your visa grant date and CoS start date of January 1st, this exceeds the 28-day limit.

While your employer wasn't aware, they are responsible for ensuring compliance with the rules. This situation unfortunately represents a **COMPLIANCE BREACH / CURTAILMENT RISK**. Your sponsor should have stopped sponsoring you after 28 days of non-attendance, and you are potentially liable to have your visa cancelled at the border or curtailed later.



Do you have any further questions about this?

[evaluation_judge]: This is very concerning news. I had no idea about this rule. So what should I do now? Is there any way to fix this situation or am I definitely going to lose my visa? My employer and I both thought this was fine, and I've already moved my whole life here.

[root_agent]: I completely understand your distress, Layla. It’s a very worrying situation, and I’m sorry to deliver difficult news. While there's no guarantee, here's what *could* potentially be done, though it’s important to understand the outcome is uncertain:

1. **Immediate Communication with your Sponsor:** Your employer needs to immediately report the delay to the Home Office. They should explain the reason for the delay (your settling affairs) and request guidance. They may need to submit a new CoS. The longer they delay reporting, the worse the situation becomes.

2. **Seek Legal Advice:** I strongly recommend you consult with an immigration lawyer *immediately*. They can assess your specific situation, advise on the best course of action, and potentially help your employer navigate the reporting process.

3. **Prepare for Potential Scenarios:** Be prepared for the possibility that the Home Office may require you to leave the UK and re-apply for a visa, or they may curtail your current visa. 

Unfortunately, because the 28-day window has passed without notification, the situation is serious. Reporting now *may* mitigate the issue, but it doesn't guarantee a positive outcome. 

Would you like me to help you find resources for finding an immigration lawyer? I cannot recommend one specifically, but I can point you toward resources that list qualified professionals.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, any resources for finding an immigration lawyer would be really helpful. I'm going to speak to my employer first thing in the morning. This is extremely stressful - I've already signed a lease and moved all my belongings here. Do you know how quickly they might curtail my visa if that's what they decide to do? Would I have time to make arrangements?

[root_agent]: I understand your stress completely, Layla. It's a very difficult situation to find yourself in after making such significant life changes.

Here are some resources for finding an immigration lawyer:

*   **Law Society:** [https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/) - You can search for accredited immigration lawyers in your area.
*   **Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA):** [https://ilpa.org.uk/](https://ilpa.org.uk/) - ILPA members are specialists in UK immigration law.
*   **Citizens Advice:** [https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) - They can offer free initial advice and direct you to relevant resources.

Regarding curtailment speed, it varies. There isn’t a fixed timeframe. It *could* be relatively quick, within weeks, if the Home Office prioritizes the case. However, it can also take months. Generally, you would receive a notice of curtailment explaining the reasons and the timeframe for compliance.

**Crucially, if your visa is curtailed, you would likely be granted a period (often 30 days, but it can vary) to make arrangements to leave the UK.** This period is designed to give you time to finalize affairs. *However*, it is vital not to overstay beyond that allotted time.

The key is to act quickly and seek professional legal advice. A lawyer can advise you on the potential timeline in your specific case and help you prepare for any possible outcome.

I really hope it doesn’t come to curtailment, and proactive communication with the Home Office alongside legal representation is your best route forward right now. Is there anything else I can help you with at the moment?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for the information and resources. I'll contact an immigration lawyer immediately and talk to my employer first thing tomorrow. This is incredibly stressful but at least now I understand the situation and can take action. I really appreciate your help explaining this to me.

✓ The agent correctly identified that this represents a COMPLIANCE BREACH / CURTAILMENT RISK due to the 45-day delay between visa grant date/CoS start date and actual arrival, exceeding the 28-day limit.
