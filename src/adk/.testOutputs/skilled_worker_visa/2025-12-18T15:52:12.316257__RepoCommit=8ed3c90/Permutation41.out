[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Ken, a marketing lead seeking information about visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Ken and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ken, nice to meet you. I'm here to help. 

To start, could you please tell me if you are applying for a Skilled Worker Visa?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am applying for a Skilled Worker visa. I've been offered a position as a marketing lead at a large multinational bank in the UK, and they're sponsoring my application. I just want to make sure everything is in order before I submit my final application.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Ken. It's good you're being proactive about checking everything.

To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me if your sponsoring bank has assigned you a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they have assigned me a Certificate of Sponsorship. The HR department at the bank completed that process last week. I received confirmation that they've assigned the CoS in the sponsorship system. I'm just making sure everything is in proper order before I proceed with my application.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Having the CoS is a key step. 

Could you tell me, to the best of your knowledge, does your sponsoring bank believe they have paid the correct Immigration Skills Charge (ISC) associated with your CoS? This is a fee the sponsor pays to the government.

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I'm not entirely sure about the details, but I did overhear something concerning when I was speaking with the HR admin last week. They mentioned they had classified the bank as a "Small" company in the sponsorship system when assigning my CoS. I think they said something about it saving money on fees - paying £364 per year instead of £1,000. I wasn't sure if that was standard practice or not, but it struck me as odd since it's definitely a large multinational bank.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Ken. That *is* a potentially concerning detail.

To clarify, are you aware if the bank has indeed paid the £364 per year Immigration Skills Charge, based on being classified as a "Small" company?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, from what I understand, they have already paid the Immigration Skills Charge at the £364 per year rate based on the "Small" company classification. The HR admin specifically mentioned they had submitted the payment at that rate when they assigned my CoS. I'm starting to worry this might cause issues with my application.

[root_agent]: You're right to be concerned, Ken. Given that your sponsoring bank is a large multinational, it sounds like they may have incorrectly classified themselves as a "Small" company to pay a lower Immigration Skills Charge. 

Unfortunately, if the correct amount (£1,000 per year) wasn’t paid, this could lead to your visa application being **INVALID / REFUSED**. The Home Office will likely contact the bank to request the difference.

Do you have any further questions about this? I can explain the process further if you'd like.

[evaluation_judge]: What would happen next if they've paid the incorrect amount? Is my application definitely going to be refused, or is there a way to fix this?

[root_agent]: The Home Office will usually contact your sponsoring bank to request a "top-up" payment to cover the difference between what was paid (£364) and what should have been paid (£1,000). 

However, it's not *definitely* refused yet. If the bank pays the outstanding amount within 10 working days of the Home Office's request, the application can usually proceed.

However, if the bank *doesn't* pay the outstanding amount within that timeframe, your application **will** be refused. It's a fairly strict rule.

It would be best for you to inform your HR contact at the bank about this potential issue, so they can address it proactively with the Home Office once contacted. Would you like me to summarise this information for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, a summary would be helpful. I'll need to contact HR right away about this. I want to make sure I understand all the details correctly before I speak with them.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ken. Here's a summary of the situation:

Your sponsoring bank may have incorrectly paid the Immigration Skills Charge (ISC) at the lower rate for "Small" companies (£364/year) instead of the correct rate for a large multinational (£1,000/year). This is because they classified themselves as a "Small" company within the sponsorship system.

**What happens next:**

*   The Home Office will likely contact the bank to request a "top-up" payment for the difference.
*   If the bank pays within 10 working days, your application can likely continue.
*   If the bank *doesn't* pay within 10 working days, your Skilled Worker visa application will be **refused**.

It’s important you inform your HR department at the bank immediately so they can resolve this issue with the Home Office if contacted.

Does this summary accurately reflect your understanding, and is there anything else I can clarify for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that summary is very clear, thank you. I'll contact HR immediately to let them know about this issue so they can be prepared to pay the top-up amount when the Home Office contacts them. I really appreciate your help in identifying this problem before my application was refused. Is there anything specific I should tell HR to make sure they understand the urgency of this situation?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ken – I'm glad I could help! It’s excellent that you’re contacting HR right away.

When you speak with them, you could emphasize these points to convey the urgency:

*   **The 10-day window:** Explain that the Home Office typically provides a 10-working-day window to pay the outstanding amount. Missing this deadline will almost certainly result in your visa refusal.
*   **CoS invalidity:** Explain that an incorrect ISC payment renders the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) invalid, which is a critical component of your application.
*   **Proactive contact:** Suggest they proactively reach out to the Home Office once they’ve identified and rectified the error, rather than waiting to be contacted. This could demonstrate good faith.
*   **Reference the Immigration Skills Charge:** Specifically mentioning the "Immigration Skills Charge" and the discrepancy in payment will help them understand the issue quickly.

You could say something like: "I recently learned that the bank may have paid the incorrect Immigration Skills Charge for my CoS, classifying us as a 'Small' company despite being a large multinational. I understand the Home Office will likely request a top-up payment, and it’s crucial that this is paid within 10 working days to avoid my visa application being refused. Perhaps we could proactively contact the Home Office once the issue is resolved?"

Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed. Thank you so much for your help and for providing such specific guidance on what to tell HR. I'll make sure to communicate all of these points clearly to them right away.

✓ The agent correctly identified that the application would be invalid/refused due to the underpayment of the Immigration Skills Charge, matching the expected outcome. The agent also accurately explained the process, including the 10-day window for the sponsor to pay the top-up amount.
