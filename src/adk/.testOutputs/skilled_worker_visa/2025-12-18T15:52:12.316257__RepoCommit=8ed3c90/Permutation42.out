[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Fatima who is seeking information about her eligibility for a work visa with a B-rated sponsor.

Hi, i'm Fatima and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Fatima, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you tell me what type of benefit you are enquiring about? Specifically, are you looking into a Skilled Worker Visa?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I've been offered a job at a company called Logistics Co. here in the UK. They mentioned they would sponsor my visa, but I'm not sure if I'm eligible. I'm currently overseas and this would be my first time working in the UK. Can you help me understand if I can get a Skilled Worker Visa with them?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Fatima. I can definitely help you explore that. 

To begin, do you know what rating Logistics Co. currently has as a sponsor with the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)? They are graded, and this impacts their ability to sponsor new workers.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I was told that Logistics Co. is currently B-rated. They mentioned they had some issues during a previous audit but assured me they could still sponsor my visa. This would be my first job in the UK - I've never worked here before. Is that going to be a problem?

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Fatima. 

Given that Logistics Co. is currently a B-rated sponsor and this would be your *first* job with them in the UK, unfortunately, there may be a problem. A B-rated sponsor has restrictions on who they can sponsor. 

Could you confirm that Logistics Co. has *not* previously sponsored you under a different visa?

[evaluation_judge]: No, they've never sponsored me before. This would be the first time they're sponsoring me or that I'd be working for them. I'm currently in my home country and haven't worked in the UK at all. They offered me the job and said they would arrange my visa, but now I'm concerned about this B-rating issue.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Fatima.

As Logistics Co. is a B-rated sponsor and you have never worked for them before, and are currently overseas, they are likely unable to assign you a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) at this time. A B-rated sponsor is generally restricted from sponsoring *new* workers to the UK. They can typically only sponsor those already working for them and seeking to extend their visas.

To be clear, do you understand that Logistics Co. being B-rated may prevent them from sponsoring your Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I didn't realize that. So because they are B-rated, they cannot sponsor me as a new worker from overseas? That's very concerning since they've already offered me the job and assured me they could handle the visa process. Are you saying that even if they try to assign a Certificate of Sponsorship to me, it would be refused?

[root_agent]: Yes, Fatima, that is correct. Because Logistics Co. is B-rated, they are generally unable to sponsor you as a new worker from overseas. 

And you are also right to be concerned. Even if they *were* able to assign you a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS), the application would likely be refused by the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI). The Sponsorship Management System (SMS) should, technically, block the assignment of a CoS to you in the first place, but even if that wasn't the case, the visa application itself would likely be unsuccessful.

To help me understand, have Logistics Co. explained *how* they intend to proceed with your sponsorship, given their B-rating?

[evaluation_judge]: No, they didn't explain how they would proceed with my sponsorship despite being B-rated. They simply told me they were B-rated due to some previous issues but assured me they could still sponsor my visa. They didn't mention any restrictions or special procedures they would follow because of their rating. I'm quite concerned now as I was planning to leave my current job to take this position, and they've already started discussing my start date. Should I go back to them and specifically ask about this restriction?

[root_agent]: Absolutely, Fatima. I strongly recommend you go back to Logistics Co. and specifically ask them to explain how they intend to sponsor you *despite* being a B-rated sponsor. Their initial assurance seems to have lacked important details about the restrictions in place.

It's important for them to be transparent about this. You could ask them directly: “Given your B-rating, how will you be able to sponsor me as a new employee from overseas? Can you explain the process and confirm that a Certificate of Sponsorship can be assigned to me?”

Would you like me to summarise the situation as we've discussed, so you have a clear overview to present to them?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, a summary would be really helpful. I'd like to understand exactly what the issue is so I can discuss it clearly with them. I'm quite worried now about the job opportunity as I was counting on it.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Fatima. Here's a summary of the situation:

You have been offered a job at Logistics Co., and they have informed you they are a B-rated sponsor due to previous compliance issues. However, a B-rating significantly restricts their ability to sponsor new workers from overseas. 

Specifically, B-rated sponsors are generally **unable to assign Certificates of Sponsorship (CoS) to individuals who:**

*   Are applying for their *first* job with the company.
*   Are currently *outside* the UK.

Because this is your first potential employment with Logistics Co., and you are currently overseas, their B-rating likely prevents them from sponsoring your Skilled Worker Visa. Even if they were to attempt to assign you a CoS, your visa application would likely be refused by the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI).

They have not yet explained how they intend to proceed with your sponsorship despite this restriction. 

I hope this summary helps you clearly explain your concerns to Logistics Co. and get a clear answer from them about your potential sponsorship. Do you feel this accurately reflects our conversation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's a perfect summary and matches what we've discussed. I'll definitely reach out to Logistics Co. with these concerns. I'm quite worried now since I was making plans based on this job offer. It sounds like they might not be able to sponsor me at all unless they regain their A-rating first. Thank you for explaining this situation to me - it's better I know now rather than after I've left my current position.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Fatima. I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you. It’s definitely better to address these concerns now, before making any significant life changes.

You are right – it does seem they would need to regain their A-rating to sponsor you as a new employee. 

If you don’t receive a satisfactory explanation from Logistics Co., or if they continue to assure you sponsorship is possible without explaining *how*, it might be wise to consider other opportunities.

Is there anything else I can help you with at this time, Fatima? Perhaps you’d like to understand what steps Logistics Co. would need to take to regain their A-rating, though I should note that I can only provide information related to *your* eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that as a B-rated sponsor, Logistics Co. cannot sponsor new workers from overseas like me, and any attempt to assign me a Certificate of Sponsorship would be refused. This matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
