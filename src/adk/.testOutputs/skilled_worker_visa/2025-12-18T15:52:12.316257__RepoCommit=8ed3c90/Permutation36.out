[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Raj and interact with the benefits agent to test their knowledge about visa requirements after an internal promotion.

Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Raj, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help! To start, could you tell me what kind of work you currently do? Just a job title will be fine for now.





[evaluation_judge]: I work as an IT Project Manager for a tech company. I was recently promoted from my previous role as a Web Developer within the same company.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear about your promotion, Raj! Congratulations!

To understand your situation a little better, could you tell me if your visa status changed at all when you moved from the Web Developer role to the IT Project Manager role? Did you apply for a new visa, or was your current visa simply updated?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for the congratulations! Actually, I didn't apply for a new visa. HR just updated my information in their system - I think they called it the SMS or Sponsorship Management System. My company said it was fine since I'm still with the same employer, and my new salary is £50,000 which they said meets all the requirements. I just started the new role last week.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Raj. That's very helpful.

Just to confirm, was the type of work you were initially sponsored for – as a Web Developer – a different type of work than you are now doing as an IT Project Manager? In other words, did those roles have different job codes associated with them?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they are different. My HR mentioned something about this actually. When I was a Web Developer, they said I was under code 2137. Now as an IT Project Manager, I believe I'm under code 2135. But since it's the same company, they just updated the information internally and said I could start right away.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details, Raj. 

Based on what you've told me, it sounds like there might be a potential issue with your current work authorization. Changing to a different occupation code (from 2137 to 2135) generally requires a new visa application, even if you remain with the same employer. Simply updating the SMS doesn't cover this change.

Are you aware of the requirements for a "Change of Employment" visa within the Skilled Worker route?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware that I needed a "Change of Employment" visa. My employer didn't mention this at all. They just said since it's the same company, it would be fine to start the new role immediately after they updated the system. Are you saying there's a problem with my current situation?

[root_agent]: I understand your surprise, Raj, and it’s good you’re asking. Unfortunately, yes, there is a potential problem.

According to the rules for the Skilled Worker visa, when a sponsored worker moves to a job with a different occupation code within the same company, a new visa application – a "Change of Employment" application – is required *before* starting the new role. 

Since you've already started working as an IT Project Manager (code 2135) without applying for this new visa, your current work situation isn’t compliant with the visa regulations. This could lead to issues for both you and your employer.

Would you like me to explain the potential consequences of this further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the potential consequences. This is very worrying to hear. I was completely trusting my employer's guidance on this. What might happen to me and my visa status now?

[root_agent]: I completely understand your worry, Raj, and it's right to be concerned. Relying on your employer's guidance is reasonable, however, in this situation, it appears incorrect advice has been given. 

Here are the potential consequences:

* **Visa Curtailment:** Your current visa could be curtailed, meaning it would be cancelled before its original expiry date. This would mean you would lose your legal right to work in the UK.
* **Loss of Sponsorship:** Your employer could have their sponsorship license revoked by the Home Office. This would prevent them from sponsoring any future Skilled Workers.
* **Immigration Consequences for You:** If your visa is curtailed, it could impact your ability to apply for future UK visas.
* **Potential Overstay:** If you remain in the UK beyond the validity of your visa (if it is curtailed), you could be considered an overstayer, which has serious immigration consequences.

Essentially, working in a role not covered by your current visa is considered illegal employment. It's important to rectify this situation as soon as possible.

Do you want me to explain what steps you should take to try and resolve this?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please tell me what steps I should take immediately to resolve this situation. I had no idea I was working illegally and I want to fix this as soon as possible.

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj, here are the immediate steps you should take. It’s important to act quickly:

1. **Inform Your Employer:** You need to immediately inform your HR department or whoever advised you that you believe you were incorrectly told you didn’t need a new visa. Explain the situation and the potential consequences. They need to understand the seriousness of this.
2. **Seek Immigration Legal Advice:** I strongly recommend you consult with a qualified immigration solicitor as soon as possible. They can assess your specific situation, advise you on the best course of action, and help you prepare and submit a “Change of Employment” application, if that's still possible.
3. **Prepare Documentation:** Gather all relevant documents, including your current visa, sponsorship certificate, employment contract for both roles (Web Developer & IT Project Manager), and any communication with your employer regarding the role change.
4. **Consider Voluntary Compliance:** Depending on the solicitor’s advice, proactively contacting the Home Office to explain the situation and demonstrate your intention to comply with immigration rules might be advisable. However, *do not* do this before speaking to a solicitor.

Your employer *should* be assisting you with the "Change of Employment" application, as they have a responsibility to ensure their sponsored workers are compliant. However, seeking independent legal advice is crucial to protect your own interests.

Do you understand these steps, and would you like me to help you find resources for locating a qualified immigration solicitor?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent correctly identified that I needed to apply for a new visa before changing to an occupation with a different code, but the judgement should have been stronger. The agent should have clearly stated this was a compliance breach that could lead to visa curtailment, which is the expected outcome stated in the scenario. While they mentioned possible curtailment as one consequence, they presented it as a potential risk rather than the definitive outcome that the scenario indicates.
