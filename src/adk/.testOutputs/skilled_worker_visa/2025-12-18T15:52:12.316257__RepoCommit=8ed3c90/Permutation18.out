[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Julian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Julian, it's good to speak with you! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for a UK skilled worker visa. I've received a job offer as a Sales Director, and I wanted to check if I'd be eligible based on my salary package.

[root_agent]: Great! The Skilled Worker visa is a popular route. 

To assess your eligibility based on salary, could you please tell me your annual base salary – that is, the fixed amount you will be paid each year before any deductions? Please state this as a numerical value in pounds (£).

[evaluation_judge]: My job offer includes a base salary of £35,000 per year. It also includes a guaranteed commission of £20,000 and a performance bonus of £10,000, which brings the total package to £65,000. But the base salary itself is £35,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Julian. Just to be absolutely sure I understand correctly, is the £20,000 commission truly *guaranteed* as part of your contract, or is it dependent on achieving certain sales targets?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the £20,000 commission is guaranteed in my contract. It's described as a guaranteed minimum commission regardless of sales performance. The additional £10,000 bonus is dependent on performance targets, but the £20,000 is guaranteed.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detail, Julian.

To confirm, is this guaranteed commission paid to you regularly as part of your salary, or as a lump sum? For example, is it added to your monthly pay, or paid out annually?

[evaluation_judge]: The guaranteed commission is paid quarterly throughout the year, so I receive £5,000 every three months on top of my monthly salary. It's written into my contract as a guaranteed quarterly payment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Julian. 

Just to be clear, and this is important for the visa requirements, how is this £5,000 quarterly commission *described* in your employment contract? Is it listed as "commission," "allowance," or simply as part of your overall "earnings" or "remuneration"? Knowing the specific wording will help me assess your eligibility.

[evaluation_judge]: In my contract, it's specifically labeled as "Guaranteed Quarterly Commission." The contract states that it's a guaranteed payment based on my role as Sales Director, but it's definitely categorized as commission rather than basic salary.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so thorough, Julian.

Based on the information you've provided, and the current rules for the Skilled Worker visa, I'm afraid your salary package is unlikely to meet the current eligibility requirements. The Home Office calculates eligibility based on the guaranteed *basic* salary only. While you have a total package of £65,000, only the £35,000 base salary counts towards the £41,700 threshold (this is the standard threshold, and some roles have lower thresholds, but we'll use this for now). 

Even though the £20,000 commission is “guaranteed”, because it is specifically labelled as *commission* and not basic salary, it is unlikely to be factored into the calculation. 

Therefore, based on this information, your application would likely be **REFUSED**. 

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or would you like to discuss other potential options?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, that's disappointing news. I didn't realize that the guaranteed commission wouldn't count toward the threshold even though it's guaranteed income. So to be clear, even though my total guaranteed pay is £55,000, because £20,000 is labeled as "commission" rather than "salary," I don't meet the £41,700 threshold?

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly, Julian. That's exactly right. Even though your total guaranteed income is £55,000, the Home Office focuses solely on the guaranteed *basic salary* when assessing eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa. 

Because the £20,000 is explicitly defined as "commission" in your contract, it won’t be included in the calculation, leaving you with a qualifying salary of £35,000. Unfortunately, this falls short of the £41,700 threshold.

It's a common point of confusion, as many roles offer commission structures, but for visa purposes, only the base salary is considered. I understand this is disappointing news. Would you like me to clarify anything further about this, or perhaps explore if your role might fall into a category with a lower salary threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I would be refused for the Skilled Worker visa because only my base salary of £35,000 counts toward the threshold, not the guaranteed commission or bonus, resulting in me falling short of the £41,700 requirement.
