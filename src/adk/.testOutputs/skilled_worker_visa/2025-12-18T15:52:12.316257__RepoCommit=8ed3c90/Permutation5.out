[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lars and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lars, it's good to speak with you. I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a UK visa. To start, could you please tell me what your profession is?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a specialist stonemason from Norway. I have a job offer here in the UK, and I'm trying to figure out if I qualify for a work visa.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Lars. A specialist stonemason is a skilled trade! 

To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me what your annual salary is in the job offer you've received?

[evaluation_judge]: My job offer is for £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lars. That's helpful to know.

Now, do you happen to know what the standard going rate is for a specialist stonemason in the UK? This is the typical salary for someone with your experience and skills.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for my role is £33,500 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Lars. 

Just to confirm, is the company offering you the job a licensed sponsor with the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)? In other words, are they approved to sponsor workers from overseas?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they are a licensed sponsor approved by the UK Visas and Immigration.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And to confirm, does this job require a skill level of at least RQF level 3 (which is equivalent to A-levels or equivalent)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my specialist stonemason role definitely requires that skill level.

[root_agent]: Great. Finally, just one more quick question – do you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker visa? This generally means passing an approved English language test.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements for the visa.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! Based on the information you've provided – your profession as a specialist stonemason, a salary of £34,000, a standard going rate of £33,500, a licensed sponsor, a role at RQF level 3 or above, and meeting the English language requirements – it appears you **would be eligible** for a Skilled Worker visa under the Immigration Salary List (ISL) criteria.

Because specialist stonemasons are on the ISL, the standard salary threshold of £41,700 is waived for you. Your salary of £34,000 meets both the lower general threshold of £33,400 *and* exceeds the standard going rate of £33,500 for your profession.



Is there anything else I can help you with today, Lars?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really good news! So even though the normal threshold is £41,700, because my job is on this Immigration Salary List, I only need to meet the lower £33,400 threshold and the going rate for my profession? And since my offer is £34,000, I'm above both those requirements?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Lars! That's absolutely correct. 

Because your job is on the Immigration Salary List, the usual £41,700 threshold doesn't apply to you. You only need to meet the £33,400 lower general threshold *and* earn at least the standard going rate for your profession. 

And as your salary offer is £34,000, you are above both of those requirements – exceeding the £33,400 threshold and the going rate of £33,500. So, based on the information we've discussed, you appear to meet the salary criteria for the Skilled Worker visa.



I'm glad I could provide you with some positive news! Do you have any other questions for me?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much more confident about my application now!

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for a Skilled Worker visa because my job as a specialist stonemason is on the Immigration Salary List, my salary (£34,000) exceeds both the lower threshold (£33,400) and the going rate (£33,500) for my profession.
