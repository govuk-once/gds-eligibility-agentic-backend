[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Javier, a 25-year-old applicant who is about to turn 26.

Hi, i'm Javier and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Javier, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you please tell me your date of birth? This will help me understand which benefits you might be eligible for.





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. My date of birth is 1st June 1999. I'm planning to apply for something in the next few days, and I'm not sure if my upcoming birthday will affect my eligibility.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Javier. That's helpful to know. And you mentioned you're planning to apply in the next few days – do you have a specific date in mind for when you intend to submit your application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm planning to submit my application on the 30th of May this year. My concern is that I'll be turning 26 on the 1st of June, so just two days after my application. I'm applying for a job with a salary of £35,000, and I heard there might be some kind of discount or benefit I can get as a "New Entrant" if I'm under 26, but I'm not sure if that still applies if I turn 26 while they're processing my application.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Javier. That's a very good question to ask upfront! To confirm, you're applying for a Skilled Worker Visa, and you're interested in whether the "New Entrant" discount applies given your upcoming 26th birthday. 

Just to be absolutely sure, could you confirm the year you are applying?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right - I'm applying for a Skilled Worker Visa this year, 2025. So my application would be on May 30th, 2025, and I turn 26 on June 1st, 2025. I'm hoping to qualify for that New Entrant discount since the salary I've been offered is £35,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Javier. That's very helpful. 

To clarify one final point - just so I have all the information correct - is the £35,000 salary the *exact* amount offered in your job, before any deductions?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The job offer is exactly £35,000 before any deductions. That's the annual salary that's stated in my contract.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you Javier. Based on the information you've provided – applying on May 30th, 2025, being born on June 1st, 1999, and a salary of £35,000 – you *do* appear to be eligible for the "New Entrant" discount.

The rules state that your age on the date of application is what matters, and you will be 25 at that time. It doesn't matter if you turn 26 while your application is being processed.

Does that answer your question?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that answers my question perfectly! So just to confirm, even if my application is still being processed after June 1st when I turn 26, I'll still qualify for the New Entrant discount because I'm 25 on the date of application? That's great news because I was worried the timing might affect my eligibility.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to confirm, Javier! Yes, that’s exactly correct. Even if the Home Office is still processing your application *after* your 26th birthday on June 1st, you will still qualify for the New Entrant discount because you were 25 years old on May 30th, 2025 – the date of your application.

I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your Skilled Worker Visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: That's wonderful news! I'm relieved to hear I'll qualify for the New Entrant discount. I don't have any other questions about my visa application right now. This was my main concern, and you've answered it very clearly. Thank you so much for your help!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Javier! I'm delighted I could help and that you're feeling relieved. It's always best to check these things upfront. 

If you do have any other questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best with your Skilled Worker Visa application!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you again for the help. Have a great day!

✓ The agent provided the correct information. They accurately stated that I would qualify for the New Entrant discount because what matters is my age at the date of application (25), not my age when the decision is made (after I turn 26).
