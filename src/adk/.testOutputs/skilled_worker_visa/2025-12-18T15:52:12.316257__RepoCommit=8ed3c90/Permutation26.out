[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Klaus and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Klaus, it's good to speak with you. I'm here to help assess your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me your age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 45 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you are 45 years old.

Could you please tell me what kind of job you have been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Welder. The company told me it's on the Immigration Salary List.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. You've been offered a Welder position and the company believes it's on the Immigration Salary List. 

Could you please tell me the salary offered for this Welder position?

[evaluation_judge]: They've offered me £30,960 per year for the position.

[root_agent]: Thank you. So the salary offered is £30,960 per year.

Do you know what the going rate is for a Welder in your area? (This is the typical salary for the role).

[evaluation_judge]: The company told me the going rate for welders is £38,700, but they said since it's on the Immigration Salary List, they can offer me 80% of that rate, which is why they're offering £30,960.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So the going rate is £38,700 and the company is offering 80% of that, which comes to £30,960.

Have you previously worked in the UK, or are you applying for a visa for the first time? Specifically, are you a 'New Entrant' as defined by the immigration rules?

[evaluation_judge]: This would be my first time working in the UK, but I don't think I'm a "New Entrant" - I've been working as a welder for many years in Germany. I'm applying for a visa for the first time to come work in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that this would be your first time working in the UK and that you don't believe you meet the criteria for a 'New Entrant'.

Based on the information you've provided, I'm afraid your application would likely be **REFUSED**. 

Here's why: Being on the Immigration Salary List (ISL) *doesn't* automatically allow employers to pay 80% of the going rate. The rules changed recently. Unless you are a 'New Entrant' (which it sounds like you are not, given your experience), you must be paid the full going rate of £38,700. Your offered salary of £30,960 is below that threshold.





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my application would be refused because the offered salary (£30,960) is below both the ISL general floor (£33,400) and the full going rate for welders (£38,700). The agent correctly explained that being on the ISL doesn't automatically allow the 80% discount on the going rate unless I'm also a New Entrant, which at age 45 with years of experience, I am not.
