[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Aris and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Aris, nice to meet you. I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in learning more about?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently a university lecturer on a Skilled Worker visa, working 20 hours a week. I've been offered another part-time role as a researcher at a private think-tank for 20 hours a week. I want to understand if I can hold both positions simultaneously and what I need to do regarding my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Aris. That's very helpful. 

To understand your situation better, could you confirm if both the university lecturer role *and* the researcher role would require sponsorship from an employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both roles would require sponsorship. I already have a Skilled Worker visa sponsored by the university for my lecturer position. The private think-tank would also need to sponsor me for the researcher position.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. And just to confirm, do you already *have* a Certificate of Sponsorship from the university for your current lecturer role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I already have a Certificate of Sponsorship from the university for my current lecturer role, and my Skilled Worker visa for that position is active.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Do you currently have a Certificate of Sponsorship from the think-tank for the researcher position?

[evaluation_judge]: Not yet. The think-tank has indicated they're willing to sponsor me, but I wanted to understand if this was even possible before proceeding with the application process and getting the Certificate of Sponsorship from them.

[root_agent]: That's a sensible approach. To confirm, are you expecting the salary for the researcher position to meet the minimum salary requirements for a Skilled Worker visa, pro-rated for 20 hours a week?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the think-tank has offered a salary that would meet the minimum requirements for a Skilled Worker visa, pro-rated for 20 hours per week. The salary is competitive for the research field I'm in.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear. Just to be absolutely clear, are both roles skilled to the required level under the Skilled Worker visa requirements (RQF level 3 or above)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both positions are at the required skill level. My university lecturer position is definitely above RQF level 3, and the researcher role at the think-tank is similarly highly skilled, requiring my PhD qualifications and expertise in the field.

[root_agent]: Okay, Aris. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you *are* eligible to hold both positions simultaneously, using what is called "Concurrent Employment."

This would involve applying for a *second* Skilled Worker visa specifically for the researcher role with the think-tank, while keeping your current visa with the university active. 

Is there anything else I can clarify about this process for you?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! So to be clear, I would need to apply for a second Skilled Worker visa rather than modifying my existing one? And both visas would be valid at the same time? Is there anything specific I need to mention in my application for the second visa to make sure my first one isn't cancelled?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct. You would apply for a *second* Skilled Worker visa, and both visas can be valid at the same time.

And you are very astute to ask about cancelling your first visa! Yes, it's crucial to specifically state on your application for the second visa that it is for **Concurrent Employment**. This tells the Home Office *not* to automatically cancel your existing visa when you are granted the second one. 

Essentially, you need to make it clear you intend to hold both roles concurrently, and aren't replacing one with the other. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So I'll need to:
1. Get a Certificate of Sponsorship from the think-tank
2. Apply for a second Skilled Worker visa, explicitly marking it as for "Concurrent Employment"
3. Make sure the application clearly indicates I'm keeping both positions

This seems straightforward enough. Will there be any issues with my total working hours being 40 per week across the two positions?

[root_agent]: You've summarised that perfectly! Those three steps are exactly right.

Regarding your working hours, 40 hours per week across both positions is perfectly acceptable as long as both roles meet the Skilled Worker visa requirements and you are correctly sponsored for both. There isn't a maximum working hour limit as long as you're fulfilling the requirements of each sponsored role.



It sounds like you have a good understanding of the process. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Aris?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that covers everything I needed to know. Thank you for confirming I can indeed work both jobs with the concurrent employment route. This is exactly what I was hoping would be possible. I'll proceed with getting the second Certificate of Sponsorship and applying for the additional visa, making sure to mark it as concurrent employment. Thanks for your help!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Aris! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It sounds like you have a clear plan of action. 

If you do happen to have any further questions down the line, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best with your applications and both roles!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct information about concurrent employment. They accurately explained that I can hold two Skilled Worker visas simultaneously for two different jobs, requiring two Certificates of Sponsorship, and that I need to mark the second application as "Concurrent Employment" to prevent cancellation of my first visa. This aligns with the expected outcome.
