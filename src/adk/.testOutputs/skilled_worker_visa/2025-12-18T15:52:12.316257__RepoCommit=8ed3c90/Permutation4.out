[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me if you have a job offer in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a job offer. I've been offered a position as a Historical Consultant for a media production company in the UK. I'm currently living in the US and have a PhD in Modern History.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Sarah! Could you please tell me what your annual salary would be in this position, before tax?

[evaluation_judge]: The company has offered me £35,000 per year before tax. I'm wondering if this will be enough for me to qualify for a visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. To assess your eligibility, could you please tell me what the 'going rate' is for a Historical Consultant role, as determined by the UK government? You can usually find this information on the government website linked to the role. Don’t worry about the link itself, just the amount.

[evaluation_judge]: The standard going rate for this role is £36,000 per year, according to the information the company shared with me.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Sarah. Just to confirm, do you understand that the 'going rate' is the officially published salary level for the role, as determined by the UK government? And that the company has already confirmed this amount to you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The company showed me the official UK government documentation that confirms the going rate for this role is £36,000 per year, as established by the government.

[root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming. Now, Sarah, could you please confirm that you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. As an American historian, English is my first language, and I've completed my entire education including my PhD in English.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know, Sarah. Finally, could you please confirm that you have a sponsoring company who is a licensed sponsor with the UK Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the media production company offering me the position has confirmed they are a licensed sponsor with the UK Home Office. They've already begun preparing the sponsorship documentation for me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of this information, Sarah. Based on what you’ve told me – a salary of £35,000, a going rate of £36,000, meeting the English language requirements, having a PhD in Modern History and a confirmed sponsor – I’m afraid your application would be **REFUSED** under the Skilled Worker Visa rules for those with a PhD.

Although your salary exceeds 90% of the going rate, the minimum salary threshold for a PhD in a non-STEM subject is £37,500. Your current offer is below this threshold. 

Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please explain that in more detail? I thought having a PhD would make things easier, not harder. How much more would I need to make to qualify?

[root_agent]: You’re right to be surprised, Sarah, and it’s understandable to think a PhD would simplify things. The rules are a bit nuanced! There are different salary thresholds depending on your subject area and whether you have a PhD.

For those with a PhD in a STEM subject (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), the salary requirements are lower. However, for a PhD in a non-STEM subject like History, the rules are stricter.

Currently, to qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa with a non-STEM PhD, your salary needs to meet *both* of these criteria:

1.  Be at least £37,500 per year.
2.  Be at least 90% of the standard ‘going rate’ for the job.

While your salary of £35,000 *is* above 90% of the going rate (£32,400), it’s still £2,500 below the mandatory £37,500 threshold. 

Therefore, you would need a salary increase of at least £2,500 to meet the requirements. Would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for the clear explanation. So essentially, I need to ask the company if they can increase my offer to at least £37,500 to qualify? And if they do that, would I then meet all the requirements for the visa?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Sarah. Yes, you would need to discuss with the company the possibility of increasing your offer to at least £37,500.

If they were to increase your salary to £37,500 or above, *and* assuming all the other information you’ve provided remains the same – that you have a confirmed sponsor, meet the English language requirements, and the job is at the required skill level – then yes, you *would* meet all the requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa based on the information we've discussed today.



It's always a good idea to double-check the latest guidance on the official government website, but based on our conversation, that salary increase would be the key factor.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. Thank you for explaining this so clearly. I'll definitely reach out to the company to discuss whether they can increase the salary offer to £37,500. I appreciate your help in understanding these requirements.

✓ The agent provided the correct information. The agent correctly identified that I would be refused a visa because my £35,000 salary is below the £37,500 minimum threshold for non-STEM PhD applicants, even though it exceeds 90% of the going rate. The agent accurately explained I would need a £2,500 raise to qualify.
