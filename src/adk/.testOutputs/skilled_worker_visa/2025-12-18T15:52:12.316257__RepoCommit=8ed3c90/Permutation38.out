[evaluation_judge]: I'll engage in a dialogue as Pavel, a mechanic from Poland, who is currently outside the UK and has been given an "Undefined" Certificate of Sponsorship by his potential UK employer.

Hi, i'm Pavel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Pavel, nice to meet you! I'm here to help assess your eligibility. 

To start, could you please tell me – are you currently in the United Kingdom?





[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm currently living in Warsaw, Poland. A garage in the UK wants to hire me as a mechanic and they've sent me something called a Certificate of Sponsorship. I need to know if I can use this to apply for a work visa to come to the UK.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear a UK garage is interested in hiring you, Pavel!

To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me what *type* of Certificate of Sponsorship they sent you? Specifically, does it say "Defined" or "Undefined" on the certificate?





[evaluation_judge]: They told me it's an "Undefined" Certificate of Sponsorship. The garage manager mentioned they had some spare allocations and gave me one of those so I could apply right away. I have the reference number they sent me. Is this the right type for my situation?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Pavel. That's good you have the reference number.

Just to be absolutely sure, could you confirm that you are applying for the visa *from outside* the UK, specifically from Poland?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm applying from here in Warsaw, Poland. I haven't been to the UK yet. The garage wants me to come over once my visa is approved.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming, Pavel.

In that case, unfortunately, an "Undefined" Certificate of Sponsorship isn’t the correct type for your application, as you are applying for the visa from outside the UK. The garage needs to apply for a "Defined" Certificate of Sponsorship specifically for your application.

Do you understand what I mean? Would you like me to explain further?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit confused. They seemed confident this would work. What's the difference between an "Undefined" and a "Defined" Certificate? Will this delay my application process? I already have the reference number they sent me - are you saying I can't use this to apply?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask for clarification, Pavel, and it's good they were eager to get the process started! It’s understandable to be confused.

Essentially, “Undefined” CoS allocations are for people who are *already in* the UK and are switching to this type of visa. Because you are currently in Poland and applying from outside the UK, the garage needs to apply for a “Defined” CoS – one specifically assigned to you. 

Yes, unfortunately, you won’t be able to use the “Undefined” CoS reference number you have to apply. Submitting an application with an incorrect CoS type could lead to your application being rejected.

It *will* likely cause a delay, as the garage needs to apply for the correct type of CoS before you can proceed with your application. 

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail? Perhaps I can suggest how you might explain this to the garage manager?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really disappointing to hear. I thought I could submit my application right away. How long does it typically take for them to get a "Defined" CoS? I should probably contact them right away to let them know about this issue.

Does this mean if I tried to apply with the current "Undefined" CoS reference number, my application would definitely be rejected?

[root_agent]: You’re right to feel disappointed, Pavel, and proactive to want to contact them immediately.

Yes, if you were to apply with the "Undefined" CoS reference number, your application would almost certainly be rejected – or at least, considered invalid and returned to you. The Home Office is very specific about using the correct type of CoS depending on your location.

Regarding how long a "Defined" CoS takes, it’s difficult to say precisely as it depends on the garage’s processing times and current demand with the Home Office. However, it generally takes a few working days to a couple of weeks to obtain a “Defined” CoS once the application has been submitted by the sponsor (the garage). They will need to apply for it specifically for *you* and your role.

It's best to ask the garage directly for their estimated timeframe. Would you like me to help you phrase an email or message to them explaining the situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be really helpful if you could help me with what to say to them. I want to be clear about what the issue is so they can fix it quickly. I need to get this process moving as soon as possible because they want me to start work next month.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Pavel. Here's a draft message you could send to the garage manager:

"Dear [Garage Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

Thank you so much for sending me the Certificate of Sponsorship. I was reviewing the requirements for my visa application and have discovered that, as I am applying from outside the UK (Poland), I require a 'Defined' Certificate of Sponsorship, rather than the 'Undefined' one I currently have.

I understand you were trying to help me get started quickly, and I appreciate that. However, I’ve been informed that using an 'Undefined' CoS for an out-of-country application will likely result in my visa being rejected.

Could you please apply for a 'Defined' Certificate of Sponsorship for my application as soon as possible? Please let me know how long this process is likely to take. I am eager to begin work next month as we discussed.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance.

Sincerely,

Pavel [Your Last Name]"

Does that sound suitable, or would you like me to adjust it in any way?

[evaluation_judge]: That's perfect, thank you! It explains the issue clearly. I'll send this to the garage manager today. Just to make sure I understand completely: an "Undefined" CoS is only valid for people already in the UK who want to change their visa status, while a "Defined" CoS is specifically for people like me who are applying from outside the UK. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You’ve got it exactly right, Pavel! 

That's a perfect summary. "Undefined" CoS allocations are specifically for individuals who are *already* legally present in the UK and are switching to the Skilled Worker visa (or another eligible route). And, as you said, a "Defined" CoS is specifically for those applying for the visa from *outside* the UK, like yourself.

I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. I hope the garage can sort out the "Defined" CoS quickly, and that your visa application goes smoothly after that. 

Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining this clearly. It's frustrating there will be a delay, but it's better to know now than to have my application rejected later. I'll contact the garage manager right away with your suggested message.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Pavel! I'm glad I could help. You're absolutely right – it's much better to address this now and avoid a potential rejection later.

I wish you all the best with your application and your future role at the garage. If you have any further questions down the line, don't hesitate to reach out.



Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that an "Undefined" Certificate of Sponsorship cannot be used for an out-of-country application and advised that a "Defined" CoS is required for someone applying from outside the UK. The agent properly explained that the application would be rejected if submitted with the incorrect CoS type, matching the expected outcome in the scenario.
