[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Elara and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Elara, I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. To start, could you tell me what your gross basic salary is – that is, the salary *before* any allowances or deductions?





[evaluation_judge]: My gross basic salary is £38,000. I also get additional allowances - a car allowance of £5,000 and a housing stipend of £4,000, bringing my total compensation to £47,000. I'm working as a Structural Engineer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Elara. Just to clarify, are those allowances – the £5,000 car allowance and the £4,000 housing stipend – paid *in addition to* your £38,000 salary, or are they part of that £38,000 figure?

[evaluation_judge]: They're paid in addition to my £38,000 salary. So my basic salary is £38,000, and then I get those allowances on top of that, which brings my total compensation package to £47,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Now, could you please confirm the current salary threshold required for the benefit you are enquiring about?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the salary threshold is £41,700.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Finally, just to be absolutely certain, is the job you've been offered a skilled role that is on the list of eligible occupations for this benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm being offered a position as a Structural Engineer, which is a skilled role on the eligible occupations list.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Elara. Based on what you’ve told me – a gross basic salary of £38,000, allowances of £9,000 bringing total compensation to £47,000, a job as a Structural Engineer, and a salary threshold of £41,700 – it appears you unfortunately do not meet the eligibility requirements. 

The rules state that only the gross basic salary counts towards meeting the threshold, and your basic salary of £38,000 is below £41,700.

Therefore, the outcome is **REFUSED**. Your sponsor would need to restructure your compensation package to ensure your gross basic salary meets the £41,700+ threshold.



Do you have any further questions?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for the benefit because my base salary of £38,000 is below the threshold of £41,700, despite my total compensation package being £47,000. They correctly explained that only gross basic salary counts, not the additional allowances.
