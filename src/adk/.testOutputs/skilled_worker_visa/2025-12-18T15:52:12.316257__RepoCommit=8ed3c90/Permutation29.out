[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Ben and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Ben, nice to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you tell me what your current gross salary is – that is, your salary before any deductions?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! My current gross salary is £42,000. I work as a Software Developer.

[root_agent]: Thanks Ben, that's helpful to know.

Do you currently participate in any salary sacrifice schemes, such as a cycle to work scheme, or make any voluntary deductions from your salary (like extra pension contributions)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I recently signed up for a Cycle to Work scheme and also decided to make some additional pension contributions. Together these sacrifice about £2,000 from my salary.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. 

So, if we deduct that £2,000 from your £42,000 gross salary, your taxable salary would be £40,000. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My taxable salary would be £40,000 after those deductions.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Ben. 

Just to be clear, are you applying for, or do you currently hold, a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I currently have a Skilled Worker Visa. I'm concerned about whether these salary sacrifice arrangements might affect my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Ben.

Based on the information you've provided, and the rules surrounding the Skilled Worker Visa, your current salary sacrifice arrangements may unfortunately be problematic. The Skilled Worker Visa requires a salary *after* any voluntary deductions to be at least £41,700 (or £33,400 depending on the job code). 

Since your salary *after* the £2,000 sacrifice is £40,000, this falls below the threshold. While you initially met the requirements, this change could be considered a breach of the sponsorship rules for your employer. 

Do you understand what I'm explaining? Would you like me to clarify any part of this?





[evaluation_judge]: I understand, yes. So even though my initial salary of £42,000 is above the threshold, after my salary sacrifice of £2,000, my taxable salary of £40,000 falls below the required minimum of £41,700 for my Skilled Worker Visa. That means I'm now in breach of the visa requirements, correct?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Ben. That is absolutely correct. 

Even though your *initial* salary was above the threshold, the Home Office assesses eligibility based on your salary *after* any voluntary deductions. Because your taxable salary after the sacrifice is below £41,700, it could lead to issues with your visa.

Your employer is also potentially in breach of their sponsorship duties by allowing your salary to fall below the required level.

Would you like me to summarise the situation, or would you like to explore potential options – though I must stress I cannot provide immigration advice?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you please summarize the situation for me? And maybe briefly explain what potential consequences this might have?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ben. Here's a summary:

You currently hold a Skilled Worker Visa with a gross salary of £42,000. You’ve recently made salary sacrifices totaling £2,000 through a Cycle to Work scheme and additional pension contributions, bringing your taxable salary down to £40,000.

The Skilled Worker Visa rules state that your salary *after* any voluntary deductions must be at least £41,700 (or £33,400 depending on your job code). Because your current taxable salary is below this threshold, your visa is potentially not compliant with the requirements. This means both you and your employer could face consequences.

**Potential consequences could include:**

*   **Visa Refusal (if applying for an extension or ILR):** If you were to apply for an extension to your visa, or Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), your application could be refused.
*   **Visa Curtailment or Revocation:** The Home Office could shorten your visa or, in more serious cases, revoke it entirely.
*   **Employer Sanctions:** Your employer could face penalties, including losing their Sponsor Licence, which would prevent them from sponsoring other workers in the future.

It’s important to note that I am not an immigration advisor, and this is not legal advice. I strongly recommend you seek professional guidance from a qualified immigration lawyer or advisor to discuss your specific situation and explore your options.



Do you have any other questions for me at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for that thorough explanation. This is quite concerning. I didn't realize that salary sacrifice schemes could impact my visa status this way. Is there anything I should do immediately, like canceling my Cycle to Work scheme, or should I speak to an immigration advisor first before making any changes?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ben. I understand this is concerning – it's good you're asking these questions.

Given the potential consequences, I would strongly recommend speaking to a qualified immigration advisor *before* making any changes to your current arrangements. While cancelling the scheme might seem like a quick fix, it's best to understand the full implications of any action you take.

An advisor can assess your specific situation, explain your options in detail, and advise you on the best course of action to protect your visa status. They can also advise on whether cancelling the scheme immediately would be the most appropriate step, and if there are any other factors to consider.

It's generally better to have expert guidance before making any changes that could affect your immigration status. Would you like me to reiterate anything I've said, or is there anything else I can help with at this stage?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's clear. I'll make an appointment with an immigration advisor as soon as possible. Thank you for explaining this situation to me - I had no idea these salary sacrifice schemes could impact my visa status. You've been very helpful.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ben. I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you. It's easy to overlook these details, and it's smart of you to be proactive. 

I wish you all the best in speaking with an immigration advisor and resolving this. If you have any further questions in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. 

Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my Skilled Worker Visa would be invalid because my salary after the £2,000 sacrifice (£40,000) falls below the required threshold of £41,700. They accurately explained that the Home Office assesses eligibility based on salary after voluntary deductions and properly outlined the potential consequences.
