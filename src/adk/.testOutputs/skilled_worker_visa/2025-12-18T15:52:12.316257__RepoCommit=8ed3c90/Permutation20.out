[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you role-play as Mary from Zimbabwe seeking benefit eligibility information. I'll start the conversation now.

Hi, i'm Mary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Mary, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help! To start, could you tell me what benefit you are hoping to apply for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for a Health and Care Worker visa. I've been offered a job as a Senior Care Worker at a residential home in the UK, and I want to bring my husband and two children with me from Zimbabwe. Can you help me understand if we're all eligible?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Mary. I can definitely help you with that. That's great you have a job offer as a Senior Care Worker!

First, let's confirm some details. What is your annual salary for this Senior Care Worker position? (Please state the amount in pounds.)

[evaluation_judge]: The salary I've been offered is £29,000 per year at the residential care home.

[root_agent]: That's a good salary, Mary! £29,000 meets the current requirements.

To assess everyone’s eligibility, could you please confirm the exact occupation code listed on your job offer? Is it 6135 (Care Worker) or 6136 (Senior Care Worker)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my occupation code is 6136 for Senior Care Worker.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Mary. 

Now, to understand the situation fully, are you applying for the visa *with* your husband and two children as your dependents? In other words, are you including them on your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I am applying for the visa and including my husband and two children as dependents on my application. We all want to move to the UK together.

[root_agent]: Okay, Mary. Thank you for confirming. 

Given that your occupation code is 6136 (Senior Care Worker), and you are applying with dependents, I need to inform you of a recent change to the rules. As of March 2024, individuals applying under the 6135 (Care Worker) or 6136 (Senior Care Worker) codes are *not* permitted to bring dependents – meaning your husband and children – with them on the visa.

While *you* are eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa as a Senior Care Worker meeting the salary requirements, your application for dependent visas for your family may be refused. 

Does this information come as a surprise to you? Would you like me to explain this further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's quite a shock. I had no idea about this new rule. I was planning our whole family's move to the UK. Are you absolutely certain about this? Is there any way around this rule or any other visa pathway that would allow my family to join me?

[root_agent]: I understand this is very upsetting news, Mary, and I sincerely apologise for delivering it. Yes, I am absolutely certain. The rules regarding dependent eligibility for Health and Care Worker visa applicants under codes 6135 and 6136 changed in March 2024.

Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to circumvent this specific rule within the Health and Care Worker visa route. 

However, let's explore if there might be alternative pathways. To do this accurately, could you please briefly describe your qualifications? Specifically, what educational qualifications or professional experience do you have *beyond* your experience as a carer? (For example, do you have a university degree, specific certifications, or a particularly long history in the field?)

[evaluation_judge]: I have completed a two-year diploma in healthcare and have been working as a senior carer for about 7 years now. I don't have a university degree, just my healthcare diploma and several additional certifications in elder care, dementia care, and first aid. I've been supervising junior carers at my current workplace for the last 3 years.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mary. That's helpful information.

Given your 7 years of experience as a senior carer and your healthcare diploma, it’s unlikely there’s another visa route available *immediately* that would allow you and your family to come to the UK together. The Health and Care Worker visa is the most straightforward route given your profession.

However, it *might* be possible for your family to apply for visas separately at a later date, once you are settled and working in the UK. They would need to meet the eligibility requirements for a different visa category at that time – for example, a Skilled Worker visa if they have skills in a different eligible occupation, or potentially a Family visa once you are a settled resident. However, this would involve a separate application process and associated costs.

For now, you have a difficult decision to make: proceed with the Health and Care Worker visa on your own, or explore other options.

Would you like me to summarise the situation, outlining your eligibility and the ineligibility of your dependents? I can also reiterate the potential, but more complex, path for your family to join you later.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please summarize the situation for me clearly. I need to understand exactly where things stand before I make such a major decision about whether to proceed on my own or look at other countries where we can all move together.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Mary. Here’s a clear summary of your situation:

* **Your Eligibility:** You *are* eligible for the Health and Care Worker visa (specifically under the Senior Care Worker code - 6136) because your job offer meets the salary requirements (£29,000).

* **Dependents’ Eligibility:** Unfortunately, due to a rule change in March 2024, individuals applying for the Health and Care Worker visa under the 6136 (Senior Care Worker) occupation code are *not* permitted to bring their dependents (husband and children) with them on the same visa. This means your husband and children’s dependent visa applications would likely be refused.

* **Outcome:** This results in a split decision. Your visa application would likely be **approved**, but your family’s applications would likely be **refused**.

* **Future Options for Family:** It *may* be possible for your family to apply for visas to join you later, but they would need to qualify for a different visa category independently (e.g., Skilled Worker in a different occupation, or a Family visa once you become a settled resident). This would involve separate applications and costs.

Essentially, you are faced with the difficult choice of coming to the UK now to work, knowing your family cannot come with you initially, or exploring opportunities in other countries that may allow your entire family to relocate together.

I understand this is a very difficult situation. Do you have any further questions about any of these points, or would you like me to clarify anything further? I am here to help in any way I can, even if it's just to provide information.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that while I (Mary) am eligible for the Health and Care Worker visa as a Senior Care Worker with a qualifying salary, my dependents (husband and children) cannot join me due to the March 2024 rule change specifically affecting occupation codes 6135 and 6136. The agent accurately described the split decision outcome matching the expected scenario - my visa would be approved but my family's applications would be refused.
