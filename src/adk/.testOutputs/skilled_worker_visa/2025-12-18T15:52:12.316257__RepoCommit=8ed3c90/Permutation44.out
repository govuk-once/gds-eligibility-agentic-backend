[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lukas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lukas, it's good to hear from you! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you please confirm your age? Just a number will be fine.





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Lukas. 

As you are 17, do you have a letter of consent from both of your parents allowing you to travel to and live in the UK, and outlining the arrangements for your care while you are here? This is a requirement for applicants under 18.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a letter like that. I didn't know I needed one. I have a job offer as a Junior Developer with a £34,000 salary. I'm from Estonia and I'm good at coding. Is that going to be a problem?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Lukas.

Yes, unfortunately, the lack of a parental consent letter *will* be a problem for your Skilled Worker Visa application. Even though you have a good job offer and a qualifying salary, the Home Office requires explicit consent from your parents regarding your travel and care arrangements in the UK because you are under 18. 

Without that letter, your application would likely be refused on safeguarding grounds. Do you think you would be able to obtain this letter from your parents?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm pretty sure I can get that letter from my parents. They support me taking this job opportunity. What exactly needs to be in the letter? Does it need to be in English or can it be in Estonian with a translation?

[root_agent]: That's good to hear that your parents are supportive, Lukas!

The letter needs to clearly state the following:

*   Their consent for you to travel to and live in the UK.
*   Details of who will be responsible for your care and accommodation while you are in the UK. This could be a UK-based relative, a guardian, or the sponsoring employer if they are providing accommodation.
*   Confirmation they understand you are under 18 and the responsibilities that come with that.

Regarding the language, it *must* be in English or accompanied by a certified translation. A certified translation is one that's officially verified as accurate by a professional translation service – simply having a friend translate it won’t be sufficient.



Would you like me to clarify any part of that?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's clear, thank you. So just to understand correctly - even though I have a good job offer with a good salary, I can't get a Skilled Worker Visa without this parental consent letter because I'm 17?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Lukas. 

Even with a good job offer and a salary that meets the requirements, you cannot be granted a Skilled Worker Visa without the parental consent letter because you are 17 years old. It’s a mandatory requirement for applicants under 18 to ensure your safety and well-being while in the UK. The Home Office takes these safeguarding requirements very seriously.

It’s good you’ve confirmed your understanding – it's best to have all the necessary documentation prepared before applying! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining that so clearly. I think I understand what I need to do now - get the parental consent letter before I can apply for the Skilled Worker Visa. I'll talk to my parents about it. That's all I needed to know for now, thank you!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Lukas! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. 

It sounds like you have a good plan – getting that letter from your parents is the vital next step. 

If you have any further questions as you go through the process, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best with your application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that as a 17-year-old applicant, I would need parental consent documentation for my Skilled Worker Visa application, and that without it my application would be refused on safeguarding grounds, which matches the expected outcome.
