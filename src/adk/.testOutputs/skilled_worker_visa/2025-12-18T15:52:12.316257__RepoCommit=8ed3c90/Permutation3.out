[evaluation_judge]: I'll now simulate a conversation between a user (Dr. Aari) and a benefits eligibility agent. I'll take on the role of Dr. Aari.

Hi, i'm Aari and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Aari, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you please tell me, do you have a job offer from a licensed sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a job offer from a licensed sponsor. It's for a Senior Lab Technician position at a pharmaceutical company in the UK.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear, Aari! 

Now, is the job offered to you at the required skill level – which generally means at least RQF level 3 (equivalent to A-levels)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's definitely above that level. I have a PhD in Microbiology, and the position is a Senior Lab Technician role that requires my expertise in microbiology research.

[root_agent]: Excellent! That's very good to know.

To confirm, do you meet the English language requirements for the visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. I completed my education in English and have taken the necessary language tests.

[root_agent]: Fantastic! That covers another important requirement.

Now, Aari, do you have a PhD in a STEM subject – that is, Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a PhD in Microbiology, which is definitely a STEM subject. I completed it in India before applying for this position.

[root_agent]: That’s wonderful! Microbiology certainly fits within the STEM criteria.

To move forward, could you please tell me your offered salary for the Senior Lab Technician position?

[evaluation_judge]: The pharmaceutical company has offered me a salary of £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Aari. That's helpful.

Do you know what the standard going rate is for a Senior Lab Technician role in the UK? It's important to compare your salary to this figure.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I was told that the standard going rate for this role is £38,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Aari. 

Just to be absolutely sure, are you aware that for this route, your salary needs to be at least £33,400 *and* at least 80% of the standard going rate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm aware of those requirements. I believe my offered salary of £34,000 is above the £33,400 minimum, and I think it's also above 80% of the standard going rate, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact calculation.

[root_agent]: You are right to check, Aari! Let's confirm. 80% of £38,000 is £30,400. 

Your salary of £34,000 is indeed above both the £33,400 minimum *and* the 80% going rate of £30,400. 

Based on the information you’ve provided, and considering your STEM PhD, it appears you **are eligible** for this benefit!





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that Dr. Aari is eligible for the Skilled Worker visa. They accurately verified all required criteria: confirmed the valid sponsor, job skill level, English language requirements, relevant STEM PhD, and correctly calculated that the £34,000 salary exceeds both the £33,400 minimum threshold and 80% of the going rate (£30,400).
