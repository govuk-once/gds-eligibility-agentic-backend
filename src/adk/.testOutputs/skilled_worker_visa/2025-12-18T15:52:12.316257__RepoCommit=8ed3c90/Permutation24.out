[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Banu and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Banu, it's nice to meet you. I understand you're exploring your eligibility for a benefit. To start, could you please tell me what qualification you have?





[evaluation_judge]: I have a PhD in Chemistry. I obtained it from a private university in Turkey. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a work visa in the UK. I've been offered a position as a Senior Chemist with a salary of £35,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Banu. That's helpful. 

To clarify, has your PhD been assessed by Ecctis to confirm it's equivalent to a UK PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I had my PhD assessed by Ecctis, but they determined that my qualification is comparable to RQF Level 7, which is a Master's level, not a doctoral standard. I was surprised by this outcome since my diploma says "PhD in Chemistry."

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Banu. That's important information.

Just to be completely sure, do you understand that because Ecctis did not recognise your PhD as equivalent to a UK PhD, you won't be able to claim the points usually associated with having a PhD for visa purposes?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that. I thought since I have a document that says "PhD," I would still qualify for the points. Does this mean I won't get the STEM PhD discount for the salary requirement? My job offer is for £35,000 as a Senior Chemist.

[root_agent]: You are right to ask for clarification, Banu. Unfortunately, because Ecctis didn't recognize your PhD as equivalent to a UK PhD, you won't be able to use the PhD points or the associated STEM PhD discount on the salary requirement. 

To be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa with a £35,000 salary, you would normally need those PhD points to meet the minimum requirements. Do you know if your job meets the criteria for a higher skill level which might allow a lower salary?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure if my job meets criteria for a higher skill level. It's a Senior Chemist position. Does that qualify for any special consideration? If not, what would be the minimum salary I would need without the PhD discount?

[root_agent]: Okay, Banu. A Senior Chemist role *can* sometimes be considered a higher skill level, but it depends on the specific duties and responsibilities outlined in your job description. However, let’s focus on the salary for now.

Without the PhD points, and relying on the standard Skilled Worker visa salary requirements, the minimum salary you would need is £41,700 per year. Your current offer of £35,000 unfortunately doesn't meet that threshold.





[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing. So my salary offer of £35,000 falls short of the £41,700 requirement since my PhD didn't get recognized properly by Ecctis. Does this mean I'm not eligible for the Skilled Worker visa at all, or are there any other options I could explore?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation correctly, Banu. With a salary of £35,000 and your PhD not being recognised as equivalent by Ecctis, you unfortunately don't currently meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker visa.

Regarding other options, without further information it's difficult to say definitively. However, the most straightforward path would be to negotiate a salary of £41,700 or above with your employer. 

Are you able to discuss a salary adjustment with them?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure if they can increase the salary that much. This is disappointing news. Are there any other visa categories I might be eligible for with my qualifications and current salary offer? Or is negotiating a higher salary really my only option?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Banu. It's frustrating when things don't go as planned.

Unfortunately, based on the information available to me and focusing on UK Visas and Immigration rules, the Skilled Worker visa is the most likely route with your qualifications. There aren't other visa categories that readily appear suitable with a £35,000 salary and your PhD situation. 

While there are other visa routes, they generally have different requirements (like sponsorship from a licensed sponsor, specific skills shortages, or family connections). 

Therefore, negotiating a higher salary with your employer really does appear to be your most viable option at this time. Would you like me to summarise the situation so far?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please summarize the situation for me. I want to make sure I understand everything correctly.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Banu. Here's a summary of our conversation:

You have a PhD in Chemistry from a Turkish university, and you've been offered a Senior Chemist position in the UK with a salary of £35,000.

You had your PhD assessed by Ecctis, but they determined it’s comparable to a Master's degree (RQF Level 7) and *not* equivalent to a UK PhD.

Because of this Ecctis assessment, you cannot claim the points normally associated with a PhD, which includes a discount on the minimum salary requirement for the Skilled Worker visa.

Therefore, you need to meet the standard minimum salary threshold of £41,700 per year, which your current job offer does not meet.

Currently, based on the information available, the Skilled Worker visa is the most appropriate route, and increasing your salary to £41,700 or above appears to be your best option. Other visa routes are unlikely to be suitable given your qualifications and salary.

Does this accurately reflect your understanding of the situation?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly advised that I would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. The correct determination is that I would be REFUSED because without the verified PhD points (as Ecctis did not confirm my PhD as equivalent to UK standards), I cannot qualify with the £35,000 salary which falls below the required £41,700.
