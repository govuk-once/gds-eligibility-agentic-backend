[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Tom, nice to meet you. I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant. To understand your eligibility, could you please tell me, are you currently employed in the UK?


[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently employed as a banker in the UK under a work visa. My employer is sponsoring me, but I'm concerned because of some recent changes at the bank.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Tom. That's good to know. Has your salary recently changed?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it has. There's been an economic downturn and the bank has implemented a 20% salary cut for all employees. I was on £50,000 but now my salary has been reduced to £40,000. I'm worried about how this might affect my visa sponsorship.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Tom. To clarify, was your salary *above* £41,700 when your sponsorship was initially approved?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. When my sponsorship was initially approved, I was on £50,000, which was well above the £41,700 threshold. The reduction to £40,000 only happened recently due to the company-wide cuts.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Tom. So, your current salary is £40,000. Does that £40,000 represent a gross annual salary before tax?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The £40,000 is my gross annual salary before tax. It was reduced from my original £50,000 gross salary when the company implemented the 20% cut across the board.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tom. Based on the information you've provided, your salary is now below the minimum threshold of £41,700 required for the Skilled Worker visa. Do you understand that, according to the rules, continued sponsorship may not be possible at this salary level?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I was worried about this. So my sponsorship can't continue at this lower salary? What are my options? Does this mean I'll have to leave the UK?

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, Tom. Unfortunately, that is correct. With your salary now below £41,700, your sponsorship is at risk. Your employer would need to either restore your salary to at least £41,700 or, unfortunately, they would need to end your sponsorship. 

To be clear, ending your sponsorship could eventually lead to you needing to leave the UK, although there may be time to find alternative sponsorship or explore other visa options. 

Are you aware of any discussions with your employer regarding potentially restoring your salary or exploring alternative sponsorship options?

[evaluation_judge]: No, there haven't been any discussions about this yet. The salary cuts were announced as a temporary measure to weather the economic downturn, but there was no specific mention about addressing visa sponsorship issues. I should probably speak to my HR department about this urgently then. How much time would I typically have to sort this out once my sponsorship becomes non-compliant?

[root_agent]: You are right to speak with HR urgently, Tom. Regarding the timeframe, there isn't a fixed amount of time, but your sponsor (the bank) is expected to act promptly once they are aware the sponsorship is no longer compliant. 

Generally, the Home Office expects sponsors to notify them of changes affecting a worker's eligibility "without undue delay". While 'undue delay' isn't precisely defined, it's best to assume a relatively short period – typically within a few weeks – to rectify the situation or begin the process of ending the sponsorship. 

It’s crucial to proactively discuss this with your HR department to understand their plan and the timeline they anticipate. Would you like me to reiterate any part of this information?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's very clear, thank you. So I should speak to my HR immediately about either raising my salary back above the £41,700 threshold or discussing other options if they can't do that. I appreciate your help explaining this situation to me. It sounds like I need to act quickly to avoid compliance issues with my visa.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Tom. You've understood the situation perfectly. Acting quickly and speaking with HR is definitely the right course of action. I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you the best of luck in resolving this with your employer.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my sponsorship cannot continue with the reduced salary of £40,000 as it falls below the required threshold of £41,700, matching the expected outcome of sponsorship termination.
