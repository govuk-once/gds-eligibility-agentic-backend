[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Claire and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Claire, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm looking to get a UK work visa. I've been offered a position as CEO of a small startup in London with a salary of £55,000 per year. I'm currently based in the US, but I'm excited about this opportunity and want to make sure I'd be eligible before I proceed further.

[root_agent]: That's fantastic to hear about the job offer, Claire! A CEO position in London sounds exciting. 

To assess your eligibility for a UK work visa, specifically the Skilled Worker visa, could you please confirm that your job offer meets the minimum salary threshold of £41,700 per year?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my job offer is for £55,000 per year, which is definitely above the minimum £41,700 threshold. I was pleased about that when I received the offer, as I know the UK has specific salary requirements for work visas.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Claire! It's good you're aware of the salary requirements. 

To further assess your eligibility, could you tell me the specific occupation code for your CEO position? This is a six-digit code used to categorise jobs and determine the 'going rate' for that role. You might find this on the job offer or you can ask your potential employer.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the occupation code is 1115, for Chief Executives and Senior Officials. The company mentioned this in their communications about the visa process.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Claire. 

Now, to confirm – the 'going rate' for a Chief Executive and Senior Official (SOC code 1115) is currently £78,000 per year. 

Knowing your salary is £55,000, does your offered salary meet this 'going rate' for your position?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I didn't realize the going rate for CEOs in the UK was £78,000. No, my offered salary of £55,000 doesn't meet that going rate. I thought since it was above the general threshold of £41,700, that would be sufficient. The company is a small startup, so I understand why they're not offering the full going rate, but I wasn't aware there was a specific rate for my position.

[root_agent]: You're right to ask and to clarify, Claire. It's a common misunderstanding! While meeting the general threshold of £41,700 is important, the Skilled Worker visa also requires that the salary meets the 'going rate' for the specific occupation. In your case, as a Chief Executive (SOC code 1115), the 'going rate' is indeed £78,000.

Unfortunately, because your salary of £55,000 is below the going rate for your position, you would not currently meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker visa.



I understand this is likely disappointing news. Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that is disappointing. I was really looking forward to this opportunity. Could you confirm there are no exceptions for startups or smaller companies? I mean, £55,000 is still a good salary, and this is a growing company with potential. Are there any other visa options I might be eligible for with this offer?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Claire, and I'm happy to explain further.

You are correct to ask about exceptions. Unfortunately, there are currently no exceptions to the going rate requirement for startups or smaller companies, even if the offered salary is considered good overall. The rules are quite strict on this point – the salary *must* meet the going rate for the specific occupation code.

Regarding other visa options, with a salary of £55,000 and the role of CEO, it's unlikely you'd qualify for alternative work visas. The Skilled Worker visa is the most appropriate route for a role like yours. 

However, it *might* be worth discussing with the company if they are willing to increase your salary to meet the £78,000 going rate. If they were to do so, you would then meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker visa.

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official government guidance on salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa, so you can review the details yourself? (Please note, I can't provide direct links, but I can tell you where to find it on the gov.uk website).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, if you could tell me where to find the official information, that would be helpful. I'll also need to go back to the company to discuss whether they might be able to increase the salary. I know startups often have budget constraints, but perhaps there's some flexibility. Is there anything else I should know about the visa requirements if they are able to meet the going rate?

[root_agent]: Certainly. You can find the official guidance on salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa on the UK government website at: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/salary-requirements](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/salary-requirements)

If the company *were* able to increase your salary to meet the £78,000 going rate, there are a few other key requirements to be aware of:

*   **Sponsorship:** The company must be a licensed sponsor with the Home Office. They will need to assign you a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS).
*   **English Language Proficiency:** You’ll need to prove your English language ability, usually through a recognised English language test.
*   **Suitability Requirements:** You will need to meet certain suitability requirements, such as not having a criminal record.

Even with a salary that meets the going rate, these other criteria must also be fulfilled for your visa application to be successful. I recommend checking the entire guidance on the gov.uk website for a full list of requirements.

I wish you the best of luck in your discussions with the company, Claire! I hope you can find a solution that allows you to pursue this opportunity.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa because my offered salary (£55,000) doesn't meet the going rate for a CEO (£78,000), even though it exceeds the general threshold of £41,700. This matches the expected outcome of REFUSED.
