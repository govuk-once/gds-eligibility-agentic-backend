[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Elena, it's lovely to meet you! I understand you're exploring your eligibility for a UK visa. To start, could you please confirm your age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 35 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Elena. And what is your nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm Brazilian.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. Do you have a job offer from a UK employer who is a licensed sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer from a fintech firm in London. They're a licensed sponsor.

[root_agent]: That's excellent to hear! What is the job title of the role you've been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a role as a Senior Engineering Manager.

[root_agent]: Thank you. The Skilled Worker visa requires jobs to be at a certain skill level. Is this role at RQF level 6 or above? (This generally includes roles like managerial or specialist technical roles).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been told it's at RQF Level 6.

[root_agent]: Wonderful. Now, regarding English language ability, have you taken a Secure English Language Test (SELT) and met the required standard?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I passed the SELT with distinction.

[root_agent]: That's fantastic, Elena! Now let's talk about salary. What is the annual salary offered to you in this role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £85,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Senior Engineering Manager role, as determined by the UK government? (Don't worry if you don't know exactly, just an approximate figure is fine).

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the going rate for this role is around £75,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Elena. To confirm, does the £85,000 salary meet the minimum threshold of £41,700 per year?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it definitely does.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And does the £85,000 salary meet or exceed the going rate of £75,000 for your role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offer of £85,000 exceeds the going rate of £75,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, Elena, based on the information you've provided, you appear to **meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa** under the standard route! Your salary is above both the general threshold and the going rate for your occupation, and you've confirmed you meet the other criteria regarding sponsorship, skill level and English language ability. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly assessed my eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa. My salary of £85,000 exceeds both the general threshold (£41,700) and the going rate for my occupation (£75,000), and I meet all other requirements.
