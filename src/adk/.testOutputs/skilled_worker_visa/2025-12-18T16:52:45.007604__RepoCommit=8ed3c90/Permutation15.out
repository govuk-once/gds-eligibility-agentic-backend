[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you evaluate the agent by playing the role of Lina, a hospitality expert seeking information about visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Lina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lina, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me what type of benefit you are interested in applying for? Specifically, are you looking into the Skilled Worker Visa?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I'm interested in the Skilled Worker Visa. I've received a job offer as a Construction Labourer in the UK with a salary of £45,000, and I'd like to know if I'm eligible to apply.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Lina! A salary of £45,000 is certainly good. To assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa, could you please tell me the occupation code for the job offer you've received? You should find this on the job details.

[evaluation_judge]: The job offer says the occupation code is 9120, which is for Elementary construction occupations. I'll be working as a Construction Labourer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Lina. Now, to confirm, does your job offer specify the skill level of the role, or are you aware of what RQF level it falls under? Knowing this helps determine eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure, but I believe Construction Labourer falls under a more basic skill level. The employer hasn't specifically mentioned an RQF level in my offer letter. Is that something important for the visa?

[root_agent]: You are right to ask, Lina, it *is* very important. The Skilled Worker Visa requires the job to be at RQF Level 3 or above. Based on the occupation code you provided (9120 for Elementary construction occupations), this role is unfortunately typically considered to be at RQF Level 1 or 2. 

Therefore, I'm afraid that based on this information, you would **not** currently meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. So even though the salary is quite good at £45,000, I wouldn't qualify because the job skill level is too low? Is there anything I can do about this, or are there any other visa options I could look into with this job offer?

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly, Lina. Even with a good salary, the Skilled Worker Visa has specific requirements around the skill level of the job itself. Unfortunately, the RQF level is a firm requirement.

Regarding other options with this specific job offer – and I must stress I can *only* advise on the Skilled Worker Visa – it's unlikely there are alternatives. This visa is designed for skilled workers in eligible occupations at the required skill level. 

However, it might be worth exploring if there are any opportunities within the company for roles that *do* meet the RQF Level 3 requirement. Would you be open to discussing that possibility with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. I might speak with the employer about other positions they have that meet the RQF Level 3 requirement. Are there any specific roles in construction or related fields that you know would qualify? And just to be completely clear, with my current job offer as a Construction Labourer, there's absolutely no way to get a Skilled Worker Visa, right?

[root_agent]: You're being very thorough, which is good! You are absolutely correct – with the current job offer as a Construction Labourer (occupation code 9120, RQF Level 1/2), there is no pathway to a Skilled Worker Visa.

As for roles that *would* qualify within construction or related fields, some examples that often meet the RQF Level 3+ requirement include:

*   **Bricklayers:** (Occupation Code 7211) - generally RQF Level 3
*   **Carpenters:** (Occupation Code 7212) - generally RQF Level 3
*   **Electricians:** (Occupation Code 7221) - generally RQF Level 3
*   **Plumbers:** (Occupation Code 7231) - generally RQF Level 3
*   **Site Managers:** (Occupation Code 1311) - RQF Level 6 or above.

However, it’s crucial to always verify the specific RQF level for *each* job offer, as it can vary. These are just examples, and the actual requirements will depend on the specific details of the role.





[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. Thank you for explaining everything.

✓ The agent gave the correct information and outcome. They accurately explained that as a Construction Labourer (occupation code 9120), I would not qualify for a Skilled Worker visa because the job is at RQF Level 1/2, and the visa requires jobs to be at RQF Level 3 or above. They correctly stated I would be refused despite the high salary of £45,000.
