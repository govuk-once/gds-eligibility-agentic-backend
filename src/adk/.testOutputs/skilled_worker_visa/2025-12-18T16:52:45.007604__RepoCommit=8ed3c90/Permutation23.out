[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Elara, a specialized Engineer, to test the agent's knowledge about whether her job offer meets the criteria for certain benefits.

Hi, i'm Elara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Elara, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are hoping to be eligible for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm hoping to find out if I'm eligible for a skilled worker visa. I've just received a job offer as a Structural Engineer with a company in the UK, but I'm not sure if my salary meets the requirements.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you've received a job offer! We can definitely check your eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa. 

To begin, what is your *gross basic salary* – that is, the salary before any deductions like taxes or pension contributions? I need to understand the base salary *only*, not including any additional allowances.

[evaluation_judge]: My base salary in the job offer is £38,000. They're also offering me a car allowance of £5,000 and a housing stipend of £4,000, which would bring the total package to £47,000. But I understand the base salary is what matters most for the visa requirements.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to focus on the base salary, as allowances are not included in the calculation for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Just to confirm, the current standard threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa is £38,700. 

Does your job fall under any eligible occupation codes that have a lower salary threshold than £38,700? Perhaps your job title is slightly different than 'Structural Engineer', or falls under a more specific SOC code?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I wasn't aware the threshold was £38,700 now. My job title is definitely Structural Engineer, and I don't believe it falls under any special categories with lower thresholds. So my base salary is £38,000, which sounds like it might be slightly below what's required.

[root_agent]: You are correct. As of April 4th, 2024, the general threshold *is* £38,700. And with a base salary of £38,000, unfortunately, it does appear you don't currently meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa.

To be absolutely clear, the car allowance and housing stipend *cannot* be added to your base salary for the purposes of meeting this threshold. 

I'm very sorry to deliver this news. Would you like me to explain anything further about the requirements, or perhaps discuss potential options with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please explain what my options might be? Would the employer need to increase my base salary to meet the threshold? How much would they need to increase it by to qualify me for the visa?

[root_agent]: Certainly. Your employer would need to increase your base salary to meet, or exceed, the £38,700 threshold. 

Currently, your base salary is £38,000. Therefore, they would need to increase it by at least £700 to reach the minimum requirement. 

Essentially, the £5,000 car allowance and the £4,000 housing stipend are not relevant when determining your eligibility. Only the gross basic salary is considered.

Would you like me to reiterate any of this, or perhaps explain how the Skilled Worker Visa salary requirements are determined in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: So they only need to increase it by £700 to reach £38,700, and then I would meet the threshold? That doesn't sound too difficult. I thought the threshold might be higher.

Just to double-check - if my employer adjusts my base salary to £38,700 or above, would I definitely meet the requirements then, assuming all my other qualifications are in order?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct! An increase of £700 would bring your base salary to £38,700, and you would then meet the general salary threshold.

And you are also correct to ask about other qualifications. *Assuming* all your other qualifications are in order – such as having a valid job offer from a licensed sponsor, meeting the skill level requirements for the job, and passing English language proficiency tests – then yes, a base salary of £38,700 or above would make you eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa, based on salary requirements.

It’s important to remember that salary is just *one* of the requirements. But you’ve identified the key point regarding the threshold!



Do you have any other questions I can help you with at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information. The prompt states the threshold is £41,700, but the agent repeatedly stated it was £38,700, leading to the incorrect conclusion that a £700 salary increase would be sufficient when the actual required increase would be £3,700.
