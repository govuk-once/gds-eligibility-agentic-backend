[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Kenji, a Japanese graphic designer with a job offer in the UK that's below the minimum salary threshold.

Hi, i'm Kenji and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Kenji, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you tell me what your job title is?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm a graphic designer and I've received a job offer in the UK. I'm trying to figure out if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: That's great, Kenji! A Graphic Designer is a skilled role. 

To assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa, could you please tell me what your annual salary is in the job offer you’ve received?

[evaluation_judge]: The company has offered me a salary of £30,000 per year. Is that enough for a Skilled Worker visa? I'm coming from Japan and this would be my first job in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Kenji. 

Just to clarify, is this job offer from a company that is a licensed sponsor with the UK government?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company confirmed they are a licensed sponsor with the UK government. They've gone through the proper channels to be able to sponsor workers from abroad.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear, Kenji. 

To help me assess your eligibility further, could you please confirm your highest level of educational qualification? For example, do you have a degree, a PhD, or other equivalent qualifications?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from a university in Japan. I don't have a PhD or any higher qualifications beyond my bachelor's degree.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Kenji.

Based on the details you've provided so far – your job as a Graphic Designer, a salary of £30,000 per year, a licensed sponsor, and a Bachelor’s degree – I’m afraid it appears you currently do not meet the salary requirements for a Skilled Worker visa.

The current salary thresholds are £33,400, and £41,700 depending on your occupation code. As you don't have a PhD, or meet the New Entrant criteria, the minimum salary for the Skilled Worker visa is £33,400. Your offered salary is below this threshold.

Therefore, based on the information given, your application would likely be **REFUSED**.

Would you like me to explain any of this in more detail? Or would you like to explore if there might be other visa options available to you?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing to hear. I was really hoping this job offer would allow me to come work in the UK. Could you explain a bit more about this £33,400 threshold? I thought since the going rate for graphic designers in the UK is lower than what I've been offered, it might be enough.

[root_agent]: You're right to ask for clarification, Kenji. It's understandable to be disappointed.

The £33,400 is a general threshold introduced in April 2024. While the "going rate" for graphic designers might be lower – and your offer of £30,000 is *above* that going rate – the Skilled Worker visa now has this absolute minimum salary floor. 

Essentially, even if the going rate for your profession is lower, the Home Office now requires a salary of at least £33,400 for most applicants to be eligible. This is a new rule and applies even to those with a job offer that exceeds the standard 'going rate' but is below this floor.

There are very limited exceptions (like for those with PhDs or who qualify as 'New Entrants' - which has very specific requirements), but unfortunately, based on what you’ve told me, it doesn’t sound like you currently fall into those categories.



Does that explanation make things a little clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes it much clearer, thank you. It's unfortunate timing with these new rules. So even though my offer is above the going rate for graphic designers, it still doesn't meet this new absolute minimum threshold of £33,400. 

Is there any other route I could explore to work in the UK with this company? Or would I need to ask if they could increase their offer to at least £33,400?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Kenji. It is unfortunate timing with the new rules.

Regarding other routes, with your current job as a Graphic Designer and qualifications, the Skilled Worker visa is the most likely path. Other visa options are quite limited and usually apply to specific circumstances.

Increasing your salary offer to at least £33,400 with your current sponsor would be the most straightforward solution.

Alternatively, you could explore if the company might be willing to sponsor you under a different visa route, if you meet the criteria - but for a graphic designer role, these are less common.

Would you like me to briefly outline some of the other visa options just for your information, even if they seem less likely to apply in your case? (For example, the Global Talent visa, or the High Potential Individual visa). Just let me know!

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would appreciate hearing about the other visa options, even if they're less likely to apply to my situation. It might be worth exploring all possibilities before I go back to the company about potentially increasing the salary offer.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Kenji. Here's a brief overview of a couple of other options, but please bear in mind these are less common for Graphic Designers and have specific requirements:

*   **Global Talent Visa:** This is for leaders or potential leaders in specific fields – science, humanities, engineering, the arts, and digital technology. You’d need to be endorsed by a relevant endorsing body, proving you’re exceptionally talented or have the potential to become a leader in your field. Graphic Design *could* fall under the arts category, but it’s quite competitive. [https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa](https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa)

*   **High Potential Individual (HPI) Visa:** This visa is for graduates from a list of top global universities. It allows you to come to the UK for two years (or three years for those with a PhD) without a job offer. After that, you would need to switch to another visa, like the Skilled Worker visa. It's not a direct route to work, more a stepping stone. [https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa](https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa)

*   **Other Work Visas:** There are visas for specific roles like Health and Care Worker, but these aren't applicable for a Graphic Designer. Other visas (like the Start-up or Innovator visa) require you to establish a business in the UK, rather than taking up employment.

Given your situation, it seems the most realistic path remains the Skilled Worker visa, and discussing a salary increase with your employer would likely be the most effective approach. However, understanding these alternatives might be useful.

Do any of these other options seem potentially relevant to you, or would you like me to elaborate on any of them?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining those options. I don't think my university would be on the HPI visa list, and while I'm a good graphic designer, I'm probably not yet at the "exceptional talent" level needed for the Global Talent visa.

It seems like discussing a salary increase with the employer to meet the £33,400 threshold is my best option. If they can't increase it, I might not be able to take this job opportunity in the UK after all.

I appreciate all your help in explaining the visa requirements and alternatives.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Kenji! You’ve assessed your situation very realistically. It does sound like discussing a salary increase is the most promising path forward.

I’m truly sorry that the current visa rules make things so challenging. I wish you the best of luck in your conversations with your employer. 

If you have any further questions in the future, or if anything changes, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help in any way I can.



Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I have all the information I need for now. Thank you again for your help and the clear explanations. I'll reach out to the company about the possibility of increasing the offer to meet the threshold. Have a good day!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Kenji! I'm glad I could help.

I sincerely hope your conversation with the company goes well, and that you're able to pursue this opportunity in the UK. 

You have a good day too, and please feel free to contact me if you need anything further in the future. Goodbye!
