[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Priya, a Marketing Manager who has been on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022 and is seeking information about eligibility for a visa extension with a new employer.

Hi, i'm Priya and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Priya, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. To start, could you please confirm if you currently hold a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022. I've been working as a Marketing Manager here in the UK since then, but now I've received a job offer from a new agency, and I'm trying to understand if I can switch my visa to the new employer.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, thank you. And to clarify, are you planning to *extend* your current Skilled Worker visa, or *change* employers with a new Certificate of Sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm planning to change employers. I've been offered a position as a Marketing Manager at a new agency, and they've told me they can sponsor me. I just want to make sure I'm eligible to make this switch given all the recent visa rule changes I've been hearing about.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. Considering you've been on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022, and are now changing employers, do you know if the new job offer meets the current going rate for a Marketing Manager? Don't worry about the exact figure right now, just a general idea is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: The new job is offering me £32,000 per year. I know that's less than what new people coming to the UK might need to earn now after the recent changes, but I've heard there might be different rules for people like me who were already here on a Skilled Worker visa before the changes.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to think there might be different rules! Since you have continuously held a Skilled Worker visa since before April 4th, 2024, you may be eligible for transitional arrangements. 

To confirm, is the job offer of £32,000 per year your gross annual salary before tax?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The £32,000 is my gross annual salary before tax. It's what will be stated on my contract with the new company.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And do you happen to know what the "going rate" is for a Marketing Manager, according to the Skilled Worker visa requirements? There are actually two figures that might apply to you - a standard going rate, and a potentially lower "transitional" going rate. Do you have access to either of those figures?

[evaluation_judge]: I was told that the standard going rate for Marketing Managers is now around £42,000, but there's a lower transitional rate of about £30,000 that might apply to me. I'm not sure exactly how these figures work, but I was worried that I might not qualify with my £32,000 offer.

[root_agent]: That's excellent, you've got the right information! Because you qualify for the transitional arrangements, the relevant going rate for you *is* the lower one - £30,000.

Given this, and the fact your salary is £32,000, does your salary meet this transitional going rate of £30,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my salary of £32,000 does exceed the transitional going rate of £30,000. So that's good news. Does that mean I'm eligible to switch to my new employer with my current Skilled Worker visa status?

[root_agent]: Yes, that's very good news! Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you *are* eligible to switch to your new employer. 

Your salary of £32,000 meets both the transitional general threshold of £29,000 and the transitional going rate for a Marketing Manager of £30,000. And importantly, because you held a Skilled Worker visa before April 4th, 2024, you qualify for these transitional arrangements.



Therefore, based on the information we've discussed, your application should be **AWARDED**.



Is there anything else I can help you with today, Priya?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming my eligibility. That's a big relief! I was quite worried about whether I'd be able to take this new job offer with all the changes I'd been hearing about. I don't have any other questions right now - you've been very helpful.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker visa under transitional arrangements. They correctly identified that my £32,000 salary exceeds both the transitional general threshold (£29,000) and the transitional going rate (£30,000), resulting in the expected "AWARDED" outcome.
