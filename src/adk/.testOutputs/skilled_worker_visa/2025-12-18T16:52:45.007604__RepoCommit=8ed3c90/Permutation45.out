[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Hans, a German engineer in this scenario.

Hi, i'm Hans and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Hans, it's nice to meet you! I'm here to help. 

To start, could you tell me which benefit you are interested in applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello there. I recently moved to the UK and I wanted to check if I qualify for any sort of skilled worker visa. I'm an engineer from Germany and I have a Master's degree that was taught entirely in English. I'm hoping that my qualifications will help me settle here.

[root_agent]: Hello! That's great to hear you're exploring the Skilled Worker visa.

To assess your eligibility, could you please confirm if you have a job offer from a UK employer who is a licensed sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a job offer from a company in Leeds. They are a licensed sponsor and have offered me a position as a mechanical engineer. I'm just trying to understand all the requirements before I proceed, particularly regarding my qualifications and the English language requirement.

[root_agent]: That's excellent news about the job offer! Having a licensed sponsor is a key step.

Regarding your qualifications – you mentioned you have a Master’s degree taught in English from Germany. Has your degree been assessed by Ecctis to confirm both its comparability to a UK degree *and* your English language proficiency?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't had my degree assessed by Ecctis yet. I thought that having my Master's degree from a German university that was taught completely in English would be sufficient proof of my language abilities. I have a letter from the university confirming that all courses and examinations were conducted in English. Is that not enough?

[root_agent]: I understand your assumption, and it's a good question. Unfortunately, a letter from the university confirming your degree was taught in English isn't enough on its own. 

For a German degree to meet the English language requirement for the Skilled Worker visa, it needs to be verified by Ecctis with *two* separate statements: one confirming the qualification is comparable to a UK degree, and another specifically confirming your English language proficiency.

Have you looked into the Ecctis assessment process at all?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't looked into the Ecctis assessment process. I was under the impression that since I have a letter from my university clearly stating that my program was taught 100% in English, that would be sufficient proof. This is new information for me. So even though I have a Master's degree with all my courses and exams in English, I still need this Ecctis verification? What exactly does this process involve?

[root_agent]: You are right to ask for clarification, and I apologize for not explaining it more clearly initially. Yes, even with a Master's degree taught entirely in English and a confirmation letter from your university, you still need the Ecctis verification to meet the Home Office's requirements.

The Ecctis assessment involves submitting your degree certificate and other relevant documents to Ecctis for evaluation. They will then issue two statements – one confirming the degree is comparable to a UK Master’s degree, and a separate statement specifically assessing your English language proficiency. 

Would you like me to explain a bit more about *why* this is necessary, and what the implications are for your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please do explain why this is necessary. I'm quite surprised since my English is fluent and I have documentation proving my studies were in English. I'd like to understand what this means for my visa application and what I need to do now.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Home Office has specific requirements for verifying qualifications and English language ability, and unfortunately, they don’t directly trust university letters from institutions outside the UK. They require an independent assessment by a UK-recognised body – in this case, Ecctis – to ensure the qualifications meet the required standard and that the English language proficiency is equivalent to that demonstrated by a test like IELTS.

Because you haven’t had your degree verified by Ecctis with both the comparability *and* English language proficiency statements, your current evidence is not sufficient to meet the English language requirement for the Skilled Worker visa.

Therefore, at this time, based on the information you’ve provided, your application would likely be **refused**. 

The next step would be to apply for the Ecctis assessment. Are you interested in finding out more about how to do that?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing to hear that my application would likely be refused without this Ecctis assessment. Yes, I would definitely like to know more about how to apply for the Ecctis assessment - how long does it take, what documents I need to provide, and approximately how much it costs. I'll need to sort this out before proceeding with my application.

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. Let's get you some information about the Ecctis assessment.

You'll need to apply through the Ecctis website. They offer two statements which you'll need:

*   **Statement of Comparability:** This confirms your German Master's degree is comparable to a UK Master's degree.
*   **English Language Proficiency Statement:** This specifically assesses your English language skills based on your degree.

**Documents you’ll need to provide generally include:**

*   Your original degree certificate (or a certified copy).
*   A transcript of your studies, listing all modules/courses taken.
*   The letter from your university confirming the course was taught in English (this will be assessed *as part of* the process, but isn't sufficient on its own).
*   A certified translation of any documents not originally in English.
*   Identification (passport copy).

**Cost:** The cost varies, but you should expect to pay around £85 - £110 for *each* statement. So, roughly £170 - £220 for both. It's best to check the Ecctis website for current pricing.

**Processing Time:** Currently, Ecctis states processing times are around 10-15 working days *after* they receive all required documents. However, it's wise to allow extra time, as delays can occur.

Would you like me to help you find the specific page on the Ecctis website where you can start the application process? (I can describe where to navigate – I won’t provide a direct link).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful. Please let me know where I can find the specific page to start this application process. I'll budget for both statements and make sure I have all the documents you mentioned ready. It's good to know the approximate processing time too, so I can plan accordingly for my visa application timeline. Thank you for explaining all this - I had no idea this additional verification was required.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Hans! I'm glad I could clarify things. It's a common oversight, and it's good you're addressing it now.

To start the Ecctis application, you'll need to go to their website - search for "Ecctis" on a search engine and you should find it easily.

Once on the website, navigate to the section for **"International Qualification Evaluation Service"**. Within that section, look for the option to apply for a **"Statement of Comparability and English Language Proficiency"**. There will be separate application forms for each statement, so you’ll need to complete both.

The website will guide you through the process step-by-step, and you'll be able to upload your documents and pay the fees online.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the Skilled Worker visa or the Ecctis assessment at this time? Perhaps you'd like to know more about the other requirements, such as financial stability?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for this information. I'll look up the Ecctis website and follow the steps you've outlined to apply for both statements. 

Yes, I would like to know more about the other requirements for the Skilled Worker visa, particularly regarding financial stability. While I get the Ecctis assessment underway, I'd like to make sure I'm prepared for all other aspects of the application.

[root_agent]: Excellent, that’s a proactive approach! Let’s talk about financial stability.

To meet the financial requirement, you generally need to show that you have enough money to support yourself when you arrive in the UK. However, this requirement is slightly different if your sponsoring employer can confirm they will cover your initial living costs.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **If your sponsor *certifies* they will maintain and accommodate you for the first month:** You don't need to show any personal savings. This is the most common scenario.
*   **If your sponsor *doesn't* certify they will maintain and accommodate you:** You'll need to demonstrate that you have £1,270 available in your bank account for at least 28 consecutive days. This money must be readily accessible.

The funds can be your own savings, or it can be provided by a close family member, but certain conditions apply if it’s from a family member.

Does your sponsoring company have a policy on whether they will certify maintenance and accommodation for new employees? Knowing this will determine whether you need to demonstrate personal savings.

[evaluation_judge]: I haven't discussed this specific aspect with my employer yet. I'll need to check if they typically provide this certification for new employees. 

If they don't provide the certification, is it sufficient to show bank statements for the past 28 days with the £1,270 available? Also, are there any other major requirements I should be aware of for the Skilled Worker visa application?

[root_agent]: Yes, if your employer doesn’t certify maintenance and accommodation, showing bank statements for 28 consecutive days with £1,270 available is generally sufficient, *provided* the funds are readily accessible and haven’t come from a loan specifically to meet this requirement.

As for other major requirements, here's a summary:

*   **Sponsorship:** As we’ve discussed, a valid sponsor license is essential.
*   **Job Suitability:** The job must be at the required skill level (RQF level 3 or above) and meet the eligible occupation codes. Your role as a mechanical engineer likely meets this.
*   **Salary:** The job must meet the minimum salary threshold, which currently is £38,700 per year, though there are exceptions depending on the job and your experience.
*   **Criminal Record:** You’ll need to declare any criminal convictions.
*   **TB Test:** Depending on your country of residence, you may need to provide a valid tuberculosis (TB) test certificate. As you are coming from Germany, this is unlikely but always check the latest guidance.
*   **Immigration History:** You'll need to provide details of your immigration history, if any.

It’s also important to note that you'll need to pay an application fee and the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS), which gives you access to the National Health Service (NHS).

The UK government website has a detailed checklist, and it's best to review it thoroughly before submitting your application. Would you like me to help you find the link to that checklist (again, I can describe how to navigate rather than providing a direct link)?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be refused because I didn't have the required Ecctis verification with both the comparability statement and English Language Proficiency statement. They correctly explained that a letter from my German university confirming my degree was taught in English is not sufficient on its own. The information provided matched the expected outcome of being refused.
