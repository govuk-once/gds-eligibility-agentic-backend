[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a UK resident named Dr. Aari who is seeking information about eligibility for a skilled worker visa with a STEM PhD.

Hi, i'm Aari and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Aari, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you please confirm your age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 29 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Aari. That's helpful to know. 

Next, could you tell me about the job you have been offered? Specifically, what is the job title?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Senior Lab Technician at a pharmaceutical company.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And what is the salary offered for the Senior Lab Technician position? Please state the amount per year.

[evaluation_judge]: The salary offered is £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. Do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Senior Lab Technician role in the UK? This is the typical salary for that position.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand that the going rate for this position is £38,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Aari. That's very helpful. 

Now, could you please confirm if you have a PhD? And if so, what subject is it in?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a PhD in Microbiology.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Finally, just to confirm, does the company offering you the job have a valid sponsor licence? This means they are approved by the UK government to sponsor workers from overseas.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company has a valid sponsor licence.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Aari. Based on what you've told me – your age, the job title, the salary of £34,000, the going rate of £38,000, your PhD in Microbiology, and a valid sponsor – it appears you **would be awarded** the Skilled Worker Visa utilising the STEM PhD route. 

Your salary meets both the lower general threshold of £33,400 and is above 80% of the going rate (£30,400). Your PhD in Microbiology is also a relevant STEM subject.



Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or any other questions you have?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's perfect, thank you for confirming my eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa. It's reassuring to know that my PhD in Microbiology helps me qualify through the STEM PhD route. I appreciate your help!

✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be awarded the Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately identified that my salary (£34,000) meets both the lower threshold (£33,400) and exceeds 80% of the going rate (£30,400), and that my Microbiology PhD qualifies as a relevant STEM subject.
