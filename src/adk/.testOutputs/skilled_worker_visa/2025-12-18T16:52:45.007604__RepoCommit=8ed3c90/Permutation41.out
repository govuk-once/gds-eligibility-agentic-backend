[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay this scenario as Ken, a marketing lead who's applying for a sponsored position at a multinational bank, where the HR admin has incorrectly categorized the company size to save on the Immigration Skills Charge.

Hi, i'm Ken and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ken, nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for different benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a marketing lead at a large multinational bank here in the UK. They're sponsoring my visa, but I want to make sure everything is in order. I'm concerned about my work visa application being approved. The bank has already assigned me a Certificate of Sponsorship. Can you tell me if there might be any issues with my application?

[root_agent]: Thanks for providing that context, Ken. It's good you're being proactive about checking things! 

To help me assess potential issues, could you tell me – is your sponsor a licensed sponsor with the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the bank definitely has a sponsorship license. They're a large multinational bank and they've sponsored many employees before me. They've already assigned me a Certificate of Sponsorship for my role as marketing lead. I'm just worried something might be wrong with the paperwork that could affect my visa application.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear they are a licensed sponsor, Ken. 

Now, regarding the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) – do you know if your sponsor paid the Immigration Skills Charge when they assigned it to you?

[evaluation_judge]: They mentioned they did pay the Immigration Skills Charge when they assigned my CoS. But actually, I overhead something interesting - one of the HR admins was saying they classified the bank as a "small" company in the system to save money on those fees. I thought that was strange since it's definitely a large multinational bank. I'm not sure if that matters though?

[root_agent]: That *does* potentially matter, Ken. Thank you for sharing that information – it's very helpful.

Just to clarify, do you know which amount was paid – the £364 or the £1,000 Immigration Skills Charge?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, they paid the £364 rate per year that's meant for small companies, rather than the £1,000 rate that would apply to a large multinational bank. The HR admin seemed to think they could save money this way. Should I be concerned about this?

[root_agent]: Yes, you absolutely should be concerned, Ken. It sounds like there's a significant issue with the Immigration Skills Charge payment. 

To be clear, has the visa application been submitted to the Home Office yet, or is it still in preparation?

[evaluation_judge]: I've already submitted my visa application after receiving the CoS from them. I'm now just waiting for the decision. Is this going to be a problem? Will my visa application be refused?

[root_agent]: Unfortunately, Ken, this is very likely to be a problem, and your application is at high risk of being refused. 

Because your sponsor appears to have underpaid the Immigration Skills Charge, your application is currently **INVALID / REFUSED**. The Home Office will likely contact your sponsor requesting a "top-up" payment to cover the difference. If they don’t pay within 10 working days, your visa will be refused.



I understand this is concerning. Is there anything else I can help you with at this time? Perhaps understanding what your sponsor needs to do to rectify the situation?

[evaluation_judge]: So my application will be refused because the bank incorrectly classified themselves to pay a lower Immigration Skills Charge? That's very disappointing. I should probably talk to the HR department right away and let them know they need to be prepared to pay the additional amount when the Home Office contacts them. Is there anything I can do personally to help fix this situation, or is it entirely in the hands of my sponsor now?

[root_agent]: You are right to be disappointed, Ken, and you’re absolutely correct to speak with the HR department immediately. Letting them know the potential consequences is a very good step.

Unfortunately, at this point, there isn’t much *you* can personally do to fix the situation. It is entirely in the hands of your sponsor to rectify the error by paying the outstanding Immigration Skills Charge when contacted by the Home Office. 

You could offer to provide any documentation they might need from your side, but ultimately, the responsibility for correcting the CoS and paying the correct charge lies with the sponsoring organization.



Do you have any other questions about this process, or would you like me to clarify anything?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my visa application would be invalid/refused because my sponsor underpaid the Immigration Skills Charge by incorrectly classifying themselves as a small company rather than a large multinational bank. They accurately explained that the Home Office would contact my sponsor for a top-up payment and that my application would be refused if this wasn't paid within 10 working days.
