[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi John, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and assess your eligibility, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 32 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, John. Have you recently completed your studies, or are you currently a student? (By 'recently' I mean within the last 6 months).

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not a recent student. I completed my studies several years ago.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Are you currently working towards a recognised professional qualification, such as with the ACCA or ICAEW, or undertaking regulated postdoctoral training?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm working towards my Chartered Accountant qualification with ICAEW.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And what is the salary offered to you in this role as a Trainee Chartered Accountant?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £34,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Do you know what the standard going rate is for this role – a qualified Chartered Accountant – is in your location? It's okay if you need to provide a range.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate is around £46,000 for a qualified position.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, John. Based on what you've told me, it appears you may be eligible for a salary discount due to your professional development. 

Just to confirm, are you currently in the UK on a different type of visa, such as a dependent visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm currently in the UK on a dependent visa and looking to switch.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided – your age, that you are not a recent student, that you are working towards a recognised professional qualification (Chartered Accountancy with ICAEW), and your salary of £34,000 against a standard going rate of £46,000 – it appears you **would be awarded** the Skilled Worker Visa. 

Your salary meets the requirements for the New Entrant discount, as £34,000 is above 70% of £46,000 (£32.2k).



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that covers what I needed to know. Thank you for the information about my eligibility.

Now I'll provide my assessment:

✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be awarded the Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately identified that despite being over 26 and not a recent student, I qualify as a New Entrant due to working towards a recognized professional qualification (Chartered Accountant). They also correctly calculated that my salary of £34,000 exceeds the 70% discount threshold (£32,200) of the standard going rate (£46,000).
