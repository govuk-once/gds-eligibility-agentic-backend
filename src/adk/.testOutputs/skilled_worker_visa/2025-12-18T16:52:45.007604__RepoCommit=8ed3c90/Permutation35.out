[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Alex and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Alex, nice to meet you! I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant. To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for a UK skilled worker visa. I've been offered a job as a Management Consultant with a salary of £38,000. I have a Doctor of Business Administration degree from a university in the United States. I'm trying to understand if I qualify for the points-based system.

[root_agent]: That's great, thank you for the information. To better understand your situation, could you please confirm if your Doctor of Business Administration involved a significant amount of original research, culminating in a substantial dissertation?

[evaluation_judge]: My DBA program was primarily taught courses with case studies and practical business applications. It didn't involve a substantial dissertation or original research component like a traditional PhD would. It was more focused on applying existing business knowledge to real-world scenarios rather than creating new knowledge through research.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Has your doctorate been assessed by Ecctis (formerly UK NARIC) to confirm its comparability to a UK qualification? If so, do you have a reference number or the outcome of that assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I had my degree evaluated by Ecctis. They assessed it as equivalent to RQF Level 8 but specifically noted that it's a "Professional Doctorate" rather than a "Research PhD." I have the assessment report with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you very much for that information. Based on what you've told me – that your DBA is classified by Ecctis as a Professional Doctorate, not a Research PhD, and your salary is £38,000 – it appears you may not meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker visa. 

To clarify, do you understand that the Skilled Worker visa generally requires either meeting a salary threshold *or* having a PhD that meets specific research criteria to qualify for tradeable points?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand that the Skilled Worker visa has a points system where I need to meet certain requirements. I was hoping my doctorate would help with those points since my salary is below the main threshold. But from what you're saying, it sounds like my professional doctorate might not qualify for those PhD points since it's not research-based. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct. Unfortunately, because your Doctorate of Business Administration has been assessed as a Professional Doctorate by Ecctis, rather than a Research PhD, it doesn’t qualify for the points that would allow you to meet the salary requirements with a lower salary of £38,000. 

Therefore, based on the information you've provided, it appears you do not currently meet the eligibility criteria for the Skilled Worker visa. I apologize if this isn't the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to summarise the reasons for this decision?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please summarize the reasons. I want to make sure I understand exactly why I don't qualify so I can consider my options.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here's a summary of why, based on the information you've provided, you don't currently qualify for the Skilled Worker visa:

* **Salary:** Your offered salary of £38,000 is below the general salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa.
* **PhD Points:** You hold a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA). While it’s a doctorate, Ecctis has assessed it as a “Professional Doctorate" – meaning it doesn't meet the requirements to be considered a research-based PhD for the purpose of gaining points under the visa rules.
* **Missing Points:** Without the points awarded for a research-based PhD, you don't meet the necessary points total to offset the lower salary.

Essentially, the visa requires either a qualifying salary *or* a research PhD to lower the salary requirement. You don't currently meet either of those conditions.

Is there anything within this summary that you would like me to explain in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's quite clear. I understand now that having a professional doctorate doesn't help me meet the points requirement since it's not research-based. My salary is below the threshold and I can't trade PhD points to make up for it. 

Thank you for explaining this to me - I'll need to discuss with my potential employer whether they can increase the salary offer to meet the threshold, or I'll have to look at other visa options.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Alex. I'm glad I could clarify the situation for you. Those sound like sensible next steps – discussing a salary increase with your employer or exploring other visa options. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. I wish you the best of luck in your visa application process!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my professional doctorate (DBA) would not qualify for PhD points in the UK skilled worker visa system since it's not a research-based PhD, resulting in me not meeting the eligibility criteria with my £38,000 salary. This matches the expected outcome of "REFUSED" in the scenario.
