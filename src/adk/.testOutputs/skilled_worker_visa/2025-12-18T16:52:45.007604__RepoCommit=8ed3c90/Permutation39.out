[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Layla and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Layla, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help. 

To start, could you tell me the date your Skilled Worker visa was granted?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! My visa was granted on January 1st. I'm an architect, and I'm concerned about something. My CoS start date was also January 1st, but I only actually arrived in the UK on February 15th because I needed to settle some affairs back home. My employer didn't mention any issues with this delay. I'm wondering if this affects my visa status or if everything is still okay?

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Layla. That’s very helpful.

Just to clarify - when you say you "arrived" on February 15th, do you mean that's the date you began working for your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. February 15th is when I both arrived in the UK and started working for my employer. I couldn't come earlier because I had to finish up some projects and handle personal matters in my home country before relocating. My employer seemed fine with the delay when I explained my situation to them.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Layla.

To help me understand your situation fully, could you confirm whether your employer reported your delayed arrival to the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure if they did. When I told them about my delayed arrival, they didn't mention anything about having to report it to the Home Office. They just said they understood about my personal matters and would see me in February. Should they have reported it? Is that something important?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Layla. It is important. 

Generally, Skilled Workers are expected to start work within 28 days of either the visa grant date or the start date on their Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS), whichever is later. 

Knowing your visa was granted on January 1st and your CoS start date was also January 1st, did you begin employment within those 28 days?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I didn't. I arrived and started work on February 15th, which would be about 45 days after both my visa grant date and CoS start date of January 1st. My employer didn't say anything about this being an issue. Should I be concerned?

[root_agent]: Yes, Layla, you should be concerned. According to the rules for the Skilled Worker visa, starting work more than 28 days after the start date on your CoS (or the date your visa was granted, if that’s later) is a problem.

Because you started on February 15th, which was 45 days after January 1st, this constitutes a breach of the conditions of your visa. Your employer should have reported this delay to the Home Office, and it's concerning that they didn't.



Do you understand what I've explained so far?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand what you're saying and it's quite worrying. So because I arrived and started work 45 days after my visa and CoS start date, I've apparently breached the visa conditions. My employer should have reported this delay but didn't. What does this mean for my current situation? Am I at risk of losing my visa or facing other consequences?

[root_agent]: You are right to be worried, Layla. Unfortunately, this situation does carry a risk.

Because the 28-day rule was breached and not reported, your visa is potentially at risk of being curtailed (cancelled). You could face issues if you attempt to travel, or the Home Office could take action even while you are in the UK.

Your employer was required to stop sponsoring you after the 28-day period passed without a valid reason being reported. The fact they didn't report it doesn't change the breach – it just means they also haven't followed the correct procedure.

Would you like me to explain what a curtailment is in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain what curtailment means and what I should do now. I had no idea about this 28-day rule. Should I speak to my employer about this? Is there any way to fix this situation or am I definitely going to lose my visa?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Layla. A curtailment means the Home Office can end your visa before the original expiry date. This would mean you would lose your right to live and work in the UK under the Skilled Worker visa.

As for what you should do now, yes, absolutely speak to your employer *immediately*. Explain the situation and that you understand a breach has occurred because of the delay and lack of reporting. They need to understand the seriousness of this.

Whether the situation can be fixed is difficult to say without knowing if there were genuinely exceptional circumstances causing the delay *and* whether your employer is willing to cooperate with the Home Office to try and rectify the situation. Your employer may need to contact the Home Office to explain the situation and potentially attempt to regain compliance, but this is not guaranteed to be successful.

Do you have any documentation that supports why you needed to delay your arrival (e.g. evidence of unfinished projects, legal documents relating to personal matters)? Even if it doesn't guarantee a positive outcome, any supporting evidence could be helpful.





[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for your explanation. It seems I'm in a serious situation that could result in the curtailment of my visa due to starting work 45 days after my CoS and visa grant date, which exceeds the 28-day rule. The problem is compounded by my employer not reporting this delay to the Home Office.

✗ The agent correctly identified that I am in breach of visa compliance rules and at risk of curtailment, which matches the expected outcome of "COMPLIANCE BREACH / CURTAILMENT RISK." The information provided about the 28-day rule and the sponsor's obligation to report delays was accurate.
