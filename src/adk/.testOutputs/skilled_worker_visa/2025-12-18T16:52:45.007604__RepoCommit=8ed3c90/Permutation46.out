[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Yara who is seeking information about using an expired SELT test for a Skilled Worker visa application.

Hi, i'm Yara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Yara, it's lovely to meet you! I'm root_agent, and I'm here to help. 

To start, could you tell me which benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hello! Yes, I'm applying for a Skilled Worker visa to come to the UK. I already have a job offer, but I'm not sure about the English language requirement. I passed a B1 SELT test about 4 years ago for my Student visa. Can I use that same test result again for this new application, or do I need to take a new test?

[root_agent]: Hello Yara, thank you for clarifying! It's good you already have a job offer.

To understand if your previous SELT test result is valid, could you confirm if that test result was used for a *successful* UK visa application in the past?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I definitely used that B1 SELT test for my previous Student visa application, and it was successful. I lived and studied in the UK with that visa for a couple of years. I'm just wondering if I can use the same test result again for this Skilled Worker visa application even though it's been 4 years since I took the test.

[root_agent]: That’s very helpful to know, thank you. 

Just to confirm, is the level of English on the SELT test result B1 or above?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the level of my SELT test was B1, which was sufficient for my Student visa at the time. I still have the reference number from that test.

[root_agent]: Great! Thank you for confirming all of that, Yara. 

Based on the information you've provided – your SELT test is expired, but was used for a previous successful UK visa application and is at the B1 level – you **are eligible** to use that test result for your Skilled Worker visa application. The rules allow for the re-use of an expired SELT in these circumstances.



Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the Skilled Worker visa, or any other questions you may have?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! I was worried I would have to take another test. So just to be clear, even though my B1 SELT test was taken 4 years ago, I can still use it for my Skilled Worker visa application because I successfully used it for my previous Student visa. That saves me time and money. 

I think that answers my main question for now. I'll continue with my application and use my previous SELT reference number. Thank you for the help!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Yara! I'm delighted I could provide reassurance and good news.

Yes, you are absolutely correct in your understanding. Because you successfully used the B1 SELT for your Student Visa, it is still valid for your Skilled Worker application despite being 4 years old.

I wish you all the best with the rest of your application! If you encounter any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly advised me that my expired SELT test is still valid for my Skilled Worker visa application because it was successfully used in a previous UK visa application (Student visa), which aligns with the expected outcome of being awarded this exception.
