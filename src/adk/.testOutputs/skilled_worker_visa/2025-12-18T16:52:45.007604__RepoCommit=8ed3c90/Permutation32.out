[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ali and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ali, it's good to speak with you! To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me, are you currently enrolled in a PhD program?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently in my third year of a 4-year PhD program in Engineering at a UK university.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that's helpful to know! And have you yet completed 24 months of your PhD study?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have completed more than 24 months of my PhD program. I'm currently in my third year, so I've been studying for about 30 months now.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. Do you have a job offer for a role that is considered a skilled occupation according to the UK government’s list of eligible occupations?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've received a job offer as an Engineering Consultant. The company has confirmed it's on the UK's skilled occupation list and they're willing to sponsor my visa.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news! Just to confirm, have you *already* completed your PhD course, or are you still currently studying?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm still currently studying. I haven't completed my PhD yet - I'm in year 3 of a 4-year program. I still have about a year left before I complete my doctorate.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you’ve provided – you are currently studying for a PhD, you've completed over 24 months of your PhD program, and you have a job offer from a licensed sponsor for a role on the skilled occupation list – you appear to be **AWARDED** eligibility to switch to a Skilled Worker visa. 

PhD students are able to switch before graduating if they've completed at least 24 months of their studies.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa as a PhD student who has completed more than 24 months of my program but hasn't yet graduated, which matches the expected outcome.
