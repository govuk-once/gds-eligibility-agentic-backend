[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Tom, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me, are you currently employed?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I'm currently employed as a banker. I'm on a work visa here in the UK, and my company sponsors me.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Tom. Thank you. Has your salary recently changed?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it has. Due to the economic downturn, the bank has implemented a 20% salary cut across the board. I was earning £50,000 before, but now my salary has been reduced to £40,000. I'm concerned about what this means for my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Tom. I understand your concern. Could you please confirm the minimum salary required for your current visa type? I understand it's related to the 'Skilled Worker Visa' but knowing the specific threshold applicable to *your* visa would be helpful.



(Just so you know, the current general threshold is £41,700, but yours might be different depending on when you were initially sponsored.)

[evaluation_judge]: The minimum salary requirement for my visa is £41,700. I was well above that at £50,000, but now with this 20% cut, my new salary of £40,000 falls below that threshold. That's what has me worried about my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Tom. Based on the information you've provided, your salary is now below the required threshold of £41,700. 

Unfortunately, this means your current sponsorship is no longer compliant with the Skilled Worker Visa requirements. Your employer will need to either increase your salary back to at least £41,700, or they will need to terminate your sponsorship.



Do you understand this explanation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. So because my salary has dropped below £41,700, which is the minimum threshold for my visa, my sponsorship is no longer compliant. My employer would either need to keep my salary at or above £41,700 or end my sponsorship. That's quite concerning news. 

Is there any grace period or anything I can do in this situation?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Tom, and I'm sorry to deliver concerning news. 

Regarding a grace period or options, there isn’t one built into the regulations for this specific scenario. The rules state that continued sponsorship isn’t permitted if the salary falls below the threshold *after* the visa is granted. 

Your best course of action is to discuss this urgently with your employer. They are responsible for ensuring your sponsorship remains compliant. They may need to explore options like a salary adjustment, or unfortunately, begin the process of ending your sponsorship. It would be wise to understand their plan as soon as possible.



Would you like me to clarify any part of this further?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's clear, although disappointing. I'll need to speak with my employer urgently to see if they can make an exception to keep my salary at the minimum threshold, or I'll need to start considering other options. Thank you for explaining the situation to me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Tom. I understand it's disappointing news, and I wish you the best in your conversation with your employer. I'm glad I could clarify the situation for you.

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. Thanks again for your help with this matter.

✓ The agent correctly explained that my sponsorship cannot continue if my salary falls below the minimum threshold of £41,700, which aligns with the expected outcome of sponsorship termination. The agent accurately stated that my employer must either maintain my salary at the minimum threshold or end the sponsorship.
