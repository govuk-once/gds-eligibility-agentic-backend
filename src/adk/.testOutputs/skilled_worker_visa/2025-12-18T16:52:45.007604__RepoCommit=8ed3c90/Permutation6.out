[evaluation_judge]: I'll act as Wei, a Chinese physicist applying for a postdoctoral position in the UK, and test the agent's knowledge about my eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa.

Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Wei, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you please tell me, do you have a job offer from a licensed UK sponsor?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer from a UK university. They've offered me a position as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Physics. The university is a licensed sponsor.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Wei! 

Now, to confirm, is this job at a skill level of RQF level 7 or above? (This generally means a degree level or equivalent).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it is. The position requires my PhD in Physics, which I've completed in China. It's definitely at RQF level 7.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And do you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker visa? This usually means passing a Secure English Language Test (SELT) with the required score.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've passed the English language requirements. I took the IELTS test and achieved the required score for the Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Wonderful, that's another key requirement ticked off. 

Now, the role you've been offered is Postdoctoral Researcher, is that correct? And is the occupation code for your role 2111 or 2311, or perhaps another code related to scientific research or higher education roles?

[evaluation_judge]: The occupation code for my role is 2114 - it's a Postdoctoral Researcher position in Physics at the university.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Wei. So, your occupation code is 2114.

Could you please tell me what your annual salary is for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: The university has offered me £33,500 per year for this postdoctoral position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Wei. That's a salary of £33,500 per year.

Do you know what the standard going rate is for a Postdoctoral Researcher (occupation code 2114) in the UK? This information is often available from the university or online resources. If you don't know precisely, an estimate is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for my position is around £46,000 per year according to what the university mentioned during our discussions.

[root_agent]: Thank you very much for that information, Wei. 

Just to confirm my understanding, your salary is £33,500, and the standard going rate for the role is £46,000.

Based on this, does your salary meet the minimum threshold of £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my salary is £33,500, so it does meet the minimum threshold of £33,400, though just by a small amount.

[root_agent]: You are right to point that out, it is a small margin, but it *does* meet the threshold!

Now, 70% of the standard going rate of £46,000 is £32,200. Does your salary of £33,500 exceed this £32,200 figure?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my salary of £33,500 is above the 70% threshold of £32,200.

[root_agent]: Excellent! 

Based on the information you’ve provided, Wei, you **qualify for the discounted going rate** specifically designed for eligible scientific research roles.

**AWARDED.** You meet all the criteria for this benefit!



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I qualify for the Skilled Worker visa. They accurately assessed that my salary (£33,500) meets both the minimum threshold (£33,400) and exceeds 70% of the going rate (£32,200), and correctly stated I was AWARDED the visa under the special discount for scientific research roles.
