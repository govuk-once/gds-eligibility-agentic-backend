[evaluation_judge]: I'll now role-play as Batbayar, a Mongolian history graduate seeking information about visa eligibility based on a job offer.

Hi, i'm Batbayar and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Batbayar, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for UK benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what type of visa you are hoping to apply for?


[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I recently received a job offer from a UK logistics company as an Office Manager. They've offered to sponsor my work visa. I graduated with a history degree specializing in Mongolian history, particularly 13th-century steppe warfare. The job description specifically requires fluent Mongolian language skills and expertise in 13th-century warfare, which matches my background perfectly. I'm wondering if this job offer would make me eligible for a UK work visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Batbayar. That’s very helpful.

To assess your eligibility, let's start with the job itself. What salary are the logistics company offering you for the Office Manager position?

[evaluation_judge]: They're offering me £35,000 per year as the salary for the Office Manager position. It seemed like a decent offer for an office management role.

[root_agent]: Okay, £35,000 per year. That's good to know.

Now, could you describe the main duties of the Office Manager role as outlined in the job description? Just a general overview will be fine for now.

[evaluation_judge]: According to the job description, the main duties include managing the office day-to-day operations, scheduling, handling correspondence, maintaining filing systems, ordering supplies, coordinating staff meetings, and some basic bookkeeping. It's a typical office manager role with administrative responsibilities, but the key requirement they emphasized was fluent Mongolian language skills and knowledge of 13th-century steppe warfare, which they listed as mandatory qualifications.

[root_agent]: Thank you, that's very detailed. It sounds like a fairly standard office manager role with a… rather unusual addition to the requirements. 

Does the logistics company have any existing business connections or clients in Mongolia?

[evaluation_judge]: Not that I'm aware of. When I asked during the interview about why they needed someone with Mongolian language skills and knowledge of ancient warfare, they were quite vague. They mentioned something about "potential future expansion" but didn't give any specific details about existing Mongolian clients or operations. It seemed like they just really liked my background and qualifications.

[root_agent]: I see. That is quite vague, and good of you to ask.

To clarify, does the job description detail *how* your Mongolian language skills and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare would be used in this Office Manager role at the logistics firm? Could you describe specifically what tasks would require these skills?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the job description doesn't actually explain how these skills would be used in the day-to-day work. When I looked more closely at it, there's nothing about translating documents to or from Mongolian, no mention of research tasks related to historical warfare, and no clear connection between these requirements and the actual office management duties. It just lists them as mandatory qualifications without explaining their relevance to the role. During the interview, they seemed more interested in my ability to handle the standard office management tasks than discussing how my Mongolian language or historical expertise would be utilized.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Batbayar. This is very helpful.

Based on the information you've provided, and considering the requirements of the Skilled Worker Visa, it appears there may be an issue with whether this job offer constitutes a *genuine vacancy*. The requirements seem unusually specific to your individual qualifications and don't appear to reflect a genuine business need for the logistics firm.

I'm afraid, based on this, your application may be **REFUSED**. The Home Office may see this as a role created specifically to facilitate your migration, rather than a legitimate employment opportunity.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or would you like to explore other potential issues with your eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you please explain a bit more about what "genuine vacancy" means and why my situation might not qualify? I was really hopeful about this opportunity.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Batbayar. I understand your disappointment. Let me explain the "genuine vacancy" requirement.

The Skilled Worker Visa rules require that the job offer must be for a genuine vacancy. This means the Home Office needs to be satisfied that the job is a real role within the company, and that it's being offered because the company has a legitimate need to fill it – not simply to help someone obtain a visa.

Essentially, the job description and the requirements must be based on the *needs of the role* itself, not tailored to match the skills of a specific applicant.

In your situation, the mandatory requirements of fluent Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare seem highly unusual for a standard Office Manager position at a logistics company with no apparent links to Mongolia. The fact that these skills aren't explained as being required for any specific tasks, and that the company couldn’t clearly articulate *how* these skills would be used, raises concerns that the role was specifically created with you in mind, rather than being a genuine business need.

The Home Office looks very closely at these kinds of situations to prevent misuse of the visa system. They want to ensure that people are coming to the UK to fill genuine employment gaps, not simply to live and work here regardless of actual demand.



Does that explanation make sense? Would you like me to elaborate on any part of it?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. I was excited about this role because it seemed perfect for my unusual skill set, but I can see why it might raise flags if there's no clear business need for those skills. So even though the salary meets the requirements, the Home Office would likely reject my application because the job description seems artificially tailored to me rather than reflecting a genuine business need. I appreciate your honesty about this - it's better to know before I go through the whole application process. Are there any other options I should consider instead?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Batbayar. You are right to appreciate the clarity now, as it can save you time and expense.

Regarding other options, the most important thing would be to look for roles where your skills are genuinely required by the company. While your historical expertise is valuable, it might be better to focus on finding Office Manager positions – or potentially roles within research or translation if you can find them – where the job description focuses on standard office skills, or explicitly requires Mongolian language skills due to actual business needs (e.g., dealing with Mongolian clients or partners). 

Before applying for any role, carefully review the job description to ensure it outlines a genuine business need for all the listed requirements. If the requirements seem oddly specific or tailored to your background without a clear explanation, it's best to avoid that application.

Would you like me to briefly summarise the key salary and skill requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa, just to refresh your understanding?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly stated the outcome as REFUSED when the expected outcome was clearly marked as REFUSED. While the agent did correctly identify the genuine vacancy issue, they failed to provide accurate information about why the visa would be rejected.
