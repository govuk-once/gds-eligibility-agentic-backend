[evaluation_judge]: I'll role play as Claire, a US executive with a job offer as CEO of a small UK start-up, applying for a Skilled Worker visa.

Hi, i'm Claire and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Claire, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa. 

To start, could you please tell me what your annual salary will be in the role you've been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! I'm excited to be moving to the UK. I've been offered a position as the CEO of a small tech start-up in London. The salary they've offered me is £55,000 per year. I know it's a start-up so they can't pay as much as bigger companies, but it seems like a good opportunity. I'm from the US and wondering if this meets the requirements for a work visa.

[root_agent]: That's wonderful to hear you're excited about moving to the UK, Claire! It's great you've found an opportunity as CEO.

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, I need to ask a few questions. First, are you aware of the requirement to meet a minimum salary threshold for the visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've heard there's some kind of salary requirement for work visas in the UK, but I'm not really sure about the details. I've been told that £55,000 is a pretty good salary in the UK, so I'm hoping it's enough. Could you explain what the requirements are for someone in my position?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask about the details, Claire. There are two salary thresholds to consider for the Skilled Worker Visa. 

Firstly, there's a general threshold, which is currently £41,700 per year. Secondly, there's a 'going rate' for your specific job role. The visa requires you to meet *both* of these thresholds.

Could you please confirm the specific job code for your CEO position? Your employer should be able to provide this - it's a standard code used to categorise occupations.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the job code is 1115 for Chief Executives and Senior Officials. The company mentioned this in the paperwork they sent over. So based on what you're saying, I need to meet both the general threshold and something called a "going rate" for my specific role. Does my £55,000 salary meet both requirements?

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing the job code, Claire. Yes, you are correct – you need to meet both.

Let's check. Your salary of £55,000 *does* meet the general threshold of £41,700. However, the current going rate for a Chief Executive (code 1115) is £78,000 per year.

Therefore, your salary does not meet the going rate for your profession. Are you aware of this going rate, and did you discuss this with your potential employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I wasn't aware the going rate for a CEO position was that high. No, I didn't specifically discuss the immigration going rates with my employer. They just told me their budget was £55,000 and I thought that would be enough since it's well above the general threshold of £41,700 that I had heard about. 

Does this mean I wouldn't qualify for the visa with this salary? Is there anything I can do about this situation?

[root_agent]: I understand your surprise, Claire. It's a common misunderstanding to focus solely on the general threshold. Unfortunately, you are correct - based on the information we have, you would not currently qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa with a salary of £55,000, as it does not meet the going rate of £78,000 for a CEO (code 1115).

To be eligible, you *must* meet the higher of the two thresholds – the general threshold *and* the going rate.

Regarding what you can do, the most direct solution would be to discuss the salary with your employer. Explaining the visa requirements and the need to meet the going rate might lead them to reconsider the offer. 

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail, or perhaps discuss other potential, albeit less likely, options?

[evaluation_judge]: This is really disappointing news. I thought my salary was sufficient since it was well above the general threshold. I'll need to go back to the employer and explain this situation to see if they can increase the offer to meet the going rate of £78,000.

Just to be completely clear - there's no way around this requirement? Even if the company is a start-up? And if they can't increase the salary to £78,000, I won't be able to get the Skilled Worker Visa at all?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Claire. It’s frustrating when something seems straightforward but runs into unexpected hurdles.

You are correct to seek complete clarity. Unfortunately, there is currently no way around meeting *both* the general threshold and the going rate for your specific occupation. Even the fact that the company is a start-up doesn’t provide an exception to this rule.

And yes, if your employer is unable to increase your salary to at least £78,000 per year, you would not meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa based on the information we've discussed.

There are very limited exceptions, but they generally don’t apply to standard skilled worker applications. They relate to new entrants to the labor market, or health and education roles. As a CEO, those exceptions wouldn't apply in your case.

I’m happy to reiterate any of this, or to point you to the official government guidance if you'd like to read it yourself. Would that be helpful?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for being so clear about this. I really appreciate knowing exactly where I stand. It sounds like my options are either to negotiate a higher salary with the employer or possibly look at other visa routes if those exist.

Would there be any other type of visa I could apply for with this job offer at the £55,000 salary level? Or is the Skilled Worker Visa really my only option for moving to the UK for this specific job?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Claire. I'm glad I could provide clarity. Negotiating a higher salary or exploring other visa routes are indeed your main options at this point.

Regarding other visa types, with a salary of £55,000 and a role as CEO, your options are quite limited. The Skilled Worker Visa is really the most appropriate route for this type of employment.

Other visa routes, such as the Innovator Founder visa, require you to establish a completely new, innovative, viable and scalable business – it’s not for taking up employment with an existing company. The Global Talent visa is aimed at leaders or potential leaders in specific fields (science, humanities, engineering, arts, digital technology) and requires endorsement from a relevant body, which is unlikely to be applicable to a CEO role unless you have exceptionally high achievements in a relevant field.

Essentially, for a standard employment position like the one you’ve been offered, the Skilled Worker Visa is the pathway – and crucially, it requires meeting both the general *and* going rate salary requirements.

I can confirm this information is based on the current immigration rules. Would you like me to link you to the government website page outlining all the UK visa options, so you can review them yourself, even though the Skilled Worker Visa is the most likely applicable one?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it would be helpful to have a link to the official government website so I can review all the options myself. But from what you're saying, it sounds like I really need to focus on either negotiating the salary up to £78,000 or reconsidering my plans.

I'll definitely need to speak with the company about this issue. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly - it's disappointing news, but I'd rather know now than find this out after submitting an application.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Claire. I'm glad I could help you understand the situation, even if it wasn't the news you were hoping for. It’s always best to know upfront!

Here's the link to the UK Visas and Immigration website outlining all available visa routes: [https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration)

I truly wish you the best of luck in your discussions with the company. Negotiating a salary increase can be challenging, but knowing the requirements clearly may strengthen your case. 

If you have any further questions down the line, or if anything changes, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help in any way I can.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I do not qualify for a Skilled Worker Visa because my £55,000 salary meets the general threshold (£41,700) but falls below the going rate for a CEO position (£78,000). The agent accurately explained that I must meet both requirements and gave appropriate advice about my limited options.
