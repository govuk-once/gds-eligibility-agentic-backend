[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Ben, a Software Developer who's looking for information about his visa eligibility after salary sacrifice arrangements.

Hi, i'm Ben and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ben, it's lovely to meet you! I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant.

To best understand your eligibility, could you tell me what type of visa you are enquiring about?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! I'm currently on a Skilled Worker visa for my job as a Software Developer. I'm wondering if there might be an issue with my visa eligibility. I initially got the visa with a salary of £42,000, but I've recently signed up for a Cycle to Work scheme and increased my pension contributions through salary sacrifice, which brings my taxable salary down to £40,000. Is this going to be a problem for my visa status?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Ben. That's very helpful. 

To confirm, is your current salary *after* these salary sacrifice deductions (Cycle to Work and increased pension contributions) now £40,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. My base salary is £42,000, but after I signed up for the Cycle to Work scheme and the additional pension contributions, my taxable salary is now £40,000. The total sacrifice amount is about £2,000. I just want to make sure this doesn't affect my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Ben.

Just to be absolutely clear, when you initially applied for your Skilled Worker visa, was your salary at or above £41,700 *after* any salary sacrifice arrangements?

[evaluation_judge]: When I initially applied for my Skilled Worker visa, my salary was £42,000 and I didn't have any salary sacrifice arrangements at that time. The Cycle to Work scheme and additional pension contributions are new - I just started them recently.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ben. That’s very helpful to know.

Are you aware that the Skilled Worker visa requirements assess eligibility based on your *gross salary after* any salary sacrifice schemes are deducted?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that. I thought they just looked at the base salary before deductions. So does that mean there could be an issue with my visa now that my salary after these sacrifices is £40,000?

[root_agent]: Yes, unfortunately, that is correct. The Home Office assesses eligibility based on your gross salary *after* voluntary deductions like salary sacrifice schemes.

Since your salary after these deductions is now below the £41,700 threshold, this unfortunately means your visa is no longer compliant with the requirements.



Do you understand what I've explained so far?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. So because my salary has dropped below the £41,700 threshold after these voluntary deductions, my visa is no longer compliant. I didn't realize this could happen. What are the potential consequences of this situation? Does this mean my visa could be revoked or that I'm breaking the rules by continuing to work?

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly, Ben. It's a tricky situation, and many people aren't aware of this specific rule.

The consequences depend on when this drop below the threshold occurred and when it's discovered. If this happened *after* your visa was granted, your employer is technically breaching their sponsorship duties by allowing you to be paid below the required threshold. 

For you personally, it could potentially lead to your visa being revoked when it comes up for renewal. Continuing to work while not meeting the salary requirements could be considered a breach of your visa conditions.

Would you like me to explain the employer's responsibilities in this situation too?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain my employer's responsibilities. I'm a bit worried now - should I cancel my Cycle to Work scheme and reduce my pension contributions to get back above the threshold? Or do I need to discuss this with my HR department?

[root_agent]: Your employer has a responsibility to ensure your salary remains at or above the required threshold throughout your sponsorship. They should have advised you about the impact of salary sacrifice schemes on your visa.

Specifically, they need to:

*   **Monitor your salary:** Regularly check that your post-sacrifice salary meets the threshold.
*   **Report changes:** If your salary falls below the threshold, they should take immediate action, which could include increasing your salary or stopping the sponsorship.
*   **Comply with duties:** Failing to do so is a breach of their sponsor duties and could result in penalties from the Home Office, including a revocation of their sponsor license.

You are right to be concerned, and contacting your HR department is absolutely the best first step. Explain the situation and ask them to advise you on how to rectify it – potentially by increasing your salary or stopping the salary sacrifice schemes. 

Cancelling the schemes to get your salary back above the threshold *would* address the compliance issue, but it’s best to discuss this with HR first to ensure you’re following the correct procedure.



Would you like me to summarise the key points about your visa compliance?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please summarize the key points about my visa compliance so I can be completely clear on what I need to do.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ben. Here’s a summary of the key points regarding your visa compliance:

*   **Salary Threshold:** Your Skilled Worker visa requires your gross salary *after* any salary sacrifice deductions to be at or above £41,700.
*   **Current Situation:** Your salary has dropped to £40,000 after signing up for a Cycle to Work scheme and increasing pension contributions. This means your visa is currently not compliant.
*   **Employer Responsibility:** Your employer is responsible for ensuring your salary remains above the threshold and for complying with their sponsor duties.
*   **Potential Consequences:** Continuing to work with a salary below the threshold could lead to your visa being revoked upon renewal.
*   **Recommended Action:** Immediately contact your HR department to discuss the situation and explore options to rectify it, such as increasing your salary or cancelling the salary sacrifice schemes.

Essentially, the Home Office looks at what you are *actually* being paid after any voluntary deductions, and that figure must meet the minimum threshold.



Do you have any further questions at this time, Ben?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for explaining all of this. I'll definitely speak to HR first thing tomorrow morning. Just to be clear - if I cancel these salary sacrifice arrangements and my salary goes back to £42,000, would that restore my visa compliance immediately, or is there some formal process I need to go through to report the change and fix this?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Ben. I’m glad I could help clarify things.

If you cancel the salary sacrifice arrangements and your salary returns to £42,000, that *would* restore your visa compliance, however, it’s not quite as simple as it immediately being “fixed”.

While your visa is compliant again with the increased salary, your employer has a duty to notify the Home Office of any significant changes to your employment, including changes to your salary. They don’t necessarily need to *request* a change to your visa, but they do need to keep a record of the change and be able to demonstrate to the Home Office that you are continuously meeting the requirements should they ask.

So, while cancelling the schemes gets you back into compliance, discussing it with HR ensures they fulfil their reporting obligations to the Home Office. This avoids any potential issues during a future visa renewal or audit.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed. Thank you for your help - I'll definitely be contacting HR to fix this situation ASAP.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Ben! I’m glad I could assist you. 

It sounds like you have a clear plan of action now. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future.

I wish you all the best in resolving this with your HR department. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that salary sacrifice schemes that drop the salary below the £41,700 threshold make the visa invalid. They explained that the Home Office assesses eligibility based on gross salary after voluntary deductions, and since Ben's salary dropped from £42,000 to £40,000 after deductions, the visa is no longer compliant. This matches the expected outcome of "REFUSED (or Compliance Breach)."
