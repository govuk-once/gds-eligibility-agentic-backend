[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Samuel and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Samuel, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm root_agent, and I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for different benefits. 

To start, could you tell me the specific job title offered to you in the UK?


[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a care assistant in the UK. I'll be working for a wealthy family as an in-home private carer. The job was arranged through a recruitment agency.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Samuel. That's helpful. 

Now, is the recruitment agency you are working with registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the recruitment agency is not CQC registered. They told me they just act as an introduction service between me and the family. They handle the visa sponsorship though.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Samuel. 

Could you please confirm the occupation code for the job you've been offered? It should be listed on your job offer or sponsorship details. The code for Care Assistant is 6135, and for Senior Care Worker it’s 6136.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the occupation code on my job offer is 6135 - Care Assistant.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Samuel. And to confirm, your salary for this position is £45,000 annually?

[evaluation_judge]: That's correct. The family is offering me £45,000 per year for the care assistant role.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Samuel.

Based on the information you've provided – you are being offered a Care Assistant (occupation code 6135) position with a salary of £45,000, arranged through a recruitment agency that is *not* CQC registered, and you will be working as an in-home private carer – I’m afraid you would **not** currently be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. 

The rules state that for Care Worker roles (6135), the employer must be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England. As the agency is only an introduction service and not CQC registered, this requirement isn’t met.



I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain any part of this decision in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: So even though the salary is quite good and the agency has a sponsorship license, I can't get the visa because they're not CQC registered? That's disappointing. Is there any way around this or any alternative visa I could apply for?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood correctly, Samuel. Even with a good salary and a licensed sponsor, the CQC registration is a specific requirement for Care Worker visas to protect those employed in this sector. It’s designed to ensure a certain standard of care and prevent potential exploitation.

Unfortunately, there isn't a direct way around this requirement for the Skilled Worker Visa in your situation. 

Regarding alternative visas, it's difficult to say without knowing more about your qualifications and circumstances. However, the Skilled Worker Visa is generally the most appropriate route for this type of role. Other visa routes, such as the Health and Care Worker visa, have their own specific eligibility criteria and may not apply to your situation as an in-home carer arranged through an agency.

I recommend exploring the UK Visas and Immigration website ([https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration](https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration)) to see if there are any other visa categories that *might* be applicable. However, it's likely that without CQC registration from your employer, your options will be limited.

Would you like me to clarify anything about why CQC registration is so important for this visa type?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd like to understand why the CQC registration is so important. Is it just about standards of care or is there more to it?

[root_agent]: That’s a good question, Samuel. It’s more than *just* about standards of care, although that is a very important part of it. The CQC registration is a key component in protecting workers in the care sector from exploitation.

Here's a breakdown of why it's so important for the Skilled Worker Visa route:

*   **Safeguarding:** CQC registration demonstrates that the organisation is subject to regular inspections and meets specific quality and safety standards, safeguarding both the individuals receiving care and the care workers themselves.
*   **Preventing Exploitation:** Direct employment in private households, without a CQC-registered provider overseeing the arrangement, can be vulnerable to exploitation. The CQC helps ensure fair working conditions, appropriate training, and adequate support for care workers.
*   **Compliance with Immigration Rules:** The UK government has specifically mandated CQC registration for sponsoring care workers to address concerns about potential abuse within the sector. It's a direct condition of sponsorship for these roles.
*   **Quality of Care:** While protecting workers, it also indirectly ensures a higher quality of care for those receiving it.

Essentially, the government wants to ensure that care workers are employed by organisations that are accountable and adhere to specific standards, rather than being directly employed by individual families without oversight. This is why the CQC registration is a non-negotiable requirement for sponsoring a Care Worker through the Skilled Worker Visa.



Does that explanation help you understand the reasoning behind the requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. I appreciate your explanation. It sounds like this restriction is in place for my own protection, even though this particular job seemed to offer good pay. So to be clear, there's definitely no way for me to get a Skilled Worker visa for this particular job with the wealthy family since they're going through a non-CQC registered agency?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Samuel. I’m glad the explanation was helpful. And you are absolutely right to recognise that this restriction is largely in place for your protection, even with the attractive salary.

And yes, to be absolutely clear: based on the information you’ve provided, there is **definitely no way** to obtain a Skilled Worker Visa for this particular job with the wealthy family, as it’s arranged through a non-CQC registered agency. The CQC registration is a mandatory requirement for sponsoring a Care Worker (occupation code 6135) on this visa route.

It’s disappointing, I understand, but unfortunately, this is the situation based on the current immigration rules.



Is there anything else I can help you with today, perhaps regarding exploring other potential visa options or understanding the UK immigration system further?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. I appreciate your clear explanation of my situation. I don't have any other questions at the moment. Thank you for your help in clarifying my eligibility for the visa.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Samuel. I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. 

If you do have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I wish you the very best in your job search and future endeavours.

Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would not be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa due to the lack of CQC registration, which is a mandatory requirement for Care Worker roles, despite the high salary and valid sponsorship license.
