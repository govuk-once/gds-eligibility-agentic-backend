[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Ms. Dubois, a French teacher concerned about her visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Marie and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Marie, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for UK benefits.

To start, could you please tell me what type of work you do?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a French teacher at a private school in the UK. I've been teaching there for about two years now. I work during the school terms only, so I'm what they call a term-time employee. I'm from France originally, and I'm trying to understand if I qualify for a skilled worker visa with my current salary.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Marie. That's very helpful. 

Could you please tell me your *full-time equivalent* (FTE) annual salary – that is, how much you would earn if you worked for 52 weeks a year?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my full-time equivalent salary would be £45,000 if I worked the full year. But because I only work during term time, which is 39 weeks per year, my actual gross salary that I receive is £33,750.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Marie. So, your actual gross salary for the 39 weeks you work is £33,750.

To confirm, is your job as a French teacher on the list of eligible occupations for the Skilled Worker Visa? (You can find a list of eligible occupations here: https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/eligible-occupations - but I don't need you to check it *now*, just let me know if you already know.)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I know that teaching is on the list of eligible occupations for the Skilled Worker Visa. As a French teacher, I fall under the secondary education teaching professionals occupation code, which I believe is eligible.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Marie. Thank you for confirming that.

Now, to understand your eligibility further, could you please confirm whether your salary includes any additional payments or benefits *on top* of your basic salary of £33,750? For example, things like bonuses, allowances, or pension contributions.

[evaluation_judge]: No, the £33,750 is my total gross salary. I don't receive any additional payments, bonuses, or special allowances on top of that. The school does provide a pension scheme, but I believe that's separate from what counts toward the visa salary requirements.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Marie. It's helpful to know your gross salary is a straightforward £33,750.

The current general threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa is £41,700 per year. Knowing you work term-time only, and given your salary, do you know if your occupation code has a "going rate" that might be lower than £41,700? (Don't worry if you don't, we can look into that later if needed).

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure what the "going rate" is for secondary education teaching professionals. I've heard about occupation-specific salary requirements, but I don't know the exact figure for teachers. I was hoping you could help me understand if there are any special considerations for teachers or term-time workers like me when it comes to these salary thresholds.

[root_agent]: Absolutely, Marie. That's exactly what I'm here for.

Let's focus on the salary requirements. The standard annual salary needed for a Skilled Worker Visa is currently £41,700. However, because you work term-time only, the rules state that the salary assessment is based on what you *actually earn* during your working weeks, not a full-time equivalent salary.

In your case, your actual gross salary is £33,750. This is below the £41,700 general threshold.

Based on this information, and without exploring potential exceptions like a PhD or 'New Entrant' provisions, it appears you **do not currently meet the salary requirements** for a Skilled Worker Visa.

Would you like me to explain this further, or would you like to discuss any potential exceptions that might apply to your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this a bit further. I'm confused because I thought my FTE salary of £45,000 might count since that's what I would earn if I worked the full year. Are you saying that for term-time workers like me, they only consider the actual amount I receive (£33,750) rather than the full-time equivalent? And are there any exceptions that might help my situation?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask for clarification, Marie - it can be a little confusing!

Yes, you are correct. For term-time workers like yourself, the Home Office assesses eligibility based on your *actual* earnings for the weeks you work, which is £33,750 in your case. They specifically state it’s based on what you “actually earn,” not the full-time equivalent (FTE) salary of £45,000. The FTE salary is only relevant for calculating potential pro-rating of the "going rate" – but not the general salary threshold.

Regarding exceptions, there are a few possibilities, though I cannot guarantee eligibility without a full assessment:

*   **New Entrant:** If you are newly qualified, there might be a lower salary threshold. However, this typically applies to those very early in their career.
*   **PhD Discount:** If you hold a relevant PhD, there’s a lower salary threshold.
*   **Eligible Occupation Shortage:** If your specific teaching role (French teacher) is on the Immigration Skills Shortage List, this *might* provide some flexibility, but it doesn’t lower the salary threshold itself.
*   **Going Rate:** While your actual salary is below the general threshold, the "going rate" for a French teacher *could* be lower than £41,700. This going rate *can* be pro-rated for term-time positions.

Do you have a PhD in a relevant field, or are you a recent graduate? Knowing that will help me understand if those exceptions are relevant for you.

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have a PhD, and I'm not a recent graduate. I completed my teaching qualifications about five years ago and have been teaching since then, with the last two years being at this UK school. So it sounds like those exceptions won't apply to me. Based on what you're saying, since my actual earnings of £33,750 are below the £41,700 threshold, I likely wouldn't qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Marie. Based on the information you've provided – your actual earnings of £33,750, and the fact that you don't qualify for the New Entrant or PhD exceptions – it appears you currently **do not meet the salary requirements** for a Skilled Worker Visa.

The key issue is that your actual salary falls below the general threshold of £41,700. While your FTE salary is above that threshold, the rules specifically focus on your actual earnings as a term-time worker.

We could investigate the "going rate" for a Secondary Education Teaching Professional (French Teacher) to see if that is lower than £41,700 and if that rate can be pro-rated for your term-time work. Would you like me to look into that further for you? However, please be aware that even if the going rate is lower, it needs to be demonstrably the standard rate for the role within the UK.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would like to know more about the "going rate" and if that might help in my situation. Is that something that could potentially make a difference in my eligibility?

[root_agent]: Yes, it could potentially make a difference, Marie. The "going rate" is the salary level that is considered appropriate for your specific job role. It's determined by the Home Office based on official labour market data.

The current going rate for a Secondary Education Teaching Professional (which includes French Teachers) is £32,700 - £43,860 per year (as of February 2024).

Because you work term-time only, the going rate *can* be pro-rated to reflect the fewer weeks you work. Let's calculate that:

The mid-point of the going rate is approximately £38,280 per year (midpoint of £32,700 and £43,860).

To pro-rate this for your 39 working weeks, we do the following calculation:

(£38,280 / 52 weeks) \* 39 weeks = £28,655.77.

Therefore, the pro-rated going rate for your role, based on your working pattern, is approximately £28,655.77.

Unfortunately, even with the pro-rated going rate, your actual earnings of £33,750 *are still above* the pro-rated going rate. Therefore, the going rate does not, in your case, change your eligibility.

Based on all the information we've discussed, and given the current rules, it appears you do not currently meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa. I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to repeat any of this information, or would you like to discuss other potential visa routes (though I specialize in the Skilled Worker Visa, so my knowledge of others is limited)?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information. The agent stated that because my actual salary of £33,750 is above the pro-rated going rate, this doesn't help my eligibility - but this is incorrect. The problem is that my actual salary is below the general threshold of £41,700, not that it's above the going rate. Additionally, the agent didn't clearly communicate that I would be refused a visa based on these salary requirements.
