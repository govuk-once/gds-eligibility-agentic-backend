[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Julian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Julian, nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for different benefits.

To start, could you please tell me what your job title is?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Sales Director. I've recently been offered a position in the UK and I'm trying to understand if I qualify for a visa.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear, Julian! A Sales Director role sounds interesting. 

Could you please tell me the total salary package offered to you in the job offer? (Please state the full amount, including any bonuses or commission.)

[evaluation_judge]: My offer is £35,000 as my base salary, plus £20,000 in guaranteed commission, and an additional £10,000 performance bonus. So the total package is £65,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Julian. 

To clarify, is the £20,000 commission a fixed amount guaranteed in your contract, or is it based on your sales performance?

[evaluation_judge]: The £20,000 commission is described as "guaranteed" in my contract, but it's still structured as commission rather than basic salary. It's what they call a "target earning" that they've guaranteed I'll receive regardless of performance, but it's separate from my base salary.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Julian. That's helpful to know.

For visa purposes, only your guaranteed basic salary counts towards meeting the financial requirements. 

Could you confirm if your contract explicitly states the £35,000 as your *basic* salary?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the contract explicitly states that £35,000 is my basic salary. The guaranteed commission and performance bonus are listed separately in the contract.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Julian.

Based on the information you’ve provided, your eligible salary for the Skilled Worker Visa would be considered £35,000. 

Do you know if the job you have been offered is on the list of eligible occupations for the Skilled Worker Visa? (Don’t worry if you don’t, we can check that separately if needed.)

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. I know it's a Sales Director position for a UK company that says they're licensed to sponsor visas, but I don't know the specifics about eligible occupations. Do I need to check that?

[root_agent]: Yes, it's important to check that your job title and the specific duties of the role align with those on the eligible occupations list. 

However, before we proceed with that, let's focus on the salary. The current general threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa is £41,700 per year.

As your basic salary is £35,000, which is below the £41,700 threshold, unfortunately, based on the information you've provided, you currently do not meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa.



Would you like me to help you check if your job title falls under a specific occupation code that might have a lower salary threshold, or if your role is eligible at all?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would appreciate that. Is there any possibility that my role could have a lower salary threshold? I'm from Argentina if that makes any difference.

[root_agent]: You're right to ask about a lower threshold, Julian, and your nationality *could* be relevant.

The Skilled Worker Visa does have some exceptions to the £41,700 threshold, particularly for "new entrants" and those with jobs on the Immigration Skills Shortage List. Also, your nationality *could* affect things if there's a specific agreement with Argentina.

However, let's focus on the most likely possibilities first. Is this role on the Immigration Skills Shortage List? If so, there may be a lower salary threshold. 

To check, could you please tell me a little more about the *specific* duties of your role as Sales Director? For example, what kinds of products or services will you be selling, and to what kind of clients? The more detail you can give me, the better I can assess if it falls under a shortage occupation.

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be leading the company's sales team for software products in the fintech sector. My responsibilities include developing sales strategies, managing key client relationships, overseeing the sales team's performance, setting targets, and reporting to the CEO on sales growth. The clients are primarily financial institutions and large corporations across the UK and Europe.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Julian. That's very helpful.

Based on your description – leading a sales team for software products in the fintech sector, dealing with financial institutions and large corporations – it *sounds* like your role could potentially fall under the occupation code **1111 Sales Directors**. 

However, as of today, **1111 Sales Directors is *not* currently on the Immigration Skills Shortage List.** (You can find the list here: https://www.gov.uk/check-skilled-worker-visa/eligible-occupations - though I cannot directly provide the link).

Therefore, the £41,700 threshold still applies. As your basic salary is £35,000, it unfortunately doesn’t meet the requirement.

Regarding your nationality, there aren't currently any specific visa concessions for Argentinian citizens that would impact the salary threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa.



Given this, it appears your application would be **REFUSED** based on the current salary requirements. Would you like me to explore any other potential avenues or explain this further?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave me the incorrect outcome. The expected outcome was "REFUSED" but the reason given was partially correct. The agent should have been clearer that only guaranteed basic pay counts toward the threshold, and my £20,000 guaranteed commission should not be counted regardless of how it's structured, as it's not basic pay.
