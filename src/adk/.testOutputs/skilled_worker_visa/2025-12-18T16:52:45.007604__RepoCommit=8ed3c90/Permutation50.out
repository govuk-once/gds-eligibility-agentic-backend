[evaluation_judge]: I'll assume the role of Sarah and engage with the agent under test regarding my eligibility for a skilled worker visa.

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, it's good to speak with you. I'm here to help assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa. 

To start, are you currently employed by the company sponsoring you, or are you working as a contractor and invoicing them for your services?


[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

I'm an IT consultant and I've been offered a position with an IT firm in the UK. They want to sponsor me for a visa, and they're going to issue a Certificate of Sponsorship for me. But they've suggested I work as a contractor and invoice them rather than being on their payroll - they mentioned something about saving on National Insurance this way. They've prepared a "Consultancy Agreement" for me to sign. Would this arrangement work for the visa I need?

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation, Sarah. That's very helpful.

To clarify, you mentioned you’ve been offered a “Consultancy Agreement” and will be invoicing the company. Could you confirm if this agreement is a contract *for* services, rather than a contract *of* employment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. They've offered me a "Consultancy Agreement" which is a contract for services, not an employment contract. They explained I'd be providing my IT consultancy services and invoicing them monthly instead of receiving a regular salary through PAYE. They said they'd still issue me a Certificate of Sponsorship for my visa, though. Is that going to be an issue?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Sarah. 

Unfortunately, this arrangement *would* be an issue for a Skilled Worker Visa. The visa requires a genuine employment relationship with a company that can act as a sponsor. Working as a contractor and invoicing for services – a contract *for* services – doesn’t meet those requirements. 

The Skilled Worker Visa is for employees on the payroll (PAYE), not for self-employed contractors. Even with a Certificate of Sponsorship, the visa application would likely be refused in this scenario.



Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, could you explain more? I'm a bit confused because the company said they could sponsor me. Would I need to ask them to change the arrangement to an employment contract instead?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Sarah. I understand your confusion – it's good they are offering a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS), as that’s a necessary step. However, the CoS alone doesn't guarantee visa approval.

The Skilled Worker Visa rules require a *genuine* employment relationship. This means you need to be directly employed by the sponsoring company, with all the usual deductions for tax and National Insurance (PAYE). The government’s intention is to bring skilled workers into the UK with the rights and protections of an employee.

A "contract for services" – like the consultancy agreement you’ve been offered – means you are essentially a self-employed business providing services to the company, not an employee *of* the company. This is often associated with IR35 rules, and isn’t permitted under the Skilled Worker route.

You are absolutely right to consider asking them to change the arrangement. To be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa, you would need a standard employment contract, with you being added to their payroll. If they’re unwilling to do this, unfortunately, it’s unlikely you’d be able to successfully obtain the visa through them.

Does that make things a little clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: That does make things much clearer, thank you. So even though they're willing to issue a Certificate of Sponsorship, the actual working arrangement as a contractor doesn't satisfy the visa requirements. I'll need to go back to them and explain that I'd need a proper employment contract and to be on their PAYE system instead of invoicing them as a contractor.

Is there anything specific I should mention when I speak to them about changing the arrangement? I'm guessing this IR35 thing is important too?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah, I'm glad it's clearer now. You’ve understood the situation perfectly.

Yes, you are right to bring up IR35. When you speak to them, you could explain that the Home Office will likely view the arrangement as falling under IR35 – meaning you *should* be taxed as an employee anyway. They are trying to avoid employer National Insurance contributions, but this doesn’t align with the Skilled Worker Visa requirements.

Specifically, you could mention that:

*   **The visa requires a genuine contract *of* employment, not a contract *for* services.**
*   **You need to be on their PAYE system with deductions for tax and National Insurance.**
*   **The arrangement, as it stands, doesn’t meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker and could lead to a visa refusal – even with a CoS.**
*   **The Home Office is likely to consider the arrangement as inside IR35, meaning you should be treated as an employee for tax purposes regardless.**

Being polite but firm about these points should help them understand the necessary changes. You could also mention you’ve been advised that this is essential for a successful visa application.



Would you like me to clarify anything else?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all very clear now. I'll definitely bring up those points when I speak with them again. It sounds like if they want me to work for them in the UK, they'll need to offer me a proper employment contract and put me on their PAYE system - there's no way around that for the Skilled Worker visa.

Thank you so much for explaining all of this. You've been really helpful and saved me from potentially having my visa application refused!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah! I'm delighted I could help. You are absolutely correct – a proper employment contract and being on their PAYE system are essential for the Skilled Worker visa in your situation.

It's always best to be sure before applying, and I’m glad I could help you avoid potential issues. 

If you have any further questions down the line, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you the best of luck with your discussions with the company and your visa application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that a Skilled Worker visa requires a genuine employment relationship with PAYE arrangements, not a contractor relationship with a "Consultancy Agreement." The agent accurately explained that despite having a Certificate of Sponsorship, my visa would likely be refused under the proposed arrangement, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
