[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Yuki and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Yuki, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you please tell me what type of visa you currently hold?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently on a Skilled Worker visa. I'm sponsored as a Graphic Designer.

[root_agent]: Thanks Yuki, that’s helpful to know. 

Are you considering taking on any additional work alongside your current role as a Graphic Designer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly what I'm wondering about. I've been offered a weekend job as a bartender that would be about 10 hours per week. I wanted to check if I'm allowed to do this alongside my main job under my current visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Yuki.

Is the job as a bartender the *same* occupation code as your current job as a Graphic Designer?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's completely different. My current job as a Graphic Designer is obviously a creative role, while the bartending position would be in hospitality.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. 

Is the job as a bartender listed on the UK government's Immigration Salary List of shortage occupations?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't think so. I'm pretty sure bartending isn't on the shortage occupation list.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Yuki. 

Based on what you've told me – that the bartending job is not in the same occupation code as your Graphic Designer role, and it’s not on the shortage occupation list – unfortunately, taking on this additional employment would not be permitted under the conditions of your Skilled Worker visa. It would be considered illegal work.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Is there any way I could take on additional work legally? For example, if I found some freelance graphic design work instead?

[root_agent]: That’s a good question, Yuki.

Yes, there is a way you could legally take on additional work! If you were to take on freelance work *as a Graphic Designer* – meaning in the same occupation code as your main job – that would be permitted, as long as you work no more than 20 hours per week in total on the additional work.

Would you like me to reiterate the rules around supplementary work, just to be clear?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the rules for supplementary work again just to make sure I understand correctly.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Yuki. Here's a summary of the rules regarding supplementary work on a Skilled Worker visa:

You *are* allowed to take on a second job if **either** of these conditions are met:

1.  **Same Occupation Code:** The second job is in the *same* occupation code as your main job (in your case, Graphic Design).
2.  **Shortage Occupation:** The second job is in an occupation that appears on the Immigration Salary List (a list of shortage occupations).

Additionally, regardless of which of those conditions are met, you must ensure that the supplementary work does not exceed **20 hours per week**.

So, freelance graphic design work would be permitted (under 20 hours a week). However, a job like bartending, which is a different occupation code and not on the shortage list, would not be allowed.

Does that make everything clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense now. So because bartending isn't the same occupation as graphic design and it's not on the shortage list, I can't do it. But I could do freelance graphic design work for up to 20 hours per week since it's the same occupation as my sponsored job. Thank you for explaining!

[root_agent]: You've got it exactly right, Yuki! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a great day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly advised me that taking a bartending job would be illegal work under my Skilled Worker visa conditions, and accurately explained that I could do freelance graphic design work instead since it's in the same occupation code as my main job, matching the expected outcome.
