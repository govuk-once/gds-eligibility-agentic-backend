[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Klaus and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Klaus, I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. To start, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 45 years old. I've got a job offer as a welder in the UK, and I want to know if I'm eligible for a skilled worker visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your age. That's helpful. 

Could you please tell me the salary offered in the job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary they're offering me is £30,960 per year as a welder. My potential employer mentioned something about the job being on some kind of special list that allows them to pay me this amount.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know the salary. It's good your employer mentioned a list – that helps! 

Do you know if the job of Welder is listed on the Immigration Salary List?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe the employer said it's on the Immigration Salary List. They explained that because welding is on this list, they can offer me 80% of what they called the "going rate" - which is apparently why they're offering me £30,960.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that the job is on the Immigration Salary List. 

Could you please tell me what the going rate is for a Welder, according to your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: The employer mentioned that the going rate for a welder is £38,700, and they're offering me £30,960 which they said is 80% of that going rate. They seem confident this is acceptable because welding is on the Immigration Salary List.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I appreciate it.

Just to clarify, have you previously worked in the UK, or are you new to the UK workforce? By "new" I mean have you never been sponsored for a Skilled Worker visa before?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't worked in the UK before. This would be my first job in the UK. I've never been sponsored for a Skilled Worker visa before.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying.

Based on the information you’ve provided, unfortunately, your application would likely be **REFUSED**. While the job is on the Immigration Salary List, being on that list alone doesn’t automatically allow your employer to pay 80% of the going rate. The rules changed recently. Because you are a new entrant to the UK workforce, your employer needs to pay you the full going rate of £38,700. Offering £30,960 doesn't meet the requirements.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ This is incorrect information. Although I'm new to the UK, at age 45 I don't qualify as a "New Entrant" under the immigration rules (which typically applies to those under 26 or recent graduates). The correct reason for refusal is that being on the Immigration Salary List doesn't automatically allow the 80% discount anymore, and since I'm not a New Entrant by immigration definition, I must be paid the full going rate of £38,700.
