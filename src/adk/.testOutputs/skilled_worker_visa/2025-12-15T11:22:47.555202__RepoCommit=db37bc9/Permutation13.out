[evaluation_judge]: I'll simulate a user named Tariq who has used 3.5 years of his "New Entrant" time on a Graduate visa and is now seeking information about eligibility for a skilled worker visa with a new entrant discount.

Hi, i'm Tariq and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Tariq, thanks for reaching out. To help me assess your situation, could you please tell me when your most recent visa – the Graduate Visa – was issued?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been on a Graduate Visa for about 3 and a half years now. It was issued after I completed my PhD. Before that I was on a student visa for my PhD studies. I have a job offer as a Junior Data Analyst with a £34,000 salary, and I'm wondering if I can get a skilled worker visa with the new entrant discount for 2 more years.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Tariq. So, you’ve been on a Graduate Visa for approximately 3 and a half years. Just to confirm, could you tell me the exact date your Graduate Visa was granted?

[evaluation_judge]: It was granted on January 15, 2020, so it's been about 3 years and 6 months now. My employer wants to sponsor me as a new entrant since I'm just starting in this field.

[root_agent]: Okay, Tariq. Your Graduate Visa was granted on January 15, 2020. That’s helpful to know. And you’re seeking a Skilled Worker Visa, applying for the New Entrant discount, with a salary of £34,000, and you're hoping for a 2-year visa.

To help me determine your eligibility, could you tell me, do you have any previous visas where you qualified for the "New Entrant" discount – for example, a previous Skilled Worker Visa as a New Entrant?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I've never had a Skilled Worker Visa before. I was on a Student Visa while doing my PhD for 3 years, then I switched to the Graduate Visa which I've been on for the past 3.5 years. This would be my first application for a Skilled Worker Visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tariq. So, to recap: you’ve held a Student Visa for 3 years and a Graduate Visa for approximately 3.5 years, and this would be your first Skilled Worker Visa application.

Given that you’ve spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa, does that mean you’ve used up all of your “New Entrant” time allowance, according to the rules?

[evaluation_judge]: To be honest, I'm not sure. That's partly why I'm asking about eligibility. My employer mentioned something about a 4-year maximum for the new entrant discount, but I don't know exactly how it works or if my time on the Graduate Visa counts towards this limit. Can you explain how that works?

[root_agent]: Okay, Tariq, that’s a really important point. Let’s clarify that. The rules state that the “New Entrant” discounts (Option E) are only available for a maximum combined total of 4 years, including time spent on Student/Graduate visas.

Because time on a Graduate visa *does* count towards this limit, and you've been on your Graduate Visa for 3 years and 6 months, it means you’ve already used up your available “New Entrant” time.

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, you wouldn’t be eligible for the New Entrant discount. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so my time on the Graduate Visa does count toward that 4-year limit. Since I've been on it for 3.5 years already, I've nearly used up the full 4 years. So you're saying I wouldn't be eligible for the 2-year Skilled Worker Visa with the new entrant discount because it would exceed the 4-year maximum, right?

[root_agent]: Exactly, Tariq. You’ve got it perfectly. Because you’ve already used 3 years and 6 months on your Graduate Visa, applying for a Skilled Worker Visa with the New Entrant discount would exceed the 4-year maximum limit.

Therefore, under these circumstances, a 2-year Skilled Worker Visa isn't possible using that particular discount. Would you like me to explain what other options might be available to you for a longer visa duration?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. What other options might I have for getting a Skilled Worker Visa given my situation? The £34,000 salary offer is what I have - would that be enough under different criteria?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s look at your options, Tariq. With a salary of £34,000, you’d likely qualify under Option A – the standard Skilled Worker Visa route. However, to be eligible under Option A, your job must meet certain requirements, such as being a ‘going concern’ and paying at least the minimum salary threshold for your occupation. 

Given your background with the Graduate Visa, it might be challenging to demonstrate you're a truly ‘new entrant’ to the field. However, with a salary of £34,000, it’s certainly a possibility. 

Would you like me to detail the specific requirements for Option A, or perhaps discuss other potential visa routes that might be suitable given your experience and salary?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to know more about the specific requirements for Option A, please. Since I can't qualify as a new entrant anymore, I need to understand if my £34,000 salary meets the standard threshold for a data analyst role under Option A.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Tariq. Let’s delve into the requirements for Option A.

The minimum salary threshold for a Data Analyst role under Option A currently stands at £33,400. Your salary of £34,000 meets this threshold, which is a positive step. 

However, it’s important to note that a salary alone doesn’t guarantee approval. Your employer also needs to demonstrate they are a genuine ‘going concern’ – meaning their business is viable and sustainable. They will need to provide evidence of this, such as financial statements. Additionally, the job role must meet the requirements defined in the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code for Data Analysts.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of Option A, such as the documentation your employer will need to provide, or perhaps the process for determining the appropriate SOC code for your role?

[evaluation_judge]: That's good news that my salary meets the threshold. I believe my employer is a well-established company, so they should be able to demonstrate they're a going concern. Could you tell me what specific documents I would need to provide for this application under Option A? And roughly how long the process might take?

[root_agent]: Okay, Tariq. For a Skilled Worker Visa application under Option A, you’ll need to provide a fairly comprehensive set of documents. Here’s a breakdown of what’s typically required:

*   **Passport:** A valid copy of your passport.
*   **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):** This is issued by your employer and is a crucial document.
*   **Proof of Qualifications:** Copies of your PhD certificate and transcripts.
*   **Proof of English Language Proficiency:** Typically, you’ll need to demonstrate a good level of English through a recognized test like IELTS.
*   **Bank Statements:** Evidence of sufficient funds to support yourself.
*   **Criminal Record Check:** An enhanced criminal record check from your home country.
*   **TB Test Results:** If required based on your country of origin.

Regarding processing times, it can vary depending on the Home Office workload. However, as a general estimate, the whole process, from application submission to visa grant, can take anywhere from 6 to 12 weeks. It’s worth checking the current processing times on the UK government website for the most up-to-date information.

Would you like me to provide links to the specific guidance documents on the UK government website that detail these requirements, or perhaps discuss any of these documents in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the detailed information. I think I understand now that I can't apply as a new entrant with my 2-year visa request because I've already used 3.5 years of my 4-year new entrant allowance on my Graduate Visa. However, I could potentially apply under Option A since my £34,000 salary meets the standard threshold for a Data Analyst role.

I appreciate the list of documents I'd need to prepare. I don't think I need any more information at this time.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Tariq. I’m glad I could help clarify things for you and outline the potential pathway under Option A. It sounds like you have a clear understanding of the requirements now. 

If you have any further questions or need assistance with any aspect of the application process down the line, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Best of luck with your application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I (as Tariq) would not be eligible for the New Entrant discount for a 2-year visa since I had already used 3.5 years of my 4-year maximum on a Graduate Visa. The agent accurately explained that time on a Graduate Visa counts toward the 4-year cap for New Entrant discounts, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
