[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Kenji, a graphic designer from Japan inquiring about UK visa eligibility. I'll interact with the agent under test until they provide an eligibility outcome, then evaluate whether their response matches the expected outcome (which should be that the application would be refused since the £30,000 salary is below the absolute minimum salary floor of £33,400).

Hi, i'm Kenji and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Kenji, it’s nice to meet you. To help me understand your situation better, could you please tell me what type of benefit you're interested in learning about?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I recently received a job offer in the UK as a graphic designer, and I'm trying to understand if I would be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. I currently live in Japan, and the company in the UK is offering me £30,000 per year. I'm just trying to figure out if this would allow me to get a visa to work in the UK.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. To start, could you tell me a little about your qualifications? Do you have a degree or any formal qualifications relevant to graphic design?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from Musashino Art University in Tokyo, and I've been working as a graphic designer for about 5 years now. I'm also proficient in English - I've taken the IELTS test and scored a 7 overall.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear, Kenji. And to confirm, you’ve scored a 7 overall on the IELTS test, which meets the English language requirement for the Skilled Worker visa.

Now, let’s talk about salary. Could you please confirm the exact annual salary you’re being offered for this graphic designer role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company is offering me exactly £30,000 per year for the graphic designer position. They told me this is above the industry average for this role, but I wanted to check if it's enough for the visa requirements.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me just double-check a key aspect for the Skilled Worker visa. The standard threshold salary for that visa is £41,700. Do you know what the lower threshold salary is?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not fully aware of all the details about these thresholds. I only know the company is offering me £30,000 and said it was above the average for graphic designers in the UK. Could you explain what these thresholds mean and whether my salary offer would be sufficient?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker visa has two salary thresholds. The lower threshold is £33,400. This is the minimum salary you need to earn to be eligible for the visa, regardless of your qualifications or experience. 

Let me check if your salary meets this requirement. Could you confirm that the £30,000 you’re being offered is an annual salary, before tax and deductions?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The £30,000 is my annual salary before tax and deductions. So if the minimum threshold is £33,400, does that mean I wouldn't be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa with my current offer?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Kenji. Based on the Skilled Worker visa criteria, with an annual salary of £30,000 before tax and deductions, you wouldn’t meet the minimum salary threshold of £33,400.

Therefore, I have to inform you that your current salary offer is not sufficient to be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa.

**REFUSED.**

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I would be refused a Skilled Worker visa because my £30,000 salary falls below the absolute minimum threshold of £33,400, which matches the expected outcome.
