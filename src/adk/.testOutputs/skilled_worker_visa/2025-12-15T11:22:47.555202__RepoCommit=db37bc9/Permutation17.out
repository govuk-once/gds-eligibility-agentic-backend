[evaluation_judge]: I'll help test the agent by assuming the role of Yuki, a Skilled Worker visa holder seeking information about taking on a second job.

Hi, i'm Yuki and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Yuki, it’s nice to meet you. I’m here to help you understand your options. To start, could you tell me a bit about the job you’re currently working as a Graphic Designer? Specifically, what is the occupation code for your role?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi, thanks for your help. I'm currently working full-time as a Graphic Designer on a Skilled Worker visa. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure about the occupation code - I just know it's listed as "Graphic Designer" on my visa paperwork. I've been working for about a year now at a design agency in London.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Yuki. Let’s try to find the specific occupation code. Could you tell me what type of design work you primarily do? For example, are you focused on branding, website design, print design, or something else?

[evaluation_judge]: I mainly work on branding and print design for commercial clients. I create logos, marketing materials, and packaging designs. Sometimes I also work on digital assets like social media graphics, but my role is primarily focused on visual identity work for various brands.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Yuki. That’s very helpful. Based on that description, it sounds like the occupation code might be “Design Architects, Drafters and Graphic Designers”. However, to be completely sure, could you tell me if your role involves any architectural design elements, like creating building plans or layouts?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't do any architectural work at all. My role is purely graphic design - working with visual elements like typography, colors, and images for branding and marketing materials. I don't create any building plans, architectural drafts, or anything related to physical structures or spaces.

[root_agent]: Okay, Yuki. It seems the occupation code is indeed “Design Architects, Drafters and Graphic Designers”. Now, let’s move on to discuss a potential second job. You mentioned you’d like to take on a weekend job – could you tell me what kind of work you’re considering doing with this second job?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm interested in taking on a weekend job as a bartender at a local pub. It would be about 10 hours per week, just on Saturday nights. I thought it would be a nice change of pace from my design work and help me earn some extra income. I want to make sure this is allowed with my visa status before I accept any offers.

[root_agent]: Alright, Yuki. Let's look into that. So, you’re considering working as a bartender – that’s 10 hours a week on Saturday nights. Let’s first confirm: is the bartender role in the same occupation as your current Graphic Designer role?

[evaluation_judge]: No, bartending is completely different from my graphic design work. They're definitely not in the same occupation category.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, you’re not aware of any shortage occupations that would cover bartending, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not really sure about what counts as a shortage occupation. I haven't looked into that. I just know bartending is very different from graphic design.

[root_agent]: Okay, Yuki. Let’s investigate that then. The Immigration Salary List details shortage occupations. Now, regarding your situation – is the proposed bartending job paid?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it would be a paid position. The pub manager offered me an hourly wage and mentioned I'd also receive tips from customers.

[root_agent]: Okay, good to know it’s a paid position. Let's consider the hours you’d be working. You said 10 hours a week on Saturday nights. Would you be working any other hours outside of those Saturdays?

[evaluation_judge]: No, just the 10 hours on Saturday nights. My main job as a graphic designer keeps me quite busy during the weekdays, so I'm only looking for something on the weekends.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Yuki. So, to summarise: you’re a Graphic Designer on a Skilled Worker visa, you’re considering a weekend job as a bartender for 10 hours a week, and that’s your only planned outside work. Based on this information, it appears this could be problematic under your visa conditions. Do you understand why?
