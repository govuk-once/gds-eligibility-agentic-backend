[evaluation_judge]: I'll help evaluate the efficacy of the agent by role-playing as Lina seeking information about visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Lina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Lina, it’s great to meet you. I’d be happy to help you explore your options. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’re considering? Specifically, what is the job title and what does it involve?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a construction labourer in the UK. The company is offering me £45,000 per year, which seems like a good salary. I'm currently living outside the UK and would need a visa to take up this position. I'm wondering if I would qualify for a Skilled Worker visa with this job offer.

[root_agent]: That’s helpful information, Lina. Thank you.

To help me assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you tell me what level the job you’ve been offered falls under in terms of the UK’s ‘Recognised Qualifications Framework’ (RQF)? Basically, what level of education or training is required for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure about the RQF level, to be honest. I know it's a construction labourer position with occupation code 9120, if that helps. The company has a sponsor license and is ready to sponsor me, but I'm not sure about the skill classification of the job itself.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lina. Thank you for clarifying. Knowing the occupation code (9120) is useful.

Based on that, it sounds like this role falls under ‘Elementary construction occupations’.

Now, I want to be absolutely sure.  Could you confirm whether you believe this construction labourer role requires a skill level of RQF Level 3 or above?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't think it requires RQF Level 3 or above. From what I understand, construction labourer roles are typically more entry-level positions that don't require advanced qualifications. I believe it would be RQF Level 1 or 2, but the company is still willing to pay me £45,000 for my experience.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Lina.

I appreciate you clarifying the RQF level. Based on our conversation, it appears this role, as a construction labourer, is classified as RQF Level 1 or 2, which is lower than the minimum requirement for a Skilled Worker Visa. 

Therefore, I must advise that you would not currently be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa for this position. Would you like me to explain why this is the case, or would you like to explore other potential visa options?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why I wouldn't be eligible despite the good salary offer. I thought if the pay was high enough, I could get the visa regardless of the job type.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Lina. You’ve raised a really important point about salary. While a high salary is a factor considered for a Skilled Worker Visa, it’s not the *only* factor.

The Skilled Worker Visa is designed for jobs that require a certain skill level – RQF Level 3 or above - to contribute to the UK economy.  Even a substantial salary won’t qualify you for a Skilled Worker Visa if the job itself doesn’t meet that minimum skill requirement. The RQF level determines how complex and demanding the job duties are.  Construction labourer roles, as we’ve discussed, generally fall into lower skill levels. 

Essentially, the visa is about the *skill* involved in the job, not just the pay. 

Does that explanation make sense, Lina?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So no matter how much they're willing to pay me, if the job itself doesn't require at least RQF Level 3 skills, I can't get a Skilled Worker visa. That's disappointing, but I understand now. Are there any other visa options I might be able to consider for this type of work?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Lina. It's frustrating when expectations aren’t met.

Yes, there are other visa options you might want to explore, though they’d depend on your specific circumstances and qualifications. One possibility could be the **Temporary Worker Visa**, which is available for jobs that don’t typically require RQF Level 3 skills, *but* which are needed to fill a specific, short-term skill shortage. However, this visa has a limited duration.

Another option could be the **Youth Mobility Scheme Visa** if you are under 30 and a citizen of a participating country. 

To help me narrow down the best options for you, could you tell me your age and which country you’re a citizen of? Also, do you have any specific qualifications or experience that might make you eligible for a different visa route?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 36 years old and I'm from the Philippines. I have about 10 years of experience in the construction industry, though I don't have formal qualifications beyond high school. I also have some hospitality experience from earlier in my career.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lina, thank you for that information. Being 36 and from the Philippines, and having 10 years of construction experience is valuable.

Let’s look at those options again. Given your experience, the **Temporary Worker Visa** might be worth investigating further. It's designed for roles that have a skills shortage, and your construction background could be a good fit, especially if the employer can demonstrate a genuine need for your skills. 

However, your age (36) would likely rule you out of the Youth Mobility Scheme.

Regarding your hospitality experience, that could potentially open doors to other visas if we find a role that combines your skills. 

Would you like me to provide you with some more information on the Temporary Worker Visa, and perhaps we can discuss what kind of evidence your sponsoring employer would need to provide to support your application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please tell me more about the Temporary Worker Visa. How long could I stay in the UK with that visa? And would there be any pathway to settlement eventually? I'm hoping for something long-term if possible.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lina, let’s talk about the Temporary Worker Visa.

The Temporary Worker Visa allows you to live and work in the UK for a maximum of **3 years** on the first application. It’s possible to extend it for a further 2 years, so you could potentially remain in the UK for up to 5 years in total.

Now, regarding a pathway to settlement (Indefinite Leave to Remain – ILR), this is a bit complex. Generally, to qualify for ILR through the Temporary Worker Visa, you’d need to meet specific requirements, including:

*   **Continuous Residence:** You’d typically need to have lived in the UK legally for a certain period (usually 5 years).
*   **Genuine Improvement:** Demonstrating that your living standards in the UK are better than they would be in the Philippines. This is assessed through factors like income, housing, and access to services.
*   **Maintenance of Employment:**  Maintaining continuous employment within the skilled occupation you were initially sponsored for.

It’s important to note there's no guaranteed pathway to ILR. The Home Office assesses each application individually.

Given your desire for a long-term solution, it’s crucial to build a strong case for meeting these criteria.

Would you like me to delve deeper into any specific aspect of the Temporary Worker Visa, such as the evidence needed to support your application, or any potential challenges you might face?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa because the construction labourer job (code 9120) is below RQF Level 3, despite the high salary offer of £45,000. The agent accurately explained that the skill level requirement cannot be overcome by a high salary.
