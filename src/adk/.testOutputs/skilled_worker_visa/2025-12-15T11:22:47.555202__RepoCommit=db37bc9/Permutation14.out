[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello John. It’s good to speak with you. To start, are you under 26 years old, or have you been a student recently?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm 32 and I haven't been a student recently. I'm actually looking to switch from a dependent visa. I have a job offer as a Trainee Chartered Accountant with a salary of £34,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, John. That’s very helpful. Let’s move on to the next question. Are you currently working towards a recognized professional qualification, such as a Chartered Accountancy qualification?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I'm working towards my ACCA qualification as part of this trainee chartered accountant position.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news, John! It sounds like you’re on a great path. Could you tell me a little more about the specific qualification you’re pursuing – is it, for example, ACCA, ICAEW, or another recognized professional body?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm pursuing the ACCA qualification. It's part of my training contract with the company offering me the position.

[root_agent]: Okay, fantastic. Just to confirm, you’re over 26 and not a recent student, and you’re actively working towards your ACCA qualification as part of your training contract. Does that accurately reflect your situation, John?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I'm 32, not a recent student, and I'm working towards my ACCA qualification as part of my training contract for this Trainee Chartered Accountant position.

[root_agent]: Perfect. Thank you for confirming all that information, John. Now, regarding your salary – what is the exact salary you’ve been offered for this Trainee Chartered Accountant position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £34,000 for this position.

[root_agent]: Alright. And could you tell me what the standard going rate for a Trainee Chartered Accountant with similar experience and qualifications is in your area?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate is around £46,000 for this position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, John. Let me just quickly calculate that... Given your salary of £34,000 and the standard going rate of £46,000, does your salary fall below 70% of the standard going rate?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure of the exact calculation. £34,000 is my offered salary, and £46,000 is what I understand to be the standard going rate.

[root_agent]: Okay, no problem at all. Let’s do the calculation together. 70% of £46,000 is £32,200. Since your offered salary of £34,000 is higher than £32,200, it does meet the 70% threshold. Based on the criteria, you qualify for the salary discount.

**AWARDED.**

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I qualify for the benefit despite being over 26 because I'm working toward a recognized professional qualification (ACCA) and my salary (£34,000) exceeds the 70% threshold of the standard going rate (£32,200).
