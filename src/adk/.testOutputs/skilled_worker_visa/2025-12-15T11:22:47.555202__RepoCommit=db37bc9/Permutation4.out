[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, it’s nice to meet you. To help me assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa, could you please tell me what subject area your PhD is in?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I have a PhD in Modern History from an American university. I've been offered a job as a Historical Consultant with a media production company here in the UK. I'm just trying to figure out if I'd qualify for the Skilled Worker visa with this job offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And could you tell me what your current salary is for this Historical Consultant role?

[evaluation_judge]: The job offer I've received is for £35,000 per year. I'm not sure if that's enough for the visa - that's why I'm checking.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. To confirm, is there a standard going rate for this role that you’re aware of, roughly speaking?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for this role is about £36,000 per year. At least that's what I understand from my research and what the company mentioned during the interview process.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for clarifying that. Just to be clear, you’re saying the standard going rate for a Historical Consultant role is £36,000 per year, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The standard going rate for this Historical Consultant role is £36,000 per year, and I've been offered £35,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Let me just quickly check a detail regarding the salary requirement for this visa route. Could you please confirm if you have a sponsor for this visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the media production company is a registered sponsor. They've assured me they'll sponsor my visa application.

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear. Now, to fully assess your eligibility, could you tell me, does your PhD fall within a STEM subject area?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my PhD is in Modern History, which is not considered a STEM subject. It's in the humanities field.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Let’s move on to the salary requirement for this specific benefit. Based on the information you’ve provided – a salary of £35,000 and a standard going rate of £36,000 – does your salary meet the minimum threshold of £37,500 for the Non-STEM PhD route?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my salary offer of £35,000 is below the £37,500 threshold you mentioned. I wasn't aware of that specific requirement for Non-STEM PhDs. Does this mean I'm not eligible?

[root_agent]: You are correct to be concerned. Based on the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa – specifically the Non-STEM PhD option – your salary of £35,000 does not meet the required £37,500 threshold. Therefore, unfortunately, I must conclude that you are not currently eligible for this benefit.

Do you have any questions about this decision, or would you like me to explain the criteria in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you explain why there's a specific threshold of £37,500 for Non-STEM PhDs? And is there anything I could do to become eligible? Would I need to negotiate a higher salary with the company?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The £37,500 threshold for Non-STEM PhDs is designed to ensure that the visa route attracts skilled professionals who contribute significantly to the UK economy. It’s meant to reflect the earning potential of individuals with a PhD in non-STEM fields.

Regarding becoming eligible, you’re right to consider a salary negotiation. To meet the requirement, you would need to secure a salary of at least £37,500.  It’s definitely possible to discuss this with your employer – perhaps they could offer a review after a certain period, or explore other benefits as part of the offer.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this, such as how salary is calculated for the "going rate" or potential negotiation strategies?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense. So I would need to negotiate my salary up by £2,500 to reach the £37,500 threshold. I'll definitely speak with the company about this. One last question - if I can't get them to increase the salary, are there any alternative visa options I might be eligible for with my current offer?

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible approach – negotiating your salary is a worthwhile step.

Regarding alternative visa options, with a salary of £35,000 and a Non-STEM PhD, your options are somewhat limited under the Skilled Worker Visa route. However, we could explore other possibilities, though they might have different requirements.

Let’s consider the Health and Care Worker visa, which sometimes has lower salary thresholds, but requires specific qualifications. Or, the Global Business Visitor visa might be relevant if you're involved in establishing a business in the UK. 

Would you like me to provide you with links to relevant pages for those visas, or would you prefer me to delve into the specific requirements for each one to see if they align with your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: I think it would be helpful to know the specific requirements for these alternative visas you mentioned. My job is purely as a Historical Consultant for a media company, not in healthcare, so I'm not sure the Health and Care Worker visa would be applicable. And I'm not establishing a business, just accepting employment. Are there any other options that might be more suitable for my situation?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct – the Health and Care Worker visa isn’t suitable for your role. And you’re right to be cautious about the Global Business Visitor visa, as it’s designed for entrepreneurs, not employment.

Let’s focus on other potential routes. Given your qualifications and employment situation, the most likely alternative would be the “Route to UK Study” visa, which can be used if you’ve studied in the UK and are now seeking skilled employment. However, this requires a prior period of study in the UK.

Alternatively, we could look into a ‘High Potential Individual’ (HPI) visa, which is aimed at graduates from outside the EEA with excellent prospects in leadership or creative roles. This visa doesn’t require sponsorship but has stringent requirements regarding your qualifications and future career plans.

Would you like me to provide you with links to the official webpages for these visas, so you can explore the specific eligibility criteria in more detail? Or would you prefer me to summarize the key requirements for each one?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate a summary of the key requirements for the High Potential Individual visa. I didn't complete my studies in the UK, so the Route to UK Study visa wouldn't apply to me. But I'm interested in learning more about the HPI visa requirements to see if that might be a viable alternative.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s look at the High Potential Individual (HPI) visa. Here’s a summary of the key requirements:

*   **Age:** You must be under 30 years old.
*   **Qualifications:** You need a Master’s degree or higher from a recognised foreign university.
*   **Job Offer:** You must have a job offer from a ‘leading edge’ company – this means a company that’s actively innovating or disrupting its industry. The company needs to demonstrate its innovative activity.
*   **English Language:** You must prove a high level of English language proficiency (usually through an approved test like IELTS).
*   **Endorsement:** You’ll need an endorsement from an endorsing body – currently, this is delivered by Innovate UK. They will assess your ‘leading edge’ job offer and your potential for future success.
*   **Financial Resources:** You’ll need to show you can support yourself financially.

The HPI visa is competitive, and Innovate UK’s endorsement is crucial. It’s worth noting that, at this time, the UKVI (UK Visas and Immigration) is reviewing the criteria for the HPI visa, so details could change.

You can find the most up-to-date information and the application process here: [https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa](https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa)

Would you like me to highlight any particular aspect of these requirements, or perhaps discuss the Innovate UK endorsement process further?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, thank you for the detailed information. It sounds like the HPI visa might be difficult for me as well, especially with the "leading edge" company requirement and age limit. I think my best course of action is probably to try negotiating a higher salary with the media company to reach the £37,500 threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa.

To summarize what I've learned: with my non-STEM PhD and current offer of £35,000, I don't qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa because I need a minimum salary of £37,500, even though my offer exceeds 90% of the standard going rate. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s absolutely correct. Thank you for summarizing your findings – it’s excellent that you’ve taken all this information on board.

To reiterate: with your non-STEM PhD and current salary offer of £35,000, you do not currently meet the minimum salary threshold of £37,500 for the Skilled Worker Visa, even though your salary meets the 90% of the standard going rate.

I’m glad we’ve been able to clarify your options and I wish you the best of luck with your salary negotiations. Do you have any other questions for me today, or would you like to explore any aspect of this further?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information. The agent stated requirements for a "High Potential Individual visa" that do not match actual UK visa requirements (particularly the age requirement of "under 30" and the need for endorsement from "Innovate UK"). The agent made up visa details that do not exist in the UK immigration system.
