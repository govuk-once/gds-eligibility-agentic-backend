[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of a user named Priya who is seeking information about their eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa extension under transitional arrangements.

Hi, i'm Priya and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Priya, thank you for reaching out. To start, could you tell me when you initially obtained your Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022. I work as a Marketing Manager and I've been living in the UK since then.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And to confirm, you’ve been holding your Skilled Worker visa continuously since 2022?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I've been holding my Skilled Worker visa continuously since 2022. I haven't left the route at any point.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me what your new role involves and what salary you've been offered for this new position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a new position as a Marketing Manager at a different agency. The salary they're offering is £32,000 per year. I want to know if I can accept this job offer while remaining on the Skilled Worker visa route.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just to clarify, the standard going rate for a Marketing Manager in the UK is currently £42,000, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I understand the standard going rate for Marketing Managers is now about £42,000, but I've been told there might be different rules for people like me who were already on a Skilled Worker visa before April 2024.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful. And to confirm, you’re looking to extend your current visa or change employers, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm looking to change employers. I want to move to this new marketing agency that's offering me the Marketing Manager role at £32,000.

[root_agent]: Alright. Let’s talk about the transitional arrangements. Could you tell me what your current salary is, as stated by your current employer?

[evaluation_judge]: My current salary is £30,500 at my existing employer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let’s look at the salary thresholds. The General Salary Threshold is capped at £29,000, and the Transitional Going Rate is £30,000.  Since your new salary of £32,000 is above both of those thresholds, and you’ve held your visa continuously since before April 2024, it appears you would qualify for transitional arrangements.

Would you like me to elaborate on what that means in terms of your visa and salary?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would like you to elaborate on what that means for my visa and salary situation. So I can definitely accept this job offer at £32,000 and still maintain my Skilled Worker status?

[root_agent]: Absolutely. Because you’ve held your Skilled Worker visa continuously since before April 2024, you are eligible for transitional arrangements. This means your employer can pay you a lower ‘going rate’ – currently £30,000 – instead of the standard £41,700 or the current standard going rate of £42,000.  Your new salary of £32,000 is still above the transitional threshold of £29,000.

Therefore, yes, you *can* accept this job offer at £32,000 and maintain your Skilled Worker status under these transitional rules. 

Is there anything else you’d like me to explain about this, or would you like me to confirm any specific aspect of your eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! So just to be clear, even though the new standard going rate is £42,000, I can accept this £32,000 offer because I've been on the Skilled Worker route since before April 2024? And this protection will continue for future extensions as long as I stay on this visa route?

[root_agent]: That’s correct. You’ve understood perfectly. Because you’ve been on the Skilled Worker route continuously since before April 2024, you benefit from these transitional arrangements. This means you can accept a salary of £32,000 for the new role, and it will apply to future extensions of your visa as long as you continue to hold the Skilled Worker visa.

Congratulations, Priya! It sounds like you’ve found a good opportunity. Would you like me to summarise the key points for you, or is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would qualify for a Skilled Worker visa under the transitional arrangements. They accurately explained that since I've held my visa continuously since before April 2024, I'm eligible under the lower threshold of £29,000 and the transitional going rate of £30,000, rather than being subject to the new standard requirements. My £32,000 salary exceeds both transitional thresholds, making me eligible as expected.
