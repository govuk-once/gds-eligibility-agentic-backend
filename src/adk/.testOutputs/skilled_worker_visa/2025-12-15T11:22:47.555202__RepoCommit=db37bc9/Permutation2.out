[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Liam, it’s great to speak with you. To start, could you confirm if there is a valid sponsor for this job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a valid sponsor for the job offer. I'm a Canadian citizen who just graduated with a Bachelor's degree here in the UK, and I've got a job offer as a Junior Financial Analyst.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now, let's talk about the job itself. Could you tell me what skill level this Junior Financial Analyst role falls under, according to the sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe it falls under the required skill level for the Skilled Worker visa. It's a professional financial role that requires my degree. My potential employer has confirmed it meets the requirements for sponsorship.

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear. To help me assess your eligibility, could you confirm if you meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker visa? Specifically, do you have evidence that your degree was taught in English?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. My entire Bachelor's degree was taught in English here in the UK, so that satisfies the English language requirement for the Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, excellent. Now, let’s move on to your salary. Can you please tell me what the annual salary you’re being offered for this Junior Financial Analyst position is?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £35,000 per year for this Junior Financial Analyst position.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, let’s determine the standard going rate for this role. Could you tell me what the standard going rate is for a Junior Financial Analyst in the UK, according to your sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: My sponsor told me that the standard going rate for this role is £42,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Alright. To help me determine your eligibility, could you confirm your age, Liam?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 23 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Finally, could you confirm whether you qualify as a New Entrant under the Skilled Worker visa criteria? That means you’re under 26, a recent student or graduate, or in professional training.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe I qualify as a New Entrant since I'm 23 years old and I just finished my Bachelor's degree in the UK on a Student Visa, so I'm a recent graduate.

[root_agent]: Okay, Liam. Let’s put all the information together. Just to confirm, you’re 23, a recent graduate, and you’ve been offered £35,000 per year for a Junior Financial Analyst role with a standard going rate of £42,000. Is that all correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's all correct. I'm 23, just finished my Bachelor's degree here in the UK, and I've been offered £35,000 for this Junior Financial Analyst position with a standard going rate of £42,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Let’s check the criteria. Does the salary meet the lower general threshold of £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £35,000 is higher than £33,400.

[root_agent]: And does the salary meet the discounted going rate threshold of 70% of the standard going rate?

So, 70% of £42,000 is £29,400. Is your salary of £35,000 greater than £29,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my salary of £35,000 is greater than £29,400, which is 70% of the standard going rate.

[root_agent]: Fantastic. Based on all of this information – your age, recent graduation, salary, and the standard going rate – it appears you do qualify for the New Entrant route under the Skilled Worker visa. 

**AWARDED.**

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this assessment, or would you like me to move on to a different topic?

[evaluation_judge]: This information is really helpful, thank you! It's a relief to know that I qualify under the New Entrant route. I do have one quick question - is there anything I should be aware of regarding how long I can stay under this New Entrant status?

[root_agent]: That's a very good question, Liam. Under the New Entrant route, you have a maximum stay of 4 years. Time spent on this visa counts towards that 4-year limit. Does that clarification help?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's really helpful to know about the 4-year maximum. This gives me a good timeline to plan for my future career progression. Thank you for all the information and confirming my eligibility!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Liam! I’m glad I could assist you. If you have any further questions in the future, don’t hesitate to ask. Have a great day!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you! You've been very helpful. Have a great day too!
