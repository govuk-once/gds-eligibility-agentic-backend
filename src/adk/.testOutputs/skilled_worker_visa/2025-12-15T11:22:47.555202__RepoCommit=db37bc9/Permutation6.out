[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Wei, a physicist from China looking into eligibility for a UK work visa based on a postdoctoral researcher offer.

Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Wei, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me a bit about the specific job you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a physicist from China and I've been offered a Postdoctoral Researcher position at a UK university. It's in my field of physics, and the university is offering me £33,500 per year for this role. I'm excited about the opportunity but I'm not sure if this qualifies me for a skilled worker visa in the UK.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Just to clarify, what occupation code does this postdoctoral researcher position fall under?

[evaluation_judge]: The occupation code for my position is 2114 - I believe that's for Physical Scientists, which covers my role as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Physics at the university.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And could you tell me what the standard going rate is for a Physical Scientist role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I was told by the university that the standard going rate for my role as a Physical Scientist is £46,000 per year. My offer is £33,500 per year, which seems to be lower than that standard rate.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Just to confirm, are you currently employed or expected to be employed by the UK university for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a formal job offer letter from the UK university. Once I sort out my visa situation, they're expecting me to start working as a Postdoctoral Researcher in their Physics department. So I would be directly employed by the university.

[root_agent]: Alright. And to help me assess your eligibility, do you have a sponsor lined up to support your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the university will be my sponsor. They've confirmed they have a valid sponsor license and will be sponsoring my skilled worker visa application for this postdoctoral research position.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news to hear. Now, regarding your salary, does the university's offer of £33,500 per year meet or exceed the minimum salary threshold of £33,400 for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £33,500 is slightly above the minimum threshold of £33,400, though it's still below the standard going rate for physical scientists.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Finally, could you confirm that you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. I completed my PhD in the United States, so my degree was taught entirely in English. I also have taken the IELTS test before with scores that meet the requirements.

[root_agent]: Great! Based on the information you’ve provided – a qualifying occupation code (2114), a sponsor, a salary above the minimum threshold, and meeting the English language requirements – it appears you *do* qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa.

**AWARDED.**

You qualify for the discount specifically designed for scientific research roles. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa as a postdoctoral researcher. They identified that my salary (£33,500) meets both the lower general threshold (£33,400) and exceeds 70% of the going rate (£32,200), which is the discounted rate allowed for scientific research positions.
