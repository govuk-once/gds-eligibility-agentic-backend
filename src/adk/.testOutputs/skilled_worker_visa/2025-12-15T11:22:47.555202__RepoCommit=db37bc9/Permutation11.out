[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Claire, a US executive looking for information about UK visa eligibility based on a job offer. I'll interact with the agent under test and then evaluate their response based on whether they correctly identify that I should be refused due to not meeting the going rate requirement for my occupation.

Hi, i'm Claire and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Claire, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m here to help you with that. To start, could you tell me a little about the job you’ve been offered? Specifically, what is your role and what is the salary you’re being offered?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, thanks for helping me! I've been offered a position as a Chief Executive Officer for a small tech start-up in the UK. They're offering me £55,000 per year. I'm currently based in the US, and I'm trying to figure out if this salary meets the requirements for a work visa in the UK.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Claire. Just to confirm, you’ve been offered a role as a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) with a salary of £55,000 per year, correct? And you’re currently based in the United States?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I've been offered a CEO position at a small UK start-up with a salary of £55,000 per year. I'm currently living and working in the United States, and I'm trying to understand if this salary would meet the requirements for a UK work visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Claire. Let’s delve a little deeper. Now, I need to check if this salary meets the ‘Going Rate’ for your occupation. Could you tell me what occupation you’re being offered for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered the role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO). That's the occupation - I'd be running the start-up as their CEO.

[root_agent]: Okay, a Chief Executive Officer. Thank you. Let me just quickly check the official guidelines. One moment please…

Now, regarding the salary, does £55,000 meet the General Threshold of £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my understanding is that £55,000 is above the £41,700 general threshold, which sounds positive. I'm just wondering if that's all I need to qualify for the visa, or if there are other requirements I should know about.

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear that the salary meets the General Threshold. Thank you for confirming that. 

Now, let’s look at the ‘Going Rate’ for a Chief Executive Officer (Code 1115) as per the Skilled Worker Visa requirements. The Going Rate is currently £78,000 per year. 

Does your salary of £55,000 meet the Going Rate?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I wasn't aware of that. So even though my salary of £55,000 exceeds the general threshold, it doesn't meet the going rate of £78,000 for a CEO position? That's concerning - does that mean I wouldn't qualify for the visa?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit upon a really important point, Claire. Yes, unfortunately, because your salary doesn’t meet the Going Rate for a CEO, you wouldn’t currently be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa.

The rules state that you need to meet the *higher* of the two figures - the General Threshold and the Going Rate. In your case, £78,000 is the relevant benchmark. 

Based on this, I would have to advise that you are currently not eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. 

Do you have any questions about this, or would you like me to explain anything in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. So even though £55,000 is well above the general threshold, I still wouldn't qualify because it's below the specific going rate for CEOs. 

I'm curious - is there any flexibility on this? Or would the company need to increase their offer to at least £78,000 for me to qualify for the visa?

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible question, Claire. You’re right to explore if there’s any flexibility.

Unfortunately, the Skilled Worker Visa rules are quite strict regarding the Going Rate. Generally, employers aren’t able to offer less than the Going Rate for a specific occupation. However, it’s always worth discussing with the start-up. They might be able to demonstrate exceptional circumstances or explore alternative visa options, though this would be a complex process. 

I want to be clear – based on the current Skilled Worker Visa criteria, your current salary of £55,000 does not meet the requirements.

Would you like me to outline some alternative visa routes we could explore, or would you prefer to focus on discussing with the start-up about potentially increasing the salary?

[evaluation_judge]: I appreciate your clear explanation. I think I'll need to have a conversation with the start-up about potentially increasing the salary offer to meet the Going Rate requirement. 

Just to confirm my understanding - unless my salary offer increases to at least £78,000, I wouldn't qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa as a CEO, is that correct?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Claire. Unless the start-up can increase your salary to at least £78,000, you wouldn’t currently qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa as a CEO. 

It’s good you’re going to discuss this with them – that’s the best course of action.

Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding this situation, or would you like me to clarify any other aspects of the Skilled Worker Visa requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you for being so clear about the requirements. I'll speak with the start-up about the salary situation and see if we can work something out to meet that £78,000 going rate requirement. I appreciate your help today!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Claire! I’m glad I could help clarify the situation. I wish you the very best of luck in your discussions with the start-up. If anything else comes up, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would be refused for the Skilled Worker Visa because my salary of £55,000, while above the general threshold of £41,700, does not meet the going rate of £78,000 for a CEO position. The agent accurately explained that I need to meet the higher of the two figures to qualify.
