[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Dr. Aari to test the agent's knowledge about skilled worker visa eligibility based on having a STEM PhD.

Hi, i'm Aari and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Aari, it’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little about the job you’re considering? Specifically, what is the job title and what field does it fall under?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm considering a job offer as a Senior Lab Technician at a pharmaceutical company here in the UK. I have a PhD in Microbiology from India and I'm trying to understand if I would be eligible for a skilled worker visa with this job offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And could you please tell me what your annual salary for this Senior Lab Technician role is?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered an annual salary of £34,000 for this Senior Lab Technician role.

[root_agent]: Alright. And could you tell me what the standard going rate for a Senior Lab Technician role is in the UK, as far as you’ve been able to find out?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I've been told, the standard going rate for this Senior Lab Technician role in the UK is around £38,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Let’s move on to a slightly different question. Do you currently have a sponsor lined up who is willing to support your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the pharmaceutical company has confirmed they are an approved sponsor and they're willing to sponsor my visa application.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news! Now, could you confirm that your PhD is in a STEM subject – Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my PhD is in Microbiology, which is definitely a STEM subject. I completed it in India about 3 years ago.

[root_agent]: Okay, fantastic. And just to be absolutely clear, you’re fluent in English?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am fluent in English. I've been using English throughout my academic career and completed my PhD thesis in English as well.

[root_agent]: Perfect. Thank you for confirming that. Now, let’s look at the salary. Considering the standard going rate of £38,000 and your offered salary of £34,000, would you agree that your salary is at least 80% of the standard going rate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand that 80% of £38,000 would be £30,400, and since my offered salary is £34,000, it's definitely above 80% of the standard going rate.

[root_agent]: Great! Thank you for confirming that. Let me just quickly summarise: You have a relevant STEM PhD (Microbiology), a sponsoring employer, English language proficiency, and a salary of £34,000 which is above 80% of the standard going rate. 

Based on this information, it appears you *do* meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the visa process, or perhaps discuss the next steps involved?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! Yes, could you explain why my STEM PhD is relevant to meeting the criteria? I know there are different salary thresholds for skilled worker visas, so I'm curious how my PhD factors into the eligibility calculation.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker Visa prioritizes those with recognised qualifications in STEM fields. Having a PhD in Microbiology directly demonstrates your expertise and advanced knowledge within a STEM discipline. This is crucial because the visa specifically targets skilled workers who contribute to sectors that benefit the UK economy – and research within the pharmaceutical industry, particularly microbiology, is a key area.

The salary requirements – £33,400 and at least 80% of the standard going rate – are designed to ensure the role is appropriately compensated and reflects the skill level involved. Your PhD significantly strengthens your application, allowing you to potentially take a slightly lower salary while still meeting the requirements. 

Does that explanation make sense, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So because I have a PhD in a STEM field that's relevant to the role, I can qualify with a lower salary threshold than someone without such qualifications - as long as I meet both the minimum of £33,400 and at least 80% of the going rate. My salary of £34,000 meets both requirements. 

Thank you for explaining. Do I need to provide any specific documentation to prove my PhD's relevance to the role?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit on a very important point! Absolutely. It’s correct that having a STEM PhD strengthens your application and allows you to potentially meet the salary requirements with a slightly lower figure.

Regarding documentation to prove relevance, it’s highly recommended to provide a detailed job description outlining the responsibilities of the Senior Lab Technician role. Alongside this, a statement from the pharmaceutical company outlining how your PhD in Microbiology directly relates to the specific tasks and duties you'll be performing would be beneficial. This helps demonstrate the connection between your qualifications and the job requirements.

Furthermore, a copy of your PhD certificate and transcript could be useful to showcase your academic achievements.

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the GOV.UK page detailing the documentation requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa application, just for your reference?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful to have a link to the documentation requirements. I'll make sure to have my PhD certificate, transcripts, and ask my employer for a detailed job description highlighting how my microbiology expertise relates to the lab technician role. I want to ensure I have everything prepared properly for my application. Thank you for the guidance!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! It’s great that you’re being so thorough – that’s a fantastic approach to ensure a smooth application process. 

Here’s the link to the GOV.UK page outlining the documentation requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/supporting-documents](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/supporting-documents)

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions as you progress with your application. I’m here to help in any way I can. Good luck!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for your help! This information has been really valuable. I'll check out the link and make sure I have all my documents in order before proceeding with my application. Have a great day!

✓ The agent correctly identified that I would be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa based on my STEM PhD, salary above £33,400, and meeting the 80% of going rate requirement. They provided accurate information about the qualifying criteria and necessary documentation.
