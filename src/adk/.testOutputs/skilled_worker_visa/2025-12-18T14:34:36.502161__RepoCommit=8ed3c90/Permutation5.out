[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lars and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lars, welcome! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you please confirm if you have a valid sponsor for your visa application? This means a UK employer who is licensed by the Home Office to sponsor workers.


[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a valid sponsor for my visa application. I've been offered a job as a specialist stonemason by a UK employer who has confirmed they are licensed to sponsor workers.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Lars!

Now, is the job you've been offered at the required skill level – specifically, at least skill level 3 according to the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my job as a specialist stonemason is at the required skill level. I understand it meets at least skill level 3 according to the Standard Occupational Classification.

[root_agent]: Excellent.

Next, can you confirm that you meet the English language requirements for the visa? This typically involves passing an approved English language test.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. I've taken and passed the approved English language test for the visa.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! That’s another important requirement met.

Now, Lars, is the job you've been offered listed on the Immigration Salary List? This list includes jobs where the standard salary thresholds are relaxed.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my job as a specialist stonemason is on the Immigration Salary List.

[root_agent]: That’s good news! 

Could you please tell me what your gross salary is for the job offer – that is, before any deductions?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary I've been offered is £34,000 per year before any deductions.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lars.

Finally, do you know what the standard going rate is for a Specialist Stonemason in the UK? It needs to be at least £33,500 for your salary to meet the requirements.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been told that the standard going rate for a Specialist Stonemason in the UK is £33,500 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay Lars, thank you for providing all of that information.

Based on what you’ve told me – having a valid sponsor, the job being at the required skill level, meeting the English language requirements, the job being on the Immigration Salary List, a salary of £34,000, and a standard going rate of £33,500 – you are **AWARDED** eligibility for this visa route.

The Immigration Salary List allows you to bypass the usual £41,700 threshold, as long as you are paid at least £33,400 *and* at least the standard going rate for the role, which you are.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome. The agent correctly determined that I am awarded eligibility for the visa since I meet all requirements: valid sponsor, required skill level, English requirements, job on Immigration Salary List, salary above £33,400, and salary above the going rate of £33,500.
