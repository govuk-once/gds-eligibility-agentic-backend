[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Miguel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Miguel, it's good to speak with you! To help me understand which benefit might be right for you, could you please tell me what kind of job you have been offered in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a registered nurse from the Philippines. I've been offered a job as a Band 5 Nurse at an NHS Trust here in the UK. They've offered me a salary of £28,407, which they told me is the standard entry salary for Band 5 positions. I'm wondering if I'm eligible for a work visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Miguel. That's very helpful. 

To confirm, is the job you've been offered with the NHS Trust a directly employed position, rather than through an agency?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a directly employed position with the NHS Trust, not through an agency.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. 

Just to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that your job title is specifically a Registered Nurse?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My job title is specifically "Registered Nurse" at the NHS Trust.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Miguel. 

Knowing this, it sounds like you might be eligible for a Health and Care Visa. To confirm, are you aware of the National Pay Scales used within the NHS?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been told a bit about the NHS pay bands. I understand that my offer of £28,407 is on the Band 5 scale for nurses. I was a bit concerned because I heard something about a higher salary threshold for UK visas, but wasn't sure if that applies to nurses.

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Miguel, and you’re right to ask! The higher general salary threshold *doesn’t* fully apply to jobs on the NHS pay scales. 

Just to be sure, can you confirm that the £28,407 offered is the starting salary for a Band 5 Nurse according to the current NHS pay scales?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. The £28,407 is the starting salary for a Band 5 Nurse according to the current NHS pay scales. It's what they offered me as a new registered nurse joining the NHS.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for confirming, Miguel.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that you are a Registered Nurse, directly employed by an NHS Trust, and offered a salary of £28,407 which matches the standard Band 5 entry – it appears you **are** eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa through the Health and Care Visa route.

Essentially, because your salary meets the National Pay Scale for your role, you are exempt from the higher general salary threshold.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So just to make sure I understand correctly - I'm eligible for the Health and Care Visa even though my salary is £28,407, which is below the general threshold of £41,700? This is because I'm a registered nurse on the NHS pay scale?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Miguel! Yes, that is absolutely correct. 

You are eligible for the Health and Care Visa *specifically because* you are a Registered Nurse on the NHS pay scale. Your salary of £28,407 is below the general threshold of £41,700, but the Health and Care Visa allows for exemptions when the job falls within specific NHS pay bands. The focus is on meeting the pay scale for your role, rather than the general salary threshold.

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! Thank you so much for explaining this clearly. I was really worried about the visa situation with the salary I was offered. It's a relief to know that as an NHS nurse, I can get the Health and Care Visa. I appreciate your help.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Miguel! I'm genuinely glad I could put your mind at ease. It's understandable to be concerned about visa requirements, and it's good you asked.

The Health and Care Visa is designed to make it easier for qualified professionals like yourself to come and work within the NHS. 

If you have any further questions down the line, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best with your move to the UK and your new role as a Registered Nurse!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly advised that I am eligible for the Health and Care Visa despite my salary being below the general threshold of £41,700. They accurately explained that as a Registered Nurse on the NHS pay scale (Band 5 at £28,407), I qualify for an exemption from the general salary threshold. This matches the expected outcome of "AWARDED" as stated in the scenario.
