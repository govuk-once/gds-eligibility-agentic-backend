[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Liam who is seeking information about eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa under the New Entrant criteria.

Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Liam, it's great to hear from you! I'm root_agent, and I can definitely help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you please confirm your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 23 years old. I recently graduated from university in the UK.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you! And could you please tell me what type of visa you currently hold, or most recently held?

[evaluation_judge]: I currently have a Student Visa. I just finished my Bachelor's degree here in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Now, do you have a job offer with a company that is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a job offer from a company that is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office. They've offered me a position as a Junior Financial Analyst.

[root_agent]: That's excellent to hear! And what salary have they offered you for the Junior Financial Analyst position? Please state the annual salary amount.

[evaluation_judge]: They've offered me £35,000 per year for the Junior Financial Analyst position.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Do you know what the standard going rate is for a Junior Financial Analyst in your specific role and location? If you don't know the exact figure, an approximate amount is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for this role is around £42,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that's helpful. Finally, just to confirm, was your Bachelor's degree taught in English?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my Bachelor's degree was taught entirely in English.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for providing all of that information, Liam. Based on what you've told me – being 23 years old, recently graduating with a Bachelor's degree on a Student Visa, having a job offer from a licensed sponsor for £35,000 as a Junior Financial Analyst with a going rate of £42,000, and having a degree taught in English – it appears you **would likely be eligible** for the Skilled Worker Visa under the New Entrant criteria.

Your salary meets both the £33,400 threshold and is above 70% of the going rate. As a New Entrant, switching from a Student Visa, you qualify for the discounted salary requirements.

However, please remember this is an initial assessment. The Home Office will make the final decision on your application.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! I was worried my salary might be too low compared to the standard rate. Do you know how long I can stay in the UK on this New Entrant visa once it's approved?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could provide some reassurance! 

Regarding how long you can stay, the Skilled Worker visa, even under the New Entrant route, is typically granted for up to 3 years. However, as a New Entrant, you have a maximum of 4 years total on the New Entrant salary conditions. 

Essentially, any time spent on the visa under the discounted salary rate counts toward that 4-year limit. After that, or if you change employers and no longer meet the New Entrant criteria, you'd need to meet the full salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa to extend your stay.

Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So I'll have the visa for 3 years initially, but I can only be considered a New Entrant for a maximum of 4 years total. After that, I'd need to meet the full salary requirements if I want to stay longer. Thanks for explaining that. I think that answers all my questions about the visa eligibility.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Liam! I'm happy I could clarify everything for you. 

Yes, you've understood it perfectly. And you're right, it sounds like I've addressed your questions about eligibility. 

If you do happen to think of anything else in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Best of luck with your visa application and your new role as a Junior Financial Analyst!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa under the New Entrant criteria, accurately explaining that my £35,000 salary meets both the minimum threshold of £33,400 and exceeds 70% of the going rate (£29,400). They also correctly noted the 4-year maximum limit for New Entrants.
