[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ahmed and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ahmed, nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what job you have been offered in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Head Chef at a restaurant here in the UK.

[root_agent]: That sounds exciting! To assess your eligibility, could you please tell me how many hours per week you are contracted to work as a Head Chef?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm contracted to work 60 hours per week as a Head Chef.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And could you please tell me your hourly rate for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: My hourly rate is £13.50 per hour.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Ahmed. Just to confirm, is this £13.50 per hour rate consistent throughout your contracted 60 hours each week?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The £13.50 per hour rate applies to all 60 hours I work each week.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please confirm your total annual salary based on these details (60 hours a week at £13.50 per hour)? Just the total amount, please.

[evaluation_judge]: My total annual salary would be £42,120.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ahmed. Do you understand that when the Home Office assesses your salary for visa purposes, they only consider earnings from the first 48 hours of your working week, not the full 60?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that. I thought they would consider my full salary based on all 60 hours.

[root_agent]: You're not alone – it's a common misunderstanding! The Home Office calculates eligibility based on a 48-hour week, even if your contract is for more hours. 

Based on a 48-hour week at your rate of £13.50 per hour, your assessable annual salary would be £33,696. Does that calculation seem correct to you?
