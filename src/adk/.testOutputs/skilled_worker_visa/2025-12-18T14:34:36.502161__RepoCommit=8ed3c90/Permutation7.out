[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of a person named Kenji who is inquiring about visa eligibility based on the scenario provided.

Hi, i'm Kenji and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Kenji, it's lovely to meet you! I'm root_agent, and I can certainly help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you tell me what type of visa you are hoping to apply for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, thank you for responding. I'm interested in applying for a Skilled Worker visa. I've received a job offer from a UK company as a Graphic Designer with a salary of £30,000 per year. I'm currently living in Japan and want to know if I'm eligible to move to the UK with this job offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Kenji. That's very helpful. 

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you please confirm if the company offering you the job is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office? You can usually check this with the company directly, or they may have provided you with a Sponsor Licence number.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office. They've confirmed this with me when they made the offer. They said they're approved to sponsor Skilled Worker visas.

[root_agent]: That's excellent news, Kenji! It's good to know they are a licensed sponsor.

Now, could you please tell me – have you had English language testing completed, and if so, did you meet the required standard for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've completed my English language test and I met the required standard for the Skilled Worker visa. I took the IELTS test and scored above the minimum requirements in all sections.

[root_agent]: Wonderful, Kenji! That’s another important requirement met.

To help me assess your eligibility further, could you tell me if you have a degree (Bachelor’s level or above) that is equivalent to a UK Bachelor’s degree?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from a university in Tokyo. I've been told it's equivalent to a UK Bachelor's degree. I graduated four years ago and have been working as a graphic designer since then.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear, Kenji! Your qualifications sound very good.

Finally, to fully assess your eligibility based on current requirements, could you please confirm the 'going rate' for a Graphic Designer in the UK, as determined by the Home Office? Your company should have checked this when making the job offer. Do you happen to know what that is?

[evaluation_judge]: The company told me that the going rate for a Graphic Designer in the UK is £29,000 per year, according to the Home Office guidelines. My offered salary of £30,000 is above this going rate.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Kenji.

Unfortunately, despite meeting the English language requirements, having a degree, and the job being sponsored, your salary of £30,000 does not currently meet the minimum salary thresholds for a Skilled Worker visa. 

Currently, the minimum salary requirement is £33,400 per year. Even though your salary is above the going rate for the profession, it is below this absolute minimum.

Therefore, based on the information you've provided, your application would be **REFUSED**.



Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you'd like to explore other visa options, though based on your profession, they may be limited.

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent was incorrect about the minimum salary requirements. While they correctly identified that my application would be refused because my salary of £30,000 is below the minimum threshold, they stated the minimum threshold is £33,400, when according to the scenario information, the absolute minimum salary floor for the Skilled Worker route is £33,400, but the standard threshold is actually £41,700. The agent should have mentioned both thresholds to provide complete information.
