[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi John, it's good to speak with you. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 32 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Have you recently completed a full-time course of study? (For example, a degree or postgraduate qualification within the last few years).

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't. I completed my studies many years ago. I'm actually switching from a dependent visa now.

[root_agent]: That's helpful to know, thank you. What is the job you have been offered? Specifically, what is the job title?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Trainee Chartered Accountant.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Are you, as part of this role, working towards a recognised professional qualification, such as ACCA or ICAEW?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. As part of the role, I'll be working towards getting my ACCA qualification.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. Could you please tell me your annual salary before tax?

[evaluation_judge]: My offered salary is £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Chartered Accountant in your specific role and location? (This is also sometimes called the 'standard occupational salary'). If not, that's okay, and I can try to help you find out, but it will take a little longer.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate is around £46,000, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the exact figure.

[root_agent]: That's very helpful, thank you. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you may be eligible for a salary discount due to being a new entrant working towards a professional qualification.

Just to confirm, are you currently on a dependent visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm currently on a dependent visa but looking to switch to my own visa based on this job offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on all the information you’ve provided – your age, your current visa status, the nature of your job as a Trainee Chartered Accountant working towards a recognised professional qualification, and your salary of £34,000 against a going rate of £46,000 – it appears you **would be awarded** the Skilled Worker Visa. 

Your salary meets the requirements for the 70% discount, as £34,000 is above 70% of £46,000. This means you qualify despite being over 26, due to your professional training.



Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or any other benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's exactly what I needed to know. Thank you for confirming that I'd be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa with my current offer. It's a relief to know that my professional training qualification counts despite being over 26.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be awarded the Skilled Worker Visa based on my status as a new entrant working towards a recognized professional qualification (ACCA), which allows me to qualify for the 70% salary discount despite being 32 years old.
