[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Mary, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant. To best understand your situation and whether you're eligible for a benefit, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi, yes of course. I've recently received a job offer as a Senior Care Worker at a residential home in the UK. It's a CQC registered facility and they're offering me £29,000 per year. I'm interested in applying for the Health & Care visa. I'd like to bring my husband and two children with me from Zimbabwe. I wanted to check if we would all be eligible.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Mary. That’s very helpful. 

To confirm, are you a qualified carer and does your job offer align with the eligible healthcare profession codes for the Health and Care Worker visa? Specifically, does your job fall under occupation code 6136 (Senior Care Worker)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am a qualified carer and my job offer is specifically for a Senior Care Worker position, which falls under occupation code 6136. The employer has confirmed this in my job offer letter.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Mary. 

To assess your family's eligibility, could you please confirm how old your children are? Knowing their ages will help me understand the rules that apply to them as dependents.

[evaluation_judge]: My children are 10 and 7 years old. My husband is 35.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mary. That's good to know.

Given your role as a Senior Care Worker (code 6136), and considering the recent changes to the rules, are you aware that there are currently restrictions on bringing dependents to the UK on the Health and Care Worker visa for this particular occupation?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that. What kind of restrictions are there? We were planning to all move together as a family. This is concerning news.

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, Mary. It's definitely important to be aware of all the rules. 

Currently, those applying under occupation code 6136 (Senior Care Worker) are eligible for the visa themselves, but they are **not** permitted to bring their dependents – that includes your husband and children – with them to the UK. This rule came into effect in March 2024.

Would you like me to explain the implications of this further? Perhaps we can discuss your options.

[evaluation_judge]: This is very upsetting news. I thought we would be able to move as a family. Could you please explain the implications? Are there any exceptions to this rule or alternative ways we could all be together? I don't think I want to leave my family behind in Zimbabwe.

[root_agent]: I completely understand your upset, Mary. It's a very difficult situation to consider leaving your family behind. I’m very sorry to deliver this news.

The implication is that, while *you* would be eligible for the Senior Care Worker visa, your husband and children would have their dependent visa applications **refused** under the current rules. They would not be granted permission to join you in the UK at the same time.

Regarding exceptions, unfortunately, there are **no current exceptions** to this rule for Senior Care Workers (code 6136). The restriction is specifically in place for this occupation and applies to all applicants. 

Alternative options are limited. Your husband could explore his own visa options – such as a Skilled Worker visa if he has a job offer meeting the requirements, or other visa categories he might qualify for independently. However, this would involve separate applications and potentially a significant waiting period. Your children's ability to join would then depend on your husband’s visa status.

Would you like me to summarise the situation, or perhaps explore potential pathways for your husband to apply for a visa separately? It's a complex situation, and I want to ensure you have all the information you need.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please summarize my situation, and if you could briefly mention potential pathways for my husband that would be helpful. I'm quite devastated as we wanted to move together as a family. I might need to reconsider this job offer if it means separating from my family for a long period.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Mary. I understand this is incredibly difficult, and I’m sorry to reiterate the challenging situation.

**Here's a summary of your situation:**

You are eligible for the Health and Care Worker visa as a Senior Care Worker (code 6136) with a salary of £29,000 and a CQC-registered employer. However, due to recent rule changes, applicants in this occupation code are **not permitted** to bring their dependents (husband and children) with them on the same visa. This means your husband and children’s dependent visa applications would be refused.

**Potential pathways for your husband:**

*   **Skilled Worker Visa (different occupation):** If your husband has a job offer from a UK employer in an eligible occupation (and meets the skill and salary requirements), he could apply for a Skilled Worker visa independently. This is the most likely route.
*   **Other Visa Categories:** Depending on his qualifications and circumstances, he might be eligible for other visas, such as a Student visa (if he pursues studies) or a Global Talent visa (if he has exceptional talent). These are less common routes.
*   **Switching Visas Later:** If you were to proceed with the visa alone, your husband *might* be able to apply to join you later if he obtains a visa in his own right. However, this isn’t guaranteed and depends on his situation at that time.

I recognise you're considering reconsidering the job offer, and that’s a perfectly understandable reaction. It's important to prioritize your family's wellbeing. 

Would you like me to provide more detail on any of these potential pathways for your husband, or perhaps explore resources for finding a UK employer if he were to look for a job independently?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for that clear summary. This is definitely not what I had expected or hoped for. I think I need to have a serious conversation with my family about whether I should take this job at all, or perhaps look for opportunities in countries with more family-friendly immigration policies. 

Is there any timeline for when these rules might change again? Or is this likely to be a permanent restriction?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Mary. I’m glad I could provide a clear summary, even though the news is disheartening. It’s absolutely right to have a serious conversation with your family and explore all your options.

Regarding the timeline for potential changes to the rules, unfortunately, there is **no current information** available about when – or if – these restrictions might be lifted. Immigration policies are subject to change based on government decisions and evolving circumstances. 

Currently, the UK government has not indicated any plans to reverse this decision for Senior Care Workers. While it’s *possible* rules could change in the future, it's not something that can be relied upon. It's generally considered a relatively firm restriction at this time.

I understand this adds to the difficulty of your decision. It’s a significant factor to consider when weighing your options, and looking at opportunities in countries with more favorable immigration policies for families is a sensible approach.

Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time? Perhaps information on where to find official updates on UK immigration policies, or resources for exploring opportunities in other countries?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the honest assessment. I think I have all the information I need for now regarding the UK visa. I'll discuss with my family and may look into other countries that would allow us to stay together. I appreciate your time and thorough explanation of the situation.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Mary. I'm glad I could provide the information you needed, even though it wasn't the news you’d hoped for. 

I truly wish you and your family all the best in your decision-making process and in finding a path that allows you to build a happy future together. 

If you do have any further questions down the line, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here to help if I can.



Take care, and I wish you all the best.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that while I (Mary) would be eligible for the Health and Care Worker visa as a Senior Care Worker, my dependents (husband and children) would not be permitted to join me due to the March 2024 rule change specifically affecting occupation codes 6136. This matches the expected outcome of a split decision where my visa would be awarded but my family's dependent visas would be refused.
