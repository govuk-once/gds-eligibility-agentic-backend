[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Banu and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Dr. Banu. Thank you for speaking with me today. I understand you’re interested in the Skilled Worker Visa. 

To start, could you please confirm for me, do you have a PhD qualification?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a PhD in Chemistry that I completed in Turkey. I'm hoping to use this for my Skilled Worker visa application since I've been offered a position as a Senior Chemist in the UK with a salary of £35,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I appreciate you letting me know about your PhD and the job offer. 

Could you tell me which university you obtained your PhD from?

[evaluation_judge]: I received my PhD from a small private university in Turkey. It's not one of the major state universities - it's a smaller specialized institution that focuses on chemistry and related fields.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me if your university has been accredited by a recognized UK accreditation body?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure if my university has been accredited by a UK accreditation body. I know it's a legitimate institution in Turkey, but it's smaller and might not have international accreditations. Is that going to be a problem for my visa application?

[root_agent]: I understand. Let me ask you this: has your PhD been verified by Ecctis?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I did get my qualification verified by Ecctis. They sent me a report, but I was a bit confused by the outcome. The report stated that my qualification is "comparable to RQF Level 7 (Master's)" rather than a doctoral level. I was surprised because my degree certificate says "PhD" on it.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Just to be absolutely clear, you’ve had your qualification assessed by Ecctis, and their assessment indicated it’s comparable to a Master’s level, not a PhD level?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Ecctis assessed my qualification and determined it's comparable to a Master's level (RQF Level 7) in the UK system, not a doctoral level, even though my degree is called a PhD in Turkey. I was quite disappointed by this assessment.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Dr. Banu. Thank you for being so open about this.

Given that Ecctis has not verified your PhD as equivalent to a UK PhD, could you confirm whether the degree certificate itself explicitly states "PhD"?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my degree certificate does explicitly state "PhD in Chemistry" on it. In Turkey, it's considered a doctoral degree, but I understand now that Ecctis hasn't recognized it as equivalent to a UK doctoral qualification.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on this information, it seems your PhD is not recognized by the Home Office as equivalent to a UK PhD.

To ensure I’m completely accurate, could you tell me, do you have any other qualifications or credentials that might be relevant to your Skilled Worker visa application, such as a Master's degree or professional certifications?

[evaluation_judge]: I do have a Master's degree in Chemistry from the same university in Turkey, and I have about 7 years of experience working as a chemist in research laboratories. I've published several papers in international journals as well. Would these help with my visa application?

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Let’s focus on the PhD for now. Considering Ecctis has not verified your PhD as a UK equivalent, and the salary you’re being offered is £35,000, does the job offer rely on the Tradeable Points system for the Skilled Worker Visa, utilizing a PhD qualification?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my employer mentioned they were offering me £35,000 because they thought my PhD would qualify me for the STEM PhD discount. They said something about not needing to meet the full salary threshold because of this. So I believe they are relying on the Tradeable Points system with my PhD qualification.

[root_agent]: I appreciate you clarifying that. Based on the information you’ve provided – the Ecctis verification confirming a Master’s level equivalent, your PhD certificate stating “PhD,” and the reliance on the Tradeable Points system for the STEM PhD discount – it appears your application wouldn’t be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa at this time. 

Without a fully verified PhD, you would need to meet the higher salary threshold.

Therefore, I have to inform you that, based on the current criteria, your application for the Skilled Worker Visa is **REFUSED**.

Do you have any questions about this decision, or would you like me to explain any aspect in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm very disappointed to hear that. Could you tell me what the higher salary threshold would be that I need to meet? Is there anything I can do to appeal the Ecctis assessment or any alternative pathways I should consider?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Dr. Banu. Let’s address your questions.

The higher salary threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa, without Tradeable Points, is currently £38,700 as of today, October 26, 2023. This can fluctuate slightly, so it's always best to check the latest figures on the official government website.

Regarding appealing the Ecctis assessment, unfortunately, the Home Office generally doesn’t intervene in Ecctis’s evaluations. Ecctis is an independent body, and their assessments are usually final. However, you could submit additional documentation to support your case, such as further details about the university’s accreditation process or letters from other academic institutions confirming the equivalence of your degree. This is unlikely to change the outcome, but it demonstrates you’ve explored all avenues.

As for alternative pathways, you could consider:

*   **Applying for a different job role:** Roles with a higher salary might be available.
*   **Pursuing a UK Master’s degree:** Completing a Master’s degree in the UK would make you eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa with the standard salary threshold.
*   **Seeking a different visa route:** Depending on your specific circumstances, other visa options might be available, but this would require a separate assessment.

I want to reiterate that I've provided this information based on the criteria provided and the information you’ve shared.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions, or perhaps direct you to resources where you can learn more about alternative visa routes?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining this clearly. The current situation is quite frustrating for me, especially since my employer thought my PhD would qualify. I'll need to discuss with them about possibly increasing the salary offer to meet the £38,700 threshold or explore some of the alternative pathways you suggested.

One last question - if I were to pursue a PhD at a UK university instead, would that automatically qualify for the points system in the future?

[root_agent]: That’s completely understandable, Dr. Banu. It’s frustrating when expectations aren't met.

Regarding your final question – yes, obtaining a PhD from a UK university would significantly improve your eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa. A UK PhD would automatically qualify you for the Tradeable Points system, allowing you to potentially lower the required salary to £38,700 (or even less, depending on the specific role and employer). 

It’s a worthwhile consideration.

Thank you again for speaking with me today. I’m glad I could provide some clarity on the situation. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all for now. Thank you for your help in understanding this situation. I'll discuss these options with my potential employer and consider my next steps.

✓ The agent correctly determined that my application would be refused because my PhD was not verified as equivalent to a UK PhD by Ecctis, meaning I couldn't use the STEM PhD discount and my £35,000 salary was insufficient.
