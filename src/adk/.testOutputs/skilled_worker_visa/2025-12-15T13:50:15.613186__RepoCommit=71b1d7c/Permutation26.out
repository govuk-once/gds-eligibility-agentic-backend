[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Klaus and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Klaus, it’s nice to meet you. To help me understand your situation and determine if you might be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you please tell me your current age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 45 years old, and I've received a job offer in the UK as a welder. I'm trying to figure out if I can get a Skilled Worker visa with the salary they're offering me.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me what salary you’ve been offered for the welder position?

[evaluation_judge]: The company has offered me £30,960 per year. They said this is acceptable because welding is on something called the Immigration Salary List, so they only need to pay me 80% of the normal rate. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let’s delve a little deeper. Could you tell me what the going rate is for a welder in the UK, according to the employer or from other sources you’ve researched?

[evaluation_judge]: The going rate for a welder is £38,700 per year. The employer told me that since welding is on the Immigration Salary List, they only need to pay me 80% of that amount, which is why they're offering me £30,960. They seemed quite confident about this arrangement.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detail, Klaus. Just to confirm, you’re saying the employer believes the Immigration Salary List allows them to pay you 80% of the going rate for a welder, which is £38,700?

[evaluation_judge]: That's exactly right. They believe that since welding is on the Immigration Salary List, they only need to pay me 80% of the going rate (which works out to the £30,960 they're offering me). They seemed very confident that this was correct and sufficient for my visa application.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Now, could you tell me your age, Klaus?

[evaluation_judge]: I already mentioned it, but I'm 45 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Let me quickly check the relevant criteria... Okay, Klaus. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re a 45-year-old welder with a salary of £30,960, and that your employer believes the Immigration Salary List allows for 80% of the going rate – I need to confirm something. 

The Immigration Salary List doesn’t automatically allow paying 80% of the going rate indefinitely. It sets a lower general threshold, but the going rate still needs to be met unless you’re a New Entrant.

Does the salary offered meet the ISL General Floor (£33,400)?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my offered salary is £30,960, which is below the ISL General Floor of £33,400 that you mentioned. The employer didn't say anything about this general floor - they only talked about the 80% of the going rate calculation. Is this going to be a problem for my visa application?

[root_agent]: You are correct to point that out, Klaus. My apologies for not bringing that up earlier. The ISL general floor is indeed £33,400. Since your salary of £30,960 is below that threshold, it presents a significant challenge for a Skilled Worker visa. 

Furthermore, being on the ISL alone does *not* grant the 80% discount on the *going rate* anymore. 

Based on this, I’m afraid I must advise that your application would likely be refused. The sponsor is applying old “Shortage Occupation” logic. Under current ISL rules, you must be paid the full going rate (£38,700).

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, this is quite different from what the employer told me. I'm confused because they seemed so certain about the 80% rule. Could you please explain more about when this changed? And is there any way I could still qualify for the visa at the salary they're offering?

[root_agent]: I understand your confusion, Klaus. It’s frustrating when information differs from what you’ve been told.

The significant change happened after April 2024. Previously, being on the Immigration Salary List (ISL) allowed employers to pay 80% of the going rate for eligible occupations. However, that rule has now been removed. The ISL now simply sets a lower *general* threshold (£33,400), which you must meet, and you *still* need to be paid the full going rate unless you qualify as a New Entrant.

As for whether you could still qualify at the salary they’re offering – unfortunately, with a salary of £30,960, it’s highly unlikely. The full going rate for a welder is £38,700, and the ISL floor is £33,400. There isn’t enough room to meet either of these requirements.

While there are a few exceptions, such as for New Entrants or those with specific, highly specialized skills, it doesn’t seem applicable in your case, given the information you’ve provided.

Do you want me to elaborate on what qualifies as a New Entrant, just to be completely clear?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain what counts as a New Entrant. I don't think I would qualify as one at 45 years old, but I want to understand all my options.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s clarify what qualifies as a New Entrant, Klaus. A New Entrant is someone who has graduated within the last three years – meaning they’ve completed their education or training within the three years before applying for the visa.

Here’s what’s important:

*   **Recent Qualification:** They must have obtained their qualification (degree, diploma, apprenticeship, etc.) within the last three years.
*   **No Prior Work Experience in the UK:** Crucially, they can’t have worked in the UK previously.
*   **Eligible Occupation:** The job they’re applying for must be on the eligible occupations list for New Entrants.

Because you are 45 years old and have prior work experience, you wouldn't qualify as a New Entrant. The criteria specifically targets recent graduates.

I want to reiterate that, given your age and salary, it’s unlikely you'll be able to secure a Skilled Worker visa with the current rules.

Would you like me to summarise the key points again, or perhaps discuss other visa options that might be available to you, although they may have different requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: I appreciate the clear explanation. Based on what you've told me, I wouldn't qualify as a New Entrant at my age, and my salary offer doesn't meet either the general floor or the full going rate requirement. 

It sounds like I should go back to my employer and explain that they're working with outdated information about the Immigration Salary List rules. If they want to sponsor me, they'd need to increase the salary offer to at least £38,700, which is the full going rate for welders.

Are there any other visa categories you think I should look into, or is increasing the salary offer the most straightforward solution?

[root_agent]: That's an excellent and very sensible approach, Klaus. Going back to your employer with the correct information is definitely the right course of action. It’s understandable they were relying on older guidance.

Regarding other visa categories – while increasing the salary is the most straightforward solution if your employer is willing, let’s briefly explore a few other possibilities, though they may have different requirements and may not be suitable for your situation:

*   **Global Skilled Professional Visa:** This visa could potentially be an option if you have specialist skills that meet specific criteria, but it's highly dependent on your qualifications and experience.
*   **High Potential Individual Visa:** This is usually for younger individuals (typically under 30) with exceptional talents, but it’s unlikely to be applicable at your age.

However, realistically, securing a Skilled Worker visa with the current salary and rules is looking challenging.

Would you like me to provide a little more detail on the Global Skilled Professional Visa, or perhaps we could focus on drafting a polite but firm email to your employer outlining the situation?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave incorrect information regarding the New Entrant category, which is not limited to people who have graduated within the last three years but includes several other categories of workers.
