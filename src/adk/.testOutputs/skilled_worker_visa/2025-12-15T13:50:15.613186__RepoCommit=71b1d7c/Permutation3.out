[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Dr. Aari seeking information about visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Aari and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Aari, it’s lovely to meet you. To help me understand your situation and whether you might be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you tell me what subject you completed your PhD in?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I completed my PhD in Microbiology from the University of Mumbai in India. I've been working in biological research for the past few years and recently received a job offer in the UK.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And could you please tell me what your current job offer is? Specifically, what is the job title and what is the salary you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Senior Lab Technician at a pharmaceutical company in the UK. They're offering me a salary of £34,000 per year. I'm quite excited about the opportunity as it aligns well with my research background.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Now, could you tell me what the standard going rate for a Senior Lab Technician role in the UK is, according to the company or any information you’ve gathered?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for this Senior Lab Technician role is around £38,000 per year. This is what the company told me when we discussed salary expectations during the interview process.

[root_agent]: Alright. Let’s talk about your PhD then. To confirm, you completed a PhD in Microbiology, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I completed my PhD in Microbiology. My research focused on antibiotic-resistant bacteria and developing new approaches to combat them.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent. And just to be completely clear, is there a valid sponsor in place who is willing to support your application for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the pharmaceutical company that has offered me the position has a valid sponsor license and they've confirmed they will sponsor my Skilled Worker Visa application.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! Now, let’s confirm some details about the role itself. Could you tell me what skill level this Senior Lab Technician position is considered to be?

[evaluation_judge]: The position is considered to be at RQF level 6, which requires advanced skills and knowledge. It requires someone with research experience and advanced laboratory techniques, which is why they were looking for someone with a PhD or significant experience in the field.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Finally, could you confirm that you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I meet the English language requirements. I completed my undergraduate and master's studies in English, and I've also passed the IELTS test with an overall score of 7.5, which I understand exceeds the minimum requirement.

[root_agent]: Okay, Aari. Thank you for providing all of this information. Let’s just quickly review – you have a PhD in Microbiology, a job offer as a Senior Lab Technician at a pharmaceutical company earning £34,000 per year, the standard going rate for that role is £38,000 (80% of that), there’s a sponsoring company, and you meet the English language requirements.

Based on this, does the salary meet the lower general threshold of £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £34,000 is above the £33,400 threshold.

[root_agent]: And does it also meet the discounted going rate requirement of being at least 80% of the standard going rate?

Let me quickly calculate that for you: 80% of £38,000 is £30,400.  Is your salary of £34,000 higher than £30,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my salary of £34,000 is definitely higher than £30,400, which is 80% of the standard going rate. So it meets that requirement as well.

[root_agent]: Excellent! Based on all of this information – your relevant STEM PhD, the salary exceeding the thresholds, a sponsoring company, and meeting English language requirements – I am pleased to inform you that you *are* eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa.

**AWARDED.**

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming my eligibility! That's great news. So my Microbiology PhD is helping me meet the requirements despite the salary being lower than the standard going rate. I'm relieved to hear that I qualify for the visa, as I'm really looking forward to starting this new position in the UK.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately identified that with my STEM PhD in Microbiology, my £34,000 salary exceeds both the lower threshold of £33,400 and 80% of the going rate (£30,400), matching the expected outcome of "AWARDED."
