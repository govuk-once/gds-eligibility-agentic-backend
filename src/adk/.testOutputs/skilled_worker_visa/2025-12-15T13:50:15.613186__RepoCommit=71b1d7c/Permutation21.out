[evaluation_judge]: I'll assume the role of Leo, a Master's student from China who wants to understand if I can switch to a Skilled Worker visa for a job starting before my course ends.

Hi, i'm Leo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Leo, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you please tell me what type of course you’re currently studying?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently studying a Master's degree. I'm from China and I'm here on a Student visa. My course is scheduled to end in September 2026.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. And just to confirm, you’re studying a Master’s degree, correct?  Could you tell me how many years of your Master’s program have you already completed?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a Master's degree. I started this academic year, so I'm only halfway through my first year. My course is a 2-year Master's program ending in September 2026.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Leo. That’s very helpful.  Let me just check something – are you currently pursuing a PhD as part of your Master’s program?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not pursuing a PhD. It's just a standard 2-year Master's program.

[root_agent]: Alright. And to be absolutely clear, you’re expecting your Master’s program to finish in September 2026, and you’re currently in the middle of your first year, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I started in September 2025, and the program ends in September 2026. So I'm still in my first year right now.

[root_agent]: Okay, Leo. Thank you for confirming that. Just one more question for now – do you have a job offer starting in January 2026?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a job offer. It's for a Marketing Executive position and they want me to start in January 2026, so quite soon.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Leo. That’s valuable information. Based on what you’ve told me – that you're studying a Master's degree, it’s your first year, you’re not doing a PhD, and you have a job offer starting in January 2026 – I need to assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa. 

Could you tell me, have you completed your Master’s degree, or are you still undertaking the full course?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm still undertaking the full course. I haven't completed it yet. As I mentioned, I'm only halfway through my first year, and my degree won't be completed until September 2026.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on this information, I need to advise you that you are currently ineligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa from inside the UK.

Could you please allow me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why I'm ineligible. I thought with a job offer I could switch to a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: You’re right to think a job offer could be a factor, and it is. However, the criteria for switching to a Skilled Worker visa while in the UK requires you to have completed your course, or, if you’re doing a PhD, at least 24 months of it. 

As you’ve explained, you’re only halfway through your first year and your degree won’t be completed until September 2026. Since you haven’t met this requirement, a switch isn’t possible at this time. 

Would you like me to outline the alternative options available to you, such as applying for a visa from outside the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please tell me about my alternative options. If I can't switch from inside the UK, what are my choices? Would I have to leave the UK and apply from overseas?

[root_agent]: Okay, Leo. If you’re unable to switch to a Skilled Worker visa from within the UK due to not having completed your course, your primary option would be to apply for a visa from outside the UK. This is often referred to as an “Entry Clearance” application.

Essentially, you would need to leave the UK and apply for a visa that would allow you to work in the UK once your Master’s degree is completed. 

Before you make any decisions, though, it’s worth noting that there might be a period where you’re unable to work while outside the UK. 

Would you like me to provide you with some links to the relevant pages on the government website that detail the Entry Clearance application process, or would you like to discuss the potential timeline for this option?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to understand both the timeline and the process, please. If I have to leave the UK to apply, how long might that process take? And would the employer need to delay my start date until I get the visa?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s break down the timeline and process for applying for a visa from outside the UK as an Entry Clearance.

**Timeline:** The processing time for an Entry Clearance application can vary, but it typically takes between **12 to 30 weeks** from the date of application. It’s important to apply well in advance of your intended start date. 

**Process:** You’ll need to gather several documents, including your passport, proof of your Master's course, your job offer letter, and evidence of funds to support yourself while in the UK. You’ll need to complete an online application and pay an application fee.  You’ll also need to attend an appointment at a Visa Application Centre.

Regarding your employer’s start date, it’s highly likely they would need to delay your start date until you’ve received your visa. Obtaining a visa can take several months, so it’s wise to discuss this with your employer as soon as possible. They may be understanding and willing to adjust the start date, but it’s best to have an open conversation about the potential delay.

Do you have any specific questions about either the timeline, the process, or discussing this with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so I'd need to return to China and apply from there. Would I be allowed to come back to the UK temporarily to finish my exams or do any remaining coursework before fully transitioning to the Skilled Worker visa? Or would I need to completely drop out of my Master's program?

[root_agent]: That’s a really important question, Leo, and a common consideration. Currently, the regulations state that you cannot switch to a Skilled Worker visa while *inside* the UK unless you’re applying for a start date *after* you’ve completed your course.

As for returning to China to finish your exams or coursework before applying for a Skilled Worker visa, the short answer is: it’s a complicated situation and generally not recommended. While it might seem like a way to expedite the process, it’s not a straightforward path.

The Home Office prioritizes applications received from outside the UK. Returning to the UK to finish your studies before applying could potentially cause issues with your application, as it might appear you are trying to circumvent the rules.

The most prudent course of action would be to complete your program in China, and then apply for the Skilled Worker visa from outside the UK. Dropping out of your Master’s program would also be a possibility, but this would mean losing the investment you’ve made in your studies and potentially affecting your future career prospects.

Would you like me to delve deeper into the potential challenges of applying from outside the UK, or perhaps discuss the implications of dropping out of your Master's program?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining. Since I can't switch to a Skilled Worker visa before completing my course, I think I need to discuss this with my potential employer. I'll need to explain that I either need to complete my studies first, or I'd have to return to China to apply. 

Is there any chance the rules might change soon? Or is there any special consideration given to those who are very close to finishing their studies?

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible approach, Leo – discussing this with your employer is definitely the right first step. 

You’ve raised a really important point about the possibility of the rules changing, and it’s understandable to be hopeful. While there’s always a chance regulations could be updated, there’s currently no indication that the rules regarding switching to a Skilled Worker visa while in the UK will be altered in the near future. The Home Office has been focusing on stricter enforcement of existing criteria.

Regarding special consideration for those close to finishing their studies, it’s a possibility, but it’s difficult to predict. The Home Office’s decisions are based on individual circumstances, and there’s no guarantee that they’ll automatically grant special consideration.  However, presenting a clear and well-documented case, highlighting your commitment to the Skilled Worker role, and demonstrating that you’ve fully completed your studies could potentially strengthen your application.

You can keep an eye on the UK Visas and Immigration website for any official announcements regarding potential changes to immigration rules: [https://www.gov.uk/immigration-rules](https://www.gov.uk/immigration-rules)

Would you like me to recap the key steps you should take – discussing this with your employer and potentially preparing a detailed application for a visa from outside the UK – or perhaps explore any other aspects of this situation you'd like to discuss?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave me incorrect information. I was not given the correct outcome that I should be REFUSED for the Skilled Worker visa since I haven't completed my studies and am not a PhD student. The agent confirmed I was ineligible to switch from within the UK but suggested I could apply from outside the UK and return to work before my course ends, which contradicts the scenario requirements where I cannot switch mid-course at all, regardless of application location.
