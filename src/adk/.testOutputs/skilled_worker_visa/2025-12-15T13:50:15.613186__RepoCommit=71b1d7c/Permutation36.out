[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Raj in this scenario. I'll engage with the agent to test their knowledge about visa requirements for internal promotions with occupation code changes.

Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Raj, it’s good to speak with you. To help me assess your situation, could you please tell me a bit about your current employment? Specifically, what is your current job title and what occupation code does it fall under?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm currently working as a Web Developer which is under occupation code 2137. I've been sponsored by my company on a Skilled Worker visa for this role. I've recently been offered a promotion to become an IT Project Manager in the same company, which would be under occupation code 2135. The salary is £50,000, which I understand meets the requirements. My employer has told me they'll just update the SMS system, and I can start right away. I just wanted to check if there's anything else I need to do regarding my visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detailed information, Raj. It’s helpful to have the specifics.

Just to clarify, your current role is a Web Developer (Code 2137) and the new role you’ve been offered is an IT Project Manager (Code 2135), correct?

Could you tell me, what is your current salary?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm currently a Web Developer under code 2137, and I've been offered a promotion to IT Project Manager under code 2135, still within the same company.

My current salary is £42,000, and the new position would pay £50,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj. Thank you for confirming that.

Considering you're changing from a Web Developer (Code 2137) to an IT Project Manager (Code 2135) within the same company, and the salary is £50,000 – which meets the requirements – do you recall if your employer has specifically mentioned needing to apply for a ‘Change of Employment’ visa to accommodate this change in occupation code?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my employer hasn't mentioned anything about a 'Change of Employment' visa. They just said they would update the SMS system and I could start the new role right away. They made it sound like it was a simple internal process since I'm staying with the same company. Is there something more I should be doing before starting this new role?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Raj. That’s important to know.

Given that you’re changing occupation codes within the same company, it’s possible your current visa may not be valid for the new role. 

To help me assess this further, could you confirm whether you are currently sponsored under the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am currently on a Skilled Worker Visa. My company is sponsoring me under that visa category for my role as a Web Developer (code 2137).

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj. Thank you for confirming.

Based on the information you’ve provided – a change in occupation code (2137 to 2135) within the same company, and you’re currently on a Skilled Worker Visa – it’s important to understand that a simple update to the SMS system might not be sufficient.

To be fully compliant, a ‘Change of Employment’ visa application would likely be required. 

Would you like me to explain why this is the case, or would you like me to outline the steps involved in applying for a ‘Change of Employment’ visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why I would need a 'Change of Employment' visa. I thought since I'm staying with the same employer, I could just transition to the new role without additional visa applications. What happens if I start the new role with just the SMS update as my employer suggested?

[root_agent]: You’ve raised a very important point, Raj, and it’s understandable to be confused. You’re correct to question the assumption that a simple SMS update is enough.

Here's why a ‘Change of Employment’ visa is typically required: Your current Skilled Worker visa is tied to the specific occupation code (2137 – Web Developer). When you move to a different occupation code (2135 – IT Project Manager), it’s considered a change in your permitted work. The Home Office needs to verify that the new role aligns with the terms of your existing visa.

If you start the new role without applying for a ‘Change of Employment’ visa, it constitutes a regulatory breach. Your sponsor would face serious consequences, including the loss of their sponsorship license, and your visa could be curtailed – meaning it would be cancelled. 

Essentially, the ‘SMS update’ is a temporary measure to allow you to continue working in the interim, but it doesn't change the fact that a formal visa application is necessary to solidify your right to work in the new role. 

Does that explanation make sense, Raj? Would you like me to go into more detail about the potential consequences of not applying for a ‘Change of Employment’ visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense now. So essentially, if I start working as an IT Project Manager without getting a 'Change of Employment' visa first, I would technically be working illegally even though I'm with the same company? And both my employer and I could face serious consequences?

That's concerning because my employer seemed to think the SMS update was sufficient. How long does the 'Change of Employment' application typically take? Would I need to delay my promotion until it's approved?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit on the crucial point, Raj – absolutely correct. Starting the role as an IT Project Manager without a ‘Change of Employment’ visa would indeed constitute working illegally, even though you’re with the same company. Both you and your employer would face serious consequences, as we discussed – your employer could lose their sponsorship license, and your visa could be curtailed.

The ‘Change of Employment’ application process can vary, but it typically takes between 6 to 8 weeks to process. It's not uncommon for employers to request that the employee delays starting the new role until the visa is approved, to ensure full compliance. 

It’s important to have an open and honest conversation with your employer about this requirement. Would you like me to outline the typical steps involved in the ‘Change of Employment’ application process, or would you like me to suggest some ways you can approach this discussion with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd appreciate some guidance on both, please. First, what are the typical steps in the 'Change of Employment' application process? And secondly, how might I approach this conversation with my employer, since they seem unaware of this requirement?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s break this down, Raj.

**The Typical Steps in the ‘Change of Employment’ Application Process:**

1.  **Employer Application:** Your employer will need to submit an application to the Home Office on your behalf, detailing the change in occupation and salary.
2.  **Supporting Documents:** They will need to provide evidence confirming you’ve been employed for a certain period (usually at least 183 days) under your current visa. They'll also need to confirm the new role and salary.
3.  **Your Biometrics Appointment:** You’ll receive an invitation to attend a Home Office appointment to provide your fingerprints and photograph.
4.  **Interview (Potentially):** In some cases, you may be asked to attend an interview to confirm the details of your employment.
5.  **Decision:** The Home Office will make a decision on the application.

**Approaching the Conversation with Your Employer:**

Given they seem unaware of this requirement, a gentle, informative approach is best. Here’s what you could say:

*   “Thank you for offering me the IT Project Manager role. I’m very excited about the opportunity. I’ve been reviewing the visa requirements, and it appears I’ll need to apply for a ‘Change of Employment’ visa to reflect the change in my occupation code. Can we discuss how this process would work and the timeline involved?"

*   "I understand the SMS update is a helpful interim measure, but for full compliance with visa regulations, a formal application is required. I want to ensure everything is handled correctly and smoothly.”

*   You could offer to assist them with providing the necessary documentation. 

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this process, or perhaps role-play a scenario of how you might handle this conversation?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the detailed explanation. This helps me understand what needs to happen. It sounds like I definitely need to have this conversation with my employer before starting the new role.

One last question - is there any way I could start the new role while the application is being processed, or would I need to continue in my current Web Developer role until the new visa is approved?

[root_agent]: That’s a really astute question, Raj. You’re right to explore the possibility of starting the new role while the ‘Change of Employment’ application is being processed.

Officially, you *would* need to continue in your current role as a Web Developer until the new visa is approved. The Home Office requires that your employment status is clearly defined. However, many employers are willing to allow you to start in a limited capacity – perhaps focusing on tasks that don't require the full scope of the IT Project Manager role – while the application is being processed. 

It’s really up to your employer’s discretion and their willingness to accommodate. Be prepared to discuss the level of involvement you can have while the application is ongoing. 

To increase your chances of a successful arrangement, it would be beneficial to proactively present a plan outlining how you can contribute minimally while the visa is being processed. 

Would you like me to suggest some specific phrases you could use when discussing this with your employer, or perhaps explore potential compromises you could propose?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would need a 'Change of Employment' visa when changing occupation codes within the same company, and clearly explained that proceeding without this would be a compliance breach with serious consequences.
