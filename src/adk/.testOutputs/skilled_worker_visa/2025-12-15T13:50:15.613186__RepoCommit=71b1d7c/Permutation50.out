[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Sarah, an IT consultant asking about visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, it’s lovely to speak with you. I’m here to help you understand your eligibility. To start, could you tell me a little about the type of work you’ll be doing for the IT firm?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! Yes, I'm an IT consultant with expertise in software development and systems integration. A company here in the UK wants to bring me on for a long-term project - they're quite a reputable IT firm. They've mentioned they want to sponsor my visa and will provide a Certificate of Sponsorship, but they're suggesting I work as a contractor rather than an employee. They said I'd need to invoice them monthly for my services rather than being on their payroll. They mentioned something about it being better for tax purposes - National Insurance I think they said. Does that arrangement sound okay for a visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Sarah. That’s very helpful. Just to clarify, they’re proposing you invoice them monthly for your work and receive a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) – essentially treating you as a contractor, even though you’ll be working on a long-term project?

Could you confirm whether you'll be receiving a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) from the company?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. They're proposing that I work as a contractor where I would invoice them monthly for my services, but they've also said they will provide me with a Certificate of Sponsorship for my visa. They explained it would be under a "Consultancy Agreement" rather than an employment contract. They seemed quite confident about this arrangement. Is there anything I should be concerned about with this setup?

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. It’s good to understand the specifics of the arrangement. I want to be absolutely clear – the Skilled Worker Visa requires you to be an employee, paying tax through PAYE. 

To help me assess your situation, could you tell me if you are currently working as a self-employed contractor, or are you being asked to operate under something like an IR35 arrangement where you invoice for services?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they specifically want me to operate as a self-employed contractor. They mentioned it would be better for them regarding National Insurance costs. The arrangement would be that I invoice them for my services monthly rather than being on their payroll. They called it a "Consultancy Agreement" rather than an employment contract. But they've assured me they'll provide the Certificate of Sponsorship for my visa. Is this going to be an issue?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Sarah. This is important information.

The Skilled Worker Visa rules state that you must be an employee – paying tax through PAYE – and not self-employed. The fact that you’ll be invoicing and receiving a CoS suggests a potential issue with this arrangement.

To help me determine the best course of action, could you tell me – is there a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) being issued?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they've definitely confirmed they will issue me a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS). They've been very clear about that part. They just want me to work under this "Consultancy Agreement" rather than as a direct employee on their payroll. They seem to think this arrangement will work fine with the visa system, but I wanted to check if that's actually the case.

[root_agent]: Okay, Sarah. Thank you for confirming that they’ll issue a Certificate of Sponsorship.

Let's delve a little deeper. The Skilled Worker Visa requires a genuine employment relationship, and this arrangement – where you invoice as a contractor – doesn’t typically meet those requirements.

To help me assess this further, could you tell me: Is there a genuine employer-employee relationship, such as a formal contract outlining the terms of your work and responsibilities?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, they said we would have a formal "Consultancy Agreement" that outlines the scope of work, my responsibilities, payment terms, and the duration of the project. But it's specifically not an employment contract - it's a contract for services where I'd be treated as an external consultant rather than an employee. They emphasized I wouldn't be on their payroll or have PAYE tax arrangements. Is that what you mean by a genuine employment relationship?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying the nature of the “Consultancy Agreement,” Sarah. You’re absolutely right – it’s a contract for services, not an employment contract. 

Based on what you’ve described, and the requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa, I have to advise that this arrangement is unlikely to be compliant. The visa specifically requires an employee with PAYE. 

Therefore, I must conclude that you would not be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa under these circumstances. 

**REFUSED.**

Do you have any questions about this assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit confused. The company seemed quite confident about this arrangement. So even though they'll provide me with a Certificate of Sponsorship, I can't get a Skilled Worker visa because I'd be a contractor rather than an employee? Would I need to ask them to change the arrangement to a proper employment contract with PAYE if I wanted to pursue this opportunity?

[root_agent]: You’ve raised a very important and understandable point, Sarah. It’s frustrating when a process seems straightforward but then reveals a key requirement.

You are correct – even with a Certificate of Sponsorship, the fundamental requirement of being an employee with PAYE under the Skilled Worker Visa isn’t met under a contractor arrangement. 

If you were to pursue this opportunity, the company would need to amend the agreement to formalize a genuine employment contract, including PAYE tax arrangements. They would need to treat you as a true employee.

Unfortunately, I cannot advise you on whether or not the company would be willing to make that change. However, your understanding of the requirements is accurate.

**REFUSED.**

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding this situation?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes it very clear, thank you. So I should go back to the company and explain that for the Skilled Worker visa to be valid, they would need to hire me as a proper employee with PAYE rather than as a contractor with a Consultancy Agreement. It sounds like they may have misunderstood the visa requirements. I appreciate your help in clarifying this before I proceeded further.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Sarah. I'm glad I could help you understand the situation and clarify the requirements. It’s always best to have a clear understanding of the rules before moving forward. 

It sounds like you’ve gained valuable insight, and I’m confident you’ll be able to discuss this with the company effectively. 

Thank you for your patience and for using my assistance. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would be refused a Skilled Worker visa because the arrangement as a contractor with a "Consultancy Agreement" does not meet the requirement of being an employee with PAYE, which matches the expected outcome.
