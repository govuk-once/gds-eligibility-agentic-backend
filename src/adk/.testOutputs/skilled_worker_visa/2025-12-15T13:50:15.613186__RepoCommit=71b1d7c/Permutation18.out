[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Julian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Julian, it’s nice to meet you. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me, what is your current nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm from Argentina. I've been offered a Sales Director position in the UK and I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a work visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. And to confirm, you’ve been offered a role as a Sales Director, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I've been offered a Sales Director position with a company in the UK.

[root_agent]: Could you please tell me what your base salary is for this position, before any bonuses or commissions?

[evaluation_judge]: My offer includes a base salary of £35,000, plus £20,000 in guaranteed commission, and there's also a £10,000 performance bonus. So the total package is £65,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Now, regarding the commission and bonus – would you describe the £20,000 commission as a guaranteed amount, or is it tied to specific performance targets?

[evaluation_judge]: The £20,000 commission is described as "guaranteed" in my contract, though of course I'm expected to perform well. The £10,000 performance bonus is definitely tied to specific targets and metrics.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that the £20,000 commission is guaranteed, even if performance is expected. Just to be completely clear, you understand that only the basic salary is considered for visa eligibility, and bonuses and commissions are generally not included, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I wasn't aware of that. I thought since the commission was guaranteed it would count toward the total salary for visa purposes. So only the £35,000 base salary would be considered?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct. Only your guaranteed basic gross pay counts. Let me just confirm – are you aware that allowances, bonuses, overtime, and commission are not included when calculating the salary threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that specific rule. I assumed that since the commission is guaranteed in my contract, it would count toward the threshold. That changes things quite a bit if only my £35,000 base salary counts.

[root_agent]: I understand. It’s a common point of confusion. So, just to recap, your base salary is £35,000.  Considering the standard threshold of £41,700, does your base salary meet that requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: No, if only my base salary of £35,000 counts, then I'm below the £41,700 threshold by about £6,700.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Based on this information – your base salary of £35,000, and the requirement of £41,700 – I’m afraid I must advise that you are unlikely to be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa at this time.

Do you have any other questions about the requirements or the assessment process?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. Is there any way I could negotiate with my employer to restructure the offer so that more of the total compensation is in the base salary? Or are there any other visa options that might be available for my situation?

[root_agent]: That’s a perfectly reasonable question. It’s certainly worth exploring options. Regarding negotiating with your employer, it’s possible they could adjust the structure – though it’s down to their decision. As for other visa options, we primarily focus on the Skilled Worker Visa, but there might be other routes depending on your specific circumstances and qualifications. However, I’m unable to advise on those specifically.

To summarize, based on the information we’ve discussed, and the current Skilled Worker Visa requirements, you are unlikely to be eligible at this time.

Would you like me to reiterate any of the information we’ve covered, or perhaps explore any of those other visa options in general terms (though I can’t offer specific advice)?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining everything. I think I understand the situation now. I'll need to talk to my employer about potentially restructuring my compensation package to increase the base salary. I appreciate your help in clarifying the visa requirements.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Julian. I’m glad I could help clarify the requirements for you. It sounds like a productive next step to discuss the compensation package with your employer. If anything else comes up, feel free to reach out.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would not be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa as my base salary of £35,000 falls below the required threshold of £41,700, regardless of my guaranteed commission or performance bonus.
