[evaluation_judge]: I'll help evaluate the agent by role-playing as Priya, a Marketing Manager on a Skilled Worker visa seeking information about my eligibility for extending or changing employers.

Hi, i'm Priya and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Priya, it’s nice to meet you. I’m here to help. To start, could you tell me when you initially obtained your Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been living in the UK on my Skilled Worker visa since 2022. I'm now looking to change employers and want to understand if I'm eligible to continue on the Skilled Worker route.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. So you’ve been living in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022. That’s helpful.

To help me assess your situation, could you confirm whether you held a Skilled Worker visa *before* April 4, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've had my Skilled Worker visa since 2022, so I definitely held it before April 4, 2024.

[root_agent]: Excellent. That’s very important.

Now, could you please tell me what your current role is, and what your salary is currently being offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Marketing Manager, and I have an offer from a new agency for £32,000 per year. The agency has assured me they're a licensed sponsor.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Priya. That’s good to hear about the sponsor.

Considering your salary of £32,000, could you tell me what the standard going rate for a Marketing Manager in the UK is currently?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for Marketing Managers is around £42,000 now. But I've also heard there might be a different rate that applies to people who already had Skilled Worker visas before the recent changes.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying.

Just to confirm, you’re currently being offered £32,000 per year, and we’ve established that the standard going rate is £42,000. 

Could you tell me if your new employer is basing their sponsorship offer on the standard going rate or the lower transitional going rate, which is £30,000?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe they're basing it on the transitional going rate of £30,000, since I already have a Skilled Worker visa from before the rule changes. My offer of £32,000 is above this transitional rate.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Let’s talk about salary thresholds. Could you confirm that your annual salary is £32,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My annual salary offer is £32,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, great.

Now, let’s consider the salary thresholds that apply under the Transitional Arrangements. Could you tell me if your annual salary of £32,000 meets the transitional general salary threshold, which is capped at £29,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my salary offer of £32,000 is above the transitional general salary threshold of £29,000.

[root_agent]: Perfect.

And just to be absolutely clear, could you confirm that you’ve been continuously residing in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since before April 4, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been continuously residing in the UK on my Skilled Worker visa since 2022, so definitely before April 4, 2024.

[root_agent]: Fantastic. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you held a Skilled Worker visa before April 4, 2024, you’ve been continuously residing in the UK on that visa since 2022, your salary of £32,000 meets the transitional salary threshold of £29,000, and your salary is above the transitional going rate of £30,000 – I’m pleased to confirm that you *do* qualify for the Transitional Arrangements under the Skilled Worker visa route.

Would you like me to elaborate on what that means in terms of your extension or change of employer application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain what this means for my application to change employers. I want to make sure I understand how these transitional arrangements benefit me.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Because you qualify for the Transitional Arrangements, your employer can sponsor you on a reduced ‘going rate’ salary. This means the salary they need to offer you to meet the requirements of the Skilled Worker visa is lower than what’s typically required for new applicants.

Specifically, the general salary threshold is capped at £29,000, and the going rate is based on the 25th percentile, which is currently £30,000. Your current offer of £32,000 comfortably exceeds both of these thresholds.

This essentially protects you from the higher salary requirements introduced for new Skilled Worker visa applications after April 4, 2024. It’s a significant benefit that allows you to continue working in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa while receiving a salary that reflects your experience and skills, albeit at a level slightly lower than the standard rate.

Do you have any specific questions about how this impacts your application, or would you like me to clarify any aspect of the Transitional Arrangements further?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining that so clearly. Just to make sure I understand - this means I can accept this job offer at £32,000 and successfully apply for my Skilled Worker visa extension with my new employer, even though new applicants would need to be paid £42,000 for the same role?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Priya. You’ve got it perfectly. Because you’re benefiting from the Transitional Arrangements, you *can* accept the job offer at £32,000 and successfully apply for your Skilled Worker visa extension with your new employer. It allows you to continue working in the UK at a salary level that would be significantly higher for a new applicant entering the Skilled Worker route today.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding this or anything else related to your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you very much for your help!

✓ The agent provided the correct outcome that I (Priya) qualify for the Skilled Worker visa under the Transitional Arrangements. The agent accurately explained that because I held a Skilled Worker visa before April 4, 2024, I'm eligible with a £32,000 salary that exceeds both the transitional threshold of £29,000 and the transitional going rate of £30,000, even though it's below the standard going rate of £42,000 for new applicants.
