[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Javier and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Javier, thank you for reaching out. To start, could you please tell me your date of birth?

[evaluation_judge]: I was born on 1st June 1999.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And could you please confirm the date you submitted your Skilled Worker Visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: I submitted my application on May 30th, 2025.

[root_agent]: Alright. Just to confirm, you submitted your application on May 30th, 2025. And what is your current age?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, today I'm 26 years old. I turned 26 on June 1st, 2025, but when I submitted my application on May 30th, I was still 25.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Javier. Based on the date of your application – May 30th, 2025 – you were 25 years old at that time. Does that information seem correct to you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I was 25 years old when I applied on May 30th, 2025, just two days before my 26th birthday.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Just one more quick question then. What is your current annual salary?

[evaluation_judge]: My current annual salary is £35,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Javier. Let me quickly check the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa…

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks, I appreciate your help in checking this.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! Based on the information you’ve provided – your date of birth, application date, and current salary – it appears you *are* a New Entrant. Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I would like to understand why I qualify as a New Entrant.

[root_agent]: Certainly. To qualify as a New Entrant for the Skilled Worker Visa, you must be under 26 on the *date of application*. You submitted your application on May 30th, 2025, and you were 25 years old at that time. Because you met that age requirement on the application date, and you are claiming the New Entrant discount based on your salary, you are eligible for the 70% salary discount for up to 4 years. Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So even though I turned 26 after I applied, what matters is that I was 25 on the application date. And with my salary of £35,000, I qualify for that New Entrant discount. Thank you for explaining that so clearly.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Javier! I’m glad I could clarify things for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today regarding your Skilled Worker Visa application or any other questions you might have?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that answers my question perfectly. I just wanted to make sure I was eligible given that I turned 26 after submitting my application. It's good to know that my age at the time of application is what matters. Thank you for your help!

[root_agent]: Fantastic! I’m delighted to hear that everything is clear. It was my pleasure assisting you. If you need anything in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for the New Entrant discount because I was under 26 (specifically 25) at the date of application, which is the relevant criteria, even though I turned 26 later when the decision was made.
