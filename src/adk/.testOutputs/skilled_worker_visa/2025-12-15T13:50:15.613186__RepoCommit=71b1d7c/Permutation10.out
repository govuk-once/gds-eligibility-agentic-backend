[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Samuel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Samuel, thanks for letting me know you're looking into your eligibility. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the type of work you’ll be doing as a care assistant? Specifically, are you working with vulnerable adults in a care setting?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been offered a job as an in-home private carer for a wealthy family here in the UK. I'll be caring for an elderly family member who needs assistance with daily activities. I'm from Ghana originally, and a recruitment agency has offered to sponsor my visa. They're offering me £45,000 per year, which seems quite good!

[root_agent]: That’s good to know. And to confirm, you’ll be providing care directly within the family’s home, rather than in a care home or hospital setting?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'll be working directly in the family's home, providing one-on-one care to their elderly family member. The recruitment agency is arranging everything and handling the visa sponsorship.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Just to be absolutely clear, this recruitment agency is acting as an introduction service and isn’t directly providing the care itself, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, exactly. The recruitment agency is just connecting me with the family and handling the visa sponsorship. They're not directly providing the care services themselves - I would be employed directly by the family to work in their home. The agency mentioned they have a sponsorship license but I don't think they're registered with any care regulator, they just help match carers with families who need help.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that detail, Samuel. Just one more question regarding the care itself – are you planning to be providing care as a Care Worker (as defined by occupational code 6135) or a Senior Care Worker (as defined by occupational code 6136)?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working as a Care Worker, so that would be occupational code 6135. I'll be helping with things like personal care, meals, medication reminders, and companionship for the elderly family member.

[root_agent]: Okay, Samuel. Thank you for that information. Now, let’s talk about your employer. Could you tell me whether the family you’ll be working for, or the recruitment agency, are registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC)?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't think either of them are registered with the Care Quality Commission. The recruitment agency just acts as an introduction service, and the family is just a private household needing care for their elderly relative. They're not a care company or anything like that.

[root_agent]: Okay, Samuel. Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you've provided – that you're a Care Worker (code 6135) being employed directly by a private household, and that neither the household nor the recruitment agency is registered with the CQC – I must advise that this application is **REFUSED**. The Skilled Worker Visa route requires the employer to be CQC registered to protect workers from exploitation, and this arrangement doesn't meet that criteria.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I would be refused a skilled worker visa. They correctly identified that despite the high salary and valid sponsorship license, the employer must be CQC registered for care workers, which neither the family nor the recruitment agency are.
