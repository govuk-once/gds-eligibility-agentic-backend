[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ravi and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Ravi, thank you for reaching out. It’s great to connect with you. To start figuring out your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you tell me a little bit about your current role at Bank Corp? Specifically, what are your primary responsibilities as a System Administrator?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm actually not working at Bank Corp yet. I have a job offer from TechRecruit Ltd as a System Administrator, but I'll be working full-time at Bank Corp, which is their client. I'd be based entirely at Bank Corp's location, reporting to Bank Corp managers. TechRecruit is offering me £50,000 for the position. I'm from India and trying to understand if I can get a Skilled Worker visa for this arrangement.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Ravi. That’s very helpful. Just to be clear, TechRecruit Ltd is essentially providing you as a worker to Bank Corp, who are the client, and you'll be working exclusively at Bank Corp’s premises, reporting to their managers?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. TechRecruit Ltd is my potential employer on paper, but I'd be working 100% at Bank Corp's premises and reporting directly to Bank Corp's managers on a day-to-day basis. This seems to be a long-term arrangement - I'd be working there indefinitely. TechRecruit specializes in providing IT professionals to different companies.

[root_agent]: Okay, Ravi, thank you for confirming that. Let me ask this then: Does TechRecruit Ltd retain full responsibility for the duties and tasks you would be performing at Bank Corp, or would Bank Corp have a significant say in how you carry out your work?

[evaluation_judge]: Bank Corp would have significant say in how I carry out my work. Since I'd be reporting directly to Bank Corp managers, they'd be the ones assigning me tasks, setting priorities, and evaluating my performance. TechRecruit would handle my payroll and formal employment matters, but the day-to-day management of my work would be entirely under Bank Corp's control. TechRecruit essentially placed me there but wouldn't be involved in what work I do or how I do it.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi. That’s really important information. Based on what you’ve told me – that TechRecruit is essentially acting as a recruitment agency supplying you to Bank Corp, and Bank Corp has significant control over your day-to-day work – I'm concerned about the potential impact on your visa eligibility. 

Could you tell me, does TechRecruit Ltd have a significant number of clients that they supply IT professionals to, or is this a more focused operation?

[evaluation_judge]: TechRecruit definitely has a significant number of clients they supply IT professionals to. They're basically an IT staffing and consulting company that places tech professionals with various clients across different industries. They have a large roster of clients including banks, retail companies, healthcare organizations, and other businesses needing IT support. They recruit people with IT skills like me and then place us with these client companies based on their staffing needs. This is their standard business model - they have dozens of consultants working at different client sites across the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Ravi. I understand now that TechRecruit operates as a staffing agency placing consultants with various clients.

Given this information, and the fact that you’ll be working under the direct control and management of Bank Corp’s managers, I need to advise you that this arrangement could potentially violate the rules regarding “contracting out.” The Home Office may view TechRecruit as simply supplying labour to a third party, rather than being the actual employer.

Therefore, I’m afraid I must advise that, based on the information you’ve provided, it’s unlikely you would be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa in this arrangement. 

**REFUSED.** The Home Office would likely determine that TechRecruit is not the entity requiring the role, but is merely supplying labour to a third party.

Do you have any questions about this assessment, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my work arrangement violates the "contracting out" rule since TechRecruit is merely supplying me as labor to Bank Corp where I would be working 100% of the time under their management. The agent accurately concluded I would be refused a Skilled Worker visa, matching the expected outcome.
