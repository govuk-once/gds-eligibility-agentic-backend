[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Liam, it’s great to speak with you. To start, could you confirm if there is a valid sponsor for this job opportunity?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a valid sponsor for the job. I'm a 23-year-old graduate from Canada who just finished my Bachelor's degree here in the UK on a Student Visa, and I've been offered a Junior Financial Analyst position.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now, let’s talk about the job itself. Can you tell me what skill level this Junior Financial Analyst role falls under, according to your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe it falls under the required skill level for a work visa. My potential employer has confirmed that the Junior Financial Analyst position meets the skill level requirements for sponsorship.

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear. To help me understand the specifics, could you please confirm the standard going rate for a Junior Financial Analyst role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: The standard going rate for my Junior Financial Analyst role is £42,000 per year. However, my offer is for £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for providing that information. And just to confirm, are you under 26 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm 23 years old.

[root_agent]: Great. Now, let’s consider your background. You recently finished your Bachelor’s degree in the UK on a Student Visa. Does that qualify you as a ‘New Entrant’ as defined by the Skilled Worker visa rules?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe I qualify as a 'New Entrant' since I'm under 26 years old and I'm switching from a Student Visa after completing my Bachelor's degree in the UK.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Let’s move on to a final check regarding your salary. Could you confirm your annual salary offer?

[evaluation_judge]: My salary offer is £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. One moment while I assess the information…

Based on the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa – New Entrant – you meet all the requirements. You are under 26, a recent graduate, and your salary of £35,000 meets the minimum threshold of £33,400, and is also higher than 70% of the standard going rate (£29,400).

**AWARDED.** You qualify as a New Entrant.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I qualify for the Skilled Worker visa as a New Entrant. They accurately noted that my £35,000 salary exceeds both the lower general threshold (£33,400) and 70% of the going rate (£29,400).
