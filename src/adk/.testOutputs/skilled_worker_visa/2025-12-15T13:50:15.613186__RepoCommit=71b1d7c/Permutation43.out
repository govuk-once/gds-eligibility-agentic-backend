[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Diego and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Diego, thanks for letting me know you're looking for information. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the reason for your proposed travel – what are you hoping to experience in South America?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Software Developer working in the UK on a sponsored visa. My company has agreed to let me take a 2-month unpaid sabbatical to travel through South America. It's always been a dream of mine to explore countries like Peru, Colombia, and Brazil. I just want to make sure this won't affect my visa status before I finalize my plans.

[root_agent]: That sounds like an amazing trip! To help me understand your situation fully, could you tell me approximately when you’re planning to take this 2-month sabbatical? Specifically, what month would you be leaving the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm planning to take the sabbatical starting in July and returning in September. My company has already approved holding my position for me during this time, but I just wanted to check if this unpaid leave would affect my visa status since I'm on a sponsored work visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, July to September. Just to confirm, is this 2-month period – July and August – considered as a single block of unpaid leave, or will it be broken up into shorter periods?

[evaluation_judge]: It will be a single block of unpaid leave - a continuous 2-month period from early July through early September. My employer has approved it as one continuous sabbatical.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Now, let’s talk about the leave itself. Can you tell me, is this leave considered “statutory” – meaning related to illness or maternity/paternity leave – or is it for a different reason, such as personal travel?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's not statutory leave. It's just personal leave for travel purposes - what my company is calling a sabbatical. It's completely for my personal interest in exploring South America. It's not related to illness, maternity/paternity, or any other statutory reason.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Just one more question regarding the length of the leave: Approximately how many weeks will this 2-month period represent?

[evaluation_judge]: It would be about 8-9 weeks in total. I plan to leave in the first week of July and return in the first week of September.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Diego. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re taking an 8-9 week period of unpaid leave, it’s *not* statutory, and it’s a continuous block – the criteria for Skilled Worker Visa sponsorship states that absences exceeding 4 weeks in a calendar year will result in sponsorship withdrawal.

Therefore, I must advise you that **SPONSORSHIP WITHDRAWAL** is likely to occur. Your employer would be legally required to stop sponsoring your visa once this leave exceeds 4 weeks. Your visa will be curtailed to 60 days, and you’ll need to either leave the UK or find alternative employment before it expires.

Do you have any questions about this outcome, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: So if I take this 8-9 week sabbatical, my employer would have to withdraw sponsorship of my visa? Would that happen immediately after the 4 weeks? What would happen to my job - even though my employer wants to hold my position for me?

[root_agent]: That’s a very important question, Diego. Let’s address both points.

Regarding the timing, the sponsorship withdrawal wouldn’t necessarily happen *immediately* after 4 weeks. The rules state that the withdrawal occurs if the absence exceeds 4 weeks *within a calendar year*. So, if you return before the end of December, the withdrawal would be triggered. However, if you return in January, the previous year’s absence would still count towards the 4-week limit.

Now, concerning your job – even though your employer has agreed to hold your position, the *sponsor* (your employer) is the one legally obligated to maintain your sponsorship. While they might be willing to continue holding the position for you, they are not legally required to do so beyond the 4-week limit. They would still need to formally notify the Home Office of the sponsorship withdrawal.

Does that clarify things a bit better? Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this process, such as the formal notification procedure?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that clarifies it. So even though my employer is happy for me to take the leave and return to my job, they're actually required by law to withdraw my visa sponsorship once I exceed 4 weeks of unpaid leave? And then my visa would be curtailed to 60 days, during which time I'd need to either leave the UK or find another sponsor?

[root_agent]: Exactly, Diego. You’ve summarized it perfectly. Your employer’s willingness to hold your position is separate from the legal requirement for the sponsor (your employer) to withdraw the visa sponsorship. The Home Office’s rules regarding unpaid leave and sponsorship are strictly enforced, and exceeding 4 weeks triggers the withdrawal process, resulting in a curtailed visa allowing only 60 days remaining.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this situation, perhaps looking at options for finding a new sponsor or understanding the timeframe for the curtailed visa?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I understand now. I'll need to reconsider my travel plans since I don't want to lose my visa sponsorship. I might look into taking a shorter trip or perhaps using my paid annual leave instead. Thanks for explaining this to me - you've definitely helped me avoid a potentially serious problem with my immigration status.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Diego. I’m glad I could help you gain a clearer understanding of the situation and avoid any potential issues with your visa. It’s always best to be informed about these regulations. 

Wishing you all the best as you reconsider your travel plans – and enjoy your time in South America when you do! If anything else comes up in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that taking an 8-9 week unpaid sabbatical would exceed the 4-week limit for unpaid leave and result in sponsorship withdrawal, with my visa being curtailed to 60 days. This matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
