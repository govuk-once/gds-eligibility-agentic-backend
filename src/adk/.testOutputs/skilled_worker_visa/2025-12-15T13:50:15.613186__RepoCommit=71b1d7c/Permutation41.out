[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Ken, a marketing lead looking for information about his visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Ken and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Ken, it’s great to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and determine your eligibility, could you tell me a little bit about the job you're applying for and the company sponsoring your visa? Specifically, could you describe your role and the type of company you work for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently a marketing lead, and I've been offered a position at a large multinational bank here in the UK. They've already sponsored me and assigned a Certificate of Sponsorship. I'm just a bit concerned because I overheard something about them possibly making a mistake with my application. They mentioned something about listing themselves as a "small" company in the system when they're obviously a large multinational. I want to make sure everything is in order before I proceed further with my visa application.

[root_agent]: Okay, Ken, thank you for clarifying that. That’s very helpful information. Just to be absolutely clear, you’ve already received a Certificate of Sponsorship from this multinational bank, correct? And you’re concerned about the possibility that they might have incorrectly categorized their company size when submitting the sponsorship details?

Could you tell me, do you know how the bank is currently categorized within the Home Office’s sponsorship system – are they listed as a ‘Small’ or ‘Large’ employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right - I already have the Certificate of Sponsorship from the multinational bank. And yes, I'm concerned because I'm pretty certain they incorrectly categorized themselves as a 'Small' employer in the Home Office system. I saw some paperwork that showed they paid the Immigration Skills Charge at the small company rate (around £364 per year) instead of what I believe should be the large company rate (which I think is about £1,000 per year). I'm just worried this might affect my visa application.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that detail, Ken. It sounds like there might be an issue with the Immigration Skills Charge being paid. To help me understand the situation fully, could you tell me – do you know whether the bank has actually made the payment for the Immigration Skills Charge?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they have made the payment for the Immigration Skills Charge, but they paid the small company rate of around £364 per year rather than the large company rate of about £1,000 per year. The HR admin mentioned they did this to save money, but I'm worried this isn't the correct approach since they're definitely a large multinational bank with hundreds of employees globally.

[root_agent]: Okay, Ken, thank you for clarifying. It’s good to know they’ve made the payment. Given that the bank categorized themselves as a ‘Small’ employer and paid the corresponding Immigration Skills Charge, I’m afraid I have to inform you that the sponsorship is likely invalid.

The Home Office requires the correct Immigration Skills Charge – the amount due based on the employer's size – to be paid. Since the payment was made at the incorrect rate, the sponsorship is considered invalid, and your visa application would likely be refused.

Do you have any questions about this outcome, or would you like me to explain anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so my visa application would likely be refused because they paid the wrong rate? That's very concerning. Is there anything that can be done to fix this situation? Would they have an opportunity to pay the difference, or is it an automatic refusal?

[root_agent]: You’re right to be concerned, Ken. Unfortunately, with the Immigration Skills Charge, once an incorrect amount has been paid, it’s generally a difficult situation to rectify. 

Typically, the Home Office will contact the sponsor to request a ‘top-up’ payment to cover the difference between the correct rate and the amount already paid. However, if the sponsor does not pay this top-up payment within 10 working days, the visa application will be refused.

Essentially, there’s no guarantee that they will be able to make the required adjustment within that timeframe. 

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official guidance on the Immigration Skills Charge, just for your reference: [https://www.gov.uk/immigration-skills-charge](https://www.gov.uk/immigration-skills-charge)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, a link to the official guidance would be helpful, thank you. So there is a chance to fix this if the bank pays the top-up within 10 working days when the Home Office contacts them? That's at least some hope. Do you know if I should notify my HR department about this issue right away so they can be prepared to make the additional payment quickly when contacted?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good point, Ken, and it’s wise to consider proactively informing your HR department. Yes, there is a chance to fix this – as long as the sponsor makes the top-up payment within those 10 working days.

It would absolutely be beneficial to notify your HR department immediately so they can be prepared to handle any communication from the Home Office and facilitate the payment promptly. Keeping them in the loop will help ensure a quicker resolution.

Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding this situation, or would you like me to reiterate any information for clarity?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for confirming. I'll contact my HR department right away to let them know about this issue so they can be prepared to make the top-up payment when contacted by the Home Office. I appreciate the clarification about my situation. I think I understand now - my application is at risk of refusal due to the incorrect Immigration Skills Charge payment, but there's a chance to fix it if the bank responds quickly with the additional payment when notified. That covers my questions for now.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Ken. I’m glad I could clarify the situation for you. It sounds like you’re taking the right steps to address this issue. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns as you move forward.

Wishing you the best of luck with your visa application!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the help and the well wishes. I'll reach out again if I have any further questions.

✓ The agent correctly identified that the application would be invalid/refused because the sponsor underpaid the Immigration Skills Charge by incorrectly categorizing themselves as a small company. The agent also accurately explained that the Home Office would contact the sponsor for a top-up payment that must be made within 10 working days, which aligns with the expected outcome in the scenario.
