[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Yara in this scenario, who is inquiring about her eligibility to use an expired SELT test for a new visa application.

Hi, i'm Yara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Yara, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help! 

To start, could you tell me which benefit you are inquiring about?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in finding out if I can use my previous English language test for my new visa application. I passed a B1 SELT about 4 years ago when I was on a Student Visa in the UK. Now I'm applying for a Skilled Worker visa from abroad, and I'm wondering if I can reuse my old test results even though they've expired.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's very helpful to know, Yara. Thank you for explaining your situation.

First, just to confirm – is the English language test you took 4 years ago a Secure English Language Test (SELT)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it was definitely a Secure English Language Test (SELT). I took it for my previous Student Visa application which was successful. I still have the reference number from that test if that's important.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, thank you. And you mentioned it was used for a successful Student Visa application – can you confirm that it *was* a successful application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it was a successful application. I used the B1 SELT test for my Student Visa application, which was approved, and I studied in the UK on that visa without any issues. The visa itself has now ended, which is why I'm applying for the Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Yara. 

To clarify, is the level of English demonstrated on the SELT test B1, as you mentioned previously? This is a requirement for the Skilled Worker visa.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the level of English demonstrated on my SELT test was B1. That's what was required for my Student Visa at the time, and I passed it successfully.

[root_agent]: Excellent. One final question for now, Yara. 

You mentioned the test is around 4 years old - so, to be certain, is the test currently expired? (SELT tests are generally valid for 2 years).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the test is currently expired. It's been about 4 years since I took it, and I know they typically are only valid for 2 years. That's why I was concerned about whether I could use it again for my new Skilled Worker visa application.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so thorough, Yara. 

Based on the information you've provided – the test is expired, but was used for a previous successful UK visa application (your Student Visa) and is at the B1 level – it appears you *are* eligible to use it for your Skilled Worker visa application. There's an exception to the expiry rule if it was previously used for a successful visa.



Does that answer your question?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that answers my question perfectly. I was really worried about having to take another test, so this is great news. So to be clear, even though my B1 SELT test is about 4 years old now, I can still use it for my Skilled Worker visa application because I used it successfully for my Student Visa before. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Yara. That is exactly right! Even though your B1 SELT test is now expired, you can still use it for your Skilled Worker visa application because you successfully used it for your previous Student Visa.

I'm very glad I could help put your mind at ease. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's wonderful news! No, I think that's all I needed to know. Thank you so much for clarifying this for me. I'll go ahead with my application using my previous SELT test results.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Yara! I'm delighted I could help. 

I wish you all the best with your Skilled Worker visa application. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.



Have a lovely day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly advised that I can use my expired B1 SELT test for my new Skilled Worker visa application due to the "previous use" exception, which matches the expected outcome of "AWARDED" in the scenario.
