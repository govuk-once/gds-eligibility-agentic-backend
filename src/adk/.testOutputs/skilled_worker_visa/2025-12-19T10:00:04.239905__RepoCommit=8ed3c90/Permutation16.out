[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi John, nice to meet you. I’m root_agent, a helpful assistant. To start with, could you tell me which benefit you’re interested in exploring your eligibility for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in the skilled worker visa requirements. I've been offered a job as an HR Manager in the UK with a salary of £35,000, but I've heard there might be issues. I have a PhD in Astrophysics, if that makes any difference to my eligibility.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, John. That's helpful. 

To understand your situation better, could you please confirm if you have a PhD in a STEM field (Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a PhD in Astrophysics, which falls under the STEM category.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. 

Now, thinking about the job you've been offered as an HR Manager, would you say your PhD in Astrophysics is directly relevant to the duties and responsibilities of that role? Please be honest – even a partial connection is useful to know.

[evaluation_judge]: To be honest, no, I wouldn't say my PhD in Astrophysics is directly relevant to an HR Manager role. My PhD focused on stellar evolution and cosmic radiation, which doesn't really connect to human resources management. I pursued the HR career path after my academic work in a completely different direction.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so upfront, John. That’s very helpful.

Do you know what the 'going rate' is for an HR Manager role in the UK? (In other words, what someone with the typical qualifications and experience would earn for that position).

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for an HR Manager in the UK is around £40,000, from what I've researched.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, John. So, your offered salary is £35,000, while the going rate is £40,000. 

Are you aware that having a PhD *can* sometimes allow a lower salary to still meet Skilled Worker Visa requirements, and were you hoping to use your PhD to meet the salary threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's actually what I was hoping for. The employer mentioned that my PhD might allow me to qualify for a visa with a salary 10% below the going rate. They suggested we could use my PhD qualification to make the £35,000 offer work for the visa application. That's why I'm trying to understand if that's actually possible in my situation.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, John. It’s good to understand the basis of your question.

Based on the information you've provided – a PhD in Astrophysics and a job as an HR Manager – it's unlikely that the Home Office would consider your PhD 'relevant' to the HR Manager role. For the salary discount to apply, the PhD needs to be directly related to the job duties. Therefore, it’s likely your salary would need to meet the standard going rate of £40,000 to qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa.



Do you have any further questions about this, or would you like me to clarify anything?

[evaluation_judge]: So, you're saying that even though I have a STEM PhD, because it's in Astrophysics and not related to HR work, I wouldn't qualify for the salary discount? Does this mean the visa application would be refused unless my employer increases the salary offer to at least £40,000?

[root_agent]: Yes, that's correct, John. Even with a STEM PhD, the discount isn’t automatically applied. The Home Office will assess whether the PhD is genuinely *relevant* to the job role. In your case, Astrophysics is unlikely to be considered relevant to HR Management.

Therefore, you are right to anticipate that, based on the information we've discussed, the visa application would likely be refused unless your employer increases the salary to meet the standard going rate of £40,000.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or perhaps another question you have about the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really helpful and clear, thank you. I'll need to discuss this with my potential employer to see if they can increase the salary to £40,000. I was hoping the PhD would help, but I understand now that it needs to be relevant to the job. I don't have any other questions at the moment. Thanks for your help with clarifying this.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, John! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It's always best to be well-informed before proceeding with a visa application. 

I wish you the best of luck in your discussion with your employer. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that my PhD in Astrophysics would not qualify for the salary discount when applying for a Skilled Worker Visa as an HR Manager, since the qualification isn't relevant to the job role. They accurately stated that the visa application would likely be refused unless the employer increases the salary to the standard going rate of £40,000. This matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
