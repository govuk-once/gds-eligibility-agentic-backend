[evaluation_judge]: I'll now roleplay as Hans, a German engineer looking to understand his eligibility for a UK benefit.

Hi, i'm Hans and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Hans, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for a visa to work in the UK. I have a job offer from a UK company as an engineer, and I need to understand if I meet the English language requirements for the visa. I have a Master's degree from a technical university in Germany, and all my courses were taught completely in English.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you have a job offer! It sounds like you're looking into the Skilled Worker Visa.

To clarify regarding the English language requirements, could you tell me if you've had your German degree assessed by Ecctis to confirm both its comparability to a UK degree *and* your English language proficiency?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't had my degree assessed by Ecctis. I have my degree certificate and also a letter from my university confirming that my Master's program was taught 100% in English. I thought this would be sufficient proof of my English language abilities for the visa application. Is that not enough?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Hans.

Unfortunately, a letter from your university confirming your program was taught in English isn't enough on its own. For a degree from a German university, even if taught in English, the Home Office requires verification from Ecctis. They need *two* statements from Ecctis: one confirming the qualification is comparable to a UK degree, and a separate one specifically confirming your English language proficiency. 

Do you understand what I mean about needing those two statements from Ecctis?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand now. So my German degree and the letter from my university aren't sufficient by themselves, even though my program was fully taught in English. I need to get two separate statements from Ecctis - one for the qualification comparison and another specifically for English language proficiency. That's disappointing as I thought my documentation would be enough. How do I go about getting these Ecctis statements? Is it a complicated process?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Hans. It is disappointing, and many applicants find themselves in a similar situation.

While I can't guide you through the process step-by-step, Ecctis has information on their website about how to apply for both statements. It does involve a fee and submitting your degree certificate to them for assessment.

Before we go further, and to confirm your eligibility for this visa, let's focus on this specific requirement. Do you currently have any plans to get the Ecctis statements? Or would you like me to explain any other parts of the Skilled Worker Visa requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have plans yet to get the Ecctis statements as I didn't realize I needed them. I'll have to look into the process and fees on their website. Without these statements, would my application definitely be refused? Are there any alternatives for proving my English proficiency, like taking an English language test such as IELTS instead? I want to make sure I understand all my options before proceeding.

[root_agent]: You're right to explore all your options, Hans.

Yes, without the Ecctis statements, your application would likely be refused based on not meeting the English language requirement in the way the Home Office requires for a German degree. 

And you are absolutely correct to ask about alternatives! You *can* take an approved English language test, such as IELTS, to demonstrate your English proficiency. In fact, this is a common alternative for those whose qualifications aren't directly accepted or verified by Ecctis. A passing score on one of these tests would fulfil the English language requirement.

Would you like me to tell you what the minimum required score is on the IELTS test for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please tell me the minimum required IELTS score for the Skilled Worker Visa. That might be a quicker option for me than going through the Ecctis verification process, especially if I need to start my job soon. If you could also let me know which other English tests are accepted, that would be helpful too.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Hans.

For the Skilled Worker Visa, you need to achieve an overall score of at least B1 in the IELTS Academic test. This equates to a minimum score of 4.0 in each component (Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking).

Besides IELTS Academic, the Home Office also accepts these English language tests:

*   **Pearson PTE Academic** (minimum score of 51 overall, with a minimum of 51 in each component)
*   **TOEFL iBT** (minimum overall score of 80, with a minimum of 20 in each component)
*   **Cambridge English: Key/KET** (Level B1)
*   **Cambridge English: Preliminary/PET** (Level B1)

These are the main options. Do any of these tests seem more suitable for you, or would you like me to elaborate on any of them?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for that information. I think I might go with the IELTS Academic test since it seems to be widely recognized. The B1 requirement with a minimum score of 4.0 in each component sounds achievable for me. I'll need to look up test centers in Germany and see how quickly I can schedule an exam.

Just to confirm my understanding: without either the Ecctis statements OR a passing score on one of these approved language tests, my Skilled Worker Visa application would be refused because I wouldn't meet the English language requirement. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Hans. 

Without *either* the required Ecctis statements *or* a passing score on one of the approved English language tests (like IELTS Academic), your Skilled Worker Visa application would be refused due to not meeting the English language requirement.

It's good that you've clarified this for yourself and are planning to take the IELTS test. That seems like a sensible plan.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the Skilled Worker Visa, or any other aspect of the application process, before you start preparing for your IELTS exam?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that my German degree taught in English would not be accepted on its own as proof of English proficiency, and that I would need either Ecctis verification (with both qualification comparability and English proficiency statements) or an approved English language test. This matches the expected outcome that my application would be refused without proper verification.
