[evaluation_judge]: I'll help evaluate the agent by taking on the role of Katarina with a zero-hours contract job offer.

Hi, i'm Katarina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Katarina, it's lovely to meet you! I'm root_agent, and I'm here to help.

To start, could you tell me what type of job you have been offered?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I've been offered a waitress job at a high-end event venue. It seems like quite a good opportunity as the pay is £20 per hour, which is much better than my previous jobs. They've told me they expect me to work about 40 hours a week.

[root_agent]: That sounds like a promising opportunity, Katarina! £20 per hour is a good rate.

To understand your eligibility, could you please tell me what type of contract you have with this event venue? For example, is it a full-time, part-time, or zero-hour contract?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a zero-hours contract. The venue manager said they expect I'll be working 40 hours a week regularly because they host many events, but it's officially a zero-hours contract. They gave me a letter stating they expect me to work those hours, which would amount to about £41,600 annually.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Katarina. A zero-hours contract is important to know. 

To confirm, does the contract *guarantee* a minimum number of hours per week or year, or is it simply an expectation of 40 hours per week?

[evaluation_judge]: No, there's no guarantee of minimum hours - that's why it's a zero-hours contract. The manager just told me they "expect" I'll get about 40 hours weekly based on their event schedule, but nothing is actually guaranteed in writing. The letter they provided mentions the expectation of hours but doesn't guarantee them.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so clear, Katarina. That's very helpful.

Just to be certain, is the £41,600 figure a guaranteed annual salary stated *within* the contract itself, or is it simply a calculation based on the expected 40 hours per week that the venue manager mentioned?

[evaluation_judge]: It's definitely not a guaranteed annual salary. It's just a calculation based on the expected 40 hours per week at £20 per hour. The contract itself doesn't guarantee any specific annual amount or even weekly hours - that's the nature of the zero-hours arrangement. The letter they gave me mentions this expected figure of £41,600, but there's nothing binding about it.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Katarina. I appreciate your honesty and thoroughness.

To help me assess your eligibility, are you applying for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm applying for the Skilled Worker Visa to come work at this venue. My employer said they would sponsor me, and they mentioned that the job pays well enough to qualify. They seemed to think the expected earnings of £41,600 would be sufficient for the visa requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming you are applying for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Based on the information you've provided, and specifically the fact that your contract is a zero-hours contract with no guaranteed minimum hours, I need to inform you that your application may be refused. The Skilled Worker Visa requires a guaranteed minimum salary, and earnings based on expected hours from a zero-hours contract do not meet this requirement, even if the hourly rate is high.



Would you like me to explain this in a bit more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain more. This is quite disappointing to hear. My potential employer seemed confident that the high hourly rate and their expectation of steady work would be enough. Why exactly is my zero-hours contract a problem?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Katarina, and I'm happy to explain further.

The Skilled Worker Visa has specific requirements around salary, and it’s not simply about the hourly rate. The Home Office needs to see a *guaranteed* salary that meets a certain threshold. This guarantee comes from a contract that specifies a minimum number of hours you will be working and, therefore, a minimum amount of money you will earn each year.

With a zero-hours contract, your employer isn't committing to providing you with any specific number of hours. While they *expect* you to work 40 hours a week, and that calculates to £41,600 a year, that’s just an expectation - not a legal guarantee. The Home Office cannot rely on expected earnings, as they need to be certain you will consistently meet the minimum salary requirements. 

Essentially, the Home Office needs assurance that you will earn enough *every year*, and a zero-hours contract doesn't provide that assurance. It’s designed to be flexible for the employer, which unfortunately makes it unsuitable for Skilled Worker Visa sponsorship.



Does that make the situation clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make it much clearer, thank you. So even though the hourly rate is good, without guaranteed hours there's no guaranteed annual salary, which is what the Home Office needs to see. I'm surprised my employer didn't know this when they offered to sponsor me. 

Is there any way around this? Would it help if they changed my contract to guarantee a minimum number of hours instead of the zero-hours arrangement?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Katarina. I'm glad I could clarify the situation. It's definitely unfortunate that your employer wasn't aware of this specific requirement.

You are absolutely right to ask about changing the contract! If your employer were to offer you a contract that *guarantees* a minimum number of hours each week or year – enough to meet the minimum salary threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa – that *would* potentially make you eligible. 

The key is the word "guaranteed" within the contract itself. It needs to be a legally binding commitment from the employer to provide you with a certain level of work and pay. Simply stating an expectation isn’t enough.

You should discuss this with your employer and see if they are willing to amend the contract to provide that guarantee. If they do, you should review the revised contract carefully to ensure it meets the visa requirements.



Would you like me to provide you with a link to the government website detailing the current salary thresholds for the Skilled Worker Visa, so you can see exactly what needs to be met?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would appreciate that link to the government website with the salary thresholds. I think I'll need to go back to my employer with all this information and see if they're willing to offer me a proper contract with guaranteed hours. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I had no idea a zero-hours contract would be such a problem for the visa application.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Katarina! I'm happy I could help.

Here is the link to the government website page detailing the current salary thresholds for the Skilled Worker Visa: https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa#salary-requirements

Please review the information carefully, and don’t hesitate to ask if you have any further questions after discussing it with your employer. I truly hope they are able to offer you a contract with guaranteed hours, allowing you to pursue your visa application.

I wish you the best of luck! Do feel free to reach out if you need further assistance in the future.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that a Skilled Worker Visa application with a zero-hours contract would be refused because it doesn't provide a guaranteed salary, which matches the expected outcome. The agent accurately explained that the Home Office requires guaranteed earnings rather than expected earnings, even with a high hourly rate.
