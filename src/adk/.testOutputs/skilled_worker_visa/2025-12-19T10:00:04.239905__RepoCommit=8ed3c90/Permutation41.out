[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Ken, a marketing lead looking for information about benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Ken and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ken, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me what type of visa you are applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm applying for a UK work visa. I've been offered a marketing lead position at a large multinational bank, and they've sponsored me for a Skilled Worker visa. They've already assigned a Certificate of Sponsorship to me, so I'm just trying to figure out if I'll be eligible before I submit my application.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's great to hear you have a Certificate of Sponsorship already! That's a very positive step.

To help me assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa, could you please confirm if your sponsoring bank is considered a 'small' or 'large' company? This relates to a charge they need to pay to sponsor you.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe they've categorized themselves as a 'small' company on the sponsorship paperwork. That seemed a bit odd to me since they're definitely a large multinational bank with offices all over the world and thousands of employees. But their HR person mentioned something about paying the lower Immigration Skills Charge rate of £364 per year rather than the higher rate. I'm just hoping everything is in order with my application.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Ken. It's good you flagged that as potentially odd – it’s right to be cautious.

To clarify, are you aware if your sponsor has paid the Immigration Skills Charge (ISC) associated with your Certificate of Sponsorship? Even if they’ve categorized themselves as a ‘small’ company, there’s a specific amount they need to pay.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my contact at the HR department mentioned they've paid the Immigration Skills Charge, but at the 'small company' rate of £364 per year, rather than the rate for large companies. I know they've definitely paid something, but I'm concerned if they've paid the correct amount given they're clearly a large multinational bank.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Ken. 

Based on the information you've provided, it appears there may be an issue with the validity of your sponsorship. If a large company incorrectly pays the lower 'small company' rate for the Immigration Skills Charge, it can unfortunately lead to a refusal of the visa.

Do you have any further information about the company’s turnover or number of employees, just to confirm this situation? It might be useful if you could gently ask your HR contact for this information.





[evaluation_judge]: I know the bank has thousands of employees globally, well over the 50-employee threshold for being considered a large company. Their annual turnover is definitely in the billions, not anywhere near small company levels. I'm quite worried now - do you think my visa application will be refused? Is there anything that can be done to fix this situation, or is it too late since they've already assigned the Certificate of Sponsorship?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Ken. Given the information about the bank’s size and turnover, it does strongly suggest your sponsor *should* be paying the higher Immigration Skills Charge rate.

Unfortunately, it does appear your application is at risk of being **INVALID / REFUSED**. The Home Office typically contacts the sponsor to request a ‘top-up’ payment to cover the difference. If the sponsor doesn’t pay within 10 working days, the visa application is usually refused.

It’s not too late to try and rectify the situation. Your sponsor needs to contact the Home Office immediately to explain the error and arrange to pay the correct amount. They will need to provide evidence to prove they meet the criteria for a large company. 

I recommend you politely but firmly encourage your HR contact to address this urgently. It’s in everyone's best interest to resolve this before you submit your full application.



Would you like me to summarise the situation for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please summarize the situation for me so I understand clearly what's happening and what needs to be done.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ken. Here's a summary of the situation:

You are applying for a Skilled Worker visa sponsored by a large multinational bank. While the job itself is eligible and you have a Certificate of Sponsorship, there’s a potential problem with the Immigration Skills Charge (ISC) your sponsor has paid.

Your sponsor incorrectly categorized themselves as a ‘small’ company and paid the lower ISC rate of £364 per year, instead of the higher rate for large companies. This is an error because the bank clearly meets the criteria to be considered a large company (thousands of employees and billions in annual turnover).

**This error means your sponsorship is currently not valid**, and your visa application is at high risk of being **INVALID / REFUSED**.

**What needs to happen:**

Your sponsoring bank *must* contact the Home Office urgently to:

1.  Acknowledge the error.
2.  Explain that they are a large company.
3.  Arrange to pay the difference in the ISC.

If they don’t resolve this within 10 working days of being contacted by the Home Office, your visa application will likely be refused.

Essentially, the issue needs to be fixed by your sponsor *before* your application is fully processed. Does that make everything clear?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that the sponsorship is invalid because the multinational bank incorrectly categorized itself as a "small" company and underpaid the Immigration Skills Charge. They accurately stated that this would lead to the visa application being refused if not corrected, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
