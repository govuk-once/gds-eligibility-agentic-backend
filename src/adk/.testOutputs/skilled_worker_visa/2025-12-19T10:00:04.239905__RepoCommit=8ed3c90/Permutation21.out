[evaluation_judge]: I'll simulate a conversation with this hypothetical UK benefits eligibility agent as "Leo" from the given scenario.

Hi, i'm Leo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Leo, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for UK benefits.

To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in finding out if I can switch from my Student visa to a Skilled Worker visa. I'm currently studying for my Master's degree, but I've received a job offer starting in January 2026 as a Marketing Executive. My course is supposed to end in September 2026, but I'd like to take this job opportunity.

[root_agent]: That's great you've received a job offer, Leo! To assess your eligibility to switch to a Skilled Worker visa, could you please confirm when your current course of study is scheduled to be completed?

[evaluation_judge]: My course is scheduled to be completed in September 2026. I'm currently in the middle of my Master's program - it's December 2025 now, so I've only finished about half of my degree.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Leo. 

Just to clarify, are you currently studying for a PhD, or a different type of degree?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm studying for a Master's degree, not a PhD.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Leo. And to confirm, the job offer you have is for a start date in January 2026, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The job offer for the Marketing Executive position has a start date in January 2026.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming all of that, Leo.

Based on the information you’ve provided, unfortunately you would currently **not** be eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa from within the UK. As you are still in the middle of your Master's degree, and your course isn't scheduled to finish until September 2026, you haven't yet completed your studies. 

Would you like me to explain this in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'd appreciate more details about why I can't switch and if there are any other options available to me.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Leo. The rules state that students switching to a Skilled Worker visa from within the UK must have **completed** their course, or – if they are PhD students – completed at least 24 months of their PhD. As you're studying for a Master's and haven’t finished your course yet, you don’t meet the requirements for switching while still a student.

Essentially, you can't switch mid-course. You would need to wait until after you’ve completed your studies in September 2026 to apply to switch to a Skilled Worker visa from within the UK.

Alternatively, you could choose to leave the UK and apply for a Skilled Worker visa from outside the UK (this is called 'Entry Clearance'). However, this would mean you would need to leave before starting the job in January.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense. So my options are either to finish my Master's degree first and then apply for the Skilled Worker visa in September 2026, or leave the UK and apply from abroad if I want to take the job in January 2026?

[root_agent]: Yes, that is absolutely correct, Leo. You've understood the situation perfectly. Those are your two main options based on the current rules.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you'd like me to reiterate the requirements, or discuss the implications of either choice in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand my situation now. Thank you for explaining the visa rules to me. I'll need to decide whether to complete my Master's or leave the UK to take the job opportunity. I appreciate your help!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Leo! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It's a big decision, so take your time to consider your options. 

If you have any further questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Best of luck with your decision and with your career!





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I (Leo) am not eligible to switch from a Student visa to a Skilled Worker visa from within the UK because I have not completed my Master's degree. The agent accurately explained that students must complete their course before switching (unless they're PhD students with 24+ months completed), and offered the correct alternatives of either finishing my degree first or leaving the UK to apply from abroad.
