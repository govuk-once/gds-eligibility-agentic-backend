[evaluation_judge]: I'll help evaluate the agent in this scenario about UK work visa conditions. I'll play the role of Yuki, a Graphic Designer on a standard Skilled Worker visa who wants to take a weekend job as a bartender.

Hi, i'm Yuki and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Yuki, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you please confirm if your current Skilled Worker visa is still valid?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my Skilled Worker visa is still valid. I'm currently working as a Graphic Designer on a standard Skilled Worker visa. I'm looking to take on a weekend job as a bartender, about 10 hours per week. I wanted to check if I'm allowed to do this or if it would affect my visa status.

[root_agent]: That's good to know your visa is valid. Thanks for clarifying you work as a Graphic Designer.

Now, is the job you are considering – the bartending role – in the *same* occupation code as your current role as a Graphic Designer?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the bartending role is definitely not in the same occupation code as my current Graphic Designer role. They're completely different types of work.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. 

My next question is: is the bartending role listed on the current Immigration Salary List (shortage occupation list)?

[evaluation_judge]: No, as far as I know, bartending is not on the Immigration Salary List or shortage occupation list. It's just a regular hospitality job I was hoping to do on weekends for some extra income.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Yuki. Based on what you've told me – your main job is Graphic Design, the second job is Bartending, it's not the same occupation code, and it's not on the Immigration Salary List – unfortunately, taking a job as a bartender while on your Skilled Worker visa would not be permitted.

It’s important to follow the rules around supplementary work to avoid any issues with your visa. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So I can't take the bartending job? That's unfortunate. I was really hoping to earn some extra money on weekends. Is there any type of supplementary work I could do instead? What if I found some freelance graphic design work instead? Would that be allowed?

[root_agent]: You are right to be disappointed, I understand wanting to earn some extra income. And you're very smart to ask about alternatives!

Regarding freelance graphic design work: yes, that *would* likely be permitted. As long as it's within the same occupation code as your main job (Graphic Designer) and you work no more than 20 hours per week in total on the supplementary work, it should be allowed.



Would you like me to clarify anything about those conditions – the same occupation code and the 20-hour limit?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense. So I can do additional graphic design work as long as it's the same occupation code as my main job and I don't exceed 20 hours per week in this supplementary work. That's helpful to know.

So just to be clear - I can't work as a bartender because it's not in the same occupation code as graphic design and it's not on the shortage occupation list. But I could do freelance graphic design work because it's in the same occupation code, as long as I keep it under 20 hours per week. Is that right?

[root_agent]: You've got it exactly right, Yuki! You've perfectly summarized the situation. 

You cannot work as a bartender because it doesn't meet the requirements for supplementary work – it’s not the same occupation code as your main job and isn’t on the shortage occupation list.

However, freelance graphic design work *is* permitted, as long as it’s the same occupation code and you limit your hours to 20 per week or less.

I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that answers my question completely. Thank you for making it clear what I can and can't do with my current visa status. I'll look into freelance graphic design opportunities instead of the bartending job.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Yuki! I'm so glad I could help. It's always best to be sure before taking on extra work. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best with your freelance graphic design work! Have a lovely day.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that bartending work would be illegal for me as it's neither in the same occupation code as my main job (Graphic Designer) nor on the Immigration Salary List, while also correctly advising that freelance graphic design work would be permitted as it's in the same occupation code (within the 20 hour limit). This matches the expected outcome from the scenario.
