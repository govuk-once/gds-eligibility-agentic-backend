[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Aris and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Aris, nice to meet you. I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant. To understand which benefit you might be eligible for, could you tell me what kind of work you do?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a university lecturer currently working 20 hours per week. I've been offered a research position at a private think-tank for another 20 hours per week. I already have a Skilled Worker visa for my university job, but I'm trying to understand if I can take this second job and what I need to do visa-wise.

[root_agent]: Thanks for clarifying, Aris. That's helpful to know. 

To confirm, does the research position at the think-tank also require sponsorship from the think-tank itself, meaning they would need to provide you with a Certificate of Sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The think-tank is willing to sponsor me and provide a Certificate of Sponsorship for the research position. I'm just not sure if I can hold two sponsored jobs simultaneously or how that works with my current visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. And to be certain, does the salary offered by the think-tank meet the minimum salary requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa, even when pro-rated to 20 hours a week?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both positions meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa, even when pro-rated for part-time hours. The university position already qualified when I got my current visa, and the think-tank position's salary also meets the threshold for the occupation code.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Just one final quick question – are both of these jobs considered skilled occupations eligible for sponsorship under the Skilled Worker visa route?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both jobs are eligible skilled occupations under the Skilled Worker visa route. My current university lecturer position is already sponsored, and the research position at the think-tank also falls under an eligible occupation code for sponsorship.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Aris.

Based on what you've told me – having two eligible jobs, both sponsored with Certificates of Sponsorship, both meeting the salary requirements, and wanting to hold both positions concurrently – you *are* eligible to apply for a second Skilled Worker visa for the think-tank position. This is known as Concurrent Employment.

Essentially, you wouldn’t replace your current visa, but apply for a new one specifically for the think-tank role. It’s important to make sure your application clearly states it’s for “Concurrent Employment” to avoid cancellation of your existing visa.



Does this information answer your question?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that answers my question perfectly. So I'll be able to keep my current university visa and just apply for an additional visa for the think-tank position, making sure to mark it as "Concurrent Employment" on the application. That's exactly what I needed to know. Thank you for clarifying how this works!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Aris! I'm glad I could help. 

Just to reiterate, yes, that's correct. You'll have two separate visas active simultaneously.

If you have any further questions down the line, feel free to ask. Best of luck with your application and both positions!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am eligible for concurrent employment, requiring a second Skilled Worker visa marked as "Concurrent Employment" rather than replacing my existing visa. This matches the expected outcome that I would be awarded the ability to hold two visas simultaneously for my two sponsored jobs.
