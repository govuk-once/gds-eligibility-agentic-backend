[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by role-playing as Wei, a physicist from China seeking information about eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa.

Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Wei! It's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa. 

To start, could you please confirm if you have a job offer from a UK employer who is a licensed sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer from a university in the UK. They've offered me a position as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Physics. They confirmed they are a licensed sponsor.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent to hear, Wei! Thank you for confirming.

Now, could you please tell me what the skill level of the job is? This is usually listed on the job offer or in the job description - it will be listed as a skill level between 1 and 8.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm afraid I don't have a specific skill level number from 1 to 8 mentioned in my offer letter. What I do know is that I'll be working as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Physics with occupation code 2114. It's a research position that requires my PhD in Physics. Does that help identify the skill level?

[root_agent]: Yes, that definitely helps, Wei! Occupation code 2114 falls under skill level 6, which is the required skill level for a Skilled Worker Visa.

Next, can you please confirm that you meet the English language requirements for the visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I meet the English language requirements. I completed my PhD at an English-speaking university, and I've also previously taken the IELTS test with sufficient scores for the visa requirement.

[root_agent]: Wonderful, Wei! That’s great news.

Now, to confirm – your job offer is specifically for a postdoctoral position, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My job offer is specifically for a Postdoctoral Researcher position in Physics at the university.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Wei. 

Could you please tell me your offered annual salary for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: The university has offered me an annual salary of £33,500 for this postdoctoral researcher position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Wei. And do you happen to know what the standard going rate is for a Postdoctoral Researcher in Physics at this university, or generally in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for my role is around £46,000 per year. That's what I was told during discussions about the position.

[root_agent]: Thank you very much for that information, Wei.

Based on the details you've provided – a sponsored job at the correct skill level, meeting the English language requirements, a qualifying postdoctoral position with a salary of £33,500, and a standard going rate of £46,000 – it appears you *would* be eligible for the discounted going rate criteria. Your salary exceeds both the £33,400 lower general threshold *and* 70% of the standard going rate (£32,200).

Therefore, the outcome is **AWARDED**. You qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa!



Do you have any further questions for me, Wei?

[evaluation_judge]: That's excellent news! I'm really relieved to hear that my salary meets both the minimum threshold and the discounted going rate requirement. I was a bit concerned about whether I would qualify with my offer. This gives me confidence to proceed with my visa application. Thank you for confirming my eligibility! No further questions at the moment.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately assessed that my salary (£33,500) meets both the lower general threshold (£33,400) and exceeds 70% of the going rate (£32,200), matching the expected outcome of "AWARDED."
