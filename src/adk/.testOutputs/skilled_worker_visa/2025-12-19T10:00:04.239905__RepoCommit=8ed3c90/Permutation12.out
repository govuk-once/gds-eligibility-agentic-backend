[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Amara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Amara, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me which benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in finding out if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. I've received a job offer as an Architect in the UK, but I'll only be working part-time, 3 days a week (22.5 hours) because I want to study privately as well. I'm currently living in Nigeria.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Amara. That's helpful. To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you please tell me your proposed gross annual salary for this Architect position? (This is the total amount you'll earn *before* any deductions like tax or National Insurance).

[evaluation_judge]: My job offer is for £30 per hour, which works out to £35,100 per year for my 22.5 hours per week. It would be equivalent to £58,500 if I were working full-time.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Amara. Now, are you aware of the current general salary threshold requirement for a Skilled Worker visa? It's currently £41,700 per year for most applicants. Do you know if your role qualifies for a different threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't aware of that specific threshold. My role is as an Architect, which I believe requires professional qualifications. The offer I have is £35,100 per year for my part-time role, but the hourly rate is quite high at £30/hour (which would equal £58,500 if I worked full-time). Does that make a difference for the visa requirements?

[root_agent]: That's a good question, Amara. While a higher hourly rate is positive, the Skilled Worker visa has a general threshold that usually needs to be met with your *actual gross annual salary*, not the equivalent full-time rate. 

To confirm, are you applying under one of the health or education exceptions, or is this a standard Skilled Worker visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm applying for a standard Skilled Worker visa. My role is as an Architect with a private architecture firm, so I don't believe I'd qualify for any health or education exceptions.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Amara. Given that you're applying for a standard Skilled Worker visa as an Architect, and your annual salary is £35,100, unfortunately, it appears you do not currently meet the general salary threshold of £41,700. 

Therefore, based on the information provided, your application would likely be refused at this time. Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or discuss options like potentially increasing your salary or working more hours?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate if you could explain this in more detail. I thought because my hourly rate is quite high at £30/hour (which would be well above the threshold if I worked full-time), that might satisfy the requirements. Can you clarify why the actual annual salary matters more than the hourly rate? And what options do I have if I want to proceed with this visa application?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Amara. You're right to ask for clarification – it can be a bit confusing.

The Skilled Worker visa requirements are primarily based on the *actual* annual salary you'll be earning, not a pro-rated or equivalent full-time salary. The UK government sets a minimum salary threshold to ensure skilled workers are adequately compensated and to control immigration. While the 'Going Rate' can be assessed by the hour, the overall general threshold (£41,700 in most cases) is a hard floor for the *total annual income*.

Think of it this way: the government wants to be sure you’ll be earning a substantial amount *in the UK* each year, regardless of how many hours you work. A high hourly rate doesn’t override the need to meet that overall annual income requirement.

As for your options, here are a few possibilities:

1.  **Negotiate a higher salary:** If possible, discuss with your employer whether they can increase your annual salary to meet the £41,700 threshold.
2.  **Increase your working hours:** If your employer is open to it, increasing your working hours to a full-time or closer-to-full-time schedule could raise your annual income.
3.  **Explore alternative visa routes:** While the Skilled Worker visa seems the most appropriate for your situation, it's worth exploring if any other visa categories might be suitable. (Though, based on your description, this seems unlikely).
4.  **Wait for potential changes to the rules:** Immigration rules are subject to change, but relying on this is not a guaranteed strategy.



Would you like me to elaborate on any of these options, or perhaps help you find more information on the current salary thresholds?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining this so clearly. I understand now that even though I have a high hourly rate, the annual threshold is what matters for the visa requirements. 

I'll need to have a conversation with my potential employer about either increasing my salary or working more hours to reach that £41,700 threshold. I was really hoping to keep my part-time schedule to allow for my studies, but it seems I'll need to make some adjustments.

Is there any flexibility at all with this threshold? For example, if I were just slightly below it, or if I could show that I have sufficient savings to support myself despite the lower annual income?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Amara. I'm glad the explanation was helpful. It's good you're planning to discuss options with your employer.

Regarding flexibility, unfortunately, there is very limited flexibility with the £41,700 general threshold for a standard Skilled Worker visa. Being “slightly below” doesn’t usually allow for waivers, and demonstrating sufficient savings to cover living expenses is not a substitute for meeting the salary requirement. The threshold is a firm requirement to demonstrate you'll be financially secure *through your employment*.

The rules do allow for some exceptions, but these generally apply to:

*   **New entrants to the labour market:** Recent graduates. This doesn't apply to you, as you're already an experienced Architect.
*   **Specific health or education roles:** As we've already established, your position doesn’t fall into these categories.

While you can present a strong case for your skills and qualifications, the Home Office primarily focuses on whether the salary meets the specified threshold. 

It’s worth noting that the rules are occasionally updated, so checking the official government website ([https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)) for any recent changes is always a good idea. However, as of today, the £41,700 threshold remains firm for most applicants.



Do you have any other questions I can help you with at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for being clear about this. I understand now that the £41,700 threshold is quite firm and I'll need to meet it for my visa application to be successful. I'll definitely check the official government website for the most up-to-date information and discuss my options with my potential employer.

No, I don't have any other questions right now. You've been very helpful in explaining the requirements and my options. I appreciate your time and guidance on this matter.

[root_agent]: You are very welcome, Amara! I'm so glad I could help clarify the situation for you. I wish you the best of luck in your discussions with your potential employer and with your visa application process. 

If you do have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to assist you. Have a lovely day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome that I would be refused a Skilled Worker visa. They correctly explained that while my hourly rate is high, the actual gross annual salary of £35,100 does not meet the general threshold of £41,700, which cannot be pro-rated for part-time work in standard applications.
