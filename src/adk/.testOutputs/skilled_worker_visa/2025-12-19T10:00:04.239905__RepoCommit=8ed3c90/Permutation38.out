[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Pavel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Pavel, it’s great to speak with you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you please tell me if you are currently located inside or outside of the UK?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently in Warsaw, Poland. I've been offered a job at a garage in the UK as a mechanic.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know, thank you Pavel. 

Has the garage already provided you with a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) reference number to use in your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they have. The garage owner told me they had some spare certificates in their allocation, so they assigned one to me right away. They said it would save time so I can apply immediately. They've already given me the CoS reference number to use in my application.

[root_agent]: That’s helpful, Pavel. To clarify, do you know if the Certificate of Sponsorship they provided you was a "Defined" CoS or an "Undefined" CoS? This information is usually on the CoS itself. Don't worry if you don't know, we can try to figure it out, but if you have the document, it will be quicker!

[evaluation_judge]: The garage owner mentioned it was an "Undefined" CoS from their annual allocation. They said they had extras available and wanted to speed up my application process.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Pavel. 

Since you are currently in Warsaw, Poland – outside of the UK – and the garage has assigned you an “Undefined” CoS, your application for a Skilled Worker Visa may unfortunately be refused. Undefined CoS are generally for people applying *from within* the UK, while those applying *from outside* the UK require a “Defined” CoS.

Have you started the application process yet, or are you still gathering information?

[evaluation_judge]: I just started filling out the online application a few days ago, but I haven't submitted it yet. Why would it be refused? The garage owner seemed confident everything was fine. Do I need a different type of certificate?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask about that, Pavel! It’s good you haven’t submitted it yet.

The reason it would likely be refused is because the Home Office has specific rules about the type of Certificate of Sponsorship used depending on where you are applying *from*. As you are applying from outside the UK – from Poland – you need a “Defined” CoS. These are specifically requested for applicants applying for entry clearance (permission to enter the UK).

An “Undefined” CoS is taken from the garage's annual allocation and is generally used for people who already have permission to be in the UK and are switching to a Skilled Worker Visa *from within* the UK. 

Yes, you do need a different type of certificate. The garage needs to apply for a “Defined” CoS specifically for your application. They can then assign that to you, and you can use *that* reference number in your visa application.



Would you like me to explain any of that in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes much more sense now. I had no idea there were different types of certificates depending on where you're applying from. I'm going to contact the garage owner right away and explain they need to apply for a "Defined" CoS for me instead of using their spare "Undefined" one.

Is there anything specific I should tell them about the process of getting a Defined CoS? Does it take a long time?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Pavel! I’m glad that’s clearer now. It’s a common misunderstanding, so don’t worry about it.

Yes, you should tell the garage owner they need to apply for a “Defined” CoS through the Sponsor Account system. They’ll need to specify that it’s for someone applying for entry clearance *from outside* the UK.

Regarding how long it takes, it can vary. Generally, a Defined CoS application is assessed quite quickly – usually within 8 working days, but it can sometimes take longer, up to 28 days. It's best for them to apply as soon as possible to avoid delays to your application.

You can find more information for them as a sponsor here: [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sponsoring-a-skilled-worker](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sponsoring-a-skilled-worker) – but you don't need to read it yourself, it's just for them.

Is there anything else I can help you with at this stage, Pavel?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, that's really helpful! I'll let the garage know they need to apply for a Defined CoS right away, and I'll share that link with them too. I appreciate you explaining this before I submitted my application incorrectly. I'll wait until I receive the proper CoS reference number before continuing with my visa application.

No other questions for now - you've been very clear about what needs to happen next. Thanks again for your help!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Pavel! I’m so glad I could help clarify things and prevent a potential issue with your application. 

It was my pleasure assisting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if any further questions come to mind once you have the Defined CoS. 

I wish you all the best with your visa application and your move to the UK!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I needed a "Defined" CoS as an out-of-country applicant rather than the "Undefined" CoS that was incorrectly assigned. They accurately explained that my application would be refused if submitted with the wrong type of CoS, matching the expected outcome of "REFUSED" in the scenario.
