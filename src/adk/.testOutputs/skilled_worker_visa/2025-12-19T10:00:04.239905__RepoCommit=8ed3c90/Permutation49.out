[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Tom, nice to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, are you currently employed in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently working at a bank in the UK on a sponsorship visa. My company sponsored me at a salary of £50,000, but they recently announced they need to cut all salaries by 20% due to an economic downturn. I'm concerned about how this will affect my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining the situation, Tom. That sounds concerning. Just to confirm, after the 20% salary reduction, what is your new annual salary?

[evaluation_judge]: My new salary after the 20% cut would be £40,000. The bank said they're implementing these cuts across the board for all employees due to the difficult economic situation.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Tom. To help me understand your situation fully, could you please confirm if you are aware of the minimum salary requirement for your current visa type? It's currently £41,700 for many skilled worker visas.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe when I got my visa, the minimum threshold was £41,700. That's why I'm concerned - my new salary would be below that minimum amount.

[root_agent]: You are right to be concerned, Tom. Based on the information you’ve provided – a current salary of £40,000 after a reduction from £50,000, and a previous understanding that the minimum salary threshold for your visa was £41,700 – it appears your sponsorship may be at risk. 

To be absolutely certain, could you please confirm whether your current role falls under any eligible occupation codes listed on the Skilled Worker visa guidance? (Don't worry if you don't have this information readily available, just let me know and we can try a different approach).



You can find a list of eligible occupations here: https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa#eligibility

[evaluation_judge]: I work as a financial analyst at the bank, and I believe my role falls under one of the eligible occupation codes for the Skilled Worker visa. I don't have the exact code in front of me, but I know the bank handled all of that when they sponsored me initially at the £50,000 salary. My main concern is just about this salary reduction and whether I can continue with my sponsorship when my salary will now be below that £41,700 threshold.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tom. It's good to know your role was initially sponsored under an eligible occupation code. However, even with an eligible occupation, maintaining the minimum salary is crucial. 

Since your salary is now below the £41,700 threshold *after* your visa was granted, unfortunately, your employer is unable to continue sponsoring you at that reduced salary. 

Essentially, sponsorship would need to be terminated, or your salary restored to at least £41,700. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make sense, although it's not what I was hoping to hear. So you're saying that my employer has to either keep my salary at or above £41,700, even while everyone else takes the cut, or they will have to terminate my sponsorship? There's no exemption or grace period during economic difficulties?

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly, Tom. Your employer must either maintain your salary at or above £41,700, or they will need to terminate your sponsorship. 

Unfortunately, there isn't a general exemption or grace period for economic difficulties regarding the Skilled Worker visa salary requirements. The rules state the salary must remain above the threshold throughout the sponsorship. While the economic situation is understandable, it doesn’t alter the visa requirements.



Do you have any further questions about this, or would you like me to clarify anything?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very clear, thank you. I suppose I'll need to speak with my employer about either maintaining my salary above the threshold or what options we have if they can't do that. Is there anything I should be aware of regarding the timeline - like how quickly this needs to be addressed if my employer does decide they need to terminate the sponsorship?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Tom. It's good you're planning to discuss this with your employer.

Regarding the timeline, if your employer needs to terminate your sponsorship, they have certain obligations. They must notify the Home Office, and you’ll typically have a period of 60 days from the date your sponsorship ends to either switch to another visa route, or leave the UK. 

However, this 60-day period can be affected by circumstances, so it's important to get accurate information from your employer and potentially seek immigration legal advice to understand your options and the specific timeframe applicable to your situation.

Would you like me to provide a link to the official guidance on sponsorship ending? (I understand you prefer not to have links, so I won’t unless you ask).

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, the 60-day guideline is helpful to know. I'll definitely discuss this with my employer soon and might look into getting some immigration advice if needed. I appreciate your help in clarifying this situation for me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Tom. I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It's a good idea to discuss it with your employer and consider immigration advice if needed. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best in resolving this situation.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for your help and advice. I'll get in touch with my employer right away.

✓ The agent correctly advised that since my reduced salary (£40,000) falls below the required minimum threshold (£41,700) for my visa, my sponsorship would need to be terminated unless my employer maintains my salary above the threshold. This matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
