[evaluation_judge]: I'll be playing the role of a UK resident seeking benefits information. I'll converse naturally with the agent under test until they provide an eligibility outcome, then assess if their conclusion matches the expected outcome.

Hi, i'm Tariq and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Tariq, it's lovely to meet you! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you tell me what kind of job you have been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Junior Data Analyst. I've just finished my time on a Graduate visa after completing my PhD. The company is offering me £34,000 per year and they want me to work for them for 2 years. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's great to know, Tariq. Thank you.

To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me how long you spent on a Student Visa in the UK? (e.g., for your PhD).

[evaluation_judge]: I spent 3 years on my PhD Student Visa and then 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa that I just finished. The company wants to hire me now as a Junior Data Analyst.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Tariq. 

Just to clarify, you spent 3 years on a Student Visa *and* 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I spent 3 years completing my PhD on a Student Visa, and then I've been on a Graduate Visa for 3 years and 6 months after that. Now I'm looking at moving to a Skilled Worker visa with this job offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Tariq.

Given the time you've spent on both the Student and Graduate visas, and considering the rules around the 'New Entrant' discount, could you confirm if the company is offering you the £34,000 salary *specifically* based on utilising a 'New Entrant' salary option?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company is offering me £34,000 specifically using the New Entrant discount option. They mentioned something about it being 70% of the normal requirement. They said this makes it easier for them to hire me as I'm just starting out in the industry after my studies.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Tariq. 

Based on the information you've provided – 3 years on a Student Visa and 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa – and the fact that the job offer of £34,000 relies on the New Entrant discount… unfortunately, it appears you would **not** be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa under the New Entrant provisions at this time. 

The total time spent on eligible visa types (Graduate visa *and* time utilising the New Entrant discount on a Skilled Worker visa) is capped at 4 years. You have already exceeded this limit with your combined time on a Student and Graduate Visa.

To be eligible, you would likely need to apply for the visa under the standard Skilled Worker requirements, meeting the full salary threshold without relying on the New Entrant discount.



Does this make sense? Would you like me to explain any part of this further?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. So I can't use the New Entrant discount because I've already been on these visas for too long? Is there any way around this, or would the company need to offer me a higher salary to meet the standard requirement?

[root_agent]: You're right to feel disappointed, Tariq. And yes, you've understood correctly – you've unfortunately exceeded the maximum time allowed to benefit from the New Entrant discount.

There isn't a way to circumvent that rule, unfortunately. The 4-year limit is firm. 

The most likely course of action would be for your company to offer a salary that meets the standard Skilled Worker visa requirements *without* relying on the New Entrant discount. The current general threshold is £38,700 per year, but this can vary depending on the job code. You can find more information about salary requirements here: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/eligibility) (although I’m not able to directly provide links, this is the page where you can find that info).

Alternatively, if the company is unable to offer a higher salary, you would unfortunately not be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa at this time. 

Would you like me to try and clarify anything further about the standard requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. Thanks for explaining. Just to confirm, is it specifically my time on the Graduate Visa (3 years and 6 months) that's counted toward this 4-year limit? Or is it the combination of my Student Visa and Graduate Visa time?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Tariq. It's the **combination of both** your Student Visa *and* your Graduate Visa time that counts towards the 4-year limit for the New Entrant discount.

While time on a Student Visa doesn’t *always* count, it does contribute to the overall total allowed under the New Entrant provisions. Since you’ve spent 3 years on a Student Visa *plus* 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa, you’ve exceeded the 4-year maximum.

The key point is the *total* time spent on visas that allow you to utilise the lower 'New Entrant' salary threshold. It’s not just about time on the Graduate Visa alone.

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information. The official rule is that time on a Student visa does NOT count toward the 4-year New Entrant limit, while time on a Graduate visa DOES count. The agent incorrectly stated that the combination of both Student Visa and Graduate Visa time counts toward the 4-year limit.
