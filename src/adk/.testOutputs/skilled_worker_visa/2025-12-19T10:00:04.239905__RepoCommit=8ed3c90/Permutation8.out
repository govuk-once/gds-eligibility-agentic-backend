[evaluation_judge]: I'll assume the role of a UK resident and engage with another agent to discuss Skilled Worker visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Priya and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Priya, it's lovely to meet you! I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant here to answer your questions.

To best understand your situation, could you tell me if you currently hold a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been living in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022. I'm currently working as a Marketing Manager, but I've been offered a new position at a different marketing agency. I'm trying to figure out if I can accept this job offer and stay in the UK.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you've been living and working in the UK since 2022! And congratulations on the new job offer. 

To clarify, is this new position *also* as a Marketing Manager?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The new position is also as a Marketing Manager, just with a different marketing agency. The salary they're offering me is £32,000 per year. I know there have been some changes to the visa rules recently, so I'm trying to understand if I'll be eligible to continue on my Skilled Worker visa with this new employer.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's very helpful to know. You're right to check, as there have been some changes.

Just to confirm, do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Marketing Manager role is according to the government's list of eligible occupations? Don’t worry if you don’t know offhand, just let me know and I can try to help you find out.

[evaluation_judge]: I think the standard going rate for Marketing Managers is around £42,000 now, but I've heard there might be different rates that apply to people who were already on Skilled Worker visas before the recent changes. My new offer is £32,000, which I know is less than the standard rate, but I'm hoping the transitional arrangements might apply to me since I've been here since 2022.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to think that transitional arrangements might apply! It's excellent that you're aware of that possibility.

To be certain, could you confirm that you have continuously held a Skilled Worker visa since 2022, without any gaps?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've held my Skilled Worker visa continuously since 2022 without any gaps. I first received it in February 2022 when I came to the UK for my current job, and I've been working and living here since then.

[root_agent]: Fantastic, that’s good to hear! Because you've held a Skilled Worker visa continuously since before April 4th, 2024, you likely *do* qualify for the transitional arrangements.

Just one more quick question: Has your new employer been approved as a licensed sponsor by the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I checked with them and they are an approved sponsor with a valid sponsorship license. They've already prepared my Certificate of Sponsorship, they just wanted me to confirm that I would be eligible to continue on my Skilled Worker visa with them before we proceed further.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news, Priya! 

Based on the information you’ve provided, it looks like you **are** eligible to continue on the Skilled Worker visa with your new employer. Because you held a Skilled Worker visa before April 4th, 2024, the transitional arrangements apply to you. This means the salary requirements are different for you than for someone applying for a visa for the first time. Your salary of £32,000 meets both the transitional general threshold and the transitional going rate for your role.



Congratulations! It sounds like you can confidently accept this new position. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome, correctly applying the transitional arrangements for my situation. They accurately determined that my £32,000 salary meets both the transitional general threshold (£29,000) and the transitional going rate (£30,000) for Marketing Managers, making me eligible to continue on the Skilled Worker visa with my new employer.
