[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Mary, it's lovely to meet you. To help me understand your situation and whether you're eligible, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm interested in the Health and Care Worker visa. I'm a senior care worker from Zimbabwe with a job offer at a residential care home in the UK. The salary is £29,000. I'm wondering if I can bring my husband and two children with me as well.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Mary. That's helpful. 

To confirm, you mentioned you're applying as a Senior Care Worker. Could you please confirm the occupation code for your role – is it 6135 (Care Worker) or 6136 (Senior Care Worker)?





[evaluation_judge]: It's 6136 - Senior Care Worker.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Mary. 

Just to be absolutely clear, regarding your family – are you applying for visas for your husband and both of your children to accompany you to the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm hoping to bring my husband and both children with me when I come to the UK. We'd like to move as a family.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. 

Given you are applying under occupation code 6136 (Senior Care Worker), and considering the rules regarding dependents, I need to explain how this impacts your application. Are you aware that there have been recent changes to the rules about bringing family members with Health and Care Worker visa applicants?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of any recent changes to the rules. What changes have been made regarding bringing family members? This is quite important for me as I was planning to move with my whole family.

[root_agent]: You're right to ask, it is very important. As of March 2024, applicants applying under occupation codes 6135 (Care Worker) and 6136 (Senior Care Worker) are eligible for the visa, but unfortunately, are **not** permitted to bring dependents – meaning your husband and children – to the UK with you.

I understand this is likely very disappointing news, especially as you were planning to move as a family. 

Would you like me to explain the situation further, or would you like to know if your visa application would still be successful without your family?

[evaluation_judge]: That is disappointing news. I had no idea about this change. Yes, please tell me more about my own application - would I still be eligible for the visa even if my family can't join me?

[root_agent]: Yes, Mary, you would still be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa as a Senior Care Worker. Your visa application itself would likely be approved, as your salary of £29,000 meets the Health & Care worker threshold, and you have a job offer from a CQC-registered residential care home.

However, the visas for your husband and children would be refused, as the rules currently prevent dependents joining those applying under the 6136 occupation code. 

Essentially, this means you would be eligible to come to the UK and work as a Senior Care Worker, but you would need to decide whether to do so without your family joining you at this time.



Does this make sense? Would you like me to go over any part of this again?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, this makes sense, although it's not what I was hoping to hear. So just to confirm - I would be able to come to the UK on the Health & Care visa with my job offer, but my husband and children would not be allowed to join me because of the new rules for senior care workers? Is there any way around this, or any timeline for when these rules might change again?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Mary. Yes, you would be able to come to the UK on the Health & Care Worker visa with your job offer, but your husband and children wouldn't be permitted to join you initially due to the current restrictions for those in the 6136 (Senior Care Worker) occupation code.

Regarding ways around this or potential changes – unfortunately, there aren't currently any specific routes to bring your family with you under these new rules. The government regularly reviews its immigration policies, but there's no published timeline for when (or if) these rules might change. Immigration rules are subject to change, and it’s best to stay updated with the official government website ([https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)) for any future updates.

It's a difficult situation, I understand. Would you like me to provide information on how to stay updated on potential changes to the rules? Or perhaps information on options for your family to potentially join you at a later date, should the rules change?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please provide information on how I can stay updated about potential changes and if there might be any options for my family to join me later. This is a very difficult decision for me to make.

[root_agent]: Of course, Mary. I understand this is a very difficult decision, and I'll do my best to provide helpful information.

**Staying Updated on Rule Changes:**

The best way to stay informed about any changes to the Skilled Worker visa rules is to regularly check the official UK government website: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa). Specifically, look for updates to the Immigration Rules and guidance for Health and Care Workers. You can also sign up for email alerts on that page to be notified of any changes.

**Potential Options for Family to Join Later:**

Here are some potential scenarios, although these are all subject to the rules in place *at the time* of application:

*   **Rule Changes:** If the rules regarding dependents for Health and Care Workers are changed in the future, you may be able to apply to extend your visa to include your family.
*   **Switching Visa Categories:** If you were to later qualify for a different visa category that *does* allow dependents (for example, if you were to gain a promotion to a role with a different occupation code), you might be able to switch visas and then apply for dependent visas for your family.
*   **Family Visas (Independent Route):** Your husband may be eligible to apply for a visa independently, such as a Family visa, if he meets the financial requirements and other eligibility criteria. This would require demonstrating sufficient funds and meeting other requirements independent of your visa. This is a separate application process.
*   **Long-Term Residency:** After living in the UK for a certain period (usually 5 years) and meeting other requirements, you may be eligible for Indefinite Leave to Remain (settlement). Once you have settled status, your family may then be able to apply to join you under the family reunification rules.

**Important Note:** These are just potential options, and the specific requirements and eligibility criteria can change. It's crucial to check the latest information on the government website and potentially seek advice from an Immigration Advisor or Solicitor before making any decisions.

Would you like me to point you to the relevant pages on the government website for information about Family Visas or Indefinite Leave to Remain?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave me incorrect information. While I would be eligible for the Health and Care Worker visa as a Senior Care Worker, the agent failed to inform me that the ban on dependents for occupation codes 6135 and 6136 only became effective from March 2024 (as specified in the scenario). This is a crucial timing detail that was missing from their advice, which could impact my decision-making.
