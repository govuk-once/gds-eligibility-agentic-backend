[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Raj, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand what benefit you might be eligible for, could you tell me what your current employment situation is? Specifically, are you currently working in the UK on a visa?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm working in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa. I've been sponsored by my current company as a Web Developer, but I was just promoted to an IT Project Manager position within the same company. My salary increased to £50,000 with the promotion. HR said they updated something called the SMS system, but I just want to make sure everything is okay with my visa situation after this change in role.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Raj. That's very helpful. To confirm, your role changed from Web Developer to IT Project Manager *within the same company*? Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I was working as a Web Developer at the same company, and now I've been promoted to IT Project Manager. It's the same company, just a different role with more responsibilities and better pay.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Do you happen to know the official occupation code listed on your Skilled Worker visa for your previous role as a Web Developer? It's a four-digit number.





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe my previous role as a Web Developer was under occupation code 2137. The new role as an IT Project Manager would fall under code 2135, from what HR mentioned.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Raj. Just to be absolutely clear, your previous role (Web Developer) was occupation code 2137, and your new role (IT Project Manager) is occupation code 2135? These are different codes, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My previous role as a Web Developer was under occupation code 2137, and my new role as IT Project Manager is under a different code, which is 2135.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Raj. Did you apply for a new Skilled Worker visa, or a "Change of Employment" visa, *before* starting your new role as an IT Project Manager?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I didn't apply for a new visa. HR just told me they updated something in their system called SMS (Sponsorship Management System), but they didn't say anything about needing a new visa. I've already started the new role about two weeks ago. Was I supposed to apply for a new visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for being honest, Raj. Unfortunately, it appears there may be a compliance issue with your visa. Because your new role has a different occupation code (2135) than your original visa (2137), you *should* have applied for a new visa – specifically a "Change of Employment" visa – *before* starting the IT Project Manager position. 

Updating the SMS system by your employer isn’t sufficient for a change in occupation code. Starting the new role without applying for the correct visa means you are technically working illegally in the UK.



This could lead to serious consequences, including curtailment of your visa and potential issues for your sponsor. Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain more! This is really concerning. What do I need to do now? I had no idea I needed a new visa just for a promotion in the same company. My employer didn't tell me anything about this requirement.

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, Raj, and I’ll do my best to explain. The Skilled Worker visa is tied to a specific occupation code. Even within the same company, a change to a different occupation code is considered a new role for visa purposes. This is because the skills and responsibilities are assessed differently for each code.

Because you started the new role without applying for a "Change of Employment" visa, you're currently in a situation considered a breach of immigration rules. This means you're technically working illegally. 

Here’s what needs to happen, and it’s important to act quickly:

1. **Inform your employer immediately.** They should have been aware of this requirement and failed to advise you correctly. They need to understand the seriousness of the situation.
2. **Apply for a "Change of Employment" visa.** This application needs to be submitted as soon as possible.
3. **Your employer will need to re-sponsor you.** They'll need to confirm the new role and your eligibility under the new occupation code.
4. **You may need to stop working in the IT Project Manager role until the new visa is approved.** This depends on the specifics of your situation, so professional legal advice is crucial.

Your employer’s failure to inform you of this requirement is a serious issue, and it could also have repercussions for their sponsor license. I strongly recommend seeking advice from an immigration solicitor as soon as possible. They can guide you through the application process and advise you on the best course of action to minimise the risks.



Do you understand what I've explained, and would you like me to clarify anything?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand what you're saying, and I'm really worried now. I had no idea this was required - I thought since it was just a promotion in the same company, everything would be fine with just an internal update. 

Just to be clear, even though my salary meets the requirements and I'm still with the same employer, I need a completely new visa just because the occupation code changed? And I shouldn't be working in this new role until that's approved?

How long does the Change of Employment visa application usually take? I'm worried about what this means for my job and my ability to stay in the UK.

[root_agent]: You're right to be concerned, Raj, but it’s good that you’re now aware of the situation. Yes, even with a salary that meets the requirements and remaining with the same employer, a change in the occupation code requires a new visa – in this case, a "Change of Employment" visa. The visa is tied to the specific role outlined by the occupation code.

And you are correct to be cautious about continuing in the new role. Ideally, you shouldn't be working as an IT Project Manager until the new visa is approved. Continuing to work could be seen as a further breach of immigration rules and could negatively impact your case. However, the best course of action regarding your employment while waiting for the decision should be discussed with an immigration solicitor.

Regarding processing times, the "Change of Employment" visa application can vary. Currently, the government states that 80% of applications are processed within 8 weeks, but it can sometimes take longer, especially if there are complications or the case requires further review. However, these are just estimates, and it's best to check the latest processing times on the government website.

I understand your worries about your job and your ability to stay in the UK. This is a serious situation, but it *is* often resolvable. The key is to act quickly, be honest with the Home Office, and get professional legal advice. 

An immigration solicitor can assess your specific case, prepare your application correctly, and represent you if any issues arise. They can also advise your employer on their responsibilities.

Would you like me to reiterate any part of this, or is there anything else I can help you understand at this point?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining. It seems I'm in a serious situation that I need to address immediately. Just to confirm - because I changed from a Web Developer (code 2137) to an IT Project Manager (code 2135) without getting a new visa first, I'm technically working illegally even though I'm with the same company?

I'll talk to my employer right away and look into getting an immigration solicitor. I really appreciate your help in clarifying this situation.

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly, Raj. Yes, because you transitioned from a Web Developer (code 2137) to an IT Project Manager (code 2135) without obtaining a new or updated visa *before* starting the new role, you are technically working illegally, even though you remain employed by the same company. This is because your current work is not authorized under the terms of your current visa.

It's good that you plan to speak with your employer and engage an immigration solicitor right away. Those are the most important steps you can take at this point.

I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you. I wish you the best in resolving this, and please don't hesitate to seek professional legal advice – it will be invaluable in navigating this process. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. I'll take action immediately. Thank you for your help.

✓ The agent correctly identified that I am in breach of immigration rules because I changed occupation codes (from 2137 to 2135) within the same company without applying for a new "Change of Employment" visa beforehand. The agent accurately explained that simply updating the SMS system was insufficient and that I'm technically working illegally, which matches the expected outcome.
