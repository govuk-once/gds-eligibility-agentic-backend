[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Ali and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Ali, it's good to speak with you. I understand you're exploring your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa. 

To start, could you tell me how long you have been studying your PhD course? Please answer with the number of months you have completed.

[evaluation_judge]: I've been studying my PhD in Engineering for almost 3 years now. I'm in the third year of a 4-year program, so that would be around 30-32 months completed so far.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Ali. That's very helpful.

To clarify, have you *completed* your PhD course yet? Please just answer yes or no.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't completed my PhD yet. I'm still in my third year of the four-year program.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, is the job you've been offered in an eligible occupation for the Skilled Worker visa? In other words, does it meet the skill level and salary requirements? Please answer yes or no.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been offered a job as an Engineering Consultant which meets the skill level and salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Based on the information you've provided – that you haven't completed your PhD but *have* completed approximately 30-32 months of your PhD course, and that the job offer is for an eligible occupation – it appears you **are eligible** to switch to a Skilled Worker visa. 

PhD students who have completed 24 months or more of their course can apply before finishing their studies.



Do you have any other questions I can help you with today, Ali?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! No, I think that answers my main question very clearly. I was aware of the rule about needing to complete your studies for most student visas to switch to a work visa, but wasn't sure about the special case for PhD students. I'm glad to know that since I've completed more than 24 months of my PhD program, I can apply for the Skilled Worker visa before finishing my studies. Thank you for confirming my eligibility!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ali! I'm glad I could clarify things for you and confirm your eligibility. It's great that you were already aware of the general rule and the exception for PhD students – it shows you've done your research. 

If anything else comes up, feel free to ask. Best of luck with your application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that as a PhD student who has completed more than 24 months of study but not graduated yet, I am eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa. This matches the expected outcome that I should be awarded the visa due to the specific PhD student concession.
