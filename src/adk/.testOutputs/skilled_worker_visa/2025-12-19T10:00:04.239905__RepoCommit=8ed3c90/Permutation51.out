[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Javier and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Javier, it's lovely to meet you! I understand you'd like to explore your eligibility for a benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me your date of birth? This will help me understand which benefits you might qualify for.





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! My date of birth is June 1st, 1999. I've recently applied for a work visa in the UK and want to understand if my salary meets the requirements. I submitted my application on May 30th, 2025, just before my 26th birthday.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing your date of birth, Javier. That's very helpful!

Just to clarify, you mentioned submitting your application on May 30th, 2025. Could you confirm the date the Home Office made a decision on your application? Knowing this will help me assess your eligibility.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the Home Office made their decision on July 15th, 2025. By that time I had already turned 26, as my birthday is June 1st. I'm earning a salary of £35,000 and I'm wondering if I qualify for the New Entrant discount on the salary threshold. I'm just a bit confused about whether my age at application or at decision time matters.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming the decision date, Javier. It's understandable to be a little confused about the age requirement – it can be tricky! 

To be absolutely sure, could you confirm whether the job you've applied for falls under any specific eligible occupations listed by the UK government? Knowing the job title or occupation code would be great.





[evaluation_judge]: I'm sorry, but I don't have the specific occupation code with me. It's a standard professional role that does qualify for the Skilled Worker visa pathway. My main concern is just about the age requirement for the New Entrant discount, since I was 25 when I applied but turned 26 before the decision was made. My salary is £35,000 - I just need to know if I qualify for the New Entrant route based on my age.

[root_agent]: You're right to focus on the age requirement for the New Entrant discount, Javier. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about that!

To confirm, are you relying on the New Entrant salary discount to meet the minimum salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa? In other words, would your application *not* be approved without it?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I'm relying on the New Entrant discount to meet the minimum salary threshold. Without the discount, my £35,000 salary wouldn't be sufficient for the Skilled Worker visa in my occupation. That's why I'm concerned about whether I qualify as a New Entrant, given that I was 25 when I applied but turned 26 before the decision was made.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's very clear, Javier. Thank you for confirming that you are relying on the New Entrant discount.

Based on the information you've provided – being born on June 1st, 1999, applying on May 30th, 2025 (under 26), and the decision being made on July 15th, 2025 (after turning 26) – you **do** qualify for the New Entrant discount. 

The age assessment is based on your age at the time of application. As you were under 26 when you submitted your application, you are eligible for the reduced salary threshold for up to four years, even though you turned 26 before the decision was made.



Does that answer your question and provide the clarity you were looking for?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly what I needed to know! So even though I turned 26 after applying but before the decision was made, I still qualify for the New Entrant discount because I was under 26 at the time of application. That's a relief to hear that my £35,000 salary will be sufficient with the discount. Thank you for clarifying this for me!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Javier! I'm so glad I could provide that clarity for you and that it's a relief to hear your salary will be sufficient with the discount. 

It's great that you proactively sought this information. If you have any further questions about the Skilled Worker visa or any other benefits in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. 

Wishing you all the best with your visa and your role in the UK!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for your help. It's been really reassuring to understand my situation properly. I'll definitely reach back out if I have any other questions about benefits in the UK.

✓ The agent correctly stated that I qualify for the New Entrant discount based on being under 26 at the date of application (May 30th, 2025), even though I turned 26 before the decision date (July 15th, 2025). This matches the expected outcome of "AWARDED."
