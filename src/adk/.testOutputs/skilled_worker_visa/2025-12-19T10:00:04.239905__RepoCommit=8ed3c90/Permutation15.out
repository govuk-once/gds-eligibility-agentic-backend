[evaluation_judge]: I'll act as Lina and engage with the agent under test about eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa for a construction laborer position. I'll assess whether the agent correctly determines I'm not eligible due to the job's RQF level.

[root_agent]: Hello Lina, it's good to speak with you. I'm here to help assess whether you might be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa. 

To start, could you please confirm the exact job title of the position you've been offered?


[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Lina, it's good to speak with you. I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa. 

To start, could you please confirm the exact job title of the position you've been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello! Yes, I'm Lina. I've been offered a job as a Construction Labourer in the UK with a salary of £45,000. I'm trying to understand if I can get a Skilled Worker visa for this position.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Lina! A salary of £45,000 is certainly a good starting point. 

To assess your eligibility further, could you please tell me the occupation code for the Construction Labourer position? This is a 4-digit code that identifies the specific role.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the occupation code for the Construction Labourer position is 9120, which I believe falls under Elementary Construction Occupations.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Lina. 

Now, to clarify, do you know what RQF level this job is? (RQF stands for Regulated Qualifications Framework, and it's a way of standardising qualifications and skill levels). Don’t worry if you don’t, just let me know and I can check for you.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure about the exact RQF level, but I was told it's a practical job that doesn't require formal qualifications beyond some basic training. Could you check what RQF level this occupation would be?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Lina. I've checked the RQF level for Elementary Construction Occupations (occupation code 9120) and it generally falls within RQF levels 1 or 2.

The Skilled Worker Visa requires jobs to be at RQF level 3 or above. 

Therefore, I'm afraid that based on the information provided, you wouldn't currently meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa with this position. Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please explain why I wouldn't qualify despite the good salary? I'm a bit confused because the company is offering me quite a good salary at £45,000.

[root_agent]: You're right to ask for clarification, Lina, and it's good you're questioning this! It *is* excellent that the salary is £45,000, and that meets the general salary threshold.

However, the Skilled Worker Visa isn't just about the salary. It's also about the *skill level* of the job itself. The UK government has determined that the visa is for skilled roles – jobs that require a certain level of training and expertise, as measured by the RQF. 

Because the role of Construction Labourer (code 9120) is at RQF levels 1 or 2, it doesn't meet the minimum RQF level of 3 required for the Skilled Worker Visa, *regardless* of the salary offered. 

Essentially, even with a high salary, the visa rules prioritize jobs that require a higher degree of skill and training.



Does that make things a bit clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. So even though the salary is good, the job itself doesn't require enough skill or training to qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa. The position needs to be at least RQF level 3, but Construction Labourer is only RQF level 1 or 2. I understand now why I can't get the visa for this job. Thank you for explaining.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Lina! I'm glad I could clarify things for you. You've understood perfectly – it's about the skill level of the job *in addition* to the salary.

If you were to be offered a different position with a different occupation code that *is* at RQF level 3 or above, we could then reassess your eligibility. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for a Skilled Worker visa despite the high salary because the Construction Labourer job (code 9120) is only RQF level 1 or 2, not meeting the minimum RQF level 3 requirement.
