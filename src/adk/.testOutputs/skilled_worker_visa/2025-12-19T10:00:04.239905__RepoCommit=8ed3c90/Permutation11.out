[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Claire, a US executive who is inquiring about visa eligibility with her UK job offer.

Hi, i'm Claire and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Claire, welcome! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. To start, could you please tell me what type of visa you are inquiring about?



I understand you have a job offer in the UK, and we can explore whether you meet the requirements for that visa.

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! Yes, I've been offered a CEO position with a small UK tech start-up. I'm currently living in the US, and I'm trying to figure out if I can get a work visa with the salary they're offering me. They're offering £55,000 per year, which seems pretty good to me, but I'm not sure if that meets the requirements for a visa. Can you help me understand if I'm eligible?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Claire. I can definitely help you with that.

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, let's start with your salary. Does your offered salary of £55,000 per year meet the minimum salary threshold of £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The offer is for £55,000 per year, which is above the £41,700 threshold that you mentioned. I was pleased to see it's well above that minimum requirement. Does this mean I should be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[root_agent]: That's good to hear, Claire. Yes, £55,000 is above the general threshold. However, there's another salary requirement to consider – the 'going rate' for your specific job.

To understand if your salary meets *all* the requirements, could you please confirm the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code for your CEO position? This code helps determine the appropriate going rate. If you don't know it, don't worry, and I can try to help you find it.

[evaluation_judge]: I don't actually know the SOC code for my CEO position. The company just said I'd be the Chief Executive Officer of their start-up. I'm not familiar with these classification codes. Could you help me find the right code for my role?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Claire. I can help with that. 

Based on your role as a Chief Executive Officer, the most appropriate SOC code is likely **1115 - Directors and chief executives**.

Now that we have the SOC code, I need to ask you one more question regarding salary. Do you know if the £55,000 salary you've been offered meets the 'going rate' for a Director or Chief Executive (SOC code 1115)?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't know what the 'going rate' is for a CEO in the UK. The company just offered me £55,000 and I thought that sounded reasonable, but I'm not sure how it compares to the standard rates for this position. What is the going rate for a CEO role?

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Claire. The current going rate for a Director or Chief Executive (SOC code 1115) is £78,000 per year. 

Therefore, your offered salary of £55,000 is unfortunately below the required going rate for this position. While it exceeds the general threshold of £41,700, the going rate is the higher amount that must be met.



Based on this information, your application for a Skilled Worker Visa would likely be **REFUSED**. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's disappointing to hear. I didn't realize the going rate for a CEO was so high at £78,000. So even though my offered salary is above the general threshold, I won't qualify for the visa because it doesn't meet the going rate for my specific role. Is there any way around this? Could the company perhaps reclassify my role to something with a lower going rate, or are there any exceptions for small start-ups?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Claire. It is frustrating when you meet one requirement but not another.

Unfortunately, simply reclassifying your role wouldn't be a viable solution, as the role would need to genuinely reflect the new job title and responsibilities. The Home Office carefully assesses job descriptions.

Regarding exceptions for small start-ups, there aren't any specific exemptions to the going rate requirement based on company size. The rules state clearly that the salary must meet *either* the general threshold *or* the going rate – whichever is higher.

You could explore with the company whether they would be willing to increase your salary to meet the £78,000 going rate. If they are unable to do so, unfortunately, a Skilled Worker Visa is unlikely to be approved with the current offer. 

Would you like me to provide a link to the official guidance on salary requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa, so you can review the details yourself? I can also answer any other questions you may have.

[evaluation_judge]: That would be helpful, yes. I'll need to have a conversation with the company about potentially increasing the salary offer. Could you also tell me if there are any other visa categories I might be eligible for that wouldn't have these same salary requirements? I'm really keen to take this opportunity in the UK if possible.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Claire. I can help with both of those requests.

First, here's a link to the official government guidance on Skilled Worker visa salary requirements: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/salary-requirements](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/salary-requirements)

Now, regarding other visa categories, it's worth exploring if you might be eligible for a different type of visa. However, most UK work visas *do* have salary requirements. Some possibilities, though they come with their own specific criteria, include:

*   **Global Talent Visa:** This is for leaders or potential leaders in specific fields (science, humanities, engineering, the arts, and digital technology). It doesn’t have a fixed salary requirement, but requires endorsement from a recognised endorsing body.
*   **Innovator Founder visa:** This is for experienced business people looking to set up and run an innovative, viable and scalable business in the UK. This also doesn't have a fixed salary requirement, but requires an endorsement.
*   **High Potential Individual (HPI) visa:** This is for graduates from a list of top global universities. It doesn’t require a job offer or a sponsor.

However, these visas all have different eligibility criteria. The Skilled Worker visa is generally the most straightforward route for someone with a job offer.

Would you like me to provide links to information on any of these alternative visa options? Or perhaps we can revisit the Skilled Worker criteria and I can help you determine if increasing your salary to meet the going rate is the most feasible option?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for the information. I think I'll first discuss with the company if they can increase the salary to meet the £78,000 requirement, as that seems like the most direct path forward if they're willing. I'd also appreciate the links to those alternative visa options you mentioned, particularly the Global Talent and Innovator Founder visas, as those might be worth exploring if the salary increase isn't possible.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Claire. That sounds like a sensible plan – discussing a salary increase is a good first step.

Here are the links to the information on the alternative visa options:

*   **Global Talent Visa:** [https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa](https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa)
*   **Innovator Founder Visa:** [https://www.gov.uk/innovator-founder-visa](https://www.gov.uk/innovator-founder-visa)

Please review the eligibility criteria for both carefully to see if either might be a good fit for your situation.

I’m here to help if you have any further questions as you explore these options. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything is unclear or if you’d like to discuss anything further. Best of luck with your conversation with the company!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for all the information. I'll have that conversation with the company and look into these alternative visa options as well. I appreciate your help in clarifying the requirements and giving me some direction on how to proceed. I'll review those links carefully and see which path might work best for me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Claire! I'm glad I could help. I wish you the best of luck with your discussions with the company and your research into the alternative visa options. 

If you have any further questions down the line, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to assist you whenever you need it.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that while my £55,000 salary exceeds the general threshold of £41,700, I would still be refused a Skilled Worker visa because it fails to meet the going rate of £78,000 for CEO positions. The agent accurately identified that I need to meet the higher of the two figures and provided appropriate alternative options.
