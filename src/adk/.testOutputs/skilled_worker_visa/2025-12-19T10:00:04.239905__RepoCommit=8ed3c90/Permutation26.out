[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Klaus, a 45-year-old with a job offer as a welder.

Hi, i'm Klaus and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Klaus, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help!

To start, could you tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 45 years old. I have a job offer as a welder in the UK, and I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a work visa. The company has offered me £30,960 per year. They mentioned something about welding being on a special list that allows them to pay me less than the usual rate.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Klaus. That's very helpful.

Just to confirm, is the job offer for a skilled worker visa, and do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Welder in the UK, according to the official guidance?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's for a Skilled Worker visa. The company mentioned that the going rate for welders in the UK is £38,700, but they told me that because welding is on something called the Immigration Salary List, they can pay me 80% of that rate, which is why they're offering me £30,960. They seem confident this is enough for my visa to be approved.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that, Klaus. It's good you've done some research and asked about the going rate.

To help me understand your situation better, are you a new entrant to the UK labour market? By that, I mean have you been working in the UK for less than 12 months?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't been working in the UK at all. This would be my first job in the UK, but I've been working as a welder for over 20 years in Germany. The company knows I'm experienced, which is why they want to hire me. They didn't say anything about being a "new entrant" - they just mentioned the Immigration Salary List allowing them to pay me less than the full rate.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detail, Klaus. It’s helpful to know you have extensive experience, and that this would be your first UK job.

Just to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that you are not currently on a visa in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: That's correct. I am not currently on any UK visa. I'm still living in Germany and would only move to the UK if this visa gets approved. I've never lived or worked in the UK before.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Klaus.

Based on the information you've provided, and the current rules regarding the Immigration Salary List, I'm afraid your application may be refused. While welding *is* on the Immigration Salary List, being on that list doesn’t automatically allow your employer to pay you 80% of the going rate, unless you are a 'New Entrant' – which you are not, as you have over 20 years of experience. 

The current going rate for a welder is £38,700, and the salary offered of £30,960 is below that. It also falls below the general threshold for the Immigration Salary List, which is currently £33,400.



I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain this further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this further. I'm confused because the company seemed so confident. Are you saying that even though welding is on this special list, they still need to pay me the full £38,700, not just 80% of it? And there's also some minimum threshold of £33,400 that needs to be met?

[root_agent]: You're right to be confused, Klaus, and it's good you're asking for clarification. Your company is unfortunately operating under outdated information.

Previously, with the Shortage Occupation List, employers *could* pay 80% of the going rate in certain situations. However, the rules changed when the Shortage Occupation List was replaced with the Immigration Salary List.

Now, simply being on the Immigration Salary List doesn’t automatically entitle your employer to pay 80% of the going rate. Unless you qualify as a ‘New Entrant’ – someone new to the UK job market – they *must* pay you the full going rate of £38,700.

You are also correct that there's a general threshold. Currently, that's £33,400. Even if the going rate was lower, the salary *still* needs to meet that minimum. In your case, the offered salary of £30,960 doesn’t meet *either* requirement – the full going rate *or* the general threshold.

Essentially, the rules are stricter now, and your employer needs to offer you a salary of £38,700 to meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa.



Does that make things a little clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's much clearer now, thank you. So my employer is using outdated information from when there was a Shortage Occupation List, but now with the Immigration Salary List, the rules are different. Since I'm not a "New Entrant," they need to pay me the full going rate of £38,700, and I also need to meet the general threshold of £33,400. Since my offer of £30,960 doesn't meet either requirement, my visa application would be refused. I'll need to go back to the employer and explain this to them.

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Klaus. You've accurately summarised the situation and the reasons why your current salary offer isn't sufficient.

I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It’s excellent that you plan to discuss this with your employer – hopefully, they will be willing to adjust the salary offer to meet the requirements.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining the current rules so clearly. I'll contact my employer about increasing the salary offer to meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Klaus! I'm happy I could help. 

I wish you the best of luck in your discussions with your employer, and I hope you're able to secure a visa and start your new job in the UK.

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.



Goodbye!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I (as Klaus) would be refused a visa with the offered salary. They accurately explained that being on the Immigration Salary List no longer allows payment at 80% of the going rate unless I was a New Entrant (which at 45 with 20 years experience, I am not). The agent correctly stated I needed to meet both the full going rate (£38,700) and the general threshold (£33,400), neither of which my offer (£30,960) satisfied.
