[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Miguel, a registered nurse from the Philippines, inquiring about visa eligibility with an NHS job offer.

Hi, i'm Miguel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Miguel, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me what type of visa you are hoping to apply for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm looking to apply for a visa to work in the UK. I've been offered a job as a nurse at an NHS hospital. I heard there might be a special visa for healthcare workers, but I'm not sure if I qualify with my salary offer.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you've received a job offer as a nurse with the NHS! You are right to ask about a specific visa – there is the Health and Care Visa which can be a good option for healthcare professionals. 

To best assess your eligibility, could you please tell me what your offered annual salary is?

[evaluation_judge]: The NHS Trust has offered me a position as a Band 5 Nurse with a salary of £28,407 per year. This is the entry-level salary for Band 5 as I understand. I'm coming from the Philippines, and I'm a bit worried because I heard that there's a salary threshold for UK visas that's much higher than this.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Miguel. You are right to be aware of the salary thresholds, as they have recently changed. 

However, the Health and Care Visa *does* have different salary requirements for certain roles, particularly those on the NHS pay scales.

To confirm, is the job you've been offered a direct role within an NHS Trust?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the job is a direct role with an NHS Trust. It's a permanent position as a registered nurse. I've already got my NMC (Nursing and Midwifery Council) registration sorted out too.

[root_agent]: That's excellent news about your NMC registration being sorted – that's a very important step! And knowing it's a direct, permanent position with an NHS Trust is very helpful.

Just to be absolutely certain, could you confirm the specific job title as it appears on your job offer? (e.g., Registered Nurse, Staff Nurse, etc.)

[evaluation_judge]: My job title is "Registered Nurse" as stated on the offer letter from the NHS Trust. It clearly states it's a Band 5 position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Miguel. That’s very clear. 

Given that you are a Registered Nurse offered a Band 5 position with an NHS Trust, and your salary is £28,407, you *do* meet the requirements for the Health and Care Visa. The standard salary thresholds don't apply in this instance, as the NHS Banding takes precedence.



**AWARDED.**



Would you like me to explain any part of this further, or perhaps tell you a bit more about the Health and Care Visa application process?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the Health and Care Visa despite my salary being below the general threshold of £41,700, as NHS pay bands take precedence for healthcare roles like Registered Nurse. The "AWARDED" outcome matches the expected result.
