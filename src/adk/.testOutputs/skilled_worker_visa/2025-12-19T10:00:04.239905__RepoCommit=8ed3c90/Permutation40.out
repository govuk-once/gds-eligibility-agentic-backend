[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Ms. Dubois, a French teacher inquiring about her visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Celine and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Celine, it's lovely to meet you. I'm root_agent, and I can certainly help you explore your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me please, what type of work do you do?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a French teacher at a private school here in the UK. I've been working at the school for a little while now, but I'm from France originally. I work during the school terms only, so not during the holidays.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Celine. That's very helpful.

Could you tell me approximately what your annual salary is? Please state the *actual* amount you earn each year, taking into account that you only work during school terms.





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my actual annual salary is £33,750. That's what I receive for working the 39 weeks of term time. If I worked the full year, the full-time equivalent would be £45,000, but since I only work during term time, my actual earnings are lower.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Celine. So your actual annual salary is £33,750.

To confirm, is your occupation code listed as eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa? (In other words, does your role as a French teacher fall under a qualifying occupation code?)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my role as a French teacher is eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa. It falls under the teaching profession which I understand is on the eligible occupation list. I have a teaching qualification and I'm employed as a secondary school teacher teaching French.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Celine. Thank you for confirming that your role as a French teacher is on the eligible occupation list.

Now, are you currently in the UK with a visa, or are you applying from outside the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently in the UK. I've been working here on a visa that's expiring soon, so I need to understand my options for staying and continuing my teaching position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Celine. That's helpful to know.

To clarify, do you have a PhD qualification relevant to your profession?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a PhD. I have a Master's degree in Education with a specialty in language teaching, but not a doctorate.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Celine.

Finally, is this your first time applying for a Skilled Worker Visa, or have you held one previously?

[evaluation_judge]: This would be my first time applying for a Skilled Worker Visa specifically. My current visa is different, but as it's expiring, I need to switch to something that allows me to continue teaching.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that this is your first time applying for a Skilled Worker Visa, Celine.

Based on the information you've provided – your annual salary of £33,750, your role as a French teacher, having a Master’s degree but not a PhD, and being a first-time Skilled Worker Visa applicant – I'm afraid you do not currently meet the eligibility requirements.

The current salary threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa is £38,700, or £41,700 depending on whether your job is on the immigration skills shortage list. Your actual annual salary of £33,750 is below both of these thresholds.



I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with, or would you like me to explain this further?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave me incorrect information. The current standard salary threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa is £41,700 (not £38,700 as stated), and for term-time workers like myself, the actual salary (£33,750) is what counts, not the full-time equivalent. The agent was correct that I don't meet the threshold, but provided incorrect threshold figures.
