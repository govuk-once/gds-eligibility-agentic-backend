[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Samuel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Samuel, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for different benefits.

To start, could you tell me the specific job title offered to you in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as an in-home care assistant for a private family through a recruitment agency. They're offering quite a good salary - £45,000 per year. I'm originally from Ghana.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Samuel. That's a very good salary! 

To clarify, is your job title specifically listed as a 'Care Worker' (SOC code 6135) or 'Senior Care Worker' (SOC code 6136) on your job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my job title is 'Care Worker' on the offer letter, and I believe it falls under that 6135 code you mentioned. I'll be providing in-home care for an elderly person in a wealthy family.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Samuel. That’s helpful to know.

Is the recruitment agency, or the family you will be working for directly, registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England?

[evaluation_judge]: The recruitment agency is helping me with the visa process and they're a licensed visa sponsor. But when I asked about CQC registration, they said they're not CQC registered since they only act as an introduction service. The family I'll be working for isn't registered either - it's just a private household arrangement.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Samuel. I appreciate you checking with the agency.

Based on the information you've provided, and the rules for the Skilled Worker Visa, I'm afraid your application would likely be **refused**. 

Because your job is as a Care Worker (code 6135), the employer – in this case, either the agency or the family you’ll be working for – *must* be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England. As neither are registered, you unfortunately don't meet that requirement. This is to ensure appropriate standards of care and to protect workers.



I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I was really hoping this would work out as the salary is very good. Could you please explain more about why the CQC registration is needed? Is there any way around this requirement?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Samuel. I understand your disappointment – a salary of £45,000 is indeed very attractive.

The CQC registration requirement for Care Workers is in place to protect both the people receiving care and the care workers themselves. Because you’d be working directly in a private home, the CQC registration ensures there are safeguards to prevent exploitation and guarantee a certain standard of care is being provided. The government wants to ensure care workers aren’t taken advantage of in private arrangements.

Unfortunately, there isn't a way around this requirement for a Care Worker visa. The rules are very specific. Even though the agency is a licensed sponsor, they aren't the direct employer, and they aren't CQC registered. The same applies to the family; they are not a registered care provider.

Essentially, the employer *must* be a CQC-registered entity to sponsor someone under the Skilled Worker Visa as a Care Worker.

I'm very sorry to deliver this news. Is there anything else I can help you with or any other benefits you’d like me to assess your eligibility for?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's really disappointing. I guess I need to look for positions with properly registered care providers instead. Is there any list or database where I can find CQC registered employers who might be hiring care workers? And would the salary requirements be different with those employers?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right, Samuel – looking for positions with CQC-registered employers is the best course of action.

Yes, there is a public register of CQC-registered providers. You can find it here: [https://www.cqc.org.uk/registrations/registered-service-providers](https://www.cqc.org.uk/registrations/registered-service-providers) – you can search by location and service type (e.g., domiciliary care). Many care agencies advertise on websites like Indeed, Reed, and NHS Jobs, and will state their CQC registration in their job adverts.

Regarding salary requirements, they *will* be different. The Skilled Worker Visa has minimum salary thresholds that are reviewed regularly. While £45,000 is well above the current general threshold, the “going rate” for a Care Worker (6135) is lower. A CQC-registered employer would need to meet that specific "going rate" for the role, as determined by the government, *as well as* the general salary threshold. The going rate is currently £20,480 per year, but this can vary slightly depending on the specific location.

However, many CQC-registered employers *do* offer competitive salaries to attract and retain staff, so you may still find good opportunities. It’s a matter of finding the right employer.

I hope this information is helpful, Samuel. Would you like me to check your eligibility for any other types of visas or benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. Thank you for explaining. I'll check out that CQC register website and look for legitimate employers. I think I'll focus on finding a proper CQC-registered care agency before looking into other visa options. No other questions for now, I appreciate your help in explaining why my current offer wouldn't work.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Samuel! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It's a sensible approach to focus on finding a position with a CQC-registered employer. 

I wish you the very best of luck with your job search. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future.



Take care!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that my application would be refused because the employer (either the agency or the family) must be registered with the Care Quality Commission for Care Worker positions. The agent accurately explained that despite the high salary (£45,000) and the agency being a licensed visa sponsor, the lack of CQC registration would result in refusal, which matches the expected outcome.
