[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Lucas in this scenario. I'll interact with the agent who is supposed to provide UK benefit eligibility information, and then evaluate their response against the expected outcome.

Hi, i'm Lucas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Lucas, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help assess your eligibility. To start, could you tell me what your current job is?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Software Engineer at a startup that's not doing very well financially. I've recently been offered a Senior Developer position and I'm wondering if I'd qualify for any benefits given my salary situation.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Lucas. That's helpful. Could you please tell me your annual cash salary for this Senior Developer position? I need the amount *before* any deductions.

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £30,000 as my annual cash salary before deductions. The company is also offering me stock options that are valued at around £50,000 per year with a vesting schedule, but that's not cash in hand.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Lucas. That’s good to know. Just to clarify, are you currently on a visa, or are you a UK citizen?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm on a work visa in the UK. That's actually part of why I'm concerned about the salary situation.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Which type of work visa do you currently hold, if you don't mind me asking? Knowing this will help me understand your situation better.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm applying for the Skilled Worker visa for this new role as a Senior Developer. My current visa with another company is expiring soon, so I need to understand if this new job offer meets the requirements.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Lucas. To assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa with this new role, could you confirm the *total* package value, including the stock options, on an annual basis? I understand the stock options aren't cash, but it helps to have the full picture.

[evaluation_judge]: The total package is valued at £80,000 annually - that's £30,000 in cash salary and £50,000 in stock options that vest over time. But again, the stock options aren't guaranteed income since they depend on the company's performance.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Lucas. Just to be absolutely certain, and for the purposes of the Skilled Worker visa, the Home Office only considers guaranteed salary. So, focusing purely on the cash amount, is £30,000 your total guaranteed annual salary before deductions?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The £30,000 is the only guaranteed salary I'd receive. The rest is in stock options which, as you mentioned, aren't considered guaranteed income.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Lucas. Do you know if the job role itself is on the list of eligible occupations for the Skilled Worker visa? It needs to be a role that's considered to be in demand.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the Senior Developer role is listed as a shortage occupation under the programming and software development category. It has an occupation code beginning with 2136 if I recall correctly.

[root_agent]: That's very helpful to know, Lucas. Finally, could you please confirm your date of birth? This is needed to verify the current salary thresholds.

[evaluation_judge]: I was born on March 15, 1988.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lucas. Based on the information you've provided – a cash salary of £30,000, a role as a Senior Developer which *is* on the eligible occupations list, and your date of birth – I'm afraid you do not currently meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa.

The minimum salary threshold is currently £38,700, or £33,400 if you are a new entrant. Even with the role being on the shortage occupation list, the minimum salary is £38,700. Your offered salary of £30,000 is below both of these thresholds.

Therefore, based on the current criteria, your application would likely be refused. Would you like me to explain any of this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that the application would be refused. They correctly explained that the £30,000 cash salary falls below both the standard threshold (which they stated as £38,700) and the new entrant threshold (£33,400), and properly noted that stock options are not considered as part of the guaranteed salary for visa purposes.
