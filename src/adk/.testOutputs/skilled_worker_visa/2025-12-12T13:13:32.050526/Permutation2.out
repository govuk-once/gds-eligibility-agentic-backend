[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by roleplaying a UK resident seeking visa eligibility information. I'll start the conversation now.

Hello, I'm Liam from Canada. I've just completed my Bachelor's degree here in the UK on a Student Visa. I'm 23 years old and I've received a job offer as a Junior Financial Analyst with a salary of £35,000 per year. I understand the standard going rate for this position is around £42,000. I'm wondering if I would qualify for a work visa? I've heard something about being a "New Entrant" but I'm not sure if that applies to me.

[root_agent]: Okay, Liam. That’s great to hear about your graduation! To help me understand your situation better and determine your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you tell me, are there any existing sponsors involved with this job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been offered the position by a company that's an approved sponsor. They've confirmed they can sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa. They're quite eager to get me started as soon as possible once my student visa expires.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news to hear that you have an approved sponsor! Now, let's move on to the next key factor. Could you tell me what level of skill is involved in the Junior Financial Analyst role you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: The role is classified as requiring a bachelor's degree in finance or related field, which I have. It involves financial modeling, analysis of market trends, and preparing reports for senior analysts. I believe it's considered a skilled role at RQF level 6, as it requires my degree-level knowledge in finance.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Liam. It sounds like a solid, skilled role. Now, let’s talk about English language requirements. Could you confirm that your degree was taught entirely in English?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my entire degree was taught in English here in the UK. I completed a Bachelor's degree in Finance at the University of Manchester. All coursework, exams, and my dissertation were completed in English.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s fantastic. It’s good to know your English language skills are well-established. Let’s move on to the crucial salary aspect. Could you please confirm the standard going rate for a Junior Financial Analyst role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for my role as a Junior Financial Analyst is £42,000 per year. My offer is £35,000, which is below that full rate, but I was told that since I might qualify as a "New Entrant" there could be different requirements.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Liam. Now, let’s focus specifically on your eligibility as a New Entrant. Are you under 26 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm 23 years old.

[root_agent]: Great. And could you tell me a bit about your recent educational background? Specifically, are you a recent graduate or currently in professional training?

[evaluation_judge]: I just finished my Bachelor's degree in Finance at the University of Manchester last month. I'm still on my Student visa which has about two months left before it expires. This would be my first professional job after graduating.

[root_agent]: That’s very helpful to know. Okay, let’s look at the salary details more closely. What is the exact salary you’ve been offered for the Junior Financial Analyst role – £35,000 per year, as you mentioned before?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The job offer is for £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, Liam. Thank you for confirming that. Now, let’s calculate a bit to assess eligibility. The standard going rate for this role is £42,000. Seventy percent of that is £29,400. Does your offered salary of £35,000 meet the lower general threshold of £33,400, and also meet at least 70% of the standard going rate (which we calculated as £29,400)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £35,000 is above the lower general threshold of £33,400, and it's also above 70% of the standard going rate (£29,400). So it seems like I meet both those requirements.

[root_agent]: Excellent! That’s a very positive step. Based on the information you’ve provided – an approved sponsor, a skilled role, English language proficiency, a salary meeting both the lower threshold and the discounted going rate, and your status as a recent graduate – it appears you do qualify as a New Entrant.

Therefore, I’m pleased to inform you that you *are* eligible for a Skilled Worker visa under the New Entrant route. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspects of this route, such as the time limits or any further requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! Yes, could you tell me a bit more about the time limits for the New Entrant route? How long would my visa be valid for, and are there any restrictions I should know about?

[root_agent]: Certainly. Under the New Entrant route, your visa is initially valid for a maximum of three years from the date you first entered the UK. However, it can be extended for a further period of up to 12 months, provided you continue to meet the eligibility criteria. 

A key thing to note is that this visa is intended for individuals starting their first professional employment after graduation. It’s designed to help you gain experience in the UK. You’ll need to demonstrate that you're actively seeking or engaged in relevant employment to maintain your visa status. 

Do you have any specific questions about the time limits or those restrictions, or would you like me to outline any other considerations related to the New Entrant route?

[evaluation_judge]: That sounds good. Since I've been studying here in the UK already, does my time as a student count toward that three-year period, or does the clock start fresh when I switch to the Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: That’s a crucial point, Liam. Your time as a student *does* count toward the three-year limit. The three-year period begins from the date you first entered the UK on your Skilled Worker visa. So, the time you spent studying here as a Student Visa holder will be deducted from the overall three-year validity.

Essentially, the clock restarts when you officially begin working under the Skilled Worker visa. 

Does that clarify things for you? Would you like me to summarise the key points regarding the time limits again, or perhaps discuss what steps you should take to ensure a smooth transition to your new visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, I'm a bit confused. You just said the three-year period begins when I enter on the Skilled Worker visa, but then you said my student time counts toward the three-year limit. Can you clarify which is correct? Does my time as a student count toward the New Entrant period or not?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to question that, Liam! My apologies for the confusion – I’ve worded that incorrectly. You’re correct to point out the contradiction.

**Your time as a Student Visa holder does *not* count towards the three-year limit on the New Entrant route.** The three-year period begins solely when you begin working under your Skilled Worker visa. 

I am still under development and sometimes struggle with clarity, and I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. Let’s go back to basics. To reiterate, the three-year validity of your New Entrant visa starts from the date you first begin working in the UK under your Skilled Worker visa. 

Again, I apologize for the initial confusion. Would you like me to restate any of the key eligibility criteria to ensure we’re on the same page?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes more sense, thank you. One more question - you mentioned earlier that the visa is valid for three years but can be extended for up to 12 months. Is there a maximum time I can spend as a New Entrant? I think I heard something about a 4-year maximum, is that correct?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Liam! My apologies for the continued oversight. There *is* a maximum time limit of four years that you can spend as a New Entrant. This is a key aspect of the route – it’s designed to encourage individuals to gain experience and progress within the UK workforce.

So, to recap: you’ll initially have a visa valid for three years, and you can apply for one 12-month extension. However, the total time you can hold the New Entrant visa cannot exceed four years from the date you first entered the UK on your Skilled Worker visa.

Does that clarify the maximum time you can remain on the New Entrant route?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that clarifies it perfectly. So I can stay on the New Entrant route for up to 4 years total, starting from when I get my Skilled Worker visa. After that, if I want to continue working in the UK, I'd need to meet the standard requirements without the New Entrant concessions, correct?

[root_agent]: That’s precisely right, Liam. Once you’ve reached the four-year limit on the New Entrant route, you would then need to meet the standard requirements for a Skilled Worker visa, without the benefits associated with the New Entrant category.

It sounds like you have a good understanding of the process. I’m glad I could help clarify things for you today. Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding your visa application or any other related questions?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for a Skilled Worker visa under the New Entrant route. They accurately explained that my salary of £35,000 meets both requirements (above £33,400 and above 70% of the going rate), and correctly identified that as someone under 26 and a recent graduate, I qualify as a New Entrant. They also properly explained the 4-year maximum time limit for the New Entrant route.
