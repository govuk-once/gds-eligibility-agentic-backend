[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Sarah, an American historian with a PhD in Modern History who is applying for a Skilled Worker visa for a job in the UK.

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, thank you for speaking with me today. To start, could you please confirm whether you have a current sponsor lined up to support your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a sponsor lined up. I've been offered a position as a Historical Consultant with a media production company in the UK. They've confirmed they're a licensed sponsor for visa applications.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to hear. Let’s move on to the job itself. Could you tell me a little bit about the specific duties and responsibilities of the Historical Consultant role?

[evaluation_judge]: As a Historical Consultant, I'll be working with the production team to ensure historical accuracy in their documentaries and period dramas. My responsibilities include researching historical events and figures relevant to their productions, reviewing scripts and set designs for historical accuracy, providing context for creative decisions, and occasionally appearing as an expert in their documentary programs. I'll be drawing heavily on my PhD research in Modern History to provide authentic historical context for their productions.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Sarah. Now, regarding your salary – what is the annual salary being offered for this Historical Consultant position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £35,000 per year for this position.

[root_agent]: Okay, £35,000 per year. Let’s talk about the role’s skill level. Could you describe the level of skill involved in this Historical Consultant position? Is it a highly skilled role requiring specialist knowledge, or more general historical understanding?

[evaluation_judge]: The role definitely requires specialist knowledge. They specifically wanted someone with a PhD in History because the productions focus on detailed historical events and contexts that require expert analysis. My doctoral research specialization in Modern History is directly applicable to their current slate of productions. The position requires me to make complex historical assessments, provide nuanced interpretations of historical events, and ensure that the productions meet high standards of historical accuracy. It's definitely a role that utilizes my advanced academic training and specialized knowledge.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for clarifying that. Now, let’s discuss salary again. Could you please state the standard going rate for a Historical Consultant role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for a Historical Consultant in my field is around £36,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And to confirm, 90% of that standard going rate would be approximately £32,400, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. 90% of the standard going rate of £36,000 would be £32,400.

[root_agent]: Okay. Finally, could you confirm whether you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. As an American, English is my first language, and I've taught university courses in English during my doctoral studies.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Sarah. Just one final question regarding the salary. Does the offered salary of £35,000 meet the minimum threshold of £37,500 for the Non-STEM PhD option?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't believe it does. My understanding is that the offered salary of £35,000 is below the £37,500 minimum threshold for the Non-STEM PhD option, even though it's above 90% of the standard going rate.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – the sponsor, the role’s skill level, your relevant PhD, and the salary – it appears that this position unfortunately doesn't meet the criteria for the Non-STEM PhD option of the Skilled Worker visa.

Therefore, I have to advise that you would likely be refused under this category.

Do you have any questions about this assessment, or would you like me to explore other visa options that might be a better fit?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. That's disappointing to hear. How much more would I need to make to qualify under this category? And are there any other visa pathways I should consider given my qualifications?

[root_agent]: Let’s break that down. To qualify for the Non-STEM PhD option, you need a salary of £37,500 or higher. Since you’re currently offered £35,000, you would need to increase your salary by £2,500 to meet the minimum threshold.

Regarding other visa pathways, given your PhD in Modern History and your experience, several options might be suitable. Let's discuss the Skilled Worker visa (General route), which doesn’t have the same stringent salary requirements. We could also explore the Global Business Mobility visa if your sponsor is a UK company expanding internationally.

Would you like me to delve deeper into the Skilled Worker visa (General route) or the Global Business Mobility visa, or would you like to discuss other potential pathways?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to discuss the Skilled Worker visa general route. What would be the salary requirements for that option?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s look at the Skilled Worker visa (General route). The salary requirements depend on your job’s skill level as defined by the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code.

For a Historical Consultant, the current threshold is £38,700 for lower-skilled roles, and **£41,720 for skilled roles**, which seems to align best with your position’s specialist knowledge and advanced academic training. 

It’s important to note that the employer needs to prove you meet this minimum salary to the Home Office. 

Would you like me to explain how the SOC code is determined for your role, or would you like to explore other visa options beyond the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information. The general salary threshold is lower than the specialized PhD path threshold, not higher. The correct general threshold should be £26,200, not £41,720, which is why Option B (Non-STEM PhD) has a higher specific threshold of £37,500.
