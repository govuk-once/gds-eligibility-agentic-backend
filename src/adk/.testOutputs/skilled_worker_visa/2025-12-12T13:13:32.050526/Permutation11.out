[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Claire, a US executive with a job offer as CEO of a small UK start-up, and interact with the agent to determine if I'm eligible for a UK work visa based on my salary offer.

[root_agent]: Hello Claire, it’s lovely to speak with you. To start, could you tell me what your current occupation is?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently an executive at a company in the US, but I've received a job offer to be the CEO of a small start-up in the UK. I'm trying to figure out if I'll be eligible for a work visa with the salary they're offering.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. And to confirm, you’re the CEO of this UK start-up, correct? Just to be completely sure, could you tell me the exact job title you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the job offer is for the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at a small start-up based in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, could you please tell me what salary you’ve been offered for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £55,000 per year for the CEO position.

[root_agent]: Okay, £55,000 per year. Just one more question regarding your salary before we move on. Do you believe this salary meets the General Threshold, which is currently £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe it does meet the General Threshold of £41,700 since my offer of £55,000 is higher than that amount.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now, let’s talk about the ‘Going Rate’ for this position. The Going Rate is the typical salary for this role in the UK. Can you tell me what the Going Rate is for a CEO, according to official guidance?

[evaluation_judge]: To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what the official Going Rate is for a CEO position in the UK. The company hasn't shared that information with me. Do you know what the standard Going Rate would be for my role?

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. Let me quickly check the official information. The standard Going Rate for a CEO (Code 1115) is £78,000 per year. Do you have any questions about that figure?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's quite a bit higher than what I've been offered. So the Going Rate for a CEO position is £78,000, but I've only been offered £55,000. Does this affect my eligibility for a work visa?

[root_agent]: Yes, it does. According to the Skilled Worker Visa requirements, you need to meet the *higher* of the two figures – the General Threshold (£41,700) and the Going Rate (£78,000). Since your offered salary of £55,000 is lower than the Going Rate of £78,000, it unfortunately means you wouldn’t currently meet the criteria for a Skilled Worker Visa.

Would you like me to explain the reasoning behind this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'm a bit confused. My salary seems quite good at £55,000, so I'd like to understand why it's not enough for the visa if you could explain more.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker Visa has specific requirements beyond just meeting the General Threshold salary. It also assesses whether your salary meets the ‘Going Rate’ for your occupation. The Going Rate is designed to ensure that skilled workers in the UK are paid appropriately compared to others in similar roles. 

Essentially, the visa system aims to prevent employers from underpaying skilled workers. Because your offered salary of £55,000 is below the £78,000 Going Rate for a CEO, the system flags it as insufficient to meet the visa requirements. 

Does that make more sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. So even though my salary is above the general threshold of £41,700, since it's below the Going Rate for a CEO position (£78,000), I wouldn't qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa. It sounds like the UK government wants to make sure companies aren't bringing in foreign executives at lower salaries than what would typically be paid in the UK market. Is there anything I could do about this situation?

[root_agent]: You’ve grasped it perfectly. The system is designed to protect skilled workers.

Unfortunately, the Skilled Worker Visa criteria are quite strict, and once you don’t meet the Going Rate requirement, it’s difficult to change that. However, there might be other visa options that could be explored, though they would likely require a significantly higher salary.

Would you like me to outline some alternative visa routes we could investigate, or would you prefer to simply conclude our conversation here?

[evaluation_judge]: What other visa options might be available to me? I'm definitely interested in exploring alternatives since I'm really interested in this opportunity.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s look at some possibilities. Given your current situation, the most likely alternative would be the Global Business Mobility visa. This visa is designed for senior employees of multinational companies and allows them to work in the UK, but it does have stricter requirements regarding the employer’s global structure and the role’s responsibilities. 

Another option, though less common, could be a Start-up Visa – however, this is usually for individuals joining a brand-new, innovative start-up. 

It’s important to note that both of these routes would likely require a significantly higher salary than the initial offer – potentially closer to the Going Rate for a CEO role. 

Would you like me to provide you with links to the official webpages for the Global Business Mobility and Start-up Visas, or would you like me to delve deeper into the specific requirements for either of those visas?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd be interested in learning more about the Global Business Mobility visa requirements. Is there anything specific about the employer's structure that would be important to know? This start-up is small but they do have some operations outside the UK as well.

[root_agent]: Yes, absolutely. The Global Business Mobility visa places a strong emphasis on the employer’s international operations. Here's what’s particularly important to know:

*   **Global Group Company:** The company you’re joining needs to be part of a ‘Global Group Company’ – essentially a multinational organization with operations in at least three countries. The start-up needs to demonstrate this structure clearly.

*   **Role’s Global Significance:** Your role as CEO needs to be considered strategically important to the entire Global Group Company, not just the UK branch. This means you’ll need to show how your position contributes to the overall success of the organization internationally.

*   **Subsidiary Status:** The UK start-up needs to be a subsidiary of the Global Group Company.

*   **Documentation:** You’ll need to provide evidence of the Global Group Company’s structure, including its international operations and the start-up’s relationship with the parent company.

I can provide you with links to the official guidance on the Global Business Mobility Visa if you’d like: [https://www.gov.uk/global-business-mobility-visa](https://www.gov.uk/global-business-mobility-visa)

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these requirements, or perhaps discuss how the start-up can demonstrate its eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent correctly identified that I would be refused for a Skilled Worker visa as my £55,000 salary is below the Going Rate for a CEO (£78,000), but then proceeded to suggest alternative visa routes rather than simply concluding with the refusal outcome as expected.
