[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Priya, a Marketing Manager who has been on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022 and is looking to change employers.

Me: Hello! I have a job offer for a Marketing Manager position at a new agency. I've been working in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022, and I'm wondering if I can switch to this new employer. They're offering me £32,000 per year. Will I be eligible for a visa with this new company?

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya, that’s great to hear! To help me understand your situation and determine your eligibility, could you tell me when your current Skilled Worker visa was granted?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been on my Skilled Worker visa since early 2022. I've been working for my current employer for a bit over 2 years now, but I got this exciting opportunity at a new agency and wanted to make sure I can switch my visa to them.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Priya. So, you’ve been on your Skilled Worker visa since early 2022. To clarify, since April 4th, 2024, when did you start working for this new agency?

[evaluation_judge]: I haven't started working for the new agency yet. I'm currently still with my original employer from 2022. I just received the job offer from the new agency, and they're offering me £32,000 as a Marketing Manager. I'm trying to find out if I can switch my Skilled Worker visa to this new employer before accepting the position.

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya. That’s very helpful to know. Just to confirm, you haven’t started working for the new agency and are still currently employed under your existing Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm still working for my original employer under my current Skilled Worker visa that I've had since 2022. I just want to check if I can transfer my visa to this new marketing agency before I accept their job offer.

[root_agent]: Alright. And just to be clear, your current Skilled Worker visa was granted *before* April 4th, 2024, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My current Skilled Worker visa was granted in early 2022, so it was definitely before April 4th, 2024.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Priya. That’s important information. Now, could you tell me what salary you are currently earning under your existing Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently earning about £30,500 in my current role. The new position is offering me £32,000, so it's a bit of an increase.

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya. Thank you for letting me know. Let’s talk about the going rates for Marketing Managers. Currently, the standard going rate for this role is £42,000, but because you’ve held a Skilled Worker visa for a while, you may be eligible for transitional arrangements. Let’s check some details.

Could you confirm whether you’ve held a Skilled Worker visa continuously since before April 4th, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've held my Skilled Worker visa continuously since early 2022, so definitely before April 4th, 2024. I haven't had any gaps in my visa status.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for confirming that, Priya. Now, let’s look at the salary thresholds for those transitional arrangements. The General Salary Threshold is capped at £29,000, and the going rate is based on the 25th percentile, which is £30,000.

Considering your current salary of £30,500 and the stated thresholds, does your current salary meet the Transitional General Threshold of £29,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my current salary of £30,500 is above the £29,000 threshold you mentioned.

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya. And does your current salary also meet the Transitional Going Rate of £30,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my current salary of £30,500 is above the £30,000 transitional going rate as well.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Priya. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’ve held your Skilled Worker visa continuously since early 2022, and that your current salary of £30,500 exceeds both the General Salary Threshold (£29,000) and the Transitional Going Rate (£30,000) – it appears you qualify for the Transitional Arrangements under the Skilled Worker visa rules.

Would you like me to explain how these arrangements might affect your new role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain how these transitional arrangements would apply to my new job offer. The new role is offering £32,000 - would that be enough for me to switch employers?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Priya. Under the transitional arrangements, because you’ve held a Skilled Worker visa before April 4th, 2024, and are changing employers, the General Salary Threshold is capped at £29,000. The going rate is based on the 25th percentile, which is £30,000.

Since your new offer of £32,000 is above both of those thresholds, you are absolutely eligible to switch employers and receive the visa for this new role. It’s great news!

Do you have any other questions about the transitional arrangements or the visa application process?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! So just to make sure I understand correctly - even though the standard going rate for Marketing Managers is £42,000 for new applicants, because I'm already on a Skilled Worker visa from before April 2024, I only need to meet the lower thresholds of £29,000 for the general threshold and £30,000 for the going rate? And since my offer is £32,000, I qualify?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Priya! You’ve understood it perfectly. You’re right to highlight that distinction. Because you’ve held a Skilled Worker visa before April 4th, 2024, you’re protected by these transitional rules. You only need to demonstrate that your salary meets the lower thresholds of £29,000 and £30,000, and your £32,000 offer comfortably exceeds those.

Therefore, yes, you qualify.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding this, or would you like me to move on to a different aspect of the visa process?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming! That's all I needed to know at this point. I'm very relieved that I can accept this new job offer without worrying about my immigration status. I appreciate your help in explaining the transitional arrangements that apply to my situation.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Priya! I'm delighted that I could help clarify things for you and alleviate your concerns. It’s a relief to know you can confidently accept the new job offer. 

If you ever have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a wonderful day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I would qualify for the Skilled Worker visa with the new employer. They properly applied the transitional arrangements rules for someone with a pre-April 2024 Skilled Worker visa, confirming my £32,000 salary exceeds both the transitional general threshold (£29,000) and the transitional going rate (£30,000).
