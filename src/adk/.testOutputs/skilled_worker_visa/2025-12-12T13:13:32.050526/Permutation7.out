[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Kenji, a Graphic Designer from Japan, who has received a job offer in the UK with a salary of £30,000 per year.

Hello, I'm interested in moving to the UK for work. I've received a job offer as a Graphic Designer with a salary of £30,000 per year. Could you help me understand if I'm eligible for a visa?

[root_agent]: Hello Kenji, thank you for reaching out. I’d be happy to help you explore your options.

To start, could you please confirm whether you have a company willing to sponsor your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a company willing to sponsor my visa application. They're a design agency based in London and they've assured me they are a registered sponsor with the UK government.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s excellent news to hear. 

To help me assess your eligibility, could you describe your English language skills? Do you consider yourself proficient in English?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I consider myself proficient in English. I have used English professionally for several years, including working with international clients in my current role in Japan. I've also passed the IELTS test with an overall score of 7.0, which I believe meets the English language requirement.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic, a good IELTS score certainly strengthens your application.

Now, let’s move on to salary. What is the annual salary being offered to you for this Graphic Designer role?

[evaluation_judge]: The annual salary being offered to me is £30,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Just one more question regarding the job itself – could you tell me what level of education you have completed? For example, do you have a Bachelor’s degree, a Master’s degree, or something else?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from Tokyo University of the Arts. I completed this four-year program about 5 years ago and have been working professionally as a graphic designer since then.

[root_agent]: Okay, a Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design from Tokyo University of the Arts – that’s impressive.

Let’s move on to a key aspect of the Skilled Worker visa. The standard threshold salary is £41,700. Would you agree that your proposed salary of £30,000 falls below this threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand that my offered salary of £30,000 falls below the standard threshold of £41,700.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Let’s check the lower threshold as well. The lower threshold salary for the Skilled Worker visa is £33,400. Considering your offered salary, would you agree that this also applies to you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand that my offered salary of £30,000 is also below the lower threshold of £33,400.

[root_agent]: Okay, Kenji. Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you’ve provided – a sponsoring company, proficient English skills, a Bachelor’s degree, and an offered salary of £30,000 – unfortunately, I must advise that you are not eligible for the Skilled Worker visa at this time. The salary offered falls below both the standard and lower thresholds required for the visa.

**REFUSED.**

Do you have any questions about this outcome, or would you like me to explore alternative visa options, although given the salary, they may also be unavailable?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. That's disappointing news, but I appreciate your clear explanation. Are there any other visa pathways I might be eligible for with my qualifications and salary offer? Or would I need to negotiate a higher salary with the employer to meet at least the lower threshold?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Kenji. Let’s explore potential alternatives.

While the Skilled Worker visa seems unlikely with the current salary, let’s consider some other possibilities. The Health and Care visa might be an option if you were to work in an eligible healthcare role, but as a Graphic Designer, that’s not applicable.

Regarding negotiating a higher salary, that’s certainly a viable route. The lower threshold for the Skilled Worker visa is £33,400. If you could successfully negotiate an increase to that level, it would open up the Skilled Worker pathway. However, the feasibility of that increase depends heavily on the employer's budget and the market demand for Graphic Designers in London.

Would you like me to explore any specific areas related to other visa options, or perhaps resources on negotiating salary with a UK employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate if you could briefly outline any other visa options that might be suitable for my situation. If negotiating a higher salary is my best option, I'll need to go back to the employer with a specific figure in mind. Would I need exactly £33,400, or is there some flexibility there? And are there any special circumstances or exceptions that could apply to my case?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s look at some alternative visa options, keeping in mind your background as a Graphic Designer.

Here are a few possibilities to consider:

*   **Global Talent Visa:** This visa is for individuals who are leaders or potential leaders in their field, demonstrating exceptional talent. If you can demonstrate significant achievements or recognition in the graphic design industry—perhaps through awards, publications, or a strong portfolio—this could be an option. The salary requirement is less rigid than the Skilled Worker visa.

*   **Innovator Founder Visa:** If you have a genuinely new, innovative business idea and can demonstrate the potential for it to grow and generate significant revenue, this visa could be suitable. It requires a more substantial investment and a detailed business plan.

*   **Youth Mobility Scheme Visa:** As you are over 18 and from a participating country (Japan), you *might* be eligible for this visa if you are a citizen of a participating country. However, this visa is typically aimed at younger individuals (usually under 30) and there are restrictions on the length of stay and types of work permitted.

Regarding your salary question: While £33,400 is the minimum threshold, there *can* be some flexibility. The Home Office may consider factors such as the cost of living in London and the specific requirements of the role. However, aiming for that figure would significantly improve your chances.

As for special circumstances or exceptions, it’s difficult to predict. A compelling case demonstrating exceptional talent or a genuinely innovative business idea could potentially be considered, but it’s not guaranteed.

Would you like me to provide you with links to the official websites for the Global Talent Visa and the Innovator Founder Visa, or perhaps some resources for researching the Youth Mobility Scheme?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining these options. Yes, I would appreciate links to those visa categories so I can research further. One last question - if I do negotiate with my employer, is the £33,400 threshold inclusive or exclusive of things like benefits and bonuses, or must it be the base salary?

[root_agent]: You’re welcome, Kenji. Certainly, here are the links to the official government pages for those visas:

*   **Global Talent Visa:** [https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa](https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa)
*   **Innovator Founder Visa:** [https://www.gov.uk/innovator-founder-visa](https://www.gov.uk/innovator-founder-visa)
*   **Youth Mobility Scheme Visa:** [https://www.gov.uk/youth-mobility-scheme](https://www.gov.uk/youth-mobility-scheme)

Now, regarding your question about the £33,400 threshold – it is generally understood to be the *base salary* you’d receive. This figure typically excludes benefits like employer-provided health insurance, pension contributions, and performance bonuses. However, it’s always best to clarify this with your employer to ensure you’re both on the same page regarding what constitutes the ‘salary’ for visa purposes. Try to get a written agreement specifying the annual gross salary before you start negotiating.

Would you like me to help you draft a sample email to send to your employer to initiate a salary discussion, outlining the minimum salary you’d require to meet the Skilled Worker visa criteria?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly advised me. The salary floor of £33,400 is a hard minimum for Skilled Worker visas, with no flexibility or exceptions. The agent suggested there "can be some flexibility" and mentioned factors like cost of living, which is incorrect.
