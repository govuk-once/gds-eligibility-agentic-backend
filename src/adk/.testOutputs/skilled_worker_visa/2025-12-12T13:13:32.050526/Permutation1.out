[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by role-playing as Elena, a Brazilian software engineering manager with a job offer in London. I'll interact with the agent to test if they correctly determine my Skilled Worker visa eligibility.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Elena! It’s lovely to speak with you. To start, could you please tell me a little about your current employment situation? Specifically, do you currently work in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't currently work in the UK. I'm a software engineering manager from Brazil with about 10 years of experience in the field. I've received a job offer from a fintech company in London as a Senior Engineering Manager, and I'm trying to understand if I would be eligible for a UK work visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Elena. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about the job offer itself. Could you tell me what the advertised salary is for this Senior Engineering Manager role?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary they've offered me is £85,000 per year. It's a Senior Engineering Manager position at a fintech company in London.

[root_agent]: Okay, £85,000 per year. Thank you. Now, can you describe the job role in a little more detail? Specifically, what level of qualification does the role require, according to the job description or the company? For example, is it RQF Level 4, Level 5, or something else?

[evaluation_judge]: The job requires a bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related field, and at least 8 years of experience, with 3-5 years in a management position. The company mentioned it's classified as RQF Level 6. I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science and 10 years of experience, with the last 4 years in management roles.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Elena. That’s very helpful information. Let’s move on to the going rate for this role. Could you tell me what the standard “going rate” for a Senior Engineering Manager with your experience and qualifications is in London currently?

[evaluation_judge]: The company mentioned that the standard going rate for this role in London is about £75,000 per year. My offer of £85,000 is above this.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for confirming that. Now, to ensure we're covering all bases, could you tell me if the company that’s offering you the job is a licensed sponsor for Skilled Worker visas?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the fintech firm is a licensed sponsor for Skilled Worker visas. They confirmed this when they made the offer and said they've sponsored international employees before.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic news, Elena! It sounds like everything is falling into place. Now, just one more question regarding your English language proficiency. Have you completed an English Language Test (ELT), such as IELTS or TOEFL, and what was the result?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've taken the Secure English Language Test (SELT) and passed with distinction. My English is quite good as I've been working with international teams for several years, including clients from the UK and US.

[root_agent]: Wonderful, Elena. Thank you for providing that detail. Let’s recap – you have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science (RQF Level 6), 10 years of experience with 4 years in a management role, a salary of £85,000 per year, the company is a licensed Skilled Worker sponsor, and you’ve passed the SELT with distinction. 

Based on this information, it appears you meet the standard criteria for a Skilled Worker Visa. Am I correct in assessing your eligibility?

The agent correctly determined that I meet all requirements for the Skilled Worker visa under the standard route.
