[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Wei, a physicist from China with a postdoctoral job offer at a UK university. I'll engage with the agent until they provide me with an eligibility outcome.

[root_agent]: Hello Wei, it’s lovely to speak with you. To help me determine if you might be eligible for some support, could you please tell me, what is your current nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Chinese national. I've recently received a job offer for a postdoctoral researcher position at a UK university, and I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Just to clarify, are you currently residing in China?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently living in China. I received the job offer from the UK university recently, and I need to understand my visa options before making arrangements to move.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Could you tell me what occupation this postdoctoral researcher position is, specifically? I need the occupation code to check its eligibility.

[evaluation_judge]: The position is a Postdoctoral Researcher in Physics. I believe the occupation code is 2114, which is for Physical Scientists. The university included this information in my job offer letter.

[root_agent]: Alright, a Postdoctoral Researcher in Physics – occupation code 2114. Thank you for that information. Now, could you please tell me what salary you’ve been offered for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £33,500 per year for this postdoctoral researcher position.

[root_agent]: Okay, £33,500 per year. Let me just quickly check something… Could you tell me what the standard going rate is for this particular role, as stated in your job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: The standard going rate for this role was mentioned in my offer as £46,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Just one more question for now. To confirm, are you currently sponsored by an employer to work in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I haven't started working in the UK yet. The university that offered me the position is a licensed sponsor, so they'll be sponsoring my visa application to work in the UK.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news to hear. Thank you for clarifying that. Let me just quickly confirm – are you working in a specific postdoctoral occupation, such as 2111 or 2311?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'll be working as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Physics, which falls under occupation code 2114 for Physical Scientists.

[root_agent]: Okay, fantastic. Thank you for confirming that. Let me just quickly analyze the information we’ve gathered…

Based on your employment as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Physics (occupation code 2114), a salary of £33,500 per year, and the standard going rate of £46,000 (70% of that is £32,200), you do meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa discount.

**AWARDED.**

You qualify for the discount specifically designed for scientific research roles. Would you like me to explain anything further about this assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for the visa. They properly assessed my postdoctoral researcher role (2114), verified my salary exceeds both the lower threshold (£33,400) and 70% of the going rate (£32,200), and correctly awarded eligibility matching the expected outcome.
