[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Wei, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and assess your eligibility, could you please tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 25 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, that’s helpful. Have you previously lived and worked in the UK on any type of visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been working in the UK for the past 3 years on a Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just to confirm, is that the *only* type of visa you've held that allowed you to work in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's the only work visa I've had in the UK - just the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa for the past 3 years.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Do you currently have a job offer in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer as a Senior Analyst with a salary of £34,000.

[root_agent]: Great. Are you aware of the 'New Entrant' discount applied to Skilled Worker visa applicants under the age of 26?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm aware of that discount. Since I'm 25, I believe I qualify as a New Entrant and can benefit from the lower salary threshold.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Just so I can be certain, are you hoping to apply for a Skilled Worker visa for 3 years, or for 5 years?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm hoping to apply for a Skilled Worker visa for 3 years.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you've provided, including your previous 3 years on a Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa, unfortunately, you likely won’t be eligible for a full 3-year Skilled Worker visa with the New Entrant salary discount.

The rules state that time spent on Global Business Mobility visas counts towards the maximum time allowed under the 'New Entrant' provisions. You have used 3 years of your allowance, leaving you eligible for only 1 additional year. 

Do you understand this explanation?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I didn't realize that time on a Global Business Mobility visa counted towards the New Entrant limit. So you're saying I can only get one more year at the reduced salary threshold?

[root_agent]: That’s correct. Time spent on a Global Business Mobility visa *does* count towards the 4-year maximum for the New Entrant discount. Since you’ve already spent 3 years on that visa, you have only 1 year remaining of eligibility for the reduced salary threshold. 

A 3-year visa at the discounted rate isn't possible in your case. Would you like me to explain the salary requirements for a 1-year visa, or for a longer-term visa without the New Entrant discount?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to understand both options please - what would be the salary requirements for a 1-year visa with the discount, and what would I need for a 3-year visa without the discount?

[root_agent]: Certainly. Let’s look at the salary requirements for both options.

**1-Year Visa with New Entrant Discount:**

With one year of New Entrant allowance remaining, your salary of £34,000 *does* meet the requirements for a 1-year Skilled Worker visa using the 70% discount. The general threshold is £38,700, but with the discount, it's reduced.

**3-Year Visa Without New Entrant Discount:**

To qualify for a 3-year Skilled Worker visa without relying on the New Entrant discount, your salary would need to meet the full general threshold of £38,700. As your current salary is £34,000, it unfortunately doesn’t currently meet this requirement.

Does that make the situation clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes it clear, thank you. So with my current offer of £34,000, I would only be eligible for a 1-year Skilled Worker visa using what remains of my New Entrant discount. If I wanted the full 3-year visa, I would need to negotiate a higher salary of at least £38,700. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood perfectly! That is absolutely correct. 

With your current salary of £34,000:

*   You are eligible for a **1-year** Skilled Worker visa utilising the remaining New Entrant discount.
*   To be eligible for a **3-year** Skilled Worker visa, your salary would need to be at least **£38,700**.

Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your visa options?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent's information was incorrect. While they correctly identified that my time on a Global Business Mobility visa counts toward the New Entrant time limit, they incorrectly stated I would be eligible for a 1-year visa at the discounted rate. The expected outcome was "REFUSED" because I cannot be granted any visa with the New Entrant discount since my application would be for a standard 3-year period.
