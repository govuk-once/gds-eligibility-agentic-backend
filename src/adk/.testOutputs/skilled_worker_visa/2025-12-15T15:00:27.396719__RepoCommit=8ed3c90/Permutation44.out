[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lukas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lukas, nice to meet you! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you please confirm your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old. I've been offered a junior developer job in the UK with a salary of £34,000. I'm wondering if I'm eligible for a work visa?

[root_agent]: That's great to hear about the job offer, Lukas! A salary of £34,000 usually meets the requirements for a new entrant to the Skilled Worker Visa.

Since you are 17, there are a few extra things to consider. Do you have a letter of consent from your parents or legal guardians allowing you to travel to and be cared for in the UK? This is a requirement for applicants under 18.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a letter from my parents yet. I didn't know I needed one. Is that a problem? I've been living pretty independently at home in Estonia while working on coding projects.

[root_agent]: Yes, unfortunately, that is a problem, Lukas. As you're 17, the Home Office requires explicit written consent from your parents or legal guardians regarding your travel and care arrangements in the UK. Living independently doesn't change this requirement.

Without that letter, your application wouldn’t be successful. It’s a safeguarding requirement for applicants under 18. Would you like me to explain a little more about what the letter needs to include?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain what the letter needs to include. I'll need to talk to my parents about this. Will it affect my ability to get the visa if I get the letter now?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The letter from your parents or legal guardians needs to confirm a few key things:

*   **Consent for travel:** They must explicitly state they consent to you travelling to and living in the UK.
*   **Care arrangements:** They need to detail how your welfare will be safeguarded while you are in the UK. This includes details of where you will be living, who will be responsible for your care (if not yourself), and how they will maintain contact with you.
*   **Financial support:** While not always explicitly stated, outlining how you will be financially supported can be helpful.

Regarding your second question - yes, getting the letter *now* will address this issue and improve your chances of getting the visa. However, it's important to understand that submitting an application *without* it currently would likely lead to refusal. Obtaining the letter and submitting it with your application, or as soon as possible after, is crucial.



Does that make sense, Lukas?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense. So without that consent letter, my application would be refused even though I have a good job offer and salary? I'll need to get this from my parents before I apply then.

[root_agent]: Exactly, Lukas. Unfortunately, yes. Even with a good job offer and a salary that meets the requirements, your application would likely be refused without the parental consent letter due to the safeguarding requirements for applicants under 18.

You are absolutely right to plan to get the letter from your parents *before* you submit your application. It's the key missing piece at the moment. 

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or any other part of the Skilled Worker Visa requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be refused without the required parental consent letter, despite meeting other criteria like the salary requirement. This matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
