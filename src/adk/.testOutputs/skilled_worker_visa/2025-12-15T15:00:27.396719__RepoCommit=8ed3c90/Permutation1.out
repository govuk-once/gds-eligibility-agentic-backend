[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Elena and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Elena, it's lovely to meet you! I understand you're exploring your eligibility for a UK visa. To help me assess which, if any, you might qualify for, could you please tell me - do you have a job offer from a UK employer who is a licensed sponsor?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a job offer from a UK employer who is a licensed sponsor. It's a fintech firm in London. They've offered me a Senior Engineering Manager position.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Elena! Following on from that, is the job you've been offered at a skill level of RQF level 6 or above? This generally includes professional qualifications, bachelor's degrees, and equivalent experience.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the position is at RQF level 6. I have 10 years of experience in software engineering, so the role aligns with my professional background and qualifications.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Now, to confirm, do you meet the English language requirements for the visa? This usually involves passing a Secure English Language Test (SELT) with a required score. Have you taken such a test?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have taken the Secure English Language Test and passed it with distinction. I'm confident that I meet the English language requirements for the visa.

[root_agent]: That's fantastic, Elena! Now let's talk about salary. What is the annual salary offered to you by the fintech firm?

[evaluation_judge]: The fintech firm has offered me an annual salary of £85,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Elena. And do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Senior Engineering Manager role, according to official UK government sources? It's the minimum salary typically required for the position.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the standard going rate for a Senior Engineering Manager role is £75,000 per year, according to what I've been told.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's very helpful. So, just to confirm - your offered salary of £85,000 is above the general threshold of £41,700, and also above the going rate of £75,000 for your occupation. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My offered salary of £85,000 is above both the general threshold of £41,700 and the going rate of £75,000 for my occupation.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! Based on the information you've provided, Elena, it appears you **would be AWARDED** the Skilled Worker Visa. Your salary meets both the general threshold and the going rate for your occupation, and you’ve confirmed you have a sponsoring employer, the role is at the required skill level, and you meet the English language requirements. 

Congratulations! Do you have any other questions about the visa process or anything else I can help you with?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I would be awarded a Skilled Worker Visa as my salary of £85,000 exceeds both the general threshold (£41,700) and the going rate (£75,000), meeting all required criteria.
