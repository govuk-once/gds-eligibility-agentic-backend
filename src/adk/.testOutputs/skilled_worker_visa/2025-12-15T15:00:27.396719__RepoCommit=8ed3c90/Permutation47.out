[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of a user named Dr. Aris who wants to understand eligibility for concurrent employment on a Skilled Worker visa.

Hi, i'm Aris and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Aris, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help!

To understand your eligibility, could you tell me what kind of benefit you are interested in applying for? Specifically, are you looking into options relating to holding more than one job on a Skilled Worker visa?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly what I'm looking into. I'm currently a university lecturer on a Skilled Worker visa working 20 hours per week. I've been offered a research position at a private think-tank for another 20 hours per week. I want to know if I can hold both positions simultaneously and what the visa requirements would be. Do I need to apply for a new visa or can I somehow use my existing one?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Aris. That's very helpful.

It sounds like you're asking about "Concurrent Employment" – holding two jobs under the Skilled Worker visa route. 

To confirm, is the think-tank position also eligible for sponsorship under the Skilled Worker visa, meaning they are willing to provide you with a Certificate of Sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The think-tank has confirmed they are a licensed sponsor and they're willing to provide me with a Certificate of Sponsorship for the research position. I would be working 20 hours per week at the university (my current role) and 20 hours per week at the think-tank, so 40 hours in total. I just want to make sure I can do both jobs legally and understand the correct process.

[root_agent]: That's excellent news that the think-tank is a licensed sponsor and will provide a Certificate of Sponsorship.

To clarify, are you confident that both positions meet the minimum salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa, considering the pro-rated hours for each role? (The requirements depend on the specific job code for each position).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both positions meet the minimum salary requirements even when pro-rated for the 20 hours per week. My university lecturer position already qualified when I got my initial visa, and the think-tank position's salary also meets the threshold for the relevant job code when calculated for 20 hours per week. Both employers have confirmed this with me during our discussions.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Aris. It sounds like everything is aligning well.

Just to be absolutely certain, have you already started the process of applying for your Skilled Worker visa through the university? Or is that visa already approved and you are currently working under it?

[evaluation_judge]: My university visa is already approved and I'm currently working as a lecturer under that Skilled Worker visa. I've been in this position for several months now. The think-tank position is the new opportunity that I'm considering taking on alongside my university work.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very clear. Since you already *have* a Skilled Worker visa through the university, and the think-tank is offering a separate sponsored position, you would need to apply for a *second* Skilled Worker visa specifically for the think-tank position, applying as a case of ‘Concurrent Employment’.

Do you understand that you'll need to submit a new visa application, rather than adding this role to your existing visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand I'll need to apply for a second, separate Skilled Worker visa specifically for the think-tank position. Just to be clear, this won't cancel or replace my existing university visa, correct? And I need to make sure it's marked as a "Concurrent Employment" application?

[root_agent]: You are exactly right, Aris! Applying for a second visa as "Concurrent Employment" will *not* cancel or replace your existing university visa. You would then hold two separate Skilled Worker visas simultaneously, one for each employer.

And yes, it is crucial to clearly mark the application as "Concurrent Employment" to ensure it doesn’t automatically trigger cancellation of your first visa. 

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you **are eligible** for this. Do you have any other questions about the process or anything else I can clarify for you?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news, thank you for confirming. Just one more question - when I submit this second visa application for the think-tank position, do I need to provide any special documentation about my current university position and visa, or is marking it as "Concurrent Employment" sufficient?

[root_agent]: That's a very good question, Aris.

Yes, you *will* need to provide details of your current Skilled Worker visa and employment with the university. The application will likely ask for information such as:

*   A copy of your current visa (Biometric Residence Permit or BRP)
*   Your current Certificate of Sponsorship reference number from the university
*   Details of your current employment (job title, employer details, start date)

While marking it as "Concurrent Employment" is essential, providing this additional documentation helps demonstrate that you are eligible to hold multiple visas simultaneously and prevents any confusion during the application process.



Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So I'll need to:
1. Obtain a Certificate of Sponsorship from the think-tank
2. Apply for a second Skilled Worker visa marked as "Concurrent Employment"
3. Provide documentation of my existing university visa and employment details
4. Make sure both positions meet the salary requirements when pro-rated

Thank you for confirming that I am eligible to hold both positions simultaneously. This helps me plan my next steps with the think-tank opportunity.

[root_agent]: You've summarized that perfectly, Aris! Those are exactly the steps you need to take.

I'm delighted I could help clarify the requirements for Concurrent Employment and confirm your eligibility. I wish you all the best with your new role at the think-tank! 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for all your help. I feel much more confident now about proceeding with this opportunity. I appreciate the clear guidance you've provided!

✓ The agent correctly advised that I am eligible to hold two Skilled Worker visas simultaneously through the Concurrent Employment route, which matches the expected outcome. They accurately explained that I need a second Certificate of Sponsorship and must apply for a second visa marked as "Concurrent Employment" rather than replacing my existing one.
