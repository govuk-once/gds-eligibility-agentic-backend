[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by roleplaying as Dr. Aari, an Indian researcher with a PhD in Microbiology who wants to understand her eligibility for a UK work visa with a job offer as a Senior Lab Technician.

Hi, i'm Aari and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Aari, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for UK benefits. 

To start, could you please confirm if you have a job offer from a UK employer who is a licensed sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a job offer from a UK employer who is a licensed sponsor. They've offered me a position as a Senior Lab Technician at their pharmaceutical company. I'm currently in India and have a PhD in Microbiology, so I'm trying to understand if I qualify for a work visa to come to the UK.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you have a job offer with a licensed sponsor! And a PhD in Microbiology is excellent.

Now, to assess your eligibility further, could you please tell me if the job offered to you is at the required skill level – specifically, is it at a Regulated Qualification Framework (RQF) level 3 or above?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the job is above that skill level. It's a Senior Lab Technician position at a pharmaceutical company, which requires technical expertise and knowledge. Given that they're hiring me with my PhD qualifications, I think it's certainly above RQF level 3. My PhD in Microbiology has prepared me well for this kind of laboratory work.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. It sounds like the job meets the skill level requirement.

Next, can you please confirm that you meet the English language requirements for the visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. I've been studying and publishing research in English throughout my academic career, including during my PhD studies. I've also taken the required English language test as part of my preparation for moving to the UK, and I passed comfortably.

[root_agent]: Excellent! That’s another important requirement met.

Now, I understand you have a PhD in Microbiology. Is your PhD in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics) subject, and is it relevant to the role of Senior Lab Technician?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my PhD is in Microbiology, which is definitely a STEM subject - it falls under the biological sciences. And it's directly relevant to my role as a Senior Lab Technician at a pharmaceutical company. My research focused on bacterial resistance mechanisms, which gives me specialized knowledge for laboratory work in pharmaceutical development and testing. The techniques and knowledge I developed during my doctoral studies align perfectly with what the company needs for their research projects.

[root_agent]: That's fantastic – a relevant STEM PhD is a significant advantage.

Could you please tell me the salary offered to you for the Senior Lab Technician position?

[evaluation_judge]: The pharmaceutical company has offered me £34,000 per year for the Senior Lab Technician position. I'm not sure if that's considered good for this role in the UK, as salary expectations are quite different in India.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. £34,000 is a good starting point for our assessment. 

To proceed, do you know what the standard going rate is for a Senior Lab Technician role in the UK? If so, could you share that information with me?

[evaluation_judge]: From what the employer told me during the interview process, I understand that the standard going rate for a Senior Lab Technician position in the UK is around £38,000 per year. So my offer of £34,000 is a bit lower than that standard rate.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. That’s very helpful.

Just to confirm, the standard going rate is £38,000 per year. As you have a PhD, there's a possibility you might meet the requirements with a lower salary. 

To clarify, does your salary of £34,000 meet at least 80% of the standard going rate of £38,000?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe it does. If 80% of £38,000 is £30,400, then my offered salary of £34,000 is above that threshold. It's about 89% of the standard going rate, if I've calculated correctly.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct in your calculations! £34,000 is indeed above 80% of the £38,000 standard going rate.

Based on the information you've provided, and considering you have a relevant STEM PhD, it appears you **AWARDED** for eligibility. Your PhD allows you to meet the salary requirements, despite it being slightly below the standard going rate, as it meets the discounted rate based on your qualifications.



Do you have any other questions for me?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am awarded eligibility for the skilled worker visa. They recognized that my STEM PhD makes me eligible with the salary of £34,000, which exceeds both the lower general threshold of £33,400 and the 80% of standard going rate requirement (£30,400).
