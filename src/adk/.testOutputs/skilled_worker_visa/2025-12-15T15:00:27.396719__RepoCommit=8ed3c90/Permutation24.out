[evaluation_judge]: I'll adopt the role of Dr. Banu from Turkey and engage with the agent to test their knowledge about UK visa eligibility with an unverified PhD.

Hi, i'm Banu and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Banu, it's lovely to meet you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for UK benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what qualification you hold? Just the highest level of education you've completed would be great.





[evaluation_judge]: Hello! I have a PhD in Chemistry that I completed at a private university in Turkey. I've been working as a researcher for several years, and now I'm considering a job offer in the UK.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Banu! A PhD in Chemistry is a fantastic achievement. 

To assess your eligibility, could you tell me if your PhD has been verified by Ecctis as being equivalent to a UK PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: I did have my qualification assessed by Ecctis, but unfortunately they only determined it was comparable to RQF Level 7, which they said is equivalent to a UK Master's degree, not a doctoral qualification. I was quite disappointed by that outcome since my degree is called a PhD in my country.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Banu. I understand that must be disappointing.

Just to confirm, the job you're considering is for a Senior Chemist, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I've been offered a position as a Senior Chemist in the UK with a salary of £35,000. I was hoping that my PhD would help me qualify for a visa since it's in a STEM field, but I'm concerned about the Ecctis evaluation.

[root_agent]: Thanks for confirming, Banu. It's good to know the position is for a Senior Chemist with a salary of £35,000.

Given the Ecctis assessment, and as you correctly anticipate, it does impact your eligibility. To be clear, are you aware that a STEM PhD can sometimes allow for a slightly lower salary threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly what I was hoping for. I understood that with a STEM PhD, I could qualify for a Skilled Worker Visa with a lower salary threshold than the usual requirement. But I'm worried that since Ecctis only evaluated my qualification as equivalent to a Master's degree, I might not be eligible for this discount. Is that the case?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to be concerned, Banu. Unfortunately, that is the case. 

Because Ecctis did not verify your PhD as equivalent to a UK PhD, you are not eligible to use the salary discount for STEM PhD holders. This means you would need to meet the standard salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa, which is currently £38,700, or £41,700 depending on your occupation code. 

Does your job offer meet that higher salary requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my job offer is only £35,000, which is well below those thresholds. So if I understand correctly, without the STEM PhD discount (since my qualification wasn't verified as equivalent to a UK PhD), I won't be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa with my current job offer. Is that right?

[root_agent]: You understand perfectly, Banu. That is correct. With a salary of £35,000 and without a PhD that is recognised as equivalent to a UK PhD, you unfortunately do not meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa.



I'm very sorry to deliver that news. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on alternative visa routes, or clarification on the Skilled Worker visa requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for clarifying. That's disappointing news for me. Could you briefly tell me what my options might be? Would I need to negotiate a higher salary with the employer to meet that £38,700 threshold, or are there other visa pathways I should consider with my qualifications?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Banu. I understand it's disappointing. Let's look at your options.

Your primary option would be to **negotiate a higher salary** with your employer to meet the £38,700 (or potentially £41,700 depending on the specific job code) threshold. 

Other visa pathways are more limited given your situation. The Skilled Worker visa is generally the most appropriate route for someone with your qualifications and a job offer. Other options, like the Global Talent visa, typically require exceptional talent and endorsement in a specific field – which is a different application process.

Unfortunately, without a recognised PhD or a salary meeting the threshold, your options are quite constrained. Exploring a salary increase with your employer is the most direct path forward. Would you like me to provide a link to the official government guidance on salary thresholds for the Skilled Worker visa, so you can review the details yourself? (Note: I will not *provide* the link, but can confirm it exists if you'd like to find it.)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. Having the official guidance would be helpful when I discuss this with my potential employer. I'll need to see if they can increase the salary offer to meet the threshold. I appreciate your help in explaining this situation clearly.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Banu. I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you.

The official government guidance on Skilled Worker visa salary requirements can be found on the GOV.UK website. You can search for "Skilled Worker visa salary" to locate the relevant page. It details the current thresholds and how they are applied.

I wish you the best of luck in your negotiations with your potential employer. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you very much for your help and guidance. I'll look up that information and discuss it with my potential employer to see if we can find a solution.

✗ The agent incorrectly stated the minimum salary requirement for a Skilled Worker visa. The current general threshold is £38,700, but the agent also mentioned a potential £41,700 threshold "depending on your occupation code" without clarifying that this would be the going rate for specific occupations. Since the scenario indicated the correct threshold is £41,700+ for this specific case, the agent provided incomplete and potentially misleading information about the salary requirements.
