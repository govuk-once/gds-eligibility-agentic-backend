[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Diego and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Diego, I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you tell me, are you currently employed in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I'm a software developer working for a tech company here in the UK on a sponsored visa.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. 

Are you currently planning to take any time off work that would be unpaid?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, actually. I'm planning to take a 2-month unpaid sabbatical to travel around South America. My company has agreed to hold my job for me while I'm away.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know.

To clarify, is this sabbatical leave due to statutory reasons, such as sick leave or maternity leave?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's not for any statutory reasons. It's just a personal sabbatical that I arranged with my employer so I can travel and explore South America for a bit.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. 

Just to be clear, would this sabbatical leave be for longer than 4 weeks in a single calendar year?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it would be for 2 months, so about 8 weeks in total.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Diego.

Based on the rules regarding the Skilled Worker visa, sponsorship may be withdrawn if a sponsored worker is absent from work without pay for more than 4 weeks in any calendar year, *unless* the leave is for statutory reasons like sick or maternity leave. 

Since your planned sabbatical is unpaid and longer than 4 weeks, it appears your company may be legally required to stop sponsoring your visa. Do you understand?

[evaluation_judge]: Are you saying that if I take this 2-month unpaid sabbatical, my company would have to stop sponsoring my visa? What would happen to my status in the UK then?

[root_agent]: Yes, that is correct. Your company would likely be required to withdraw sponsorship if you take the 2-month unpaid sabbatical.

If sponsorship is withdrawn, your visa would be curtailed – meaning it would be shortened, usually to 60 days. During those 60 days, you would need to either find a new sponsor for a Skilled Worker visa, or leave the UK. 

Does that make sense, Diego?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make sense but this is quite serious. So essentially I would lose my right to work and stay in the UK if I take this unpaid sabbatical, and would only have 60 days to either find a new sponsor or leave the country? Are there any alternatives or exceptions I should know about?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation correctly, and it is serious. Losing sponsorship does mean losing your right to work under that visa and having 60 days to find a new sponsor or leave the UK.

Regarding alternatives or exceptions, the rules state exceptions *do* exist for statutory leave like maternity or sick leave. However, as we've established, your sabbatical isn't covered under those categories. 

There aren't other general exceptions for personal sabbaticals, unfortunately. You could potentially discuss with your employer if restructuring the leave – perhaps taking a shorter unpaid period combined with annual leave – would be possible to stay within the 4-week limit. However, that would be a conversation to have with them.

Would you like me to summarise the key points again?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's alright. I think I understand the situation now. If I take this 2-month unpaid sabbatical, my employer would be legally required to withdraw my sponsorship since it exceeds the 4-week unpaid leave limit. Then my visa would be curtailed to 60 days, and I'd need to either find a new sponsor or leave the UK. 

I should probably reconsider my sabbatical plans or talk to my employer about keeping it under 4 weeks. Thank you for explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You've got it exactly right, Diego. You’ve clearly understood the implications. 

I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. It's definitely wise to reconsider or discuss options with your employer. 

If you have any other questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best in figuring out the best course of action!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that sponsorship would be withdrawn due to my unpaid leave exceeding the 4-week limit in a calendar year, and accurately explained the consequences (visa curtailment to 60 days) matching the expected outcome of SPONSORSHIP WITHDRAWAL.
