[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Lina, a hospitality expert with a job offer as a construction laborer, to test the agent's understanding of Skilled Worker visa requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant. I will ask you questions one at a time to determine your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, based on the information provided on the government website. 

Let's start with the job you have been offered. Could you please tell me the exact job title as it appears on your job offer letter?


[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lina, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. To start, could you please tell me the exact job title as it appears on your job offer letter?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Construction Labourer in the UK. The company is willing to sponsor me and has offered me a salary of £45,000 per year. I'm wondering if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa to work in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Lina. That's very helpful. 

To assess your eligibility, I need to understand the skill level of the job. Do you know the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code for a Construction Labourer? It's a 4-digit code.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe the SOC code for the Construction Labourer position is 9120. That's what the employer mentioned in our discussions.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lina. That's good to know.

Now, the Skilled Worker visa requires jobs to be at a certain skill level – specifically, RQF level 3 or above. Do you know what RQF level a Construction Labourer (SOC code 9120) typically falls under?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure about the RQF level. The employer just mentioned the code 9120 and that they're willing to sponsor me for the position with the good salary of £45,000. Could you help me understand what RQF level this job falls under and if I would qualify for the visa?

[root_agent]: Of course, Lina. I can certainly help with that. 

According to the information available, a Construction Labourer (SOC code 9120) is generally considered to be at RQF level 1 or 2. 

Because of this, and as the Skilled Worker visa requires a job to be at RQF level 3 or above, I'm afraid that this role does *not* meet the skill level requirement for the visa.

Therefore, based on the information you've provided, your application for a Skilled Worker visa would be **REFUSED**.



I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with, or would you like me to explain this further?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa because the Construction Labourer job (SOC code 9120) is at RQF level 1-2, which does not meet the required RQF level 3 or above, despite the high salary offer of £45,000.
