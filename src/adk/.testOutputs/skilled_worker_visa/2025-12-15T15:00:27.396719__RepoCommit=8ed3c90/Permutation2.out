[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Liam, it's lovely to meet you. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me your age?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 23 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you! And could you tell me what your current immigration status is – for example, are you currently on a visa, and if so, what type?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently on a Student Visa. I just finished my Bachelor's degree here in the UK. I'm from Canada originally.

[root_agent]: That's very helpful, thank you. Now, have you received a job offer, and if so, what is the job title?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've received a job offer as a Junior Financial Analyst.

[root_agent]: Great! And what is the salary offered with this Junior Financial Analyst position? Please state the amount per year.

[evaluation_judge]: The salary I've been offered is £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Do you know what the standard going rate is for a Junior Financial Analyst in your area? (An approximate figure is fine).

[evaluation_judge]: I was told the standard going rate for this role is about £42,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Excellent, that’s very useful information. Finally, just to confirm, is the company offering you this job a licensed sponsor with the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they are a licensed sponsor with the UK Visas and Immigration.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Liam. Based on what you've told me – your age, your current Student Visa status, the job offer as a Junior Financial Analyst with a salary of £35,000, a going rate of £42,000, and a sponsoring employer – you appear to be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa as a New Entrant.

Specifically, your salary meets both the £33,400 lower general threshold *and* is above 70% of the going rate (£29,400). 

**AWARDED.** You qualify as a New Entrant, allowing you to be paid less than the standard £41,700 and less than the full going rate. *Note: Time on this visa counts toward the 4-year maximum for New Entrants.*



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome of "AWARDED" for my Skilled Worker visa application. They correctly identified that I qualify as a New Entrant (being 23 years old and switching from a Student visa), and confirmed my salary of £35,000 meets both required thresholds: above the £33,400 minimum and above 70% of the going rate (which is £29,400). They also correctly noted that time on this visa counts toward my 4-year maximum as a New Entrant.
