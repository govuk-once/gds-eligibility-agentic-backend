[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of Ali, a PhD student looking to understand if he can switch to a Skilled Worker visa.

Hi, i'm Ali and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ali, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help.

To start, are you currently on a PhD course?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I'm currently in my third year of a four-year PhD program in Engineering at a UK university.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear! And you said you're in your third year – have you completed at least 24 months of your PhD programme so far?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have completed more than 24 months of my PhD program already. I started about two and a half years ago.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Do you have a job offer from a UK employer that is eligible for sponsorship under the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer as an Engineering Consultant from a UK employer who is able to sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: That's fantastic, Ali! Just one final question: have you already completed your PhD course?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't completed my PhD yet. I'm in my third year of a four-year program, so I still have about a year to go before I graduate.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Ali. 

Based on what you've told me – being a PhD student who has completed more than 24 months of your course, having a job offer from a licensed sponsor, and not having yet completed your PhD – you are **AWARDED** eligibility to switch to a Skilled Worker visa.

PhD students have a special concession allowing them to switch before formally graduating, provided they’ve completed at least 24 months of their studies.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for clarifying that! It's a relief to know I can switch to the Skilled Worker visa even though I haven't completed my PhD yet. I was worried I'd have to wait until graduation, so this is really good news. I don't have any other questions at the moment.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa as a PhD student who has completed more than 24 months of study but hasn't graduated yet. This aligns with the expected outcome of "AWARDED" based on the special concession for PhD students.
