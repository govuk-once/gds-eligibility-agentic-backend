[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ravi and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ravi, it's good to speak with you. I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a benefit.

To start, could you please tell me what kind of work you will be doing in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm an IT consultant from India, and I've been offered a job as a System Administrator with TechRecruit Ltd, which is a consultancy firm in the UK. The position pays £50,000 per year. I'm trying to understand if I would be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Ravi. That's very helpful.

Will you be working *at* TechRecruit Ltd, or will you be working at another company – perhaps a client of TechRecruit Ltd?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll actually be working at Bank Corp, which is a client of TechRecruit Ltd. I'll be working there full-time (100% of my time) as a System Administrator, and I'll be reporting to the managers at Bank Corp. It's an indefinite arrangement from what I understand.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Ravi. 

To confirm, will TechRecruit Ltd be directly managing your day-to-day tasks and responsibilities, or will Bank Corp be responsible for that?

[evaluation_judge]: Bank Corp managers will be responsible for my day-to-day tasks and supervision. I'll be reporting directly to them, not to TechRecruit Ltd managers. TechRecruit is just the company sponsoring my visa and paying my salary, but my actual work will be directed by Bank Corp.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so clear, Ravi. 

Could you please describe what kind of tasks you will be performing as a System Administrator at Bank Corp? I'm trying to understand the specifics of your role.

[evaluation_judge]: As a System Administrator at Bank Corp, I'll be responsible for maintaining their IT infrastructure. This includes managing their servers, ensuring network security, troubleshooting technical issues, setting up accounts for new employees, performing regular system updates and backups, monitoring the performance of their systems, and providing technical support to Bank Corp staff when needed. It's essentially a permanent IT support position within their organization that I'll be filling.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi. That gives me a good understanding of your responsibilities.

Considering you’ll be working full-time at Bank Corp, reporting to their managers, and performing a permanent IT support role within their organization, would you say this position is filling a routine, ongoing need for a System Administrator *at Bank Corp*?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, absolutely. This is definitely a routine, ongoing position at Bank Corp. They need a permanent System Administrator to handle their IT infrastructure and support needs, and I'll be filling that role indefinitely. It's a standard, permanent position within their organization.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Ravi.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears your potential sponsorship doesn't meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker visa. The role seems to be a routine, permanent position at Bank Corp, and TechRecruit Ltd would essentially be supplying labor to them, acting more like a recruitment agency. 

Therefore, I am unfortunately unable to confirm your eligibility at this time. Your application would likely be **REFUSED**.



Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you explain why this would be refused? I thought as long as I had a skilled job offer with a proper salary from a UK company that can sponsor visas, I'd be eligible. What's the issue with TechRecruit Ltd sponsoring me while I work at their client's site?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask for clarification, Ravi. It's understandable to be confused! It *is* true that a skilled job offer with a proper salary from a sponsoring company is a key part of eligibility. However, the rules also specify *how* that work needs to be structured.

The issue here revolves around the idea that TechRecruit Ltd shouldn't be providing you as a long-term worker directly *to* Bank Corp to fill a permanent need Bank Corp has. The Skilled Worker visa is designed for companies to hire people directly to fill gaps in *their* workforce, not to effectively outsource a permanent employee to a client.

Think of it this way: if Bank Corp needed a System Administrator permanently, they should be the ones sponsoring the visa themselves. TechRecruit Ltd, as a consultancy, can sponsor you for projects *they* need you for - short-term assignments where *they* are responsible for your work and benefit from your skills directly.

Because you will be working 100% of the time at Bank Corp, under their management, filling a permanent role for *them*, the Home Office will likely see TechRecruit Ltd as acting like a recruitment agency, and that’s not permitted under the Skilled Worker visa rules. It's known as the "routine role" third-party ban.



Does that explanation make things a little clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes much more sense now. So essentially, the issue is that I'd be permanently working at Bank Corp filling their ongoing need, but TechRecruit Ltd would just be acting as a middleman rather than my actual employer in practice. Even though TechRecruit would be paying me, since Bank Corp would be managing me and I'd be filling their permanent position, it looks like an arrangement to get around immigration rules. I understand now why this wouldn't qualify for a Skilled Worker visa. Thank you for explaining this clearly.

[root_agent]: You've understood it perfectly, Ravi! That's exactly the situation. It appears as though the arrangement is designed to circumvent the rules, even if that wasn't the intention.

You're very welcome. I'm glad I could explain it clearly for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your time and for explaining the rules to me. I'll need to reconsider my options now.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ravi. I'm sorry I couldn't deliver more positive news, but I'm glad you have a clear understanding of the situation now. 

I wish you all the best in reconsidering your options and finding a path forward. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be refused due to the "routine role" third-party ban, accurately explaining that TechRecruit Ltd is essentially acting as a recruitment agency supplying labor to Bank Corp, which violates skilled worker visa rules.
