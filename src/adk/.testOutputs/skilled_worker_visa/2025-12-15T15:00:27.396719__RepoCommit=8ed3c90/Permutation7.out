[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Kenji from Japan who's looking for information about visa eligibility with a job offer below the salary threshold.

Hi, i'm Kenji and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Kenji, it’s lovely to meet you! I'm here to help.

To start, could you tell me what kind of benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hello, nice to meet you as well. I've recently received a job offer in the UK as a Graphic Designer, and I wanted to check if I would be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. The company is willing to sponsor me, and they've offered me £30,000 per year. I'm currently living in Japan and hoping to relocate to the UK for this opportunity.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you've received a job offer as a Graphic Designer! It sounds like a very exciting opportunity.

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you please confirm if you have already checked that the company offering you the role is an approved sponsor with the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have checked and the company is definitely an approved sponsor with the Home Office. They have assured me they can sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa. I've already completed all the English language requirements too, so that part is not a concern. I'm just worried about whether the salary they're offering me (£30,000) will be enough for the visa requirements.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know about the sponsorship and your English language skills. You're right to check the salary requirements – they are an important part of the Skilled Worker visa.

Could you tell me, to the best of your knowledge, what the 'going rate' for a Graphic Designer is in the UK, according to official sources (like the government website)? Don't worry if you don't know offhand, just an approximate figure is helpful.

[evaluation_judge]: Based on what I've been told by the employer, the going rate for Graphic Designers in the UK is around £29,000. They said my offer of £30,000 is slightly above this going rate. I wasn't sure if this would be enough for the visa though, as I've heard there are other salary thresholds I need to meet.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Kenji. You are correct to be cautious, as there are indeed salary thresholds that need to be met.

Just to confirm, are you currently holding a PhD, or are you considered a "New Entrant" to the job market (meaning you have less than 3 years of relevant experience)?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a PhD. I have about 5 years of experience as a Graphic Designer in Japan, so I wouldn't be considered a "New Entrant" either. I have a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design, but that's my highest qualification.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Kenji. 

Unfortunately, based on the information you've provided, your salary of £30,000 does not meet the minimum requirements for a Skilled Worker visa. Currently, the general salary threshold is £38,700, and even the lower threshold – which sometimes applies to new entrants or those with PhDs – is £33,400. Your offered salary falls below both of these.

Therefore, I'm afraid to say that, based on the information available, you would **not** currently be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with a salary of £30,000.



I understand this may be disappointing news. Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or perhaps discuss other potential visa routes (although, given your profession, there may not be any immediately obvious alternatives)?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. I thought since my salary was above the going rate for Graphic Designers, I might have qualified. Could you explain why the going rate isn't enough in my case? Is there any way the company could adjust their offer to make me eligible? What would be the minimum they'd need to offer?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask for clarification – it *is* confusing that being above the going rate isn’t enough. The 'going rate' is used to determine if the salary is appropriate for the job, but the Skilled Worker visa has *separate*, fixed salary thresholds set by the Home Office. These thresholds are higher than many 'going rates' for various professions.

Essentially, the government has set a minimum salary floor to control immigration. Even if a company is willing to pay the standard market rate, it must still meet these higher thresholds.

To be eligible, your employer would need to offer a salary of at least £38,700 to meet the general threshold. However, because your job code does *not* currently qualify for the lower threshold (even with experience), there's no lower amount they could offer to make you eligible under the Skilled Worker route.

You could discuss the possibility of a salary increase with your employer, explaining the visa requirements. If they are unable or unwilling to increase your salary to at least £38,700, you unfortunately won’t be able to proceed with a Skilled Worker visa.

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. Thank you for explaining that so clearly. So regardless of the going rate for Graphic Designers, I would need to be offered at least £38,700 to qualify for the Skilled Worker visa. I'll have to talk to the company about whether they can increase their offer to that level.

Are there any other visa options I might be eligible for with my current offer, or is Skilled Worker really the only route for someone in my profession moving to the UK for work?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood perfectly, Kenji. Yes, £38,700 is the minimum currently required for the Skilled Worker visa in your situation.

Regarding other visa options, it’s unlikely there would be a suitable alternative for a Graphic Designer seeking to work in the UK. Most other visa routes are designed for specific circumstances – such as students, family members, or those with exceptional talent.

The Skilled Worker visa is generally the most appropriate route for someone with a job offer. While other visas *exist*, they wouldn't align with your intention to take up employment as a Graphic Designer. 

For example, the High Potential Individual visa doesn't require sponsorship but is for recent graduates of top universities and doesn't directly lead to employment. The Global Talent visa is for leaders or potential leaders in specific fields, which doesn’t typically apply to Graphic Design, unless you have exceptionally high achievements.

Therefore, the Skilled Worker visa remains the most viable option, contingent on meeting the salary requirements. It's best to focus your efforts on discussing a potential salary adjustment with your employer.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's very helpful information, even if it's not what I was hoping to hear. I'll definitely speak with the employer about the possibility of increasing the salary to meet the £38,700 threshold.

It seems like the Skilled Worker visa is really my only option if I want to work as a Graphic Designer in the UK. Thank you for being straightforward about my situation and explaining the requirements so clearly. I appreciate knowing exactly where I stand.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Kenji! I’m glad I could provide you with a clear understanding of your situation. It's always best to have all the information upfront, even if it's not ideal.

I sincerely hope your employer is able to consider increasing your salary, and I wish you the very best in those conversations. If you have any further questions down the line, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

Good luck, and I hope you'll be able to relocate to the UK as a Graphic Designer soon!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for all your help! I'll reach out to my potential employer right away to discuss the salary requirements. I appreciate your guidance on this matter.

✓ The agent correctly identified that I would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with a £30,000 salary, which is below the minimum threshold of £33,400 (and the general threshold of £38,700). The agent accurately explained the requirements and confirmed the expected outcome of refusal.
