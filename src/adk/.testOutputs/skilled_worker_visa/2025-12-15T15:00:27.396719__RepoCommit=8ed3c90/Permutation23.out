[evaluation_judge]: I'll now role-play as Elara, a specialized Engineer, to test another agent regarding eligibility for benefits.

Hi, i'm Elara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Elara, it's lovely to meet you! I’m happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you tell me what your job title is?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Structural Engineer. I've recently received a job offer and I'm trying to figure out if the salary meets the requirements for a skilled worker visa.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear about the job offer, congratulations!

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you please tell me your gross basic salary – that is, the salary *before* any deductions like taxes or pension contributions?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks! My job offer includes a base salary of £38,000. The company is also offering me a car allowance of £5,000 and a housing stipend of £4,000, which brings the total compensation to £47,000. But I'm not sure if that meets the requirements for the visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Elara. It's good you're checking, as it can be a bit complex!

Just to clarify, when assessing eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa, we only consider the gross basic salary. Does that £38,000 represent your salary *before* the car allowance and housing stipend are added?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The £38,000 is my basic salary before any allowances. The car allowance and housing stipend are additional benefits on top of that base amount.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Elara.

Do you know what the current general threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa is? (Don't worry if you don't, I can tell you, but I just want to check if you're already aware!)

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard threshold is £41,700, but I wanted to check if my total compensation package of £47,000 would count toward meeting that requirement.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right, the current standard threshold *is* £41,700.

However, for the Skilled Worker Visa, only your gross basic salary counts towards meeting that threshold. Allowances, such as the car allowance and housing stipend, are *not* included in that calculation.

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, your basic salary of £38,000 does not currently meet the £41,700 threshold.



Unfortunately, this means you would currently be **REFUSED** for a Skilled Worker Visa, based on salary alone.

Would you like me to explain this further, or discuss potential options with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. So even though my total package is worth £47,000, only the £38,000 base salary counts toward the threshold. That's disappointing to hear that I wouldn't qualify. 

What would be my options with the employer? Would they need to increase my base salary to at least £41,700 for me to qualify?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly – even with a total compensation of £47,000, it’s the £38,000 base salary that matters for the Skilled Worker Visa. It is disappointing, I understand.

And yes, you are correct. To qualify, your employer would need to restructure your compensation package to ensure your gross basic salary is at least £41,700. They could achieve this by increasing your base salary directly.

Alternatively, they *could* potentially reduce or remove the car allowance and housing stipend and increase your base salary by an equivalent amount, but the key is that the base salary reaches the £41,700 threshold.

Would you like me to reiterate any aspect of this, or perhaps explain how the sponsor (your employer) would go about making these changes?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand the situation now. So the employer would need to restructure my pay package so that at least £41,700 is listed as my base salary rather than as allowances. That makes sense.

Is there anything else I should be aware of regarding the visa requirements, or is the salary threshold the main concern at this point?

[root_agent]: You've got it exactly right – the employer needs to ensure at least £41,700 is designated as your base salary.

At this point, with the salary being the current issue, it *is* the main concern. However, it’s important to remember that the Skilled Worker Visa has other requirements as well. These include:

*   **Sponsorship:** You need a licensed sponsor (your employer) to assign you a certificate of sponsorship.
*   **Job Skill Level:** The job must be at a skill level of RQF level 3 or above. (Your role as a Structural Engineer likely meets this).
*   **English Language Proficiency:** You'll need to demonstrate English language ability.
*   **Suitability:** Meet suitability requirements (e.g., no criminal record).

However, until the salary requirement is met, those other criteria aren't really relevant to assess. 

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the full list of requirements on the government website (though I can't directly *display* it here)? Or are you happy focusing on the salary issue for now?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for that information. I appreciate you explaining the other requirements too, though as you say, the salary issue needs to be resolved first. I think I have enough information for now - I'll need to go back to my employer and discuss restructuring my compensation package to meet the base salary requirement.

I appreciate your help in clarifying this for me!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Elara! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. 

It sounds like you have a clear plan of action now, which is excellent. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions down the line.

I wish you the best of luck in your discussions with your employer, and with your visa application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent gave the correct outcome that I would be REFUSED for a Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately explained that only the basic salary of £38,000 counts toward the threshold of £41,700, and that allowances (car and housing) cannot be included. The agent correctly advised that my employer would need to restructure my compensation to increase the base salary to meet the threshold.
