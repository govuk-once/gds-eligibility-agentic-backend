[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Leo, a Master's student from China looking for information about switching from a Student visa to a Skilled Worker visa.

Hi, i'm Leo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Leo, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you please tell me what type of visa you currently hold?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently on a Student visa. I'm studying for my Master's degree here in the UK. My course is supposed to finish in September 2026, but I've actually just received a job offer for January 2026 as a Marketing Executive. I'm wondering if I can switch to a Skilled Worker visa while I'm still studying.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Leo. That's good to know you have a job offer already!

To clarify, is your Master's degree course continuous, or do you have scheduled breaks between terms?

[evaluation_judge]: My Master's course is continuous with standard university breaks for Christmas and Easter. It's a standard two-year Master's program at a UK university. I started last September (2024) and it's supposed to run until September 2026. So by January 2026 when this job would start, I'd only be about halfway through my course.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Leo. That’s very helpful. 

Just to confirm, have you completed any exams or coursework as part of your Master's degree yet?

[evaluation_judge]: I've completed the first year's coursework and exams, but by January 2026, I would still be in the middle of my second year, with more coursework and exams to go before completing the full degree. So I haven't completed the entire program yet.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Leo. 

Are you currently enrolled in a PhD program?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not in a PhD program. I'm just doing a Master's degree - it's a two-year Master's in Marketing.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Leo.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you are currently ineligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa while still studying. The rules state that students can only switch once they have *completed* their course, or if they are PhD students and have completed at least 24 months of their studies. As you are mid-way through your Master's degree, and not a PhD student, you don’t currently meet those requirements.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to explain this further?



**REFUSED.**

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. So I can't switch to a Skilled Worker visa in January while I'm still studying. What options do I have if I want to take this job offer?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask about your options, Leo. Since switching while still studying isn't possible, you essentially have two main options:

1. **Complete your studies first:** You could finish your Master's degree in September 2026 and *then* apply to switch to a Skilled Worker visa.

2. **Apply from outside the UK:** You could choose to leave the UK *before* your Student visa expires and apply for a Skilled Worker visa from your home country (China). This is known as "Entry Clearance."

Would you like me to elaborate on either of these options? Perhaps you'd like to know more about the Entry Clearance process?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please tell me more about the Entry Clearance process? Would I have to leave my studies completely to take this job?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Leo. The Entry Clearance process involves applying for the Skilled Worker visa from outside the UK. 

Essentially, you would need to leave the UK *before* your current Student visa expires. You would then apply for the Skilled Worker visa through the British embassy or consulate in China. This application process is separate from switching *within* the UK, and has its own requirements and processing times.

Regarding your studies - yes, to apply for Entry Clearance, you would need to interrupt your studies. You wouldn’t be able to simultaneously hold a Student visa and apply for a Skilled Worker visa from overseas. You would essentially be leaving your course to pursue the job offer, and could potentially resume your studies later if you wished, but you would need to re-apply for a Student visa at that point.

Does that clarify things? Would you like me to provide more detail about any aspect of the Entry Clearance process, such as required documents or typical processing times?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining. So if I understand correctly, I have two options: either complete my Master's degree first and then apply for the Skilled Worker visa, or leave my studies and the UK to apply from China. The job starts in January 2026 and I'm not eligible to switch visas while still studying since I haven't completed my course yet.

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Leo! That's a very accurate summary of your situation and your options. 

You are correct – either completing your Master's degree and *then* switching, or applying for Entry Clearance from China are your available paths forward. And you're also right to reiterate that a switch while still studying isn’t possible given your current course status.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, or are you happy with this information?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that covers what I needed to know. I'll need to decide whether to prioritize completing my degree or taking this job opportunity. Thanks for explaining the visa rules so clearly.

✓ The agent correctly identified that I am not eligible to switch from a Student visa to a Skilled Worker visa while still studying, as I have not completed my course and am not a PhD student. They accurately explained that I would need to either complete my studies first or apply from outside the UK.
