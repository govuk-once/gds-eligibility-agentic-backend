[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Samuel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Samuel, it's good to speak with you. I understand you’d like to understand your eligibility for a benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me what job role you have been offered? Knowing the specific job title will help me assess your situation.





[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as an in-home private carer for a wealthy family in the UK. I'd be working through a recruitment agency that's helping me with the visa process. They're offering me £45,000 per year, which seems quite good. I'm currently living in Ghana and hoping to move to the UK for this opportunity.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Samuel. That's very helpful. 

To clarify, is the job title specifically listed as 'Care Worker' (SOC code 6135) or 'Senior Care Worker' (SOC code 6136) on your job offer or contract?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, on my job offer they have listed me as a 'Care Worker' with the SOC code 6135. The agency said this is the correct classification for the role I'll be doing, providing personal care for the elderly family members in the household.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Samuel. That’s good to know. 

Given that the job is listed as 'Care Worker' (SOC code 6135), could you please confirm whether the recruitment agency, or the family you will be working for directly, is registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England?

[evaluation_judge]: I asked the agency about this when they sent the offer. They told me they're not CQC registered because they only act as an introduction service. They have a sponsorship license for visas, but they mentioned that since I'll be working directly for the family in a private household arrangement, CQC registration doesn't apply to them. Is that going to be a problem?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Samuel. Yes, unfortunately, that *is* likely to be a problem.

As you are applying for a Skilled Worker Visa as a Care Worker (SOC code 6135), your employer – in this case, the agency *or* the family employing you directly – **must** be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England. 

Because the agency is not CQC registered and is acting only as an introduction service to a private household, it doesn’t meet the requirements for this visa route.

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, your application would likely be **REFUSED**.



I understand this may be disappointing news. Would you like me to explain the reasoning in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why it would be refused. I thought since the agency has a sponsorship license and the salary is quite good at £45,000, it would be acceptable. Why is the CQC registration so important?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Samuel. You’re right to question it – a sponsorship license and a good salary are important factors, but in the case of Care Workers, the CQC registration is a crucial additional requirement specifically designed to protect both the workers and those receiving care.

The requirement for CQC registration exists to ensure a certain standard of care and to prevent exploitation of care workers. The government has identified that private household arrangements without CQC oversight can be vulnerable to abusive practices and poor working conditions. 

Essentially, the CQC registration verifies that the employer meets specific standards relating to safe and effective care. Because you will be working directly for a private family, and the agency isn’t providing the care itself but just the introduction, the CQC registration is mandatory.

Even though the agency has a sponsor license and the salary is above the threshold, the specific rules for Care Workers (SOC code 6135) require the *employer* – the entity directly responsible for your work – to be CQC registered. Without that, the application will likely be refused.



Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. So even with the high salary and the agency having a sponsorship license, I can't get a visa for this job because neither the agency nor the family are CQC registered. It sounds like this is a specific protection put in place for care workers like me. 

Is there any way around this, or should I look for employment with a properly CQC registered care provider instead?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Samuel. Exactly – the high salary and agency sponsorship license aren't enough on their own for this particular role. The CQC registration is a non-negotiable requirement for a Care Worker (SOC code 6135) in a private household arrangement.

Unfortunately, there isn’t a way around this requirement. The rules are quite specific.

Your best course of action would be to seek employment with a care provider that *is* registered with the CQC. This would mean working for a care home, a domiciliary care agency, or another organisation that provides care services and is subject to CQC oversight.

While this role seemed promising with the high salary, seeking employment with a CQC-registered provider will significantly increase your chances of a successful Skilled Worker Visa application.



I wish I had better news, but I hope this clarifies the situation and helps you find a suitable and viable employment opportunity.

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. Thank you for explaining this so clearly. I'll look for opportunities with CQC-registered care providers instead of this private arrangement. It's disappointing about the high salary, but I don't want to waste time on an application that will be refused.

✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be REFUSED because neither the agency nor the family are CQC registered, which is a specific requirement for Care Worker visas, despite the high salary and valid sponsorship license.
