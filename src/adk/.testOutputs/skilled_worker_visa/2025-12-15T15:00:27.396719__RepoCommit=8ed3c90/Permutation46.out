[evaluation_judge]: I'll play this role and evaluate the agent's response.

Hi, i'm Yara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Yara, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand which benefits you might be eligible for.

To start, are you currently *in* the UK, or are you applying from abroad?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently outside the UK, applying for a Skilled Worker Visa to come and work there. I lived in the UK before as a student a few years ago.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's very helpful to know, Yara!

The Skilled Worker Visa requires proof of English language ability. Do you have a Secure English Language Test (SELT) certificate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a Secure English Language Test certificate. I passed a B1 level test about 4 years ago when I applied for my Student Visa. I still have the reference number from that test. Can I use that for my Skilled Worker Visa application?

[root_agent]: That’s good you have that certificate and the reference number! 

Just to confirm, is that SELT certificate now expired – meaning more than 2 years have passed since you *took* the test?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's definitely expired. As I mentioned, I took the test about 4 years ago for my previous Student Visa application. That application was successful, and I studied in the UK using that visa. I'm wondering if I can still use the same test results now for my Skilled Worker Visa application.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. That's very useful information, Yara.

To clarify, was the B1 level SELT certificate used for a *successful* UK visa application previously?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, absolutely. I used that B1 SELT certificate for my Student Visa application 4 years ago, and that application was successful. I was granted the Student Visa and completed my studies in the UK using that visa.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that, Yara. 

Just one final quick question – are you confident that the B1 level meets the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa? (The Skilled Worker Visa generally requires B1 level English).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe B1 is the minimum level required for the Skilled Worker Visa. My test was at B1 level when I took it 4 years ago for my Student Visa.

[root_agent]: Excellent!

Based on the information you’ve provided, it looks like you **do** meet the requirements to use your previous SELT certificate, even though it is expired. Because you successfully used it for a previous UK visa application, you are eligible to re-use it for your Skilled Worker Visa application.



Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or are you happy with this initial assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! So I can just provide that same reference number from my previous B1 test when I apply for the Skilled Worker Visa, even though the test was taken 4 years ago? That makes things much easier for me. I'm happy with this initial assessment, thank you for confirming.

[root_agent]: You are very welcome, Yara!

Yes, that's correct. You can provide the reference number from your previous B1 SELT test with your Skilled Worker Visa application, despite it being 4 years old. As long as it was used for a successful previous application, it’s valid for this purpose.

I'm glad I could help make things a little easier for you! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thanks for your help with this! It's great to know I don't need to take another language test for my application.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Yara! I'm delighted I could provide that reassurance. 

I wish you all the best with your Skilled Worker Visa application. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.

Have a lovely day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible to use my expired SELT certificate because it was previously used for a successful UK visa application, matching the expected outcome of "AWARDED."
