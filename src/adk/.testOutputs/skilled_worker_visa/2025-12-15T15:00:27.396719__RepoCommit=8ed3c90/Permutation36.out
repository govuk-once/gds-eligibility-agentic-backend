[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Raj in this scenario where he has been internally promoted but hasn't applied for a new visa despite changing occupation codes.

Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Raj, it's good to speak with you. I'm here to help.

To start, are you currently in the UK on a Skilled Worker Visa?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I've been working for my company as a web developer on a Skilled Worker visa for about two years now. They just promoted me to IT Project Manager last month - it's a great opportunity with better pay. The HR department updated something in their system but said I didn't need to apply for a new visa since I'm still with the same company. I just wanted to check if everything is in order.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear about your promotion, Raj! It's good you're checking to make sure everything is in order.

To clarify, was the job you were initially sponsored under – as a Web Developer – listed with a specific occupation code on your visa? Do you happen to know what that code was?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my original job as a Web Developer was under occupation code 2137. My new role as an IT Project Manager is under a different code, I believe it's 2135. HR just updated their internal systems and told me since I'm staying with the same company, there's no need to apply for a new visa. The salary is good too - I'm now on £50,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Raj. That’s very helpful.

Just to be certain, did you apply for a new visa, specifically a "Change of Employment" visa, *before* starting your new role as an IT Project Manager?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I didn't apply for any new visa. HR told me it wasn't necessary since I'm staying with the same company. They just updated something in their system called the SMS (Sponsorship Management System). I started the new role as IT Project Manager about a month ago and have been working in that position since then. Did I need to do something else?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Raj. Unfortunately, it appears there may be an issue with your current situation.

Because your new role as an IT Project Manager (code 2135) has a different occupation code than your original Skilled Worker visa for Web Developer (code 2137), you were required to apply for a new visa – a "Change of Employment" visa – *before* starting the new position. 

Updating the SMS internally by your HR department isn't sufficient.



Are you aware that working in a role not covered by your current visa can have implications for your immigration status?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I had no idea. No one told me I needed to apply for a new visa. HR just said since I was staying with the same company, everything was fine. What are the implications? Am I working illegally right now? What should I do? I'm quite worried now as I didn't know this was required.

[root_agent]: I understand your worry, Raj, and I’m sorry to deliver this news. You are right to be concerned.

Unfortunately, you are technically working illegally in your current role as IT Project Manager. Because you started the new position without applying for a new visa with the correct occupation code, you are in breach of the Skilled Worker visa requirements.

This could have serious consequences. Your sponsor (your company) could have their sponsorship license revoked, and your visa could be curtailed – meaning it would be cancelled, and you would likely be required to leave the UK.

The first thing you should do is speak to your HR department immediately and explain the situation. They should be aware of the requirement to apply for a new visa when there’s a change of occupation code. They need to urgently begin the process of applying for a “Change of Employment” visa for you.

Do you want me to explain the “Change of Employment” visa process in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the "Change of Employment" visa process. I need to understand what I should have done so I can talk to HR as soon as possible. This is very concerning - I had no idea I was working illegally. How quickly do I need to sort this out? Could I lose my right to stay in the UK over this?

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj, let's break down the "Change of Employment" visa process and the urgency of the situation.

**The Change of Employment Process:**

Essentially, a "Change of Employment" visa (which is applied for *within* the Skilled Worker route - it's not a completely new visa application) is needed when a Skilled Worker changes job roles within the same company *and* that new role has a different occupation code. Here’s what should have happened:

1.  **Sponsor Assignment:** Your company (the sponsor) should have assigned you to the new occupation code (2135) in the SMS.
2.  **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):** They should have issued you a new Certificate of Sponsorship for the IT Project Manager role (2135). This CoS is a key document for your application.
3.  **Application Submission:** *Before* you started the new role, you should have applied online for a new visa, using the new CoS reference number. This involves completing an application form, paying a fee, and providing supporting documents (passport, evidence of qualifications, etc.).
4.  **Biometrics:** You would then need to attend an appointment to provide your biometrics (fingerprints and photograph).
5.  **Decision:** The Home Office would then make a decision on your application.

**Urgency & Potential Consequences:**

You need to address this *as quickly as possible*. The longer you work in a role you're not permitted to, the greater the risk. 

Yes, you *could* lose your right to stay in the UK over this. Here's why:

*   **Visa Curtailment:** The Home Office could curtail your current visa if they discover you're working in a role you're not authorized for. This means your visa would be cancelled, and you’d likely be given a limited time to leave the UK.
*   **Sponsor License Revocation:** The Home Office could revoke your company’s sponsorship license. This would prevent them from sponsoring any future Skilled Workers.
*   **Future Visa Applications:** This breach could negatively impact any future visa applications you might make.

**What to tell HR:**

Explain that you understand you should have applied for a "Change of Employment" visa *before* starting the IT Project Manager role. Emphasize that you relied on their advice that it wasn't necessary, and you were unaware of the specific rules around occupation code changes. Ask them to begin the application process immediately.

Would you like me to help you find resources explaining the Change of Employment process in more detail, even though I can't provide direct links? I can describe the information to you.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful. I'm going to speak with HR first thing tomorrow morning. I had no idea this could lead to such serious consequences. Are there any specific official resources you'd recommend I mention to them? And is there any grace period for these kinds of situations, or am I already at risk of having my visa curtailed? I'm really worried about my status now.

[root_agent]: I understand your worry, Raj, and it’s good you’re planning to speak with HR first thing tomorrow. It's important to address this proactively.

Regarding official resources to mention to HR, you can refer them to the guidance for sponsors on the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) website. Specifically, they should be aware of the requirements around assigning Certificates of Sponsorship (CoS) for different roles and the need for a worker to have a valid visa for the role they are performing. You can mention they should review the section on “changing jobs” or “changing roles” within the Skilled Worker route.

While there isn’t a defined “grace period” for these situations, the Home Office *may* take a more lenient view if your employer takes immediate action to rectify the situation. *However*, there's no guarantee of this. The risk of curtailment exists from the moment you began working in the role without the correct visa.

The key is demonstrating to the Home Office (if you were ever asked to explain this) that:

1.  You acted in good faith, believing you didn’t need a new visa based on advice received.
2.  Your employer is taking swift action to rectify the situation by applying for the “Change of Employment” visa immediately.

I would strongly recommend that HR seek legal advice from an immigration lawyer to ensure they fully understand their obligations and how to best handle this situation.

To summarise, it’s a serious situation, but prompt action from your employer and a demonstration of good faith could mitigate the risk.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this stage? Perhaps you'd like to understand what documents you might need to gather for the "Change of Employment" application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please tell me what documents I should start gathering for the "Change of Employment" application. I want to be as prepared as possible when I speak with HR tomorrow. Also, would you recommend I stop working in my new role and go back to my old position until this is sorted out? Or would that create more issues? I'm trying to figure out the best approach to minimize the damage while we get this fixed.

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj, being prepared is a very sensible approach. Here are the documents you should start gathering for the "Change of Employment" application:

*   **Your Passport:** Including any previous UK visas.
*   **New Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):** This is the most important – your employer needs to provide this to you. It will have a unique reference number.
*   **Proof of Qualifications:** Any certificates or transcripts related to the IT Project Manager role (2135). While you may have submitted these before, it’s good to have them readily available.
*   **Employment Contract:** A copy of your updated employment contract, clearly stating your new role as IT Project Manager and your new salary.
*   **Payslips:** Recent payslips as proof of your current salary.
*   **Bank Statements:** May be requested to demonstrate financial stability.
*   **Any Previous Visa Application Documents:** If you have copies of your original Skilled Worker visa application, it might be helpful to have those.

**Regarding whether to revert to your old role:**

That's a very insightful question. Yes, **I would strongly recommend that you temporarily revert to your previous role as a Web Developer (code 2137) until the "Change of Employment" visa is approved.**

Here's why:

*   **Minimizes Risk:** Continuing to work as an IT Project Manager without the correct visa is actively increasing your risk of curtailment.
*   **Demonstrates Good Faith:** Switching back shows the Home Office that you and your employer are taking the situation seriously and proactively addressing the breach.
*   **Less Complicated Explanation:** It simplifies the explanation to the Home Office; you can clearly state that you stopped working in the unauthorized role as soon as you became aware of the issue.

While temporarily returning to your previous role might be inconvenient, it’s the most cautious and responsible course of action. It’s far better to temporarily step back than risk jeopardizing your immigration status.

Explain this to your HR department tomorrow, and emphasize your willingness to return to your previous role while the "Change of Employment" application is processed.

Do you feel prepared to discuss this with HR tomorrow? Is there anything else I can help you with before then?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for all this information. I do feel more prepared to talk to HR tomorrow, though obviously very concerned about the situation. I'll gather all the documents you mentioned and suggest reverting to my Web Developer role temporarily while we sort this out.

One last question - roughly how long does the "Change of Employment" application usually take to process? I want to have realistic expectations about the timeframe when discussing this with my manager and HR.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Raj. I’m glad I could help you feel more prepared. It's completely understandable to be concerned, but you're taking the right steps.

Regarding processing times for a “Change of Employment” application, it can vary, but here's a realistic expectation:

*   **Standard Processing Time:** Currently, the Home Office states a processing time of **up to 8 weeks** for Skilled Worker visa applications, including “Change of Employment” applications.
*   **Priority Service:** There is a priority service available for an additional fee, which aims to process the application within **5 working days**. However, availability can be limited. Your HR department would need to investigate if this is an option.
*   **Potential Delays:** It’s important to be aware that these are just estimates. Processing times can be affected by factors like the volume of applications the Home Office is receiving, the complexity of your case, and any required further checks.

Therefore, when discussing this with your manager and HR, you should explain that it could take anywhere from **5 working days (with priority service) to 8 weeks** to resolve the situation. Be prepared for the possibility of it taking longer.

It’s also important to emphasize that during this time, you are willing to temporarily revert to your previous role as a Web Developer to minimize any risk to your immigration status.

I sincerely hope everything gets resolved quickly and smoothly for you, Raj. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions later on.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for all this helpful information. I'll plan for potentially up to 8 weeks of processing time and ask about the priority service option. I really appreciate your guidance on this serious matter - I had no idea my promotion could cause such immigration issues. I'll speak to HR first thing tomorrow and get this process started immediately.

✗ The agent incorrectly advised that the user's current situation constitutes a compliance breach and that they are "technically working illegally." According to the scenario, this is correct, but the agent should have identified this violation earlier in the conversation and clearly communicated the need for a Change of Employment visa from the beginning rather than waiting for multiple exchanges to fully explain the serious nature of the situation.
