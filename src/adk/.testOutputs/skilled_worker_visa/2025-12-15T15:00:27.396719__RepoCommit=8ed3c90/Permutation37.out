[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Maria, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in exploring your eligibility for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm actually a nurse on a Skilled Worker visa, and I'm trying to understand if I can legally pick up extra shifts at another hospital. I've been offered agency work at a different hospital, and I want to make sure I'm not breaking any visa rules.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Maria. That's a very sensible thing to check. 

To understand your situation better, approximately how many hours *per week* do you typically work at your primary nursing role (the one your Skilled Worker visa is based on)?

[evaluation_judge]: I work full time at my main job, which is about 37.5 hours per week at a hospital. This is the job that my Skilled Worker visa is tied to.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Maria. And approximately how many *additional* hours per week are you considering working at the agency nursing position at the other hospital? Please give me an average, or an estimate of a typical busy week.

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I'm interested in picking up as many shifts as they'll offer. I worked with them last week during a staff shortage, and I did about 25 hours on top of my regular job. The agency said they'd likely have similar needs in the future. Is that going to be a problem?

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Maria.

Just to be clear, so I fully understand - last week you worked 37.5 hours at your primary job, *and* 25 hours at the agency role. 

Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I worked my regular 37.5 hours at my main hospital job (the one my visa is tied to), and then I did an additional 25 hours at the second hospital through an agency last week. I'm wondering if this is allowed under my Skilled Worker visa or if I'm breaking any rules.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Maria.

Regarding working for the agency, is the type of nursing work you're doing at the agency (the second hospital) the *same* type of nursing work as you do at your primary hospital job – meaning, does it fall under the same occupation code?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's the same type of work. I'm a registered nurse at my main hospital, and at the agency I'm also working as a registered nurse, doing the same kinds of tasks and responsibilities. It's just at a different hospital location.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know, Maria.

Given that the work is the same occupation code, and you're on a Skilled Worker visa, are you aware that there's a limit to how many hours per week you can work in this secondary role, *in addition* to your main job?

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't sure if there was a specific limit. That's why I wanted to check. Is there a maximum number of hours I can work at the second hospital?

[root_agent]: Yes, there is, Maria. The rules state that you can't work more than 20 hours per week in supplementary work (like the agency shifts) *on top of* your contracted hours with your primary employer.

Since you worked 25 hours of overtime at the agency last week, you unfortunately exceeded that limit. This is considered a breach of your visa conditions.



Do you understand?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. I didn't realize there was a 20-hour limit on supplementary work. So by working 25 hours at the agency last week, I've already breached my visa conditions? What could happen because of this? Will my visa be in trouble now?

[root_agent]: Yes, unfortunately, working 25 hours exceeded the limit and is considered a breach of your visa conditions, Maria.

The consequences could include issues with future visa applications or even curtailment of your current visa – meaning it could be cancelled before its original expiry date – if this is detected by the Home Office. It could also affect your ability to settle in the UK long-term.

It’s important to ensure you don’t exceed 20 hours per week in supplementary work going forward. It’s a strict limit.



Would you like me to reiterate any of this, or would you like me to explain anything in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I understand now. I need to limit my agency work to a maximum of 20 hours per week to stay compliant with my visa conditions. I'll make sure to tell the agency that I can't accept more than 20 hours of work per week from now on. Thank you for explaining this to me - it's very important information that I didn't know before.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Maria. I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It’s always best to be aware of the conditions of your visa to avoid any potential issues. 

It’s a good idea to inform the agency of your limitations. 

Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. I'll be sure to stick to the 20-hour limit going forward. Thank you for your help!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Maria! I'm happy I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future.

Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I breached my visa conditions by working 25 hours in supplementary work, exceeding the 20-hour weekly limit for Skilled Workers. They accurately explained the potential consequences of this violation and provided clear guidance on the correct limit going forward.
