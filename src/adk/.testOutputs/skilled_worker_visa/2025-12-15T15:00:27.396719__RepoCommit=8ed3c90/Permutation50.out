[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Sarah, an IT consultant looking for information about her eligibility for a UK work visa.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for UK benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what kind of work you do?

[evaluation_judge]: I work as an IT consultant. I've recently been offered a position with a UK IT firm who want to sponsor me for a visa. They mentioned they would issue something called a CoS for me.

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear about the potential position and the CoS! 

To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me how you will be paid for this work? Will you be paid through PAYE (Pay As You Earn) as a regular employee, or will you be invoicing the company for your services?

[evaluation_judge]: The company actually suggested that I invoice them as a contractor rather than going on their payroll. They said it would save on National Insurance costs. I'd be working under a "Consultancy Agreement" that they called a contract for services. Is that going to be an issue with the visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Sarah. Yes, that *could* be an issue.

To be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa, you generally need to be an employee of the sponsoring company and be paid through PAYE. Invoicing as a contractor, and having a "contract for services", is different from being employed.

Could you confirm if the company is issuing you a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) *despite* wanting you to invoice them as a contractor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. They've said they'll issue me a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) for my visa application, but they want me to work under this "Consultancy Agreement" where I'd invoice them rather than be on their payroll. They seemed to think this arrangement would be fine.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Unfortunately, that arrangement is unlikely to be acceptable for a Skilled Worker visa.

While they are offering a CoS, the visa rules require a genuine employer-employee relationship. Invoicing the company for your services, even with a CoS, suggests you're a contractor, not an employee. This is especially true with a "Consultancy Agreement" which is a contract *for* services, rather than *of* employment. 

To be clear, are you comfortable with being added to the company's payroll and receiving payments through PAYE?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would be fine with being added to their payroll and receiving payments through PAYE if that's what's required for the visa. I just want to make sure I have a valid visa to work in the UK. Should I go back to the company and tell them that their proposed arrangement won't work for my visa?

[root_agent]: Yes, absolutely. You should definitely go back to the company and explain that their proposed arrangement of invoicing as a contractor is unlikely to be accepted by UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) for a Skilled Worker visa, even with a CoS. 

Explain that you need to be employed directly by them and paid through PAYE to meet the visa requirements. It's good that you're willing to be added to their payroll – that's the correct approach.

Would you like me to summarise the key reason why this arrangement is problematic, so you can clearly explain it to them?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, that would be very helpful. If you could summarize the key reason why the arrangement they proposed is problematic, I can explain it clearly to them when I go back to discuss changing it.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here’s a summary you can use:

The Skilled Worker visa requires a genuine employment relationship. This means you need to be an employee of the sponsoring company, subject to their control and direction, and paid through PAYE (Pay As You Earn) like any other employee.

The arrangement they’ve proposed – where you invoice them as a contractor under a “Consultancy Agreement” – indicates a business-to-business relationship, not an employer-employee relationship. Even with a Certificate of Sponsorship, UKVI will likely consider this a non-compliant arrangement because it doesn’t meet the requirements for employment. Essentially, the visa is for *employees*, not self-employed contractors.

You need an employment contract and to be on their payroll to be eligible.



Does that explanation feel clear and helpful for your conversation with the company?

[evaluation_judge]: That explanation is perfect, thank you! I'll go back to the company and explain why I need to be a direct employee on their payroll with a proper employment contract rather than working as a contractor under the Consultancy Agreement. I'll make it clear that even with a CoS, the visa requires a genuine employer-employee relationship with PAYE arrangements, not a business-to-business relationship. This should help them understand what needs to change for my visa application to be successful.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah! I'm really glad I could help clarify things for you. You've clearly understood the situation and have a good plan to address it with the company. 

I wish you the best of luck in your conversation with them and with your visa application. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. You've been extremely helpful in explaining why the proposed arrangement wouldn't work for my visa application. I feel much more prepared to discuss this with the company now.

✓ The agent correctly identified that the contractor arrangement would make me ineligible for a Skilled Worker visa. They accurately explained that I must be an employee paid through PAYE with a genuine employment relationship, not a contractor under a "Consultancy Agreement," which matches the expected outcome of REFUSED.
