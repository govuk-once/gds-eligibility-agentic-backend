[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Klaus and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Klaus, it's lovely to speak with you! I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me your age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 45 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Klaus. 45 years old is helpful to know.

Next, could you tell me what kind of job you have been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Welder. The company told me it's on something called the Immigration Salary List.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Klaus. A job as a Welder on the Immigration Salary List.

Could you please tell me the salary offered for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary they've offered me is £30,960.

[root_agent]: Thank you, £30,960 is helpful information, Klaus.

Do you know what the going rate is for a Welder in your area?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the going rate for Welders is £38,700. The company mentioned they thought they could pay me 80% of that rate because the job is on the Immigration Salary List.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Klaus. So the going rate is £38,700 and the company believes they can pay 80% of that due to the Immigration Salary List.

Just to confirm, have you previously worked in the UK, or is this your first time applying for a visa to work here?

[evaluation_judge]: This would be my first time working in the UK. I've never had a UK visa before.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Klaus, it’s good to know this would be your first UK visa.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears your application would likely be **REFUSED**. Here's why: The rules regarding the Immigration Salary List changed recently. Being on the list doesn't automatically allow a company to pay 80% of the going rate unless you are a "New Entrant" – someone who has *never* worked in the UK before. 

Since this is your first time seeking a UK visa, you might think you qualify as a New Entrant. However, the Immigration Salary List sets a lower general threshold, but you still generally need to meet the full going rate. In your case, the salary offered (£30,960) is below both the full going rate (£38,700) and the current ISL floor (which is above £30,960). 

I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: So even though this is my first time applying to work in the UK, I don't qualify as a "New Entrant"? And the company is wrong about being able to pay me 80% of the going rate just because the job is on the Immigration Salary List?

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly, Klaus. That’s a very good question!

Yes, even though this is your first time applying to work in the UK, the term "New Entrant" has a specific meaning in this context, and simply being a first-time applicant doesn't automatically qualify you. The rules are quite specific.

And you are absolutely right to question the company – they *are* mistaken. The Immigration Salary List does *not* automatically allow them to pay 80% of the going rate simply because the job is on the list. The allowance for 80% of the going rate has changed, and it’s not generally available now, even for jobs on the ISL, unless very specific criteria are met related to being a qualifying New Entrant. 

Essentially, they would need to pay you the full going rate of £38,700 for your visa application to be successful under the current rules.



Is there anything else I can clarify for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the explanation. That's disappointing to hear that my visa would likely be refused. I'll need to talk to the company about this and see if they can meet the full going rate requirement. I appreciate you taking the time to explain this to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Klaus. I’m glad I could provide some clarity, even though it wasn’t the news you hoped for. 

It’s definitely a good idea to discuss this with the company and see if they're able to meet the full going rate. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. I wish you the best of luck in your discussions with your potential employer!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome (REFUSED) and accurately explained that being on the ISL doesn't automatically allow paying 80% of the going rate. The agent correctly identified that Klaus would need to be paid the full going rate of £38,700 for his application to be successful.
