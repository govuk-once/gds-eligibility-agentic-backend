[evaluation_judge]: I'll assume the role of Hans, a German engineer, and engage with the benefits agent to test their knowledge about eligibility requirements.

Hi, i'm Hans and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Hans, it's lovely to meet you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you tell me what benefit you are hoping to apply for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm hoping to apply for a UK work visa. I have a Master's degree from a German university that was taught completely in English. I want to know if I meet the English language requirements for the visa application.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Hans. 

To clarify, are you applying for the Skilled Worker Visa? Knowing this will help me assess your English language requirements accurately.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm applying for a Skilled Worker Visa. I have a job offer from a UK company as an engineer, and I need to meet all the requirements, including the English language requirement.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. That's very helpful to know.

You mentioned you have a Master's degree from a German university taught in English. Do you have a UK university degree, or have you had your German degree assessed by Ecctis?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my degree is not from a UK university. It's from a technical university in Germany. The program was taught entirely in English, and I have a letter from the university confirming this. I haven't had my degree assessed by Ecctis though.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Hans.

Just to be clear, when you say you have a letter from the university confirming the program was taught in English, is that the *only* evidence you have regarding the language of instruction? Did you obtain an English Language Proficiency statement from Ecctis specifically?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the only evidence I have is the letter from my university stating the program was taught entirely in English, along with my degree certificate. I don't have any English Language Proficiency statement from Ecctis. I thought the university letter would be sufficient since it clearly states the program was in English.

[root_agent]: I understand your reasoning, Hans. However, for the Skilled Worker Visa, a letter from the university confirming your degree was taught in English isn't enough on its own if your degree isn't from a UK university. 

To meet the English language requirement, you also need a statement from Ecctis confirming both your qualification's comparability *and* your English language proficiency.

Have you started the process of getting your qualifications assessed by Ecctis at all?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't started the process with Ecctis yet. I didn't realize I needed that. I thought having a letter from my university stating the degree was taught in English would be sufficient. So, I need to get my qualification assessed by Ecctis and specifically get a statement about English language proficiency from them as well?

[root_agent]: Yes, that's correct, Hans. Unfortunately, a letter from your university isn't sufficient proof on its own. 

You need *two* statements from Ecctis: one confirming the comparability of your qualification to a UK degree, and a separate statement specifically verifying your English language proficiency.

Without those Ecctis statements, your application likely won't meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa.



Would you like me to explain anything further about the Ecctis assessment process?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. How do I get these two statements from Ecctis? Is this something I need to pay for? And approximately how long does the process take? I want to make sure I get everything right for my visa application.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Hans. I can provide some information about the Ecctis assessment process.

You'll need to apply for two separate statements through Ecctis: a qualification assessment and an English language proficiency statement. You do need to pay a fee for each statement. You can find information about the current fees on the Ecctis website - though I am unable to provide a direct link. Search for "Ecctis qualification assessment" and "Ecctis English language proficiency".

The process generally involves submitting your degree certificate and transcript to Ecctis for evaluation. They will then compare your qualification to the UK education system and assess your English language ability based on your degree being taught in English.

The processing time can vary, but it generally takes around 15-20 working days *per statement* once Ecctis receives your documents and payment. It’s best to check their website for the most up-to-date processing times as they can fluctuate.

It is important to allow enough time for this process before submitting your visa application.



Does that help clarify things, Hans? Would you like me to ask you any further questions about your situation, or are you happy with this information for now?

[evaluation_judge]: That helps a lot, thank you. So it sounds like I definitely need both of these Ecctis statements to meet the English language requirements for my Skilled Worker Visa. Without them, even though my degree was taught in English, I wouldn't qualify based just on the university letter. I'll need to budget for the fees and allow enough time for processing before submitting my application. I think I have a clear understanding now of what I need to do next.

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Hans. Yes, you absolutely need both Ecctis statements to meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa in your situation. The university letter alone isn't sufficient.

I'm very glad I could help clarify things for you. It’s smart to factor in the fees and processing time now. 

Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you **do not currently meet** the English Language requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today regarding your visa application or any other benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for being so clear about the requirements. I'll get started on the Ecctis applications right away.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Hans! I'm happy I could help. 

It was a pleasure assisting you. I wish you all the best with your visa application and your move to the UK!

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my German degree taught in English would not meet the English language requirement without Ecctis verification. They accurately explained I need two separate Ecctis statements (qualification comparability and English language proficiency) and clearly stated I would be refused without them.
