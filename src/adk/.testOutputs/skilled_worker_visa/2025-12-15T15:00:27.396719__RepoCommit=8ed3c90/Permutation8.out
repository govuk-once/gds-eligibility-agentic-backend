[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Priya and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Priya, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me if you currently hold a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do. I've been living in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022 working as a Marketing Manager. I'm now looking at a job offer with a new agency, and I wanted to check if I'd be eligible to continue on the Skilled Worker route.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Priya. Since you've held a Skilled Worker visa since 2022, and are now changing employers, could you please confirm if you have continuously lived in the UK on the Skilled Worker route since you first arrived in 2022? In other words, has your visa remained current and valid throughout that time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been continuously living in the UK on my Skilled Worker visa since 2022. My visa has remained current and valid the whole time - I've made sure not to let it expire.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know, Priya. Now, could you please tell me the annual salary offered to you by the new agency for the Marketing Manager position?

[evaluation_judge]: The new agency has offered me £32,000 per year for the Marketing Manager position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Priya. To assess your eligibility further, do you know what the 'going rate' for a Marketing Manager is, as determined by the UK government? There are actually two figures available - a 'standard' going rate, and a potentially lower 'transitional' rate. If you don't know both figures, that's okay – just let me know, and I can proceed assuming you don't.

[evaluation_judge]: I've heard that the standard going rate for Marketing Managers is around £42,000, and there's some lower transitional rate of about £30,000, but I'm not entirely sure about these figures. I'm hoping you can confirm if these are correct.

[root_agent]: You're right, Priya. The standard going rate is currently £42,000, and the transitional rate is £30,000. 

Given your current Skilled Worker visa and continuous residency since 2022, and the salary offered of £32,000, it looks like you *do* qualify for the transitional arrangements. 

Based on this, your salary of £32,000 meets both the transitional general threshold of £29,000 and the transitional going rate of £30,000.

Therefore, based on the information provided, you would be **awarded** eligibility to continue on the Skilled Worker route with this new employer. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense! I'm relieved to hear that I qualify under these transitional arrangements. It's great to know that I can continue on the Skilled Worker route with my new employer even though my salary is below the standard threshold that new applicants would need. Thank you for confirming my eligibility!

✓ The agent correctly determined I qualify for the Skilled Worker visa under transitional arrangements, accurately noting that my £32,000 salary exceeds both the transitional general threshold (£29,000) and transitional going rate (£30,000).
