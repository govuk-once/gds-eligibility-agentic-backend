[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Claire, a US executive looking to understand her eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa based on the given scenario.

Hi, i'm Claire and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Claire, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me, do you have a job offer in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a job offer in the UK. I've been offered a position as a CEO for a small tech startup in London. I'm currently based in the US, and I'm trying to figure out if I qualify for a Skilled Worker visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Claire! A CEO role sounds interesting.

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you please tell me your annual salary for this position, *before* tax?

[evaluation_judge]: They're offering me £55,000 per year before tax. It's a startup so they can't offer a massive salary yet, but I'm excited about the opportunity. Is that going to be enough for the visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Claire. £55,000 is a good starting point.

To determine if that salary is sufficient for the visa, could you please tell me the specific occupation code for your CEO role? You can find this on the UK government website under the list of eligible occupations for a Skilled Worker visa. Don't worry if you don't have it immediately, we can work through it if needed.

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have the exact code in front of me, but I know it's a CEO position - Chief Executive Officer. I believe that falls under senior management or executive roles in the occupation list.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Claire. I can look that up for you. 

The occupation code for Chief Executive Officer is 1115. 

Now, to confirm eligibility, do you know what the 'going rate' is for this role, as determined by the UK government? It's a specific amount, and it's important for the visa requirements.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure what the 'going rate' is for this position according to UK immigration rules. Could you tell me what that would be for a CEO position? And how does that affect my visa eligibility?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Claire. The going rate for a Chief Executive Officer (code 1115) is currently £78,000 per year.

To be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa, your salary needs to meet *both* a general threshold *and* the going rate for your specific job. The general threshold is £38,700, but you also need to be paid at least the going rate for your role.

In your case, your offered salary of £55,000 is above the general threshold, but it is *below* the going rate of £78,000 for a CEO.



Unfortunately, this means that, based on the information provided, your application would likely be **refused**. You must meet *both* requirements, and the higher of the two amounts applies. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So even though my salary of £55,000 is above the general threshold of £38,700, I don't qualify because it's below the going rate of £78,000 for a CEO position. That's disappointing, but I understand. Is there anything I can do about this? Would the company need to increase their offer to at least £78,000 for me to qualify?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Claire. That's exactly right.

And yes, you are correct - to qualify for the Skilled Worker visa, the company would need to offer you a salary of at least £78,000 per year to meet the going rate for a CEO. 

Negotiating a higher salary with the company is the primary way to overcome this issue. Otherwise, unfortunately, you wouldn't currently meet the requirements for the visa.



Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or any other questions you might have?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining that clearly. I'll need to go back to the company and see if they can increase the offer to meet the £78,000 requirement. It's a small startup, so I'm not sure if they'll be able to, but at least now I understand what's needed. If they can't meet that salary requirement, are there any alternative visa options I might be eligible for with my executive experience?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Claire. I'm glad I could clarify things for you.

That's a sensible plan to discuss it with the company.

Regarding alternative visa options, based on the information available to me regarding the Skilled Worker visa and its linked resources, I am unable to advise on other visa types. My expertise is limited to assessing eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa specifically.

To explore other potential visa routes, I would recommend visiting the UK government's website and searching for all UK visa options: https://www.gov.uk/browse/visas-immigration. You may also want to consider seeking advice from an immigration lawyer who can assess your individual circumstances and provide tailored guidance.

I wish you the best of luck in your negotiations with the startup and in finding the right visa pathway for your move to the UK! Is there anything else I can help you with *specifically* regarding the Skilled Worker visa at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think you've answered my questions about the Skilled Worker visa requirements. I'll check out the UK government website for other options and maybe consult an immigration lawyer. Thanks again for your help in explaining the salary requirements so clearly.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Claire! I'm happy I could help. 

Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions about the Skilled Worker visa in the future. 

I wish you all the best with your job offer and your potential move to the UK.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome. They accurately explained that while my £55,000 salary exceeded the general threshold of £38,700, it failed to meet the "going rate" of £78,000 for a CEO position (code 1115). The agent correctly stated my application would be refused as I need to meet both requirements, with the higher amount being the determining factor.
