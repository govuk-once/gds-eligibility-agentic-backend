[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of a UK visa applicant named Yara who is seeking information about using an expired SELT test for a new visa application.

Hi, i'm Yara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Yara, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m here to help you understand your eligibility. To start, could you tell me, what type of visa are you applying for today?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm applying for a Skilled Worker visa. I currently live abroad, but I was previously in the UK on a Student Visa a few years ago.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And do you remember which English Language Test (ELT) you took while you were on your Student Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I took a SELT test for my Student Visa. It was at B1 level, and I passed it. That was around 4 years ago though.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Let’s talk about the test itself. Could you tell me if you still have the reference number for that SELT test you took?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have the reference number for that SELT test from 4 years ago. I was planning to submit that same reference number for my Skilled Worker visa application.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news. Just to be clear, when you say “reference number,” are you referring to the specific code or identifier they gave you at the time you took the SELT?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. It's the specific identifier code I received when I took the SELT test 4 years ago. I made sure to keep that documentation since it was important.

[root_agent]: Okay, fantastic. Now, let me ask you this: Do you recall if that SELT test was used for a previous successful UK visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it definitely was. I used it for my Student Visa application which was successful. I completed my studies in the UK using that visa before returning home.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. And just to confirm, the SELT you took was at the B1 level?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The SELT test I took was at B1 level.

[root_agent]: Okay, Yara. Let me check something for you. Considering you took a B1 SELT 4 years ago and used it for a previous successful Student Visa application, is the test expired?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm aware the test is expired since it's been 4 years. Usually they're only valid for 2 years, which is why I was concerned about whether I could use it again for my Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: You’re absolutely right to be concerned about that. Let’s move on to the next part. Was this SELT test used in a previous successful UK visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, as I mentioned, I used this SELT test for my previous Student Visa application which was successful. I completed my studies in the UK with that visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. And just to be sure, can you confirm the level of the SELT test you took? Was it B1?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it was definitely B1 level. That's what was required for my Student Visa at the time.

[root_agent]: Alright, Yara. Thank you for providing all of this information. Based on what you’ve told me – that the test is expired, it was used in a previous successful application, and it was at the B1 level – I’m happy to inform you that you are eligible to use the expired SELT reference number. Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I would like to understand why I can still use it even though it's expired.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The UK government has a specific rule for Secure English Language Tests (SELTs). A SELT is generally valid for two years. However, if you used a SELT for a *previous* successful UK visa application, you can reuse it even if it has since expired. Because you used it successfully for your Student Visa, that previous use overrides the standard two-year expiry period.

Does this explanation make sense to you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense! So because I successfully used it for my Student Visa before, I can reuse the same SELT reference number for my Skilled Worker visa application now, even though it's been 4 years. That's a relief to know. Thank you for explaining that policy to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Yara! I’m delighted I could clarify things for you. It’s good to know that the previous use exception applies. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your Skilled Worker visa application today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that was my main concern. I was really worried I'd have to take another English test since my old one expired, but knowing I can reuse it saves me time and money. Thank you so much for your help today!

[root_agent]: You’re most welcome, Yara! I’m so glad I could assist you. It’s been my pleasure. If anything else comes to mind in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a wonderful day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible to use my expired SELT test for my Skilled Worker visa application because I previously used it for a successful UK Student Visa application, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
