[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you by acting as Sarah, an IT Consultant looking into visa eligibility under the given scenario.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, it’s nice to meet you. To help me assess your situation, could you tell me, do you receive a Payslip from your current employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, thanks for asking. No, I don't receive a payslip. I'm an IT consultant and the company I'm working with wants to hire me on a consultancy agreement where I'll invoice them as a contractor. They said they'll issue me a Certificate of Sponsorship for a work visa though. They mentioned it would save on National Insurance costs if we do it this way.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Sarah. Just to be clear, the company is proposing that you invoice them for your work under a “consultancy agreement,” and they’ll provide a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) for a work visa, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. The IT firm wants to set me up under a consultancy agreement where I'd invoice them for my work rather than being on their payroll. They've assured me they'll still provide a Certificate of Sponsorship for my work visa. They specifically mentioned this arrangement would save on National Insurance payments. Is this going to work for my visa application?

[root_agent]: Okay, Sarah. Thank you for confirming that. I want to be completely sure I understand your situation correctly. Could you tell me, does the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) that the company is offering relate to a genuine employment relationship, or is it for a contract-based arrangement?

[evaluation_judge]: The Certificate of Sponsorship they're offering is for a contract-based arrangement. They've been very clear that they want me to work under a "Consultancy Agreement" which is a contract for services, not an employment contract. I'd be invoicing them as a contractor rather than being on their payroll as an employee. They specifically mentioned this would be better for both of us tax-wise, particularly regarding National Insurance.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sarah. This is very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, it appears the company wants you to operate as a self-employed contractor, even though they’re providing a Certificate of Sponsorship. 

To help me assess this further, could you please confirm whether you receive a Payslip from any current or previous employers?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't receive a payslip from my current position, and under this proposed arrangement, I wouldn't receive one either. The whole setup they're suggesting is that I'd be self-employed and invoice them for my services as a contractor. I'd be responsible for my own taxes and wouldn't be on their PAYE system at all. They're suggesting this consultancy agreement specifically to avoid the usual employer-employee relationship.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sarah. That’s very important to know.

Considering you wouldn’t be receiving a Payslip and are being offered a consultancy agreement with invoicing, it’s crucial to understand the rules around the Skilled Worker Visa. The visa requires individuals to be employed through a genuine employment relationship, meaning you must be on the sponsor’s PAYE system. 

Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears this arrangement, where you're operating as a self-employed contractor, would not meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Therefore, I must advise that **REFUSED**. A sponsor cannot sponsor a self-employed individual under this visa category.

Do you have any questions about this outcome, Sarah?

[evaluation_judge]: So this arrangement they're proposing won't work for a visa? That's concerning because they seemed quite confident about it. Are you absolutely certain that I can't be sponsored while working as a contractor? Is there any type of visa that would allow for this arrangement?

[root_agent]: You’ve raised a very valid point, Sarah, and I understand your concern. Let me clarify. The Skilled Worker Visa *specifically* requires you to be employed through a genuine employment relationship, meaning you need to be on the sponsor’s PAYE system – receiving a Payslip – as an employee.

Regarding whether there’s another visa that would allow for a contractor arrangement, it's complex. There isn’t a direct pathway for self-employed individuals under the Skilled Worker Visa. However, there are other visa options – such as the Global Business Mobility Visa – that *might* be suitable depending on the specific circumstances of your work and the company you're working with. 

However, those visas have different criteria and requirements than the Skilled Worker Visa, and it’s important to consult with an immigration advisor to determine if you'd be eligible. 

Would you like me to provide you with some information on the Global Business Mobility Visa, or would you prefer to speak with an immigration advisor to explore your options further?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I'd like to look into the Global Business Mobility Visa and maybe talk to an immigration advisor. It sounds like what the company was proposing won't work under the Skilled Worker Visa rules. I appreciate you being clear about that - it's better I know now rather than after submitting an application that would be refused.

Just to be absolutely clear - for a Skilled Worker Visa, I would need to be a direct employee on their PAYE system, not a contractor with a consultancy agreement, is that right?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s absolutely correct, Sarah. For a Skilled Worker Visa, you must be a direct employee on the sponsor’s PAYE system – receiving a Payslip – to qualify. A consultancy agreement and invoicing as a contractor wouldn’t meet the criteria.

Thank you for confirming that, and for seeking clarification to ensure you’re making an informed decision. I’m glad I could help you understand the requirements.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or would you like me to provide you with any additional resources as you explore the Global Business Mobility Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that the arrangement would lead to a REFUSED outcome, accurately explaining that the Skilled Worker visa requires a genuine employment relationship with the applicant being on PAYE, not working as a self-employed contractor under a consultancy agreement.
