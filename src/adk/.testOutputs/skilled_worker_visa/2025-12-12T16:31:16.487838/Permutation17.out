[evaluation_judge]: I'll now role-play as Yuki, who is seeking information about her eligibility to take on a second job while on a Skilled Worker visa.

Hi, i'm Yuki and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Yuki, it’s nice to meet you. To help me understand your situation, could you tell me a bit about the main job you currently have? Specifically, what is your job title?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently working as a Graphic Designer at a marketing agency. I'm here on a Skilled Worker visa - my employer sponsored me for this role.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And could you tell me what occupation code your Graphic Designer role falls under? You can usually find this information on your visa or employment contract.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe my occupation code is 3421 - Graphic Designers. It's listed on my Certificate of Sponsorship that my employer provided when I got my Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Just to be clear, you’re currently employed as a Graphic Designer with occupation code 3421, and you hold a Skilled Worker visa sponsored by your employer, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm employed full-time as a Graphic Designer with occupation code 3421, and I have a Skilled Worker visa that my current employer sponsored me for.

[root_agent]: Alright. And you mentioned you’re interested in taking on a second job – could you tell me what kind of work you’re considering doing?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm considering taking a weekend job as a bartender at a local pub. It would only be about 10 hours per week, just to earn some extra money on weekends when I'm not at my main job.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let's talk about this potential second job. Could you tell me what you understand the hourly pay rate to be for this bartending position?

[evaluation_judge]: The hourly pay rate would be around £12 per hour for the bartending position. It's nothing fancy, just a local pub looking for weekend help.

[root_agent]: Okay, £12 per hour. Thank you for that information. Now, I want to check if this second job aligns with the rules for your Skilled Worker visa. Considering your main job is as a Graphic Designer (occupation code 3421), is the bartending job in the same occupation code – Graphic Design – or does it fall under any of the shortage occupations listed on the Immigration Salary List?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the bartending job is definitely not in the same occupation code as my Graphic Designer role. And as far as I know, bartending isn't on the shortage occupation list either. It's just a standard hospitality role at a local pub.

[root_agent]: Okay, Yuki. Thank you for clarifying that the bartending job is not in the same occupation code as your Graphic Designer role and is not on the Immigration Salary List. Based on this information, it appears that taking on this second job could be a violation of the conditions of your Skilled Worker visa.

Specifically, the rules state you can take a second job if it’s in the same occupation code as your main job, or if it’s a shortage occupation. Since neither of those conditions are met, this potentially constitutes illegal work.

Do you have any questions about this assessment, or would you like me to elaborate on why this situation is problematic?

[evaluation_judge]: I appreciate you explaining that clearly. I didn't realize there were such strict rules about second jobs. If I wanted to earn some extra money legally, would I be able to do freelance graphic design work instead? That would be in the same occupation code as my main job.

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Yuki. Yes, undertaking freelance graphic design work would likely be a permissible way for you to earn extra income while on your Skilled Worker visa. As long as the work you’re doing as a freelancer falls under the same occupation code (3421 - Graphic Designers) and you’re earning a salary that meets the requirements for your visa, it should be fine. 

Would you like me to explain a little more about the requirements for freelance work under your Skilled Worker visa, such as ensuring you’re paying the correct taxes and National Insurance contributions?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful. I'd like to understand what I need to do to make sure everything is legal if I take on some freelance graphic design work. How would I handle taxes and National Insurance in that situation?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s talk about taxes and National Insurance when you’re working as a freelancer under your Skilled Worker visa.

Firstly, you’ll need to register as self-employed with HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs). This involves registering for Self Assessment. You’ll then be responsible for calculating and paying Income Tax and National Insurance contributions through Self Assessment tax returns.

It's important to understand that as a Skilled Worker, you're generally required to pay Class 2 National Insurance contributions on your earnings from self-employment - this is different from the usual system.

You'll also need to keep accurate records of all your income and expenses, as these can be used to reduce your tax bill. Services like Xero or FreeAgent can be helpful for managing your finances as a freelancer.

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the HMRC website for more information about registering as self-employed and paying taxes as a Skilled Worker? [https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-for-smes](https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-for-smes)

[evaluation_judge]: That's very useful information. Yes, please do share that link. I'll make sure to register properly with HMRC if I decide to do freelance work. Is there any limit to how many hours I can spend on freelance graphic design work alongside my main job?

[root_agent]: You’re welcome! Here’s the link to the HMRC website: [https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-for-smes](https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-for-smes)

Regarding the number of hours you can work on freelance graphic design alongside your main job, the Skilled Worker visa has a key restriction: you can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week in *any* secondary employment. This includes freelance work.

It’s important to adhere to this limit to avoid violating the terms of your visa. Do you have any other questions about the rules surrounding secondary employment or the process of registering as self-employed?

[evaluation_judge]: So just to clarify, as long as I stick to freelance graphic design work and limit it to 20 hours per week maximum, I should be able to do this legally with my Skilled Worker visa, correct? And I'll need to register with HMRC as self-employed and handle my own taxes for this additional work. Is there anything else I should be aware of?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s absolutely correct. As long as you limit your freelance graphic design work to a maximum of 20 hours per week and comply with all HMRC requirements, it should be permissible under your Skilled Worker visa.

There’s one more important point to be aware of: your sponsor (your employer) needs to be informed about your intention to undertake freelance work. They'll likely require you to provide them with a copy of your Self Assessment tax return to demonstrate that you’re managing your tax obligations correctly.

It’s also a good idea to review your contract with your employer to ensure there are no clauses that restrict your ability to take on freelance work.

Do you feel that you have a comprehensive understanding of the rules and requirements now, or would you like me to delve into any specific area in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense. I'll be sure to inform my employer and check my contract for any restrictions. I think I have a good understanding of the requirements now - I can do freelance graphic design work up to 20 hours per week, must register with HMRC, and need to inform my employer. I'm glad I asked before taking that bartending job, as I wouldn't want to violate my visa conditions. Thank you for all the helpful information!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Yuki! I’m so glad I could help clarify things for you and prevent any potential issues with your visa. It’s always best to be informed and proactive when it comes to immigration rules. 

If you ever have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. It was a pleasure assisting you today.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly advised that taking a bartending job would be illegal under my Skilled Worker visa conditions, as it's neither in the same occupation code as my main job nor on the Immigration Salary List. They also correctly explained that freelance graphic design work would be permitted as it's in the same occupation code, matching the expected outcome.
