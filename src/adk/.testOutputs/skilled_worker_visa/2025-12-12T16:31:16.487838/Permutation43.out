[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Diego, a software developer, asking about my eligibility to take unpaid leave while on a sponsored visa.

Hi, i'm Diego and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Diego, it’s nice to meet you. I’m happy to help you understand your options. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the leave you’re considering? Specifically, how long are you thinking of being away from work?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I've been working as a software developer here in the UK for about a year now on a sponsored visa. I'm planning to take a 2-month unpaid sabbatical to travel through South America. My company has already agreed to hold my job for me while I'm away. I just want to make sure this won't affect my visa status or anything.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Diego. That’s very helpful. Just to confirm, you’re planning to be away from work for two months, which is approximately eight weeks, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm planning to be away for 2 months, which is about 8 weeks. My company is fine with it and they've agreed to hold my position for me until I return. I just want to make sure there won't be any issues with my visa since I'm sponsored by my employer.

[root_agent]: Alright. Let’s talk a little more about the leave itself. Would you describe this leave as “statutory,” meaning it’s related to something like sickness or maternity leave?

[evaluation_judge]: No, this isn't statutory leave. It's just an unpaid sabbatical that I've requested so I can travel around South America for a couple of months. It's purely personal time off that my employer has agreed to.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Diego. So, this is a planned, unpaid period of time off for personal travel. Now, let me ask you this: do you anticipate being absent from work without pay for more than four weeks during the course of a calendar year?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'll definitely be absent without pay for more than four weeks. The sabbatical I'm planning is for 2 months, which is about 8 weeks total. This would be the only unpaid leave I'm taking this calendar year.

[root_agent]: Okay, Diego. Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re planning on being absent without pay for more than four weeks in a calendar year – it appears your sponsorship could be withdrawn. 

Would you like me to explain why that is, based on the criteria I have access to?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why this could be an issue. I thought since my employer agreed to it, everything would be fine with my visa. I'd really appreciate understanding what the problem is.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker visa rules state that a sponsor – which is your employer in your case – must stop sponsoring you if you are absent from work without pay for more than four weeks within a calendar year. 

Since your planned absence of eight weeks exceeds this limit, and it's your only unpaid leave planned for the year, your employer is legally obligated to withdraw their sponsorship. This would lead to your visa being curtailed – shortened to just 60 days – and you would need to either leave the UK or find a new job sponsoring your visa within that timeframe. 

Does that explanation make sense, Diego?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I had no idea! That's really serious. So even though my employer is happy for me to go and keep my job, they would legally have to withdraw my sponsorship because the unpaid leave exceeds 4 weeks? And then I'd only have 60 days to either leave the UK or somehow find another sponsor?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Diego. Your employer’s agreement to hold your position doesn't override the legal requirements of the Skilled Worker visa. They are still bound by the rules regarding absences without pay. And yes, if sponsorship is withdrawn, you'd have approximately 60 days to either depart the UK or secure a new sponsoring employer. 

I understand this is concerning news. Would you like me to outline some potential options you might explore, such as looking for alternative visa routes or discussing a shorter leave period with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please! I really want to travel but I also don't want to jeopardize my ability to stay and work in the UK. What options might I have? Could I potentially take a shorter trip that stays under the 4-week limit? Or are there any other solutions you can suggest?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s explore some options, Diego. Yes, taking a shorter trip that remains under the four-week limit would certainly be a way to avoid the sponsorship withdrawal. You could potentially plan a shorter sabbatical and maintain your visa status.

Alternatively, you could discuss with your employer the possibility of taking the leave in a different calendar year. This would allow you to comply with the four-week rule. 

Another potential, though more complex, route would be to explore if you qualify for any other visa categories that don't have similar restrictions on absences. However, this would require careful assessment of your specific circumstances and might involve lengthy application processes.

Would you like me to delve deeper into any of these options, or perhaps discuss the possibility of a shorter trip in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I'd like to explore the option of a shorter trip or maybe splitting up my leave across different calendar years. How exactly does the 4-week rule work? Is it strictly 28 days in a calendar year, or could I potentially take, say, 3 weeks this year and 5 weeks early next year? Would that work within the rules?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Diego, and it’s important to understand the specifics. The 4-week rule is calculated based on calendar years – January 1st to December 31st. It’s measured in *continuous* periods of absence without pay.

So, your suggestion of taking 3 weeks this year and 5 weeks next year *could* work, as long as the absences don't overlap significantly. The key is that the total continuous period of absence without pay across the entire calendar year must not exceed four weeks. 

Essentially, it’s about ensuring that no single period of unpaid leave stretches for longer than four weeks.

To be absolutely certain about your specific situation, I would recommend discussing this with your employer and, if you’re unsure, seeking advice from an immigration lawyer. They can provide tailored guidance based on your individual circumstances. 

Would you like me to help you structure a conversation with your employer to discuss these potential arrangements?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think I'll need to have a careful conversation with my employer about this. Just to make sure I understand - if I take 3 weeks unpaid leave in December 2023 and then 5 weeks in January 2024, that should be compliant because they're in different calendar years, right? Even though they would be back-to-back?

[root_agent]: You've got it precisely, Diego! That’s exactly right. Because the 4-week rule applies to each *calendar year* independently, taking 3 weeks in December 2023 and 5 weeks in January 2024 would be compliant. The absences are in different years, so they don’t count against each other.

It's good you’re clarifying this – it’s a common point of confusion. Do you want me to help you formulate some questions to ask your employer to ensure they understand the situation and are willing to support your proposed arrangements?

[evaluation_judge]: That would be great, yes. I'd like to have a clear way to explain this to my employer so they understand the visa implications and why we need to structure my leave in this specific way. What questions should I make sure to ask them?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s craft some questions for your conversation with your employer, Diego. Here’s a suggested list, categorized for clarity:

**1. Confirming Understanding & Commitment:**

*   “Just to confirm, you’re still happy to hold my position while I’m away on leave?”
*   “Can we discuss the potential impact of my leave on my Skilled Worker visa sponsorship?”

**2. Clarifying the 4-Week Rule:**

*   “I want to ensure I’m compliant with the visa regulations. Could you confirm how the 4-week absence rule is interpreted within the context of my sponsorship?”
*   “Would taking my leave in two separate calendar years – like 3 weeks in December 2023 and 5 weeks in January 2024 – be acceptable from a sponsorship perspective?”

**3. Exploring Solutions & Flexibility:**

*   “Are there any alternative arrangements we could consider to minimize any potential impact on my visa?”
*   “Would it be possible to discuss a slightly shorter leave period to ensure full compliance with the rules?”

**4. Seeking Confirmation in Writing (Important):**

*   “Could we document this agreement – outlining the dates of my leave and confirmation that my sponsorship will remain in place – in an email or letter?”

Would you like me to help you draft a specific opening statement incorporating these questions, or perhaps tailor them to your specific situation and relationship with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Those questions are really helpful, thank you! I think I have enough guidance now to approach my employer with this plan. I'll definitely make sure to get everything documented in writing too.

Just to summarize what I've learned: if I take more than 4 weeks of unpaid leave in a calendar year, my employer would be legally required to withdraw my sponsorship, which would result in my visa being curtailed to 60 days. But I could split my leave across two calendar years to comply with the regulations and keep my sponsorship intact.

Is there anything else I should know or consider before I speak with my employer?

[root_agent]: You’ve got a really solid understanding of the situation, Diego – excellent summary! You’ve accurately identified the key risks and potential solutions.

Before you speak with your employer, it might be worthwhile to also consider:

*   **Statutory Leave:** Make absolutely sure you’re not inadvertently double-counting any statutory leave (sick pay, maternity leave, etc.) when calculating your total absence.
*   **Company Policy:** Check your company’s HR policy on unpaid leave. There might be specific guidelines or procedures you need to follow.
*   **Communication:** Be upfront and honest with your employer about your visa concerns. Transparency is key to maintaining a positive working relationship.

Finally, it's always a good idea to have a backup plan in case your employer isn't fully supportive of your proposed arrangements. 

Do you feel confident with these additional points, or would you like me to explore any of them in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I'm all set now. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly! I'll check our company policy and make sure I'm transparent with my employer about the visa implications. I feel much more confident about approaching this conversation now that I understand the rules better.

I appreciate all your help with this!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Diego! I’m genuinely pleased I could help clarify things and boost your confidence. Wishing you the best of luck with your conversation with your employer – and with your travels in South America! If you have any other questions or need further assistance down the line, please don't hesitate to reach out.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you! I really appreciate all the guidance. Have a great day!

✓ The agent correctly identified that taking an 8-week unpaid sabbatical would require the employer to withdraw sponsorship, resulting in visa curtailment. The explanation was accurate that sponsorship must be withdrawn for unpaid absences exceeding 4 weeks in a calendar year, with the visa being shortened to 60 days.
