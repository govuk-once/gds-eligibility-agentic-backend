[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ravi and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Ravi, thank you for reaching out. I understand you're looking into your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa.

To start, could you tell me a little bit about the specific role you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a role as a System Administrator. I'm currently in India, and I've been offered £50,000 per year to work for TechRecruit Ltd. It's an IT consultancy based in London. They want me to work full-time at one of their clients, Bank Corp. I'd be reporting to the managers at Bank Corp and working at their office all the time.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that detailed information, Ravi. 

Just to clarify, TechRecruit Ltd is the company offering you the job, and Bank Corp is the company where you would be working, correct? And you would be working *entirely* at Bank Corp’s offices, reporting directly to their managers?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. TechRecruit Ltd is the company sponsoring me and offering the job, but I'd be placed at Bank Corp's offices 100% of the time. I would report directly to Bank Corp's managers for my day-to-day work. TechRecruit told me this is a long-term placement - essentially indefinite.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi. That’s very helpful.

Let me ask you this: Does TechRecruit Ltd retain full responsibility for your duties and the overall management of your work at Bank Corp, or would Bank Corp be directly involved in supervising your day-to-day tasks?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, Bank Corp would be directly supervising my day-to-day tasks and duties. TechRecruit would handle my pay and administrative aspects, but all my actual work instructions, supervision, and management would come from Bank Corp's managers. TechRecruit essentially placed me there, but wouldn't be involved in my actual work responsibilities.

[root_agent]: Okay, Ravi. Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you’ve described – that TechRecruit Ltd is essentially acting as a recruitment agency supplying you to Bank Corp, and Bank Corp is directly supervising your daily work – it appears this arrangement could potentially violate the rules regarding "contracting out." 

Would you be able to tell me a little more about TechRecruit Ltd’s role beyond simply placing you at Bank Corp? Specifically, do they have any involvement in the *content* or *nature* of your work, or how you perform it?

[evaluation_judge]: From my understanding, TechRecruit doesn't really have any involvement in the content or nature of my work. They're simply placing me at Bank Corp and handling my payroll, visa sponsorship, and basic HR functions. All my technical tasks, performance reviews, and work direction would come from Bank Corp managers. TechRecruit wouldn't be involved in how I perform my duties or what those duties are - that would all be determined by Bank Corp.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi. That’s very important information.

Given this scenario – where TechRecruit Ltd is acting as a recruitment agency supplying you to Bank Corp, with Bank Corp directly overseeing your day-to-day work – I’m concerned about the potential for this to be considered “contracting out,” which is not permitted under the Skilled Worker Visa rules. 

Therefore, I must advise you that, based on the information you’ve provided, this application is likely to be **REFUSED**. The Home Office would likely determine that TechRecruit Ltd is not the entity requiring the role, but is merely supplying labor to a third party.

Do you have any questions about this decision, or would you like me to explain the reasoning in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit disappointed to hear this. Could you explain more about why this arrangement would be refused? What exactly is the "contracting out" rule? I thought as long as the sponsoring company pays me and the role meets the skill level and salary requirements, it would be fine.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Ravi, and I appreciate you wanting to understand the reasoning behind this decision. Let me explain the “contracting out” rule in more detail.

Essentially, the Skilled Worker Visa is designed to allow a genuine employer – the company that *needs* the skills you possess – to sponsor you for work. The “contracting out” rule prevents sponsors from essentially subcontracting the role to another company. 

Think of it like this: the Home Office wants to ensure that the sponsor is the one truly responsible for the worker’s employment and the work they perform. When a sponsor simply places a worker with another company to carry out tasks, it’s seen as circumventing the purpose of the visa.

In your case, TechRecruit Ltd is acting as an intermediary. While they handle the payroll and visa sponsorship – which is acceptable – the *actual* work, supervision, and management are being provided by Bank Corp. This is what triggers the concern about “contracting out.” The Home Office needs to be convinced that TechRecruit Ltd is the genuine employer, with the ultimate responsibility for your role.

Does that explanation help clarify the rule a bit more? Would you like me to delve into any specific aspect of it further, or perhaps discuss alternative arrangements that *might* be suitable for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that explanation helps, thank you. So if I understand correctly, even though TechRecruit would be legally my employer and paying my salary, the fact that I'd be working full-time at Bank Corp's office under their supervision makes this arrangement invalid for a Skilled Worker Visa.

Are there any adjustments that could make this arrangement work? For example, if I spent part of my time at TechRecruit's offices, or if they maintained more oversight of my work?

[root_agent]: You’ve got it perfectly, Ravi. That’s a clear and accurate understanding of the situation. The key point is the direct supervision and management by Bank Corp – that’s what’s causing the issue with the Skilled Worker Visa.

Regarding your question about potential adjustments, you’ve identified some valid points. However, the Home Office is very strict about this rule, and even small changes might not be enough to overcome the concerns about “contracting out.”

Let’s consider your suggestions:

*   **Spending part of my time at TechRecruit's offices:** While this might slightly alter the dynamics, it still wouldn't fundamentally change the fact that Bank Corp is directly supervising your daily work. The Home Office would likely still view TechRecruit as a recruitment agency.

*   **TechRecruit maintaining more oversight of your work:** Increased oversight from TechRecruit wouldn’t automatically resolve the issue. They would still need to demonstrate full responsibility for your employment.

Unfortunately, without a significant change in the arrangement – such as TechRecruit truly taking on the role of *employer* and having genuine control over your work – it’s unlikely the Skilled Worker Visa would be approved.

I want to be completely transparent – based on this information, the application is likely to be refused. 

Would you like me to reiterate any of the key reasons for this decision, or explore potential alternative visa options, keeping in mind the restrictions of the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would be refused for the Skilled Worker visa due to the contracting out rule, as I would be essentially filling a permanent position at a third-party organization (Bank Corp) while technically employed by TechRecruit Ltd.
