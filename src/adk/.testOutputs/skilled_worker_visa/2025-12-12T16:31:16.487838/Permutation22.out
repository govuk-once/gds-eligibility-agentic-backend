[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ahmed and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Ahmed, welcome! It’s great to speak with you. To start, could you tell me, what type of work are you being offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Head Chef at a restaurant here in the UK. I'm trying to figure out if I'm eligible for a work visa based on my job offer.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know. And could you tell me, what is the typical number of hours you’ll be working per week in this role?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working 60 hours per week as the Head Chef. It's quite demanding but I'm used to long hours in the kitchen.

[root_agent]: Okay, 60 hours a week. And what is your hourly rate for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: My hourly rate will be £13.50 per hour.

[root_agent]: Alright, £13.50 per hour. Just to confirm, this is a permanent position, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a permanent position as the Head Chef.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now, I need to ask you a slightly specific question. When calculating your salary for visa purposes, the Home Office only considers the earnings from the first 48 hours of your work week. Would you agree with that?

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't aware of that. I thought they would consider my total earnings from all 60 hours per week. That's concerning to hear.

[root_agent]: I understand your concern. Let’s clarify that point then. To calculate your potential salary, we need to consider those 48 hours. Could you tell me, approximately how many weeks will you be working in a year?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working all year, so 52 weeks.

[root_agent]: Okay, 52 weeks a year. And if we calculate based on those 48 hours a week, at £13.50 per hour, what would your total assessable salary be for the year?

[evaluation_judge]: Let me think... 48 hours × £13.50 × 52 weeks would be... £33,696 for the year if only counting 48 hours per week.

[root_agent]: That’s correct, £33,696. And to confirm, the standard salary threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa is £41,700, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe the threshold is £41,700. So it seems like my assessable salary would fall short of that requirement if only 48 hours are counted.

[root_agent]: You’ve hit upon a very important point. Based on that calculation, your assessable salary of £33,696 is below the £41,700 threshold. Therefore, unfortunately, it appears you wouldn’t currently meet the eligibility requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa based on this information.

Would you like me to explain further why that’s the case, or perhaps discuss options for potentially meeting the requirements in the future, such as increasing your hourly rate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why this is happening. I'm quite concerned because my total annual salary based on 60 hours would be £42,120 (60 hrs × £13.50 × 52 weeks), which is above the threshold. Why aren't they considering all my working hours?

[root_agent]: You’ve raised a really important and often confusing point, Ahmed. The Home Office’s rule regarding the 48-hour cap is designed to prevent people from artificially inflating their salary by working excessive hours and then claiming a lower hourly rate.

Essentially, they only consider the earnings from the first 48 hours of your work week when determining if you meet the minimum salary threshold. It doesn't matter that you’re contracted to work 60 hours; the calculation is based on just those initial 48.

Let's look at the numbers again to illustrate this. As you calculated, 48 hours at £13.50 a week equals £648 per week. Over 52 weeks, that's £33,696 - meaning your assessable salary is below the £41,700 threshold.

Does that make sense now?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. So even though my total salary would be above the threshold when considering all 60 hours, the Home Office caps the calculation at 48 hours to prevent people from using excessive hours to meet the threshold with a lower hourly rate. That means my application would be refused because my assessable salary is too low. Would I need to negotiate a higher hourly rate with the employer instead?

[root_agent]: Exactly! You’ve grasped it perfectly. The 48-hour cap is in place to ensure a genuine reflection of your earnings.

Yes, negotiating a higher hourly rate with your employer would be the most direct way to address this issue and potentially make you eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. It's important to discuss this openly with them to see if an increase is possible.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding this situation, or would you like me to explore some other potential avenues – although they’d likely involve a salary adjustment?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that my application would be refused because only the first 48 hours are counted when calculating the assessable salary (£33,696), which falls below the threshold of £41,700, matching the expected outcome.
