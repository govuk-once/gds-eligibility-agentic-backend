[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Raj, it’s nice to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and see if you might be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you please tell me what your current job role is?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently working as a Web Developer on a Skilled Worker visa. I've been with my company for about 18 months now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Raj. And to clarify, your current job role is a Web Developer, correct? Could you please confirm the specific Occupation Code associated with your Web Developer position?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm currently a Web Developer under occupation code 2137. My company sponsored me for this role when I joined.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Raj. That’s very helpful. Now, I want to ask about a potential change within your current role. Are you currently considering a promotion or a change in responsibilities within your company?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, yes. I've just been offered a promotion to IT Project Manager (occupation code 2135) within the same company. It's a great opportunity with a salary of £50,000. My manager mentioned I can start right away, and HR said they'll just update my details in the system. I wanted to check if there are any visa implications before I accept.

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj, that's a significant change. It sounds like you’re moving from a Web Developer (Code 2137) to an IT Project Manager (Code 2135) within the same company. Just to be absolutely clear, you're saying HR has indicated they will update the system without requiring you to apply for a new visa, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. HR told me they'll just update my details in their Sponsorship Management System, and I can start the new role right away. They don't think I need to apply for a new visa since I'm staying with the same company. I'm a bit unsure about this though, which is why I wanted to check.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Raj. Let’s delve a bit deeper into this. The Skilled Worker Visa has specific rules about changing occupations, even within the same company. Could you tell me, does your new role as an IT Project Manager involve significantly different duties or responsibilities compared to your current role as a Web Developer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's definitely quite different. As a Web Developer, I'm mainly writing code and working on the technical aspects of websites. The new IT Project Manager role would involve managing teams, coordinating project timelines, handling budgets, and liaising with clients. It's much more about overseeing the entire project rather than doing the technical development work myself.

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj, that’s a very important distinction. Because your new role as an IT Project Manager (Code 2135) represents a different occupation than your current role as a Web Developer (Code 2137), even though you're staying with the same company, it triggers a specific rule under the Skilled Worker Visa.

Let me ask you this: Has your current sponsor (the company) already applied for a “Change of Employment” visa on your behalf to reflect this move?

[evaluation_judge]: No, they haven't applied for any "Change of Employment" visa. They just said they'd update my details in their system. Are you saying I need a completely new visa application before I can start the new role?

[root_agent]: You are correct to be concerned, Raj. Based on the rules for the Skilled Worker Visa, because you’re changing to a different occupation code (2137 to 2135) even within the same company, you absolutely need a new visa application – a “Change of Employment” visa – before you begin the IT Project Manager role.

If your current sponsor doesn’t apply for this “Change of Employment” visa before you start working, it would be considered a compliance breach. This could lead to serious consequences for your employer, including the potential loss of their sponsorship license, and could result in the curtailment of your visa.

Is it possible for your company to initiate the “Change of Employment” application process?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I had no idea! That's really serious and not at all what HR told me. I definitely don't want to risk my visa status or cause problems for the company.

I'll speak with HR tomorrow and explain that we need to apply for a "Change of Employment" visa before I can officially start the new role. I assume I should continue in my current Web Developer role until the new visa is approved?

[root_agent]: That's the right approach, Raj. Absolutely, you should continue in your current role as a Web Developer until the “Change of Employment” visa is approved. It’s vital to maintain your current visa status.

It’s good that you're taking this seriously and addressing the issue with HR immediately. Do you want me to summarise the key points for you, so you have a clear understanding of what needs to be done?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. A summary would be really helpful so I can explain this correctly to HR tomorrow.

[root_agent]: Okay, here’s a summary of the situation, Raj:

*   **Current Visa:** You currently hold a Skilled Worker Visa sponsored as a Web Developer (Occupation Code 2137).
*   **Promotion:** You’ve been offered a promotion to IT Project Manager (Occupation Code 2135) within the same company.
*   **Visa Rule:** Changing to a different occupation code, even within the same employer, requires a separate visa application – a “Change of Employment” visa.
*   **Current Status:** HR has indicated they will update your details in the Sponsorship Management System without initiating a “Change of Employment” visa application. This is incorrect.
*   **Risk:** Starting the new role without a “Change of Employment” visa is a compliance breach and could lead to serious consequences for both you and your employer (potential loss of sponsorship license, visa curtailment).
*   **Action Required:** You *must* contact HR to initiate the “Change of Employment” visa application process before starting the IT Project Manager role. You should continue working as a Web Developer until the new visa is approved.

Do you have any questions about this summary, or would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really clear, thank you. I'll bring this summary to my meeting with HR. Just to confirm - even though it's the same company, because the occupation code is changing from 2137 to 2135, a new visa application is required before I can start the new role. 

I'm glad I checked before making this move. I'll make sure everything is done properly to protect both my visa status and the company's sponsorship license.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Raj. And you’re absolutely right to be proactive and ensure everything is done correctly. Confirming that – yes, even though it’s the same company, the change in occupation code (2137 to 2135) necessitates a new visa application – a “Change of Employment” – before you can begin the IT Project Manager role.

I’m pleased to hear you understand the situation and are taking the necessary steps. If you have any further questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. It’s good to know you're prioritizing a compliant and secure situation.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for clarifying everything. I appreciate your help and will make sure to follow the correct procedure. Have a good day!

✓ The agent correctly identified that changing from a Web Developer (code 2137) to an IT Project Manager (code 2135) within the same company requires a new "Change of Employment" visa application before starting the new role. The agent accurately explained that proceeding without this would be a compliance breach that could result in curtailment and problems for the employer, matching the expected outcome.
