[evaluation_judge]: I'll now take on the role of Hans, a German engineer looking to understand benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Hans and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Hans, it’s nice to meet you. I’m here to help you with that.

To start, could you tell me the name of the benefit you’re interested in learning about?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in learning about skilled worker visas for the UK. I have a Master's degree in Engineering from a German university that was taught completely in English. I've been offered a job in the UK and need to understand if I meet the English language requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Let’s focus on the Skilled Worker Visa then.

Just to be clear, you’ve stated you have a Master’s degree in Engineering from a German university, and that the degree was taught entirely in English.

Could you please confirm the name of the university where you earned your degree?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich (TUM). The program was called "Advanced Manufacturing Engineering" and it was taught 100% in English. I graduated last year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Hans. That’s helpful.

I want to double-check something regarding your qualification. The Skilled Worker Visa requires proof of English language proficiency. 

Could you tell me if you have ever taken an English language test, such as IELTS or TOEFL, and what your score was?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't taken any specific English language tests like IELTS or TOEFL. I thought my Master's degree would be sufficient proof of my English language ability since it was taught entirely in English. The university provided me with a letter confirming that all instruction, coursework, and examinations were conducted in English. I have this letter along with my degree certificate.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information.

I understand you’re relying on the letter from the Technical University of Munich confirming that the degree was taught entirely in English.

To clarify, the Home Office requires more than just a letter from the university. They need to see verification of your English language proficiency, specifically through Ecctis.

Would you be open to providing me with more details about Ecctis – have you heard of it, or would you like me to explain what it is?

[evaluation_judge]: I've heard of Ecctis vaguely, but I'm not very familiar with it. Could you please explain what it is and what I would need to do? I wasn't aware I needed something beyond my university's confirmation letter.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Hans. Let me explain.

Ecctis is a service that verifies the comparability of qualifications obtained outside the UK. For the Skilled Worker Visa, they need to confirm that your degree is equivalent to a UK degree. Crucially, they also require an “English Language Proficiency” statement.

Essentially, it’s a two-statement verification. One statement confirms your qualification is comparable to a UK degree, and the other confirms you meet the English language requirements.

Since your degree was taught entirely in English, you’ll need to prove your English proficiency through Ecctis. 

Do you have any questions about that process, or would you like me to explain how to get started with Ecctis?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very helpful information. So just to be clear, my university letter confirming my degree was taught in English is not sufficient on its own? I need to get this Ecctis verification with the two statements you mentioned?

How do I go about getting this Ecctis verification? Is it expensive and how long does it take? I want to make sure I have everything in order for my visa application.

[root_agent]: You’ve hit the nail on the head, Hans. That university letter, while helpful, is not sufficient on its own. You absolutely need the Ecctis verification with those two statements.

Let’s talk about the process, cost, and timeframe.

Currently, Ecctis charges a fee of £196 per statement (so £392 for both the comparability and English language statements). You’ll need to pay this to Ecctis directly.

The timeframe for receiving the verification statements can vary, but it typically takes around 10-15 working days from when Ecctis receives all the necessary documents. You’ll need to submit your degree certificate and application to Ecctis through their website.

Would you like me to guide you through the steps of applying to Ecctis, or would you prefer I provide you with a direct link to their website so you can explore the process yourself?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for clarifying. So without these Ecctis statements, I wouldn't meet the English language requirements for my Skilled Worker Visa application, even though I have a letter from my university confirming my degree was taught in English?

That's good to know about the cost and timeframe. Could you please provide me with the link to their website so I can start this process soon? My potential employer is eager to have me start work in the UK.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Hans. Without the Ecctis statements, you wouldn’t meet the English language requirements. It’s good you’re aware of that – it’s crucial to get this right.

Here’s the link to the Ecctis website: [https://www.ecctis.org.uk/](https://www.ecctis.org.uk/)

I’ve also highlighted the key sections you’ll need:

*   **“Check your qualification”:** Use this to see if your degree is listed on their database.
*   **“Apply for comparability”:** This is where you'll begin the process for the first statement.
*   **“Apply for English language statement”:** This is where you'll apply for the second, English language verification.

Do you want me to help you navigate the website and start the application process, or would you prefer to go through it independently?

[evaluation_judge]: I appreciate your clear explanation. Just to make sure I completely understand: without the Ecctis verification, my visa application would likely be refused because my university's letter about English-taught courses isn't sufficient proof?

Thank you for providing the link and the key sections to navigate. I think I'll go through it independently first, but I might reach out again if I encounter any issues during the application process. 

I'm glad I asked about this before submitting my visa application - it would have been disappointing to be refused over something I could have addressed.

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Hans. Without the Ecctis verification, your visa application would likely be refused – the Home Office requires that specific proof of English language proficiency. 

I’m very pleased you’ve gained a clear understanding of this and took the initiative to investigate. It’s excellent that you’re proactively addressing this now. 

Please don’t hesitate to reach out again if you encounter any difficulties during the Ecctis application process. I’m here to help if you need anything further.

Good luck with your visa application, Hans!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that my German degree taught in English would not meet the English language requirements without Ecctis verification with both qualification comparability and English Language Proficiency statements. The agent explained that my university letter confirming English instruction is insufficient on its own, which aligns with the expected outcome of being refused without proper Ecctis verification.
