[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as John, a 32-year-old who's switching from a dependent visa and has a job offer as a Trainee Chartered Accountant.

Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello John, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 32 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And could you tell me if you’ve been a student in the last five years?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't been a student in the last five years.

[root_agent]: Great. And could you describe the job you've been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Trainee Chartered Accountant. I'll be working towards my ACCA qualification while working.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news! It sounds like a fantastic opportunity. To clarify, are you currently working towards a recognized professional qualification, such as ACCA or ICAEW?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'll be working towards my ACCA qualification as part of this job. That's one of the main reasons I accepted the position - it gives me the opportunity to earn while studying for this professional qualification.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. Now, could you tell me what salary you’re being offered for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £34,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And could you tell me what the standard going rate for a Trainee Chartered Accountant with your experience and qualifications is?

[evaluation_judge]: The standard going rate for this position is £46,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Just one more question for now: Are you over 26 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm 32 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, John. Let me just quickly check some of this information against the eligibility criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa...

[evaluation_judge]: Alright, I appreciate you looking into this for me. I'm hoping to switch from my dependent visa to a Skilled Worker visa with this job offer.

[root_agent]: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me – that you’re over 26, haven’t been a student in the last five years, and are working towards a recognized professional qualification – it appears you *do* qualify as a “New Entrant” under the Skilled Worker Visa rules. Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'd like to understand why I qualify as a "New Entrant" given my age.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker Visa has a rule that generally, applicants must be below 30 to qualify as a “New Entrant.” However, there’s an exception for individuals working towards a recognized professional qualification, such as ACCA or ICAEW. Because you’re undertaking this training as part of your job, you meet the criteria for “New Entrant” status, despite being over 26. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. I didn't realize my professional qualification training would give me that status. That's great news.

[root_agent]: I’m pleased to hear that! Now, let’s look at another aspect – the salary. Does your salary of £34,000 meet the 70% threshold of the standard going rate of £46,000?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure. Could you tell me what that calculation would be?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The 70% threshold means your salary needs to be at least 70% of the standard going rate. Let’s calculate that: 70% of £46,000 is £32,200. Since your salary of £34,000 is above £32,200, it does indeed meet the threshold. Would you like me to summarise your eligibility based on this information?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'd really appreciate a summary of my eligibility status.

[root_agent]: Okay, here’s a summary of your eligibility:

You meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa because you are over 26 but qualify as a “New Entrant” due to your work towards an ACCA qualification. Furthermore, your salary of £34,000 exceeds the 70% threshold of the standard going rate of £46,000.

Based on this, you appear to be eligible for the salary discount associated with the Skilled Worker Visa.

Do you have any other questions about this, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very helpful, thank you! So just to be clear, I'm eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa even though I'm 32, because I'm working towards a professional qualification, and my salary meets the required threshold with the discount. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: Yes, that is absolutely correct! You’re welcome to rephrase it however you’d like, but yes, your age and salary are being taken into account because of your “New Entrant” status and the salary discount.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today regarding your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be awarded the visa. They correctly identified that despite being over 26, I qualify as a "New Entrant" due to working toward a recognized professional qualification (ACCA), and my salary of £34,000 exceeds the 70% threshold of the £46,000 standard going rate.
