[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Batbayar in this scenario to test the agent's ability to determine eligibility for a UK work visa based on a potentially non-genuine job vacancy.

Hi, i'm Batbayar and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Batbayar, it’s nice to meet you. I understand you’re interested in exploring your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me a little about the job you’ve been offered? Specifically, what is the job title and what are the main responsibilities involved?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello, thank you for helping me. Yes, I've been offered a job as an Office Manager at a logistics company in the UK. The role involves managing the office operations, administrative tasks, scheduling, and general office coordination. I was very happy to receive this offer as I recently completed my degree in Mongolian history.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Batbayar. That’s helpful to know. Let’s delve a little deeper. Could you describe the specific duties and responsibilities outlined in the job description, particularly anything related to using specific skills or knowledge?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the job description says I'll be coordinating office operations, managing administrative tasks, handling scheduling, and maintaining office supplies. But what's interesting is that they specifically require a "fluent Mongolian speaker" and someone with "expert knowledge in 13th-century steppe warfare." They mentioned these were mandatory requirements. I found it a bit unusual for an Office Manager position at a logistics company, but since I studied Mongolian history with focus on military history, I thought it was perfect for me.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like those specific requirements are quite unusual for an Office Manager role. Just to be clear, you’ve studied Mongolian history, with a particular focus on 13th-century steppe warfare, correct? And this job description is stating that fluency in Mongolian and expertise in that specific area of historical warfare are *essential* for the role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I have a degree in Mongolian history and specialized in 13th-century steppe warfare for my thesis. And yes, the job description specifically lists fluency in Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare as "mandatory requirements" for the Office Manager position. That's why I thought it was such a good match for me, even though I was surprised to see such specific requirements for an office job at a logistics company.

[root_agent]: I appreciate you confirming that, Batbayar. It’s understandable why you’d be surprised by those requirements. Let’s consider this carefully. Could you tell me, aside from your academic background in Mongolian history and steppe warfare, what other skills and experience do you have that are relevant to an Office Manager position – things like computer skills, customer service, or any experience with administrative tasks?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I have some basic office skills I developed during part-time work at my university department. I can use Microsoft Office programs like Word, Excel, and Outlook. I have some experience answering phones and managing calendars from when I worked as a student assistant. But honestly, I don't have extensive administrative experience. I was surprised they were interested in me despite this, but they seemed really focused on the Mongolian language skills and my knowledge of steppe warfare history. They didn't ask many questions about my administrative abilities during the interview.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Batbayar. It’s helpful to understand the scope of your experience. Given the very specific requirements – particularly the need for fluency in Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare – and your limited experience in traditional office administration, I need to assess whether this job offer genuinely aligns with the Skilled Worker Visa criteria.

To help me with this assessment, could you tell me, does the logistics company have any clients or business operations in Mongolia, or anywhere else where your specific historical knowledge might be utilized?

[evaluation_judge]: As far as I know, the company doesn't have any clients or business operations in Mongolia. During the interview, they didn't mention any Mongolian clients or any projects related to Mongolia. They're mainly focused on logistics within the UK and some parts of Europe. And honestly, I'm not sure how my knowledge of 13th-century steppe warfare would be useful in modern logistics operations. They didn't explain how these skills would be applied in the day-to-day work.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Batbayar. This information is very important. Considering the company’s lack of connection to Mongolia and the seemingly unrelated nature of the required specialist knowledge – fluency in Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare – it raises concerns about the genuine need for these specific skills within this role.

Based on the information you’ve provided, I’m afraid I must advise that this job offer appears to be potentially non-genuine, designed primarily to facilitate a Skilled Worker Visa.

**REFUSED.** The Home Office would likely rule this is not a genuine role but a vehicle for migration.

Do you understand why I’ve reached this conclusion?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. I was hoping this opportunity would work out since it seemed so perfectly matched to my background. It's disappointing to hear that the job might not be considered genuine for visa purposes. Could you explain a bit more about why it would be refused? Is it because the requirements seem tailored specifically to my unusual combination of skills?

[root_agent]: You’re welcome to ask for clarification, Batbayar. Certainly. The Home Office assesses job offers to ensure they are truly for a skilled worker and not simply a pretext for obtaining a visa. In your case, the combination of the very specific, seemingly unrelated requirements – fluency in Mongolian and expert knowledge of 13th-century steppe warfare – alongside the company’s lack of business connection to Mongolia, strongly suggests the job description was tailored to you.

This is known as a “tailored job description” and it’s a red flag. The Home Office wants to be sure that the job genuinely requires those skills and that you’re being offered a role based on your abilities, not to circumvent immigration rules.

Essentially, it looks like the employer may be prioritizing your visa application over genuine business needs.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this explanation, or perhaps discuss alternative job opportunities that might better align with your skills and experience while meeting genuine visa requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense now. It does seem like the job was created specifically for me rather than being a genuine position the company needed. I appreciate your honesty about this situation.

I would be interested in learning more about what kinds of positions might better align with my skills that could qualify for a visa. I'm still interested in working in the UK if possible.

[root_agent]: Okay, Batbayar, that’s a great next step. Let’s explore some potential avenues. Given your background in Mongolian history, particularly your expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare, and your basic office skills, here are a few areas you might consider that could potentially lead to a Skilled Worker Visa:

1.  **Research Roles:** Universities and research institutions often require researchers with specialist historical knowledge. These roles often involve administrative tasks but focus primarily on research and analysis.

2.  **Translation/Interpretation:** Your fluency in Mongolian could be valuable for translation or interpretation services, particularly if there are any British businesses involved in trade with Mongolia or regions where Mongolian is spoken.

3.  **Museums and Cultural Institutions:** Museums with collections related to Central Asia or Mongolia might seek individuals with historical expertise.

4.  **Archival Work:** Organisations holding archives related to Mongolian history could benefit from your knowledge.

To help me narrow down the best options for you, could you tell me:

*   Are you primarily interested in academic work, or would you be open to roles in other sectors?
*   Are you looking for a role that is primarily administrative, or are you happy to combine it with research or specialized knowledge?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm definitely open to a range of possibilities. While academic work would be great given my background, I'm not limiting myself to just that sector.

I'd actually prefer something that uses my specialized knowledge rather than primarily administrative work. Positions at museums or research institutions sound particularly interesting. I'd love to use my language skills and historical knowledge in a meaningful way.

I hadn't considered translation work before, but that could be a good option too since I am fluent in Mongolian, English, and have basic Russian as well. Do these kinds of specialized positions typically qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[root_agent]: That’s excellent information, Batbayar. Your preference for roles that utilize your specialized knowledge is definitely a good direction. And yes, positions at museums, research institutions, and in specialized translation services *can* qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa, but it depends on a few factors.

Let’s break it down:

*   **Museums and Research Institutions:** These roles almost always qualify, provided the job description outlines the specific skills and responsibilities required – clearly demonstrating they are genuinely needed and not simply ‘nice to have.’

*   **Translation Services:** This is a little more complex. You'll need to demonstrate that the translation work you’re offered is *specialized* and requires your specific knowledge of Mongolian. General translation work usually doesn’t qualify. You'll also need to find a UK-based translation company or client.

*   **Russian Language Skills:** Your basic Russian could be a bonus, but it’s not a primary requirement for visa eligibility.

To help me assess your potential options further, could you tell me:

*   Have you researched any specific museums or research institutions in the UK that might be a good fit for your background?
*   Are you open to freelance translation work, or would you prefer to work for a company?

[evaluation_judge]: I haven't researched specific museums or institutions in the UK yet, though I know the British Museum has Central Asian collections. The British Library might also have relevant materials. I should probably start looking more systematically at universities with strong Central Asian or Mongolian studies programs.

I would prefer to work for a company rather than freelance, at least initially. My understanding is that freelance work makes visa sponsorship more complicated. I'd feel more secure with a company that can properly sponsor my visa.

I'm curious - for museums or research positions, what kind of job titles should I be looking for that would likely qualify for the visa? And approximately what salary level would be required to meet the visa threshold?

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible approach, Batbayar – starting with research and considering company sponsorship is a wise move.

Regarding job titles for museums and research positions, here are some that would likely qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa, depending on the specific role’s responsibilities:

*   **Curatorial Assistant:** Supporting curators with research, cataloging, and exhibition preparation – your historical expertise would be valuable.
*   **Researcher:** Conducting research projects related to Central Asian or Mongolian history, often supported by grants or funding.
*   **Collections Manager:** Overseeing the care and management of collections, which could involve research and documentation.
*   **Archive Assistant:** Assisting with the organization and preservation of historical archives.

As for salary levels, this varies greatly depending on the institution, location, and seniority of the role. As of today (October 26, 2023), the minimum salary for a Skilled Worker Visa is £26,200 per year. However, to realistically qualify for a role with your specialized knowledge and experience, you would likely need to aim for a salary in the range of **£30,000 to £45,000** or potentially higher, especially in London or at larger institutions.

It’s worth noting that some institutions, particularly universities, may be willing to offer slightly lower salaries if the role is particularly suited to your skills and experience.

Would you like me to help you explore some specific universities or museums that might have relevant openings, or perhaps delve into resources for finding jobs in these sectors?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave me incorrect information. While they correctly identified that this job doesn't meet the Genuine Vacancy test and would be refused, they provided an outdated minimum salary threshold of £26,200 per year, when the correct figure for 2023 is £26,200 or the "going rate" for the occupation, whichever is higher.
