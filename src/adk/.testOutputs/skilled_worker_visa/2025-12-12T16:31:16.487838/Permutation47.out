[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Aris and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Dr. Aris. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the type of work you do at the university?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a lecturer at a university where I work 20 hours per week. I've already secured a Skilled Worker visa for this position. Now I've been offered another position as a researcher at a private think-tank, also for 20 hours per week. I'm trying to understand if I can hold both positions simultaneously and what the visa requirements would be for that situation.

[root_agent]: That’s very helpful to know. And it sounds like you’re considering a role at a private think-tank, correct? Just to clarify, could you tell me a bit about the type of research you’d be doing at the think-tank?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The think-tank focuses on economic policy research. My role there would involve analyzing economic trends and producing reports on policy implications. It's very much aligned with my academic expertise from my university position, but the think-tank work is more focused on practical policy applications rather than teaching. Like my university position, it would be 20 hours per week, so I'd have 40 hours total between both jobs.

[root_agent]: Okay, Dr. Aris. Thank you for that detailed explanation. Just to confirm, you already have a Skilled Worker visa for your university lecturing role, and you’re now seeking a second visa – a “Concurrent Employment” visa – for your work at the think-tank, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I already have a Skilled Worker visa for my university lecturer position. Now I need to understand if I can get a second visa for the think-tank researcher position while maintaining my first visa. I've heard something about "Concurrent Employment" but I'm not sure if that applies to my situation or how to go about applying for it.

[root_agent]: I understand. It sounds like you’re trying to determine if you can hold two sponsored jobs simultaneously. Let’s delve a little deeper into that. Could you tell me, what is the total number of hours you’ll be working across both your university lecturing role and your role at the think-tank?

[evaluation_judge]: I would be working exactly 20 hours per week at the university as a lecturer, and then 20 hours per week at the think-tank as a researcher. So that would be a total of 40 hours per week across both roles.

[root_agent]: Okay, Dr. Aris. That’s very useful information. Now, regarding the Skilled Worker Visa, do you know what the maximum number of hours you are permitted to work under your current visa?

[evaluation_judge]: To be honest, I'm not entirely sure about the maximum hours allowed under my current Skilled Worker visa. I've been working 20 hours per week at the university as that's what my contract specifies, but I don't recall if there's a specific maximum limit set by the visa regulations. Could you please explain what restrictions there might be?

[root_agent]: Certainly. Let’s look at the Skilled Worker Visa criteria. Generally, a Skilled Worker visa allows you to work up to 35 hours per week. However, it’s important to note that this is a general guideline and specific circumstances can influence this.

Considering you’re seeking a second visa for concurrent employment, are you currently working the maximum 35 hours per week under your existing Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm only working 20 hours per week under my current Skilled Worker visa for the university position. My contract with the university is specifically for 20 hours per week, not the maximum 35 hours. That's why I'm looking to take on the additional 20 hours at the think-tank to bring my total to 40 hours per week across both positions.

[root_agent]: Okay, that clarifies things considerably. Since you’re currently working only 20 hours per week under your Skilled Worker visa, and you’re seeking a second visa to cover the additional 20 hours at the think-tank, it does appear you could be eligible for a “Concurrent Employment” visa.

To confirm, are both jobs – your lecturing role at the university and your role as a researcher at the think-tank – being sponsored by their respective employers, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The university already sponsors my current Skilled Worker visa for the lecturer position. And the think-tank has confirmed they are willing to sponsor me for the researcher position. Both employers are registered sponsors in the UK system.

[root_agent]: Excellent. That’s very important. With both employers sponsoring you and your current Skilled Worker visa allowing a maximum of 35 hours, and you’ll be working a total of 40 hours, it sounds like you meet the criteria for a “Concurrent Employment” visa.

To be absolutely sure, let’s just confirm one last thing: Are both jobs considered to be ‘regular’ employment contracts, rather than temporary or zero-hour contracts?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both positions are regular employment contracts with fixed hours. The university position is an ongoing contract for 20 hours per week as a lecturer, and the think-tank has offered me a standard employment contract also for 20 hours per week. Neither position involves zero-hour contracts or temporary arrangements - they're both permanent positions with regular schedules.

[root_agent]: Okay, Dr. Aris. Based on all the information you’ve provided - having two sponsoring employers, your current Skilled Worker visa allowing up to 35 hours, and both positions being regular employment contracts – it appears you *are* eligible to apply for a “Concurrent Employment” visa.

Therefore, I would award you the benefit. You will hold two visas simultaneously, one for your university lecturing role and another for your work at the think-tank. It’s important to note that when applying for the second visa, you must clearly indicate that it’s for “Concurrent Employment” to avoid it automatically cancelling your existing visa. Does that all make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So I'll need to apply for a second Skilled Worker visa specifically marked as "Concurrent Employment" for my think-tank position, and this will allow me to hold both jobs simultaneously without affecting my existing university visa. Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for this arrangement. I'll make sure to clearly indicate it's for concurrent employment when submitting my application.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Dr. Aris! I’m glad I could clarify things for you. It sounds like you have a clear plan moving forward. If you have any further questions down the line, don’t hesitate to ask. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that covers everything I needed to know about the concurrent employment visa. Thank you for your help with understanding this process. It's reassuring to know I can pursue both opportunities while staying compliant with the visa regulations.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for concurrent employment with two separate visas, which matches the expected outcome. They accurately explained that I need to apply for a second visa marked as "Concurrent Employment" to avoid canceling my first visa, and confirmed that having two sponsored jobs is permitted.
