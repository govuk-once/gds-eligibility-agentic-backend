[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Lina who has a job offer as a construction laborer, not realizing that this occupation doesn't qualify for the Skilled Worker visa due to its skill level, despite the high salary offered.

Hi, i'm Lina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Lina, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! Yes, I've been offered a job as a Construction Labourer with a company here in the UK. The salary they're offering is quite good - £45,000 per year. I've worked in construction for several years in my home country, but I need to know if I can get a visa to work here. They said something about a Skilled Worker visa, but I'm not entirely sure about all the requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lina, thank you for that information. Just to clarify, you’ve been offered a role as a Construction Labourer, and the salary is £45,000 per year.

Could you tell me what level of qualification or training you have in construction?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I've been working in construction for about 7 years now. I don't have any formal qualifications like diplomas or certificates, just extensive on-the-job experience. I've learned everything through hands-on work at various construction sites. My experience includes basic construction tasks, site preparation, materials handling, and assisting the skilled tradespeople. The company that wants to hire me seems happy with my experience even though I don't have formal credentials.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Lina. It sounds like you’ve gained a lot of valuable experience.

To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me what level on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) you believe your skills and experience fall under? (RQF Level 1, 2, 3, or above)?

[evaluation_judge]: To be honest, I'm not entirely familiar with this Regulated Qualifications Framework. From what I understand about my role as a Construction Labourer, it's mostly physical work that requires some training but not extensive qualifications. I don't think it would be considered highly skilled. Based on what little I know, I would guess my skills might be at Level 1 or Level 2, but I'm really not sure. The company hiring me has classified the position under job code 9120, if that helps.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lina. Thank you for sharing that.

Based on your description and the job code 9120, it appears this role is classified as an “Elementary construction occupation,” which typically falls under RQF Level 1 or 2.

Is there a valid Sponsor associated with this job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company has told me they are an approved sponsor for work visas. They mentioned having a sponsor license and that they've sponsored other international workers before. They're a legitimate construction company that's been operating in the UK for over 15 years.

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear, Lina. Knowing there’s a valid sponsor is a positive step.

Now, let’s talk about the salary. Does the salary offered for this Construction Labourer role meet the minimum salary threshold for a Skilled Worker visa? Currently, that’s £38,700 per year, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the salary they're offering is £45,000 per year, which seems to be above that £38,700 threshold you mentioned. That's actually one of the reasons I was hopeful about getting the visa - the salary is quite generous for this type of work.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lina. Thank you for confirming that.

Just one more question regarding the job itself. Could you tell me what level on the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) you believe this Construction Labourer role falls under? (RQF Level 1, 2, 3, or above)?

[evaluation_judge]: As I mentioned earlier, I believe the Construction Labourer role probably falls under RQF Level 1 or 2. It's mainly physical work that requires basic training but not advanced qualifications. The job code they gave me is 9120 for "Elementary construction occupations," which I assume means it's considered a lower-skilled position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lina. I appreciate you clarifying that.

Based on the information we've discussed – the job being a Construction Labourer at RQF Level 1 or 2, a valid sponsor, and a salary exceeding the minimum threshold – I must advise that you are unlikely to be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. The role doesn’t meet the criteria for a higher-skilled occupation.

Therefore, I’m afraid I have to conclude that you are not eligible for a Skilled Worker visa at this time.

Do you have any questions about this assessment, or would you like me to explain anything in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. I was hoping the high salary might make up for it being a lower-skilled job. So even though the pay is above the threshold, the skill level of the job itself is too low for a Skilled Worker visa? That's disappointing to hear. 

Are there any other visa options that might work for someone in my situation? Or would I need to find a different type of job that meets the skill requirement?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Lina. It’s frustrating when a high salary doesn’t automatically qualify you for a visa.

Let’s explore other options. While a Skilled Worker visa isn’t suitable, there are a few other routes you might consider. However, they often depend on your specific circumstances and qualifications. 

One possibility could be a **Temporary Worker visa**, which is for jobs that are seasonal or temporary. However, this route is generally more restrictive. 

Another option to explore would be the **Health and Care Worker visa**, but this visa route is currently paused.

Ultimately, finding a role that meets the skill level requirements for a Skilled Worker visa would likely be the most straightforward path. Perhaps discussing your experience with a recruitment agency specializing in the construction industry could help identify roles that align with a higher RQF level. 

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these options, or perhaps discuss the recruitment agencies you could contact?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's really helpful information. Yes, I think I'll need to look for roles that meet the higher skill requirements. Maybe I could find something that better matches my experience but at a higher RQF level. I might reach out to some recruitment agencies as you suggested.

Is there a specific RQF level I should be aiming for with construction jobs? And do you have any suggestions for how I might be able to demonstrate or improve my skill level to qualify for these higher-skilled positions?

[root_agent]: That’s a wise decision, Lina. It’s definitely worth exploring options that align with higher RQF levels.

Regarding specific RQF levels within construction – it really varies depending on the role. Generally, roles involving more complex tasks, supervision, or technical expertise would fall into RQF Levels 3 or above. For example, roles like a Site Supervisor (Level 3), a Construction Manager (Level 5), or a Quantity Surveyor (Level 6) would be considered higher-skilled.

As for demonstrating or improving your skill level – here are a few suggestions:

*   **Professional Development Courses:** Look into courses that can upskill you and lead to nationally recognized qualifications. For example, courses in construction management, health and safety, or specific building trades could be beneficial.
*   **Apprenticeships:** Consider pursuing an apprenticeship to gain formal qualifications while working.
*   **Certifications:** Obtaining industry-recognized certifications relevant to your chosen area of construction can demonstrate your expertise.

To help you with your search, would you like me to direct you to some resources where you can find information on relevant training courses and certifications within the UK construction industry?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent correctly identified that I am not eligible for a Skilled Worker visa because the Construction Labourer role (job code 9120) falls below the required RQF Level 3. However, they initially asked me about my personal qualification level rather than focusing on the job's classification, which could have been confusing. The agent did eventually reach the correct conclusion that I'm ineligible.
