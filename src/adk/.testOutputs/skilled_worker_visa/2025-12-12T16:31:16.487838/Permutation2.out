[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Liam, thanks for reaching out. To start, could you tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 23 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thanks. And could you tell me a bit about your educational background? Specifically, what did you study and where did you study it?

[evaluation_judge]: I just finished my Bachelor's degree here in the UK. I'm from Canada originally, but I was studying in the UK on a Student Visa.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know. And could you tell me what your degree was in?

[evaluation_judge]: My degree was in Economics and Finance.

[root_agent]: Alright. And to confirm, you’re currently looking to switch to a Skilled Worker Visa, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I just finished my degree and I'd like to stay in the UK to work.

[root_agent]: Okay. And could you tell me the name of the company offering you the job, and the specific role you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Junior Financial Analyst at Morgan Financial Partners.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And could you please tell me what salary you’ve been offered for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: They've offered me £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, £35,000 per year. Now, could you please tell me what the standard going rate is for a Junior Financial Analyst role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for this role is about £42,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. And just to confirm, you are under 26 years old, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm 23 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Let’s move on to salary. Does your offered salary of £35,000 meet the lower general threshold of £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my salary offer of £35,000 is above the £33,400 threshold.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And finally, does your offered salary of £35,000 meet at least 70% of the standard going rate of £42,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, 70% of £42,000 would be £29,400, and my offered salary of £35,000 is well above that.

[root_agent]: Okay, Liam. Thank you for providing all of that information. Based on your age (23), your recent graduation, your degree in Economics and Finance, your salary of £35,000, and the standard going rate of £42,000, you appear to meet the criteria for the New Entrant route under the Skilled Worker Visa.

**AWARDED.**

Would you like me to explain anything further about the New Entrant route?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. Could you tell me a bit more about the New Entrant route? Particularly how long I can stay on this visa?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The New Entrant route allows eligible individuals to work in the UK while building towards permanent residence. You can typically stay on this visa for up to 3 years. Importantly, time spent on the New Entrant route counts towards the 4-year requirement for indefinite leave to remain (permanent residency).

Do you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect, such as the requirements for English language proficiency or the sponsorship process?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for the information. Does that mean I could potentially switch to another visa after the New Entrant route if I want to stay longer than 3 years?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question. Yes, absolutely. After your 3-year period on the New Entrant route, you would typically then be eligible to switch to another visa route, such as the Skilled Worker Visa, depending on your employment situation and the requirements of that visa. 

Would you like me to briefly outline some of the other common visa routes available after the New Entrant route?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's okay for now. I think I've got the information I need about my eligibility. Thank you for your help!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Liam! I’m glad I could assist you. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a great day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for the Skilled Worker visa under the New Entrant route, properly verifying that my salary (£35,000) meets both the lower general threshold (£33,400) and exceeds 70% of the going rate (£29,400), matching the expected "AWARDED" outcome.
