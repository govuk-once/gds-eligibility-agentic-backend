[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lukas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Lukas, it’s great to speak with you! To start, could you tell me a little about your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Since you’re 17, it’s important to check if we need any specific arrangements in place. To clarify, are you living with your parents or a legal guardian at the moment?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently living with my parents in Estonia. I'm a coding enthusiast, and I've been offered a Junior Developer job in the UK with a salary of £34,000. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a work visa in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Lukas. Given that you’re currently living with your parents in Estonia and you’re 17, the visa requirements will need to consider your living arrangements and parental consent. Could you tell me, do your parents currently reside in the UK, or would they be able to support you while you’re there?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my parents would not be coming with me to the UK. They would continue to live in Estonia while I work in the UK. They're supportive of my opportunity though.

[root_agent]: Okay, I appreciate you clarifying that. Since your parents won’t be coming with you to the UK, we need to confirm we have the necessary arrangements in place to ensure your safety and well-being. The Home Office requires specific parental consent and care arrangements for 16-17 year olds. Do you have a letter of consent from your parents regarding your travel and care arrangements in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a letter of consent from my parents yet. I didn't know I needed one. Is that something required for the visa application?

[root_agent]: You are correct, Lukas – a letter of consent is indeed required. It’s a crucial part of the process for 16 and 17-year-olds applying for a Skilled Worker Visa. Unfortunately, without that letter demonstrating parental consent and care arrangements, your application would be invalid.

Based on the information we've discussed, I have to conclude that your application is **INVALID / REFUSED.** The Home Office requires explicit parental consent for applicants under 18.

Do you understand why the application wouldn’t be successful in its current state?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand now. So even though I have a good job offer with a good salary, I can't get the visa without my parents' consent letter because I'm under 18. Is there anything specific this consent letter needs to include, or is it just a general statement saying they approve?

[root_agent]: That’s a good question, Lukas. The consent letter needs to be quite specific. It should outline details about your travel to the UK, your accommodation, and who will be responsible for your care and well-being while you’re there. It’s not enough for it to just be a general statement of approval. Ideally, it would include information like where you’ll be living, who will be providing you with meals and support, and a confirmation that they understand you’ll be working in the UK. 

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official guidance from the Home Office regarding the requirements for the consent letter?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa without a letter of parental consent, matching the expected outcome of "INVALID/REFUSED" due to missing child safeguards.
