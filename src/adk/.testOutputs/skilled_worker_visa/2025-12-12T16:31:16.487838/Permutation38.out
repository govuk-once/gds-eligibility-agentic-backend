[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Pavel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Pavel, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’ve been offered in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a mechanic and I've been offered a job at a garage in the UK. They said they want me to come work for them as soon as possible. I'm still here in Warsaw, Poland at the moment. They've already given me a Certificate of Sponsorship number so I can apply for my visa. I think they said it was an "Undefined" CoS from their allocation.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel, thank you for that information. Just to clarify, you’re currently located in Warsaw, Poland, and the UK garage has provided you with an "Undefined" Certificate of Sponsorship. 

To help me understand your situation fully, could you please tell me what kind of work you’ll be doing at the garage?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working as an automotive mechanic at their garage. I've been doing this work for about 10 years here in Poland. They're offering me a full-time position with a salary of about £28,000 per year. I'll be fixing cars, doing diagnostic work, and performing regular maintenance services. They said they need someone with my experience.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Pavel. That’s very helpful. Now, regarding the Certificate of Sponsorship – could you confirm for me, are you currently in the United Kingdom, or are you still based in Poland?

[evaluation_judge]: As I mentioned, I'm still here in Warsaw, Poland. I haven't been to the UK yet. I'm planning to apply for my visa from here in Poland once I understand the process better.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel, thanks for confirming that. Just to be absolutely clear, since you’re applying for the visa from outside the UK, and you received an "Undefined" Certificate of Sponsorship, are you aware that “Undefined” CoS certificates are only for applicants who are already inside the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that. The garage just told me they had a spare Certificate of Sponsorship they could assign to me, and that I should use the reference number they gave me to apply right away. They didn't mention anything about different types of CoS or that this one wouldn't work for me since I'm outside the UK. Is this going to be a problem?

[root_agent]: You’ve raised a very important point, Pavel. It appears there’s been a misunderstanding. Because you’re applying from outside the UK, the garage needs to provide you with a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship. An “Undefined” CoS is only valid for applications made while already in the UK. 

To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me, does the UK garage have the ability to apply for and assign you a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure about that. They didn't mention anything about different types of certificates. They just said they had some spare CoS allocations and assigned one to me. I'll need to contact them about this. So if I understand correctly, my current "Undefined" CoS won't work for my visa application since I'm outside the UK, and I'll need them to apply for a specific "Defined" CoS for me instead?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Pavel. You’ve got it exactly right. Your current “Undefined” Certificate of Sponsorship will not be sufficient for your visa application since you’re applying from outside the UK. The garage needs to apply for a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship specifically for you.

To help me understand your situation further, could you tell me – do you have any existing UK visas or have you ever been to the UK before?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I've never been to the UK before and I don't have any UK visas. This would be my first time applying. I've only traveled within the EU before since Poland is part of the EU. Do I need to tell the garage anything specific when I ask them about getting a "Defined" Certificate of Sponsorship?

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel, thank you for clarifying that you’ve never been to the UK and don’t have any previous visas. That’s important information.

When you contact the garage to request a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship, it’s best to be prepared. You’ll need to provide them with details about yourself and the job offer, such as your passport details, employment contract, and proof of your qualifications as an automotive mechanic. 

To help me give you more tailored advice, could you tell me – do you have a copy of your employment contract with the garage that outlines the job description and salary?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have the employment contract they sent me. It has all the details about my job as a mechanic, the £28,000 annual salary, my working hours, and the garage's location in the UK. It also mentions that they'll sponsor my visa, but it doesn't specifically mention what type of CoS they'll provide. Should I ask them to amend the contract to specifically mention a "Defined" CoS, or is that something separate from the contract?

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news about having the contract, Pavel. It’s good to see they’ve outlined their intention to sponsor your visa.

Regarding amending the contract – it’s generally not necessary to ask them to specifically add “Defined” CoS to the contract itself. The sponsorship process typically involves the garage applying for the CoS through the Home Office system. However, it *is* a good idea to confirm with them that they understand they need to apply for a “Defined” CoS for you, as you’re applying from outside the UK. 

To ensure clarity, could you tell me, when you contact the garage, what specific question will you ask them to confirm they understand the need for a “Defined” CoS?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll ask them something like: "I've been informed that since I'm applying from outside the UK, you need to apply for a specific 'Defined' Certificate of Sponsorship for me, rather than assign an 'Undefined' CoS from your allocation. Could you please confirm that you're able to do this, and what the process and timeline might be for getting this new type of CoS?"

Does that sound appropriate?

[root_agent]: That sounds absolutely perfect, Pavel! That’s a very clear and direct question that will help clarify the situation and ensure they understand the requirement for a “Defined” CoS. 

It’s great that you’ve taken the initiative to get this information.

Based on what you’ve told me, it seems likely that your visa application will be refused as it stands, due to the incorrect CoS being used. 

Do you have any other questions about the process or anything else I can help you with regarding your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: So just to be clear - if I go ahead and apply with this "Undefined" CoS that they've already given me, my application will definitely be rejected because I'm applying from outside the UK? And I need to wait for them to get a "Defined" CoS specifically for me before I can make a valid application? 

How long does it usually take for employers to get a "Defined" CoS? I'm a bit worried because they seemed eager for me to start as soon as possible.

[root_agent]: You’ve hit on a crucial point, Pavel, and yes, you are absolutely correct. Applying with the “Undefined” CoS when you’re applying from outside the UK will almost certainly result in a refusal. It’s a fundamental requirement for those outside the UK.

And you’re right to be cautious about the timeframe for a “Defined” CoS. It can vary, but typically it takes between 2-6 weeks for the Home Office to process a new “Defined” CoS application. However, it can sometimes take longer depending on the volume of applications the Home Office is processing. 

The garage’s eagerness to get you started shouldn’t overshadow the importance of a valid CoS.

To help you manage expectations, would you like me to outline the steps you should take to ensure a smooth process, including how to track the CoS application once it’s submitted?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful! I'd appreciate knowing the steps and how to track the application. I'll need to explain all this to the garage anyway, so having a clear understanding of the process will help me communicate with them better.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel, absolutely. Let’s break down the steps.

1.  **Garage Applies for “Defined” CoS:** The garage will submit an application to the Home Office for your “Defined” CoS, providing all the necessary information about you and the job.

2.  **Home Office Processing:** The Home Office will review the application. This can take 2-6 weeks.

3.  **CoS Issued:** Once approved, the Home Office will issue the “Defined” CoS reference number. The garage will then send this to you.

4.  **You Use CoS Reference:** You’ll use this reference number when you submit your visa application.

5.  **Tracking the Application:** The Home Office doesn’t provide a direct tracking system for individual CoS applications. However, the garage can check the status of the application through the online portal for sponsors: [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/checking-the-status-of-a-certificate-of-sponsorship](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/checking-the-status-of-a-certificate-of-sponsorship). It’s worth asking the garage to keep you updated on the progress.

Do you want me to elaborate on any of these steps, or perhaps explain how the garage can access the sponsorship portal?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that explanation is clear. So I'll have to tell the garage to apply for a "Defined" CoS for me, and then wait for them to get approval before I can submit my visa application. And there's no way to speed up this process? I'm just concerned because they seemed to want me to start quite soon.

[root_agent]: You’ve got it perfectly, Pavel. You’ll need to rely on their timely application and the Home Office’s processing time. Unfortunately, there’s no guaranteed way to speed up the CoS application process – it’s largely dependent on the Home Office’s workload.

I understand your concern about the garage’s eagerness to get you started. It's a common situation, and navigating these timelines can be a bit frustrating. 

It might be worth having a gentle conversation with the garage to reiterate the importance of securing the “Defined” CoS before proceeding with your visa application. You could say something like, “I appreciate your enthusiasm to get me started, and I'm eager to begin working too. To ensure a smooth visa application, it’s crucial that we have the ‘Defined’ CoS in place before I submit my application.”

Would you like me to suggest some further points to discuss with the garage regarding the timeline and potential next steps?

[evaluation_judge]: That would be helpful, yes. If you could suggest some other points I could discuss with them about the timeline and what we might need to do next, that would be great. I want to make sure I understand everything properly before I contact them.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel, let's think about some additional points to discuss with the garage. Here are a few suggestions:

1.  **Confirmation of Sponsor Responsibilities:** Ask them to confirm they’ll handle all aspects of the “Defined” CoS application, including submitting all required documents and communicating with the Home Office.

2.  **Understanding Potential Delays:** Gently inquire about their experience with CoS applications – do they typically encounter delays? This can help you manage your expectations.

3.  **Contact Information:** Obtain their direct contact person for CoS-related queries – this will streamline communication.

4.  **Next Steps After CoS Approval:** Ask what their process is for notifying you once the "Defined" CoS has been approved and issued.

5. **Supporting Documents:** Confirm what supporting documents you’ll need to provide to them to facilitate the CoS application process (e.g., copies of your passport, employment contract, qualifications).

Would you like me to tailor these suggestions further, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect of the conversation you’re most concerned about? For instance, would you like me to help you draft a specific sentence or two to use when you speak to the garage?

[evaluation_judge]: These points are great, thank you. I think I have a much better understanding now of what I need to discuss with the garage. Just to summarize what I've learned:

1. The "Undefined" CoS they've given me won't work for my visa application since I'm outside the UK
2. They need to apply for a "Defined" CoS specifically for me
3. This process will take 2-6 weeks through the Home Office
4. Only after they receive the "Defined" CoS and give me the reference number can I submit my visa application

I'll contact them tomorrow with all these points and the questions you suggested. Thank you for explaining this so clearly!

[root_agent]: Absolutely fantastic, Pavel! You’ve nailed the key information and are well-prepared to discuss it with the garage. It sounds like you’ve gained a very clear understanding of the process. 

I’m truly glad I could help clarify things for you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns as you move forward. Best of luck with your visa application – I’m confident it will work out well for you!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for all your help! I feel much more informed now about what needs to happen. I'll get in touch with the garage right away.

✓ The agent correctly identified that an "Undefined" CoS cannot be used for an out-of-country application and advised that Pavel would need a "Defined" CoS instead, matching the expected outcome of refusal with the current CoS.
