[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of Katarina, a waitress with a zero-hours contract offer, interacting with the agent being tested.

Hi, i'm Katarina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Katarina, it’s nice to meet you. I’d be happy to help you look into that. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, thanks for helping me. I've been offered a job as a waitress at a really nice event venue. They're paying £20 per hour which is great, and my employer wrote me a letter saying they expect me to work 40 hours a week which would be about £41,600 per year. It's on a zero-hours contract though. I'm from outside the UK and want to know if I can get a Skilled Worker visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Katarina. That’s very helpful. Just to confirm, that £41,600 is an *expected* salary, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. My employer's letter says they "expect" me to work 40 hours per week at £20 per hour, which would add up to £41,600 per year. But it's a zero-hours contract, so those hours aren't guaranteed.

[root_agent]: Okay, Katarina. Thank you for clarifying. Let me just ask you this: Does your employment contract guarantee a minimum number of working hours each week?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it doesn't guarantee any minimum hours. It's a zero-hours contract, so technically they could give me no hours at all in a particular week, although they've said they expect to give me 40 hours most weeks.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that, Katarina. I appreciate the detail. Based on what you’ve told me, it seems the salary isn’t guaranteed. Is the hourly rate of £20 per hour sufficient for the Skilled Worker visa requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the hourly rate is £20 per hour, which I thought was quite good. But you're right that the total amount isn't guaranteed since I'm on a zero-hours contract. Does that affect my eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: Yes, Katarina, it does. The Home Office requires that the salary offered be guaranteed. Because your earnings on a zero-hours contract aren’t guaranteed, we can’t proceed with assessing your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa at this time. Would you like me to explain why that’s the case?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why. I thought since the hourly rate was good and my employer expects me to work full-time hours that would be enough. Why does it matter that it's a zero-hours contract?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker visa requires a guaranteed minimum salary to ensure the worker receives a stable income. The Home Office doesn’t accept “expected” earnings from a zero-hours contract, even if the hourly rate is high. This is because the employer cannot guarantee the worker will earn the minimum threshold every year. A zero-hours contract means the number of hours you work can fluctuate, potentially leading to an income below the required threshold. 

Does that explanation make sense, Katarina?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. So even though the hourly rate is good and they expect me to work full-time hours, because my contract doesn't guarantee those hours, the visa would be refused? Is there anything I can do? Maybe ask my employer to change the contract to guarantee minimum hours?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit on the correct conclusion, Katarina. Unfortunately, based on the zero-hours contract and the lack of a guaranteed salary, the Skilled Worker visa would be refused.

Regarding your suggestion, yes, asking your employer to change the contract to guarantee minimum hours would be the best course of action to improve your chances of eligibility in the future. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today, or would you like me to summarise the key reasons for the refusal?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. Could you please summarize the key reasons for the refusal so I can explain this to my potential employer? It would help me when I ask them if they're willing to change the contract type.

[root_agent]: Okay, absolutely. Here’s a summary of the key reasons for the refusal regarding your Skilled Worker visa application:

*   **Uncertain Salary:** The contract is a zero-hours contract, meaning the number of hours you’ll work is not guaranteed.
*   **Home Office Requirement:** The Home Office requires a *guaranteed* minimum salary for Skilled Worker visas. They cannot accept “expected” earnings from a zero-hours contract, regardless of the hourly rate.
*   **Insufficient Guarantee:** Because the salary isn't guaranteed, it doesn't meet the minimum requirements for the visa.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps give you some additional information about alternative contract types that might be suitable for a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that my application would be refused because a zero-hours contract doesn't provide guaranteed earnings, which is required by the Home Office for a Skilled Worker visa, even though the hourly rate is high and the expected hours would meet the threshold.
