[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ali and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Ali, it’s good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you tell me how long you’ve been studying for your PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently in my third year of a four-year PhD program in Engineering. I've completed about 30 months of my studies so far.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Just to clarify, you’re currently in your third year of a four-year PhD program. And you’ve completed approximately 30 months of your studies.

Could you confirm whether you've graduated from your PhD program yet?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't graduated yet. I'm still working on my research and thesis. I still have about a year left before I complete the full program.

[root_agent]: Alright. And to be absolutely clear, you’re still enrolled in your PhD program and haven’t received your degree yet?

[evaluation_judge]: That's correct. I'm still actively enrolled in my PhD program and haven't received my degree yet. I'm continuing with my research and working toward completion.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Now, let me ask: Approximately how long have you been studying for your PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been studying for my PhD for about 30 months now - I'm in the third year of a four-year program.

[root_agent]: Okay, so you've been studying for your PhD for around 30 months. Just one more question for now – could you please confirm if you’ve completed at least 24 months of your PhD studies?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've definitely completed at least 24 months of my PhD studies. As I mentioned, I'm about 30 months into the program now.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for clarifying. Based on your responses, it appears you might be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa switch. Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why I might be eligible. I'm quite interested in understanding the requirements for switching to a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Certainly. As a PhD student, you have a specific concession under the Skilled Worker visa rules. It states that a student on a PhD course can switch to a Skilled Worker visa *before* graduating if they have completed at least 24 months of their PhD. Since you’ve completed 30 months, you meet this criteria. Unlike Bachelor’s or Master’s students, you don’t typically need to complete the course before applying. 

Do you have any questions about this specific rule or anything else regarding the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very interesting! I didn't realize PhD students had this special concession. So just to confirm, even though I haven't completed my PhD yet, I can switch to a Skilled Worker visa because I've been in the program for over 24 months?

Do I need to have a job offer in place already to make this switch?

[root_agent]: That’s correct. You’ve understood it perfectly! Even though you haven’t yet completed your PhD, fulfilling the 24-month requirement allows you to apply for a Skilled Worker visa.

And yes, you absolutely need to have a job offer from an eligible employer in place *before* you can apply for the Skilled Worker visa switch. The job offer needs to meet certain salary and occupation criteria. 

Would you like me to outline those job offer requirements in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful. I actually do have a job offer as an Engineering Consultant. I'd like to know if this job would qualify and what other requirements I need to meet for the visa switch.

[root_agent]: Okay, fantastic! Having a job offer is a key step. Let’s look at whether your Engineering Consultant role would qualify. Generally, roles within the Engineering sector are eligible for the Skilled Worker visa. However, the salary offered needs to meet the minimum threshold set by the government – currently £38,700 per year.

Could you tell me what the salary is for your Engineering Consultant role?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary for the Engineering Consultant position is £50,000 per year. I believe that's above the minimum threshold you mentioned.

[root_agent]: Excellent news! £50,000 is well above the current minimum salary requirement for the Skilled Worker visa. So, your job offer appears to be eligible. 

Now, to confirm everything, do you have a confirmed job offer letter from the employer stating the role, salary, and start date?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a formal job offer letter that outlines the Engineering Consultant role, the £50,000 salary, and a proposed start date three months from now. The company has also mentioned they are a licensed sponsor for skilled worker visas.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! That’s all very positive. Since you have a confirmed job offer with a licensed sponsor and meet the salary requirements, and you’ve completed over 24 months of your PhD, it certainly appears you are eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa. 

Would you like me to outline the next steps in the application process now, or would you like me to provide some links to the official government guidance?

[evaluation_judge]: I would definitely appreciate if you could outline the next steps in the application process, and if you have any official government links to share, that would be helpful too. I want to make sure I understand exactly what I need to do to successfully make this switch.

[root_agent]: Okay, absolutely. Let’s break down the next steps.

1.  **Employer Sponsorship:** Your employer (the licensed sponsor) will need to officially start the sponsorship process. They’ll need to provide you with a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS). This is a crucial document.

2.  **Your Application:** Once the CoS is issued, you’ll need to apply for the Skilled Worker visa online through the UK government website. 

3.  **Supporting Documents:** You’ll need to provide supporting documents with your application, including your passport, proof of English language proficiency (if required), and your job offer letter.

4.  **Fees:** There are application fees associated with the Skilled Worker visa.

Here are some helpful links to official government resources:

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps or provide further details about any specific requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: This is very comprehensive, thank you. I think I have a clear understanding now of what I need to do. Just to summarize what I've learned: As a PhD student who has completed more than 24 months of my program, I'm eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa even before graduation. With my job offer of £50,000 as an Engineering Consultant with a licensed sponsor, I meet the requirements. 

I'll work with my employer to get the Certificate of Sponsorship and then follow the application process. Thank you for explaining all this to me!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Ali! I’m absolutely delighted to hear that you have a clear understanding of the process and feel confident moving forward. It sounds like you’re well-prepared. 

If you have any further questions at any point during your application, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I wish you the very best of luck with your Skilled Worker visa application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that PhD students who have completed at least 24 months of their PhD program are eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa before graduation. They accurately assessed my eligibility based on my 30 months of study and confirmed job offer as an Engineering Consultant, matching the expected outcome of "AWARDED."
