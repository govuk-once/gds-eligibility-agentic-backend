[evaluation_judge]: I'll now assume the role of Maria, a nurse exploring her visa eligibility for supplementary work.

Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Maria, it’s nice to meet you. I understand you’re exploring your options for supplementary work as a Skilled Worker Nurse.

To start, could you tell me a little bit about the type of work you’re considering doing outside of your primary role as a Nurse?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently a nurse working full-time at City Hospital on a Skilled Worker visa. I've been offered some extra shifts at Memorial Hospital through an agency. The work would be the same - I'd be working as a nurse, but just at a different location. I'm wondering if this is allowed under my current visa or if I need to apply for something else. Last week was particularly busy, and I ended up working about 25 hours at Memorial on top of my regular job.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Maria. It’s helpful to have the details.

Just to clarify, you’re currently working as a Nurse at City Hospital under a Skilled Worker visa, and you’ve been offered extra shifts at Memorial Hospital as an Agency Nurse – essentially the same role, just at a different location.

Could you tell me what occupation code you use for your role as a Nurse at City Hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: My main job at City Hospital is under occupation code 2231 for Nurses. The work at Memorial Hospital would be exactly the same - nursing duties under the same occupation code. I'm just wondering if I'm allowed to do these additional shifts under my current visa since they offered me quite a few hours.

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria, thank you for clarifying that. So, your primary role at City Hospital is listed as occupation code 2231 for Nurses, and the work at Memorial Hospital would also involve nursing duties under the same code.

To help me assess the situation, could you tell me approximately how many hours per week you anticipate working at Memorial Hospital, on average?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, they're offering me shifts based on their needs. Last week was particularly busy and I worked about 25 hours at Memorial on top of my regular job at City Hospital. I think moving forward they would want me for around 20-25 hours per week depending on their staffing needs. Is that going to be an issue with my visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for outlining that, Maria. It sounds like the hours could vary, with a potential average of 20-25 hours per week at Memorial Hospital.

Let’s focus on the key aspect of supplementary work. According to the guidance, to take on a second job without a new visa, it needs to either be in the same occupation code, OR be on the Immigration Salary List, AND not exceed 20 hours per week.

Considering you’re doing the same job type (Nursing – occupation code 2231) at a different location, and you've mentioned a potential range of 20-25 hours per week, could you confirm whether you believe those hours would be *less* than 20 hours per week?

[evaluation_judge]: No, as I said, I worked 25 hours last week, and they're talking about similar hours going forward - generally 20-25 hours per week. So it would sometimes be more than 20 hours. Does this mean I'm not eligible to take on this supplementary work with my current visa?

[root_agent]: You are correct, Maria. Based on the information you’ve provided, the potential hours exceeding 20 hours per week would indeed make you ineligible for supplementary work under your current Skilled Worker visa.

Specifically, the guidance states that supplementary work must not exceed 20 hours per week outside of your contracted hours.

Therefore, I must advise that taking on this additional work could be considered a visa violation. Would you like me to explain the potential consequences of a visa violation in a bit more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would like to understand the potential consequences of a visa violation. Is there any way I could take this work legally, perhaps by reducing my hours to stay below 20 per week? Or would I need a completely new visa arrangement?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Maria, and it’s wise to explore all options.

Yes, you could potentially reduce your hours at the Agency Nurse position to ensure you remain below the 20-hour limit. This would be the simplest way to comply with your visa conditions.

Alternatively, you could explore a new visa arrangement, such as a ‘start-up’ visa, which *may* allow for limited supplementary work, but would require careful consideration and potentially further assessment. However, this would involve a more complex and likely lengthy application process.

Given the potential consequences of a visa violation – including future refusals or curtailment of your visa – it’s generally advisable to operate within the boundaries of your current Skilled Worker visa. 

Would you like me to elaborate on the potential consequences of a visa violation, or would you like me to provide you with some resources to explore the possibility of a ‘start-up’ visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I'll just keep the hours below 20 per week then. But could you tell me about the consequences of a visa violation? I want to make sure I fully understand the risks involved if I were to work those extra hours.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Maria. Let’s discuss the consequences of a visa violation.

A breach of your Skilled Worker visa conditions, such as working more than 20 hours per week on supplementary work, can lead to several significant outcomes:

*   **Future Visa Refusals:** A single visa violation can negatively impact your ability to apply for future visas, potentially leading to refusals.

*   **Visa Curtailment:** If your employer or the Home Office become aware of the violation, they can curtail your existing visa, meaning your visa will be revoked and you’ll be required to leave the UK.

*   **Potential Deportation:** In serious cases, repeated or significant breaches of visa conditions could lead to deportation proceedings.

*   **Difficulty Obtaining ILR (Indefinite Leave to Remain):** A history of visa violations can make it considerably more difficult to qualify for ILR.

It’s important to note that the Home Office has discretion in enforcing visa conditions. While a first-time, minor breach might not immediately result in curtailment, it’s a record that can be brought up during future visa applications.

Do you have any specific concerns or aspects of these consequences you'd like me to clarify further?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining that so clearly. The consequences sound quite serious, and I definitely don't want to risk my immigration status. I'll make sure to keep my supplementary work strictly under 20 hours per week to comply with my visa conditions. Is there anything else I should be aware of regarding supplementary work as a Skilled Worker visa holder?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Maria, and it’s excellent that you’re prioritizing compliance with your visa conditions. It’s wise to be cautious and avoid unnecessary risks.

Beyond the 20-hour limit, there are a few other key points to be aware of regarding supplementary work for Skilled Worker visa holders:

*   **Same Occupation:** As we’ve discussed, the work you take on must be in the same occupation code as your main role.

*   **Genuine Additional Work:** The supplementary work should be a genuine ‘extra’ – it shouldn't be intended to supplement your income while reducing your hours at your primary job.

*   **No Impact on Primary Job:** The extra work shouldn’t affect your ability to fulfil your duties at your main job.

*   **Employer’s Responsibility:** Your employer is responsible for ensuring you comply with the visa conditions. They should be aware of the restrictions regarding supplementary work.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps discuss how to ensure you maintain compliance with your visa conditions moving forward?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that working 25 hours per week in a supplementary job would violate my Skilled Worker visa conditions, which have a strict 20-hour limit for supplementary work. They accurately explained that this would be considered a visa violation even though the work was in the same occupation code, and outlined the potential consequences.
