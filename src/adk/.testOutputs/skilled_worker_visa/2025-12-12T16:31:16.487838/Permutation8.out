[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Priya and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Priya, it’s good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please confirm if you held a Skilled Worker visa before April 4th, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been living in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022. I'm working as a Marketing Manager currently, but I've got a job offer from a new marketing agency and I'm trying to figure out if I'm eligible to switch to them under the Skilled Worker route.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me what salary you’ve been offered for this new role as a Marketing Manager?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £32,000 per year for the new Marketing Manager role. I'm not sure if that's enough for the visa requirements these days, especially with all the recent changes.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Just to clarify, are you currently employed by the same employer you’ve held your Skilled Worker visa with since 2022, or are you looking to change employers as part of this visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm looking to change employers. My current visa is with my existing employer, but I'd like to move to this new marketing agency that's made me the offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Considering you’re looking to switch employers after holding a Skilled Worker visa since 2022, could you tell me what your current visa status is? Are you still on your current visa, or has it expired?

[evaluation_judge]: My current Skilled Worker visa is still valid. I want to switch to the new employer before my current visa expires.

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya. Just to be certain, could you confirm that you held a Skilled Worker visa *before* April 4th, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I've been on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022, so definitely before April 4th, 2024.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And to confirm, you’re aiming to switch to a new employer, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I want to switch to this new marketing agency that's offered me the job.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, regarding the salary for this new role, I understand you’ve been offered £32,000 per year. Could you tell me what the standard going rate for a Marketing Manager in this location is, according to your understanding?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for Marketing Managers is around £42,000 now. That's what I've heard is the current rate since the immigration rules changed. My offer is £32,000, which is less than that.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I also understand that there are transitional arrangements available for Skilled Worker visa holders who are changing employers after April 4th, 2024. Could you confirm whether you’ve been continuously resident on the Skilled Worker route since before April 4th, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been continuously resident in the UK on my Skilled Worker visa since 2022, so that's well before April 4th, 2024.

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya. Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – holding a Skilled Worker visa before April 4th, 2024, and being continuously resident since then, with a salary offer of £32,000 – it appears you qualify for the transitional arrangements.

Would you like me to explain those arrangements in more detail, or would you like me to confirm if the salary meets the relevant thresholds?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain a bit more about the transitional arrangements and confirm if my salary meets the requirements. I want to make sure I'm eligible before I proceed with my application.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The transitional arrangements offer some flexibility for Skilled Worker visa holders who are changing employers after April 4th, 2024. The General Salary Threshold is currently capped at £29,000 (indexed), and the Going Rate is based on the 25th percentile, which is £30,000.

Now, let’s look at your situation: Your salary offer is £32,000.  Since £32,000 is *above* the Transitional General Threshold of £29,000, and also above the Transitional Going Rate of £30,000, you *do* meet the criteria for these transitional arrangements.

Therefore, I can confirm that you are eligible for the transitional arrangements under the Skilled Worker visa route.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these arrangements, such as how they affect the required salary or any other related requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! So just to be completely clear - I qualify for the Skilled Worker visa with my new employer at the £32,000 salary, even though it's below the standard £42,000 going rate, because I'm protected by the transitional arrangements since I've been on a Skilled Worker visa since before April 2024?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Priya. You’ve understood it perfectly. Because you held a Skilled Worker visa before April 4th, 2024, and you’re continuing to work in a similar role, you are protected by the transitional arrangements. This allows you to be paid at the lower Transitional Going Rate of £30,000, even though the standard rate for a Marketing Manager is higher.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding your eligibility or the application process?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very reassuring, thank you. I was really worried about whether I'd qualify with the new immigration rules. Do I need to provide any special documentation to prove I qualify for these transitional arrangements? Or will the Home Office automatically know from my immigration history?

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible question, Priya. Generally, the Home Office *will* automatically recognize your eligibility for the transitional arrangements based on your immigration history – holding a Skilled Worker visa prior to April 4th, 2024.

However, to ensure a smooth application process and to provide them with all the necessary information, it’s a good idea to gather and submit supporting documentation. This might include:

*   A copy of your previous Skilled Worker visa grant letter.
*   A letter from your current employer confirming the details of your new role and salary.

While not always strictly required, providing these documents strengthens your application and demonstrates your eligibility clearly.

Would you like me to provide you with a list of the general documents typically required for a Skilled Worker visa application, just in case you want to gather those ahead of time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful. Could you please list the documents I'll need for my application? I want to make sure I have everything prepared properly.

[root_agent]: Okay, here’s a list of documents you’ll typically need for a Skilled Worker visa application. Please note that this is a general guide, and the Home Office may request additional documents depending on your individual circumstances:

**Essentials:**

*   **Application Form:** Completed Skilled Worker visa application form.
*   **Passport:** Valid passport with at least six months of validity remaining.
*   **Previous Skilled Worker Visa Documents:**
    *   Grant letter for your previous Skilled Worker visa.
    *   Visa vignette (the sticker in your passport).
*   **Proof of Funds:** Evidence that you have sufficient funds to support yourself in the UK (bank statements, savings statements).
*   **TB Test Results (if required):** Depending on your country of origin, you may need a valid TB test certificate.

**Employment Related:**

*   **Employment Offer Letter:** Letter from your new employer confirming the details of your job offer, salary, and terms of employment.
*   **Letter from Current Employer (if applicable):** A letter confirming your employment history on your previous Skilled Worker visa.
*   **Contract of Employment:** Your employment contract with the new employer.

**Other:**

*   **Proof of Address:** Utility bill, bank statement, or other official document confirming your current address in the UK.
*   **Police Certificate (if applicable):** If you have spent time outside the UK in the past, you may need a police certificate from each country.
*   **Marriage Certificate/Birth Certificates (if applicable):** If you’re applying with a family member.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these documents in more detail, or perhaps suggest where you might find some of them?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, this list is very comprehensive! I think I have most of these documents already, but it's good to have a complete checklist. One last question - do I need to take the new English language test for this visa application, or is that also waived because I'm under the transitional arrangements?

[root_agent]: That’s a great question, Priya. Yes, you are correct - because you’re applying under the transitional arrangements, you are exempt from needing to take the standard English language test as part of your Skilled Worker visa application.

The transitional rules provide an exemption for those whose previous visa was granted before the changes to English language requirements came into effect. This simplifies the process for you significantly!

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your visa application or the transitional arrangements?

[evaluation_judge]: That's fantastic news! I think I have all the information I need now to proceed with my application. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly about the transitional arrangements and confirming I'm eligible with my £32,000 salary. You've been incredibly helpful!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Priya! I’m absolutely delighted that I could assist you and provide you with the clarity you needed. It sounds like you’re well-prepared to proceed with your Skilled Worker visa application. 

Wishing you the very best of luck with your application – and congratulations on the new role! If you ever have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I qualify for the Skilled Worker visa under the transitional arrangements. They accurately explained that since I held a Skilled Worker visa before April 4th, 2024, I'm subject to the lower salary thresholds (£29,000 general threshold and £30,000 going rate) rather than the standard £41,700 threshold and £42,000 going rate. The agent confirmed my £32,000 salary meets both transitional requirements, matching the expected outcome.
