[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Mary, thank you for reaching out. It’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me a bit about your job experience? Specifically, what types of care work have you done?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a qualified carer from Zimbabwe with several years of experience working in residential care homes. I've recently been offered a position as a Senior Care Worker at a residential home in the UK. They're offering me £29,000 per year. I'm trying to understand if I can get a Health and Care visa, and also if my husband and two children would be able to come with me.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent to hear about the job offer and salary! It sounds like you’ve done a lot of great work. To help me understand your situation fully, could you tell me which occupation code best describes your role as a Senior Care Worker? You can find a list of occupation codes here: https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/occupation-codes

[evaluation_judge]: I believe my role falls under occupation code 6136 - Senior Care Worker. The job offer letter mentions this code specifically. I'll be working at a Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered residential care home.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So, you’re applying under occupation code 6136 – Senior Care Worker. Just to confirm, are you currently residing in Zimbabwe?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently living in Zimbabwe with my husband and our two children. We're hoping to move to the UK together when I start this new job.

[root_agent]: Okay, Mary. Thank you for confirming that. Now, let’s talk about the salary. The Skilled Worker visa requires a minimum salary. Considering your offer of £29,000, does that salary meet the specific Health and Care sector requirements? You can find details of those requirements here: https://www.gov.uk/health-and-care-route

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've checked that information. My offered salary of £29,000 meets the Health and Care visa salary requirements. The employer has confirmed this meets all the necessary thresholds for my role as a Senior Care Worker.

[root_agent]: That’s great news – the salary definitely meets the requirements. Now, let’s shift our focus to your family. Could you tell me, are you applying for the visa as the primary applicant, or are you applying for a family visa as well?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm applying as the primary applicant for a Health and Care visa, and I want my family (my husband and two children) to join me as dependents on my visa. We all want to relocate to the UK together.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mary. Just to be absolutely clear, your occupation code is 6136 – Senior Care Worker, your salary is £29,000, and you’re applying as the primary applicant with your husband and two children as dependents.

Now, I need to inform you of a specific rule that applies to applicants under occupation codes 6135 (Care Workers) and 6136 (Senior Care Workers). As of March 2024, these applicants are eligible for the visa but are **not** permitted to bring dependents (partners or children) to the UK.

Would you like me to explain that rule in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this rule in more detail. This is very concerning for me, as I was hoping my whole family could join me in the UK. When did this rule come into effect and is there any way around it? Are there any exceptions?

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, Mary. Let’s break down the rule. It came into effect on 8 March 2024. Essentially, if you’re applying under occupation codes 6135 or 6136, you *can* obtain the Skilled Worker visa, but you *cannot* include your spouse or children as dependents on that visa.

Regarding exceptions, currently, there aren’t any automatic exceptions to this rule. However, the Home Office does consider individual circumstances on a case-by-case basis. It’s possible, but not guaranteed, that an exception could be made.

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official Home Office guidance on this rule, so you can review the details yourself? Here’s the relevant page: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/dependent-pass-rules-for-skilled-worker-visa

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please provide that link. This is very disappointing news. So to be clear - I would be eligible for the Health and Care visa with my qualifications and salary, but my husband and children would not be allowed to join me as dependents? Are there any alternative visa routes they could apply for to join me, or would I have to move to the UK alone?

[root_agent]: You’re right to want to clarify, Mary. Yes, to reiterate, you would be eligible for the Health and Care visa with your qualifications and salary. However, as we discussed, your husband and children would not be able to join you as dependents under this route.

Regarding alternative visa routes for your family, there isn’t a straightforward path currently. Generally, family members would need to apply for a separate visa category, such as a visitor visa or potentially a fiancé(e) visa if your husband is eligible. However, these visas often have specific requirements and may not guarantee entry to the UK.

It does seem like the most likely scenario is that you would need to relocate to the UK alone, at least initially. 

Would you like me to provide you with links to information about those alternative visa routes, just for your information? Here are some relevant pages:

*   **Visitor visas:** https://www.gov.uk/visit-uk
*   **Fiancé(e) visas:** https://www.gov.uk/fiance-visa

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming. This is a difficult situation to consider. So based on everything you've told me, I would be eligible for the Health and Care visa as a Senior Care Worker with my £29,000 salary, but my husband and children would be refused as dependents due to the March 2024 rule change. I'll need to decide whether to move to the UK alone or explore other options.

Could you please confirm this final understanding is correct?

[root_agent]: Yes, Mary, that’s absolutely correct. Let’s recap to ensure we’re completely aligned: You are eligible for the Health and Care visa as a Senior Care Worker with a salary of £29,000. However, your husband and children would be refused as dependents due to the rule implemented on March 2024.

It sounds like a significant decision for you to make. I’m glad we’ve clarified the situation. Is there anything further I can assist you with today, or would you like me to provide any additional resources related to the visa process or relocation?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I would be eligible for the Health & Care visa as a Senior Care Worker, but my family would be refused as dependents due to the March 2024 rule change, matching the expected outcome of a split decision.
