[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you please tell me what subject your PhD is in?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a PhD in Modern History. I'm an American historian and I've been offered a job in the UK as a Historical Consultant for a media production company. I want to understand if I qualify for a skilled worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know. And what is the salary offered for this Historical Consultant role?

[evaluation_judge]: The role pays £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Could you tell me what you understand to be the standard going rate for a Historical Consultant role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for this role is £36,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Alright. Just to confirm, is there a valid sponsor for this job opportunity that you’re considering?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the media production company is a valid sponsor with the appropriate license.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Now, I need to check a specific detail regarding your eligibility. Does the offered salary of £35,000 meet the minimum salary threshold of £37,500 for a Non-STEM PhD under the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't aware of that specific threshold. So the requirement is £37,500 for a Non-STEM PhD? My offer is £35,000, which is below that amount.

[root_agent]: You’re absolutely right to point that out. Thank you for clarifying. One last question for now – does the salary offered represent at least 90% of the standard going rate for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe it does. If the standard going rate is £36,000, then 90% of that would be £32,400. My offer of £35,000 is above that threshold.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided, the salary doesn’t quite meet the required threshold of £37,500 for a Non-STEM PhD.

Therefore, unfortunately, I must conclude that you are not currently eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa under the Non-STEM PhD option.

Do you have any other questions about the criteria, or would you like me to explain anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: So even though my salary meets the 90% of the going rate requirement, I'm not eligible because it's below the £37,500 threshold for Non-STEM PhDs? How much would my salary need to increase to make me eligible?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit upon a crucial detail. To meet the Non-STEM PhD criteria, your salary needs to be £37,500 or higher.

Since your current salary is £35,000, you would need to increase your salary by £2,500 to meet the minimum requirement.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this, or perhaps explore other visa options that might be more suitable given your qualifications and salary?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's clear enough. I understand now that I need to either negotiate my salary up by £2,500 or look into other visa options. Thank you for explaining this to me.

✓ The agent correctly identified that I'm not eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa under the Non-STEM PhD option because my salary of £35,000 is below the required £37,500 threshold, even though it meets the 90% of going rate requirement.
