[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Klaus to test the agent's knowledge about the Immigration Salary List and eligibility requirements.

Hi, i'm Klaus and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Klaus, it’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’ve been offered? Specifically, what is the job title?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a welder in the UK. The company says it's on something called the Immigration Salary List. They're offering me £30,960 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Klaus. And just to confirm, you’ve been offered a job as a Welder, and the company believes it falls under the Immigration Salary List – which is great.

To help me understand your situation fully, could you tell me your age, please?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 45 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Klaus. That’s helpful to know.

Now, regarding the salary you’ve been offered, £30,960 per year, could you tell me what the going rate is for a Welder in the UK, according to the employer?

[evaluation_judge]: The employer mentioned that the going rate for welders is £38,700. But they told me that since the position is on the Immigration Salary List, they can pay me 80% of that going rate, which is why they're offering £30,960.

[root_agent]: Okay, Klaus, thank you for clarifying that. So, the employer is basing the offer on the Immigration Salary List and applying a 80% discount to the going rate.

To make sure I fully understand, can you confirm that this is a job that is listed on the Immigration Salary List (ISL)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the employer confirmed that welders are on the Immigration Salary List. That's why they thought they could offer me 80% of the going rate.

[root_agent]: Alright, Klaus. Thank you for confirming that.

Let’s move on to a key question about your eligibility. Could you please tell me your current age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 45 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Klaus.

Now, I need to check a specific detail related to the Immigration Salary List. Considering your age of 45 and the fact that this job is on the ISL, does the employer intend to pay you 80% of the going rate for a Welder, as they initially indicated?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's my understanding. They told me that since the welding job is on the Immigration Salary List, they can pay me 80% of the going rate, which is why they're offering me £30,960 instead of the full going rate of £38,700.

[root_agent]: Okay, Klaus. Thank you for confirming.

Let me quickly check something… Based on the current rules regarding the Immigration Salary List, and your age of 45, it appears that the salary of £30,960 does not meet the general floor threshold (£33,400) and, crucially, does not meet the going rate (£38,700) even with the 80% discount.

Therefore, I must conclude that your application would be refused under current Immigration Salary List rules.

Do you understand this assessment, Klaus?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't understand. The employer specifically told me that since the job is on the Immigration Salary List, they can pay me 80% of the going rate, which is why they offered £30,960. Are you saying that's not correct? Could you explain why?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to question that, Klaus. My apologies for the confusion. I was focusing too much on the 80% discount and not enough on the overall criteria. 

The key change is that the Immigration Salary List no longer automatically grants an 80% discount on the going rate, regardless of age. It sets a lower *general* threshold, but you must still meet the full going rate unless you qualify as a New Entrant.

With a going rate of £38,700 and your age of 45, the offer of £30,960 simply doesn’t meet the requirements for the Immigration Salary List.

Therefore, I must confirm that your application would be refused.

I sincerely apologize for the initial misunderstanding. Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: So you're saying the employer is wrong about being able to pay me 80% of the going rate just because the job is on the Immigration Salary List? I thought that was the whole point of the list.

[root_agent]: That’s exactly right, Klaus. You’ve grasped the important distinction perfectly. The Immigration Salary List *does* provide a lower threshold, but it does *not* automatically entitle a sponsor to pay 80% of the going rate. The 80% discount was a previous arrangement that’s no longer in effect for most roles.

As I explained before, with a going rate of £38,700 for a welder, and your age, the offered salary of £30,960 doesn’t meet the requirements for the ISL.

I apologize again for the initial confusion. Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding this situation?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so they're using outdated information. That's disappointing. Just to be clear - if I'm 45 years old and applying for a welder job that's on the Immigration Salary List, I would need to be paid the full going rate of £38,700, not 80% of it. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: Yes, Klaus, you’ve got it perfectly. If you’re 45 years old and applying for a welder job on the Immigration Salary List, you would absolutely need to be paid the full going rate of £38,700 – not 80% of it. 

I’m glad we’ve cleared up the confusion. It’s understandable to be disappointed when an employer isn’t using the most up-to-date information.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or would you like me to simply conclude our conversation?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. No, I think that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining it clearly to me.

✓ The agent correctly identified that Klaus would be refused for the visa because the ISL no longer automatically allows paying 80% of the going rate. The agent properly explained that at 45 years old, Klaus would need to be paid the full going rate of £38,700 rather than the offered £30,960.
