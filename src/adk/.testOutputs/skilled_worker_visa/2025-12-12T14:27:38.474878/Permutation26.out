[evaluation_judge]: I'll engage in a conversation with the agent as Klaus, who is seeking information about his eligibility for a work visa based on an ISL job offer.

Hi, i'm Klaus and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Klaus, it’s nice to meet you. To help me understand your situation, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’ve been offered? Specifically, what is the job title?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Welder with a company in the UK. They want to sponsor me for a work visa. I'm trying to figure out if I'll be eligible.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. And what salary are you being offered for this Welder position?

[evaluation_judge]: They're offering me a salary of £30,960 per year.

[root_agent]: Alright. And do you know what the ‘going rate’ for a Welder is in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I think my employer mentioned something about the going rate being around £38,700. They said they could offer me less because welding is on some kind of special list.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify, you mentioned this welding job is on a “special list”. Could you tell me which list you’ve been informed of – is it the Skilled Worker Visa list, or something else?

[evaluation_judge]: My employer mentioned that welding is now on the Immigration Salary List (ISL), which they said replaced an older list called the Shortage Occupation List. They told me this means they can pay me 80% of the going rate, which is why they're offering £30,960.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Just to confirm, you believe your employer is relying on the Immigration Salary List (ISL) because welding is on it, and they’re offering you 80% of the going rate, which is £30,960?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, exactly. That's what they explained to me. I'm 45 years old if that matters, and this would be my first time working in the UK. They seem confident about the visa situation, but I wanted to check if everything is in order.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know your age and that this would be your first time working in the UK. Let’s take a closer look at this ISL offer. Could you tell me what the ‘going rate’ for a Welder is, according to official sources, not just what your employer mentioned?

[evaluation_judge]: From what my employer showed me in the documentation, the official going rate for a Welder in the UK is £38,700. They calculated my offered salary of £30,960 as 80% of this amount.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. So, the official going rate is £38,700. Now, let’s check whether your offered salary meets the ISL’s general floor. The ISL general floor is £33,400. Would you agree that £30,960 does not meet that threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I see. So my offered salary of £30,960 is below the ISL general floor of £33,400. I wasn't aware of this requirement. My employer didn't mention anything about a general floor, they just focused on the 80% of going rate calculation.

[root_agent]: You’re right to point that out. It seems your employer may not be fully aware of all the current ISL rules. Let's move on to another important factor. Are you eligible to claim the 80% discount on the going rate, as you mentioned before?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure. What makes someone eligible for the 80% discount? My employer seemed to think I qualified just because welding is on the ISL. Is there more to it than that?

[root_agent]: That’s a really important question. You’re correct to question that assumption. Under current ISL rules, being on the list alone doesn't automatically grant the 80% discount. It’s a more complex process. To help me determine your eligibility, could you tell me if you are considered a ‘New Entrant’?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't think I would be considered a 'New Entrant'. I'm 45 years old and I've been working as a welder for over 20 years, just not in the UK. Does that help clarify?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Okay, so you are not a New Entrant. Given that your salary is below the ISL general floor (£33,400) and you are not a New Entrant, it appears that your employer is applying outdated logic based on the old Shortage Occupation List. Under current ISL rules, you would need to be paid the full going rate of £38,700.

Based on this information, it seems unlikely the visa application would be successful with the current offer. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding your visa options?

[evaluation_judge]: So you're saying I won't be eligible for the visa with my current offer? My employer seemed so confident that because welding is on the ISL, they could pay me 80% of the going rate. Are you certain that this is no longer the case? Is there anything else I could do to make this work?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to seek clarification and explore other options. Let me reiterate: currently, with your salary of £30,960 and being outside the New Entrant category, you cannot receive the 80% discount under the ISL rules. It’s not that the ISL isn’t being used – it’s that the specific discount you were anticipating isn’t available in your situation.

There are a few potential avenues, though they might require adjustments. Your employer could consider increasing your salary to meet the £33,400 general floor, or raising it to the full £38,700 going rate. Alternatively, they could explore other visa routes, though those often have different requirements. 

Would you like me to briefly outline some alternative visa options that might be suitable, or would you prefer to discuss ways to work with your employer to adjust the salary offer?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I should talk to my employer about adjusting the salary offer first. It sounds like they're using outdated information about how the ISL works. So to be absolutely clear - for me to be eligible for this visa, they would need to offer at least £38,700, which is the full going rate for welders, correct? The 80% discount doesn't apply in my case because I'm not a New Entrant, even though welding is on the ISL?

[root_agent]: You’ve grasped it perfectly. To be absolutely clear, yes – for you to be eligible for this visa under the current ISL rules, your employer would need to offer you at least £38,700, which is the full going rate for welders. And, you are correct; the 80% discount doesn’t apply to you because you are not a New Entrant.

It’s good that you’re seeking further clarification from your employer. Do you want me to suggest some phrasing you could use when you speak to them about increasing your salary, or would you prefer to simply continue discussing potential next steps?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand the situation well now. I'll explain to my employer that they need to adjust their salary offer to meet the current ISL requirements, which means offering the full going rate of £38,700 since I don't qualify as a New Entrant. Thank you for clearing this up for me - it's much better to know this now than to have a visa application rejected later.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Klaus. I’m genuinely glad I could help clarify the situation and prevent any potential disappointment down the line. It’s certainly much better to have this information upfront. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Good luck with your conversation with your employer!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that Klaus would be refused for the visa based on the current offer. They accurately explained that being on the ISL alone doesn't grant the 80% discount on the going rate anymore, and that Klaus needs to be paid the full going rate of £38,700 since he's not a New Entrant.
