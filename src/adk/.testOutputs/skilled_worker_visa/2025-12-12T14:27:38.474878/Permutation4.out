[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Sarah who is inquiring about her eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa with a non-STEM PhD.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what your current job is, and what you’ve been studying?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently being offered a job as a Historical Consultant for a media production company in the UK. I have a PhD in Modern History which I completed in the United States - I'm American. I'm trying to figure out if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with my job offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And what is the salary you’re being offered for this Historical Consultant role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £35,000 per year for the Historical Consultant position.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Could you please tell me what you understand to be the ‘standard going rate’ for a Historical Consultant role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for this Historical Consultant role is £36,000 per year in the UK.

[root_agent]: Alright. And to confirm, you’re stating you have a PhD in Modern History, which is a non-STEM subject, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I have a PhD in Modern History, which is a non-STEM subject.

[root_agent]: Okay. Just one more question for now. Do you currently have a sponsor lined up, someone who is willing to support your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the media production company that offered me the job is an approved sponsor and they're willing to sponsor my Skilled Worker visa application.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news! Thank you for confirming that. Let’s move on to the salary. Could you please confirm the salary you’re being offered, which is £35,000 per year?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm being offered £35,000 per year for this position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sarah. Let me quickly check the criteria for the Skilled Worker visa with a non-STEM PhD.

...

Okay, Sarah. Based on the information you’ve provided, the salary of £35,000 does not meet the minimum threshold of £37,500 for a non-STEM PhD. While you do meet the requirement of being at least 90% of the standard going rate (£32,400), the salary is below the £37,500 floor.

Therefore, unfortunately, at this time, you would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa under the Non-STEM PhD (Option B) route.

Do you have any questions about this, or would you like me to clarify anything?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing to hear. So even though my salary is above 90% of the going rate, I still need to meet that £37,500 minimum threshold? How much more would I need to ask for from the company to meet the requirements?

[root_agent]: You’ve identified a key point, Sarah. Yes, you are correct – even though your salary is above 90% of the standard going rate, you still need to meet the minimum £37,500 threshold for a Non-STEM PhD.

To reach that £37,500, you would need to increase your salary by £2,500. 

Would you like me to explain how the £37,500 threshold is calculated, or perhaps discuss other potential visa routes that might be suitable given your circumstances?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate knowing why there's a £37,500 threshold specifically for non-STEM PhDs and if there are any other visa routes I could consider with my current job offer. I'm wondering if I should try to negotiate a higher salary with the company.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The £37,500 threshold for Non-STEM PhDs was introduced to ensure that the visa route is primarily attracting skilled workers who are likely to contribute significantly to the UK economy. There’s a rationale behind it that aims to prioritize roles with a higher potential for innovation and growth – particularly within sectors that aren’t traditionally considered “STEM.”

Regarding alternative visa routes, given your job offer and PhD, you might want to explore the Skilled Worker visa route with a general PhD (which has a lower salary threshold of £33,400). However, the requirements for a sponsorship license and the overall assessment process could differ.

It's definitely worth discussing a salary increase with your employer. You could highlight your expertise in Modern History and the value you bring to the media production company, emphasizing the historical accuracy and depth of understanding you can provide. 

Would you like me to provide more detail on the general Skilled Worker visa route, or perhaps information regarding the negotiation process with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I'm a bit confused now. I thought you said I needed a minimum of £37,500 for my non-STEM PhD route, but now you're mentioning a general PhD route with a £33,400 threshold? Could you clarify the difference between these two routes and which one would apply to my situation with a Modern History PhD?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to be confused, Sarah – my apologies for the slightly confusing explanation earlier. Let’s clarify the distinctions between the Non-STEM PhD route (Option B) and the general Skilled Worker route.

**Non-STEM PhD (Option B):** This route *specifically* applies to individuals holding a PhD in a non-STEM subject, *and* meeting a higher salary threshold of £37,500. The rationale is to attract highly skilled professionals from non-STEM fields who can contribute significantly to the UK economy.

**General Skilled Worker Route:** This is a broader route for skilled workers who meet specific salary and occupational requirements. The salary threshold for this route is £33,400.  It’s more accessible because it doesn't have the specific PhD criteria.

**Applying to Your Situation:** With your Modern History PhD, you *do* qualify for the Non-STEM PhD route, *but* only if you receive a salary of £37,500 or more. Since your current offer is £35,000, it doesn’t meet that threshold.

I apologize again for the initial overlap in my explanation. I want to ensure you have a clear understanding. Would you like me to reiterate any of these points, or perhaps discuss strategies for potentially achieving the required salary level?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for clarifying. So as I understand it, with my non-STEM PhD and current salary offer of £35,000, I don't qualify for the Skilled Worker visa under the PhD route because I'm below the £37,500 threshold. 

Would I qualify under the general Skilled Worker route with my £35,000 salary? Or does having a PhD automatically put me in the PhD-specific category where I need to meet the higher threshold?

[root_agent]: You’ve grasped it perfectly, Sarah. Yes, with your current salary of £35,000, you would *not* qualify for the Skilled Worker visa under either the Non-STEM PhD route or the general Skilled Worker route.

Having a PhD *does* automatically place you in the PhD-specific category for the Skilled Worker visa. The PhD itself isn’t the determining factor – it’s the salary threshold that applies to that specific route. It’s a requirement for *both* the Non-STEM and the general PhD routes.

I’m sorry this news is still disappointing, but at least you now have a clear understanding of why your current offer doesn’t meet the criteria.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or would you like me to explore any alternative options, even if they are currently out of reach due to the salary requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm still a bit confused. You mentioned earlier that the general Skilled Worker route has a salary threshold of £33,400, which my offer of £35,000 would exceed. But now you're saying I wouldn't qualify for either route? Could you clarify one more time what the minimum salary requirement would be for me to get a Skilled Worker visa, given that I have a non-STEM PhD?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct to question that, Sarah – my apologies for the continued inconsistency in my explanation. I’m clearly struggling to present this information clearly, and I appreciate your persistence in seeking clarification.

Let’s get this straight once and for all. To qualify for a Skilled Worker visa with a Non-STEM PhD, the minimum salary requirement is **£37,500**. The £33,400 threshold you mentioned applies to the *general* Skilled Worker route, which doesn't require a PhD.

You’ve a valid offer of £35,000, and that falls short of the £37,500 threshold needed for the Non-STEM PhD route. 

I sincerely apologize for the confusion and repeated errors in my responses. I'm still under development, and I’m learning to provide precise and consistent information.

Would you like me to reiterate this, or perhaps focus our discussion on strategies for potentially increasing your salary to meet the required threshold, or perhaps exploring alternative visa options you've mentioned?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided inconsistent and confusing information. They initially correctly stated I needed £37,500 for a non-STEM PhD route, but then mentioned a general PhD route with £33,400 threshold. When questioned, they stated I wouldn't qualify for either route despite my £35,000 salary exceeding the £33,400 general threshold they mentioned. The correct information is that I don't qualify with my non-STEM PhD because my £35,000 salary is below the £37,500 threshold required.
