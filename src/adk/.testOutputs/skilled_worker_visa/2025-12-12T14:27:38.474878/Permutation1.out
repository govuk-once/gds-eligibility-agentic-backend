[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Elena. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’ve been offered? Specifically, what is the job title?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Senior Engineering Manager at a fintech firm in London. I'm from Brazil and have about 10 years of experience in software engineering.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Elena. And to confirm, you’ve been offered a Senior Engineering Manager role in London, correct? Just to be absolutely clear, could you tell me what level of qualification this role requires – for example, is it RQF Level 6 or something else?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I've been offered a Senior Engineering Manager role in London. The position requires RQF Level 6 qualification. I have 10 years of experience in the field, though I don't have a PhD.

[root_agent]: Okay, Elena. Thank you for clarifying that. Now, let’s talk about salary. What is the annual salary being offered for this Senior Engineering Manager position?

[evaluation_judge]: The company has offered me £85,000 per year for this position.

[root_agent]: Alright, £85,000 per year. And just to double-check, is there a licensed sponsor associated with this job offer – meaning a company that’s authorized to sponsor visas for foreign workers?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the fintech firm that offered me the position is a licensed sponsor that can sponsor visas for foreign workers like myself.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news, Elena. Finally, to assess your eligibility, could you tell me what your English language proficiency is? Do you have a recognised English language qualification, such as IELTS or TOEFL?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've passed the Secure English Language Test (SELT) with distinction. My English proficiency is quite good as I've been working with international teams for many years.

[root_agent]: Perfect. Thank you for confirming that, Elena. Now, let’s move on to the specific salary threshold. The Skilled Worker Visa requires a salary of at least £41,700. Does the offered salary of £85,000 meet this requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £85,000 is well above the £41,700 requirement.

[root_agent]: Great! Now, let’s consider the “going rate” for this role. Could you tell me what the standard going rate is for a Senior Engineering Manager in London?

[evaluation_judge]: The standard going rate for a Senior Engineering Manager in London is £75,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Just one final question regarding the salary: Does your offered salary of £85,000 exceed the standard going rate of £75,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £85,000 exceeds the standard going rate of £75,000 for this position.

[root_agent]: Excellent! Based on your answers – a licensed sponsor, an RQF Level 6 qualification, a passing SELT, a salary of £85,000 (exceeding both the general threshold and the going rate – £75,000) – I’m happy to confirm that you meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa.

**AWARDED.**

Would you like me to provide you with any further information about the Skilled Worker Visa process?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! Thank you for confirming my eligibility. Could you briefly explain what the next steps would be in the application process for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Elena. The next steps typically involve the following:

1.  **Employer Sponsorship:** Your employer will need to formally apply to the Home Office to sponsor you for the Skilled Worker Visa. They’ll need to demonstrate that they meet specific requirements and that you meet the necessary criteria.

2.  **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):** Once approved, your employer will issue you a Certificate of Sponsorship, which is a unique reference number. You’ll need this to apply for the visa.

3.  **Online Visa Application:** You’ll then complete an online visa application form, providing details about yourself, your job, and your finances.

4.  **Supporting Documents:** You’ll need to gather and submit supporting documents, such as your passport, proof of qualifications, and bank statements.

5.  **Biometrics Appointment:** You’ll need to attend a biometrics appointment to provide fingerprints and a photograph.

6.  **Visa Decision:** The Home Office will then process your application and make a decision.

It’s a fairly involved process, but your employer’s sponsorship will make it significantly smoother. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps, or perhaps point you to some helpful resources on the government website?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, that's a very helpful overview. I think I have a good understanding of the process now. My employer has mentioned they'll help guide me through the sponsorship process, but I'll definitely check the government website for more details. Is there an estimated timeline for how long this whole process typically takes from start to finish?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Elena! That’s a great plan.

Regarding the timeline, it can vary, but typically the entire Skilled Worker Visa process, from initial sponsorship application to visa grant, takes between **12 to 3 months**. However, it’s important to note that this is just an estimate. The speed of processing can depend on several factors, including the Home Office’s workload, the completeness of your application, and any potential issues that may arise.

Your employer’s assistance will certainly help keep things moving efficiently. Again, I’m glad I could assist you in understanding this process. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for the information! I appreciate knowing that it could take between 1-3 months. My employer mentioned they'd like me to start in about 4 months, so that should give us enough time. I don't have any more questions right now. You've been very helpful in confirming my eligibility and explaining the process. Thank you!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Elena! I’m delighted I could assist you. It sounds like you’re well on your way, and I wish you the very best with your move to London and your new role. If you do have any further questions down the line, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa based on my scenario details. They confirmed that I meet all the criteria: licensed sponsor, RQF Level 6 qualification, passing English language test, and salary (£85,000) exceeding both the general threshold (£41,700) and the going rate (£75,000). The final determination of "AWARDED" matches the expected outcome.
