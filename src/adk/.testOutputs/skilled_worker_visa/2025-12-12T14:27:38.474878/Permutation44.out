[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lukas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Lukas, it’s great to speak with you! To start, could you tell me a little about your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Since you’re 17, it’s important to check a specific requirement for your situation. The Skilled Worker Visa has additional rules for applicants under 18.

Could you tell me, do you have a letter of consent from your parents or legal guardians regarding your travel and care arrangements while you’re in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a letter of consent from my parents. I didn't know I needed one. Is that a problem? I've got a job offer as a Junior Developer with a salary of £34,000.

[root_agent]: I understand. Thank you for clarifying that. Because you don't have a letter of consent from your parents or legal guardians, and that’s a specific requirement for applicants under 18, the application would be considered invalid. 

Do you have any questions about why this is the case, or would you like me to explain the safeguarding requirements in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you please explain the safeguarding requirements? I thought since I had a good job offer, the visa would be straightforward.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Home Office has specific “Child Safeguard” requirements to protect young people when they’re living abroad. These safeguards ensure a child is adequately cared for and supported while in the UK. 

Essentially, they need to be confident that you're not at risk of neglect or harm.  Having a good job offer is fantastic, but it doesn’t automatically override these protections. The requirement for parental consent is a key part of ensuring those safeguards are in place.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of that explanation, or would you like me to state the overall outcome of your application based on this information?

[evaluation_judge]: Please state the overall outcome of my application.

[root_agent]: Okay, based on the information we’ve discussed – your age (17), the lack of parental consent for travel and care arrangements – the overall outcome of your Skilled Worker Visa application would be **INVALID / REFUSED**.

Thank you for your patience and for providing the information needed to assess your eligibility. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that my application would be invalid/refused due to missing parental consent, which matches the expected outcome.
