[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ravi and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Ravi, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the specific job you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a System Administrator at TechRecruit Ltd. They're an IT consultancy company based in the UK. The position pays £50,000 per year, which I understand is a good salary in the UK. I'm currently living in India and would need to move to the UK for this role. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Just to be clear, TechRecruit Ltd is the company sponsoring you for this role, correct? And you will be working at Bank Corp, which is a separate client of TechRecruit Ltd?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. TechRecruit Ltd would be my sponsor and employer, but my actual work location would be at Bank Corp, which is their client. I'd be working as a System Administrator there full-time and reporting to managers at Bank Corp. TechRecruit has told me this is a long-term arrangement with no end date specified.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi. That’s very helpful. Could you describe the specific duties and responsibilities you would have as a System Administrator at Bank Corp?

[evaluation_judge]: As a System Administrator at Bank Corp, I'd be responsible for maintaining their IT infrastructure - managing their servers, network equipment, and security systems. I'll be handling system backups, user account management, troubleshooting technical issues, and ensuring their systems run smoothly. I'd also be involved in implementing new systems when needed and providing technical support to Bank Corp employees. I was told I'd be reporting directly to their IT Manager and working solely at their location. TechRecruit mentioned that Bank Corp needed someone permanently for this role.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that detailed explanation. Just one more question regarding your employment structure: Does TechRecruit Ltd retain full responsibility for the duties you’ll be performing at Bank Corp, or will Bank Corp also have a direct hand in managing your work and assigning tasks?

[evaluation_judge]: From what TechRecruit explained to me, Bank Corp will have a direct hand in managing my work and assigning tasks. I'd be reporting directly to the IT Manager at Bank Corp, and they would be setting my daily priorities and responsibilities. TechRecruit would handle my payroll and HR matters, but all my actual work duties, performance reviews, and day-to-day management would be handled by Bank Corp managers. TechRecruit mentioned they'd check in occasionally, but essentially I'd be integrated into Bank Corp's IT team, working under their direction.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi. Based on this information, I’m afraid I have to advise that your situation may not be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa.

Specifically, the Skilled Worker visa rules prevent sponsors from supplying workers to third parties – in your case, Bank Corp – if the role involves filling a routine permanent position. TechRecruit Ltd is acting as a recruitment agency, essentially placing you as an agency worker with Bank Corp, and retaining control over your work.

Therefore, I must advise that **REFUSED.** The Home Office would likely determine that TechRecruit Ltd is not the entity requiring the role, but is instead supplying labor to a third party.

Do you have any questions about this assessment, or would you like me to explain any part of the reasoning in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. I wasn't aware of this rule about third-party placements. So even though my salary meets the threshold and the job is skilled, I can't get a Skilled Worker visa because I'd be placed permanently at Bank Corp while being employed by TechRecruit? Is there any alternative way this arrangement could work? Perhaps if TechRecruit had more direct supervision over my work?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit on a key point, Ravi. Yes, the core of the issue is the “contracting out” rule – that TechRecruit Ltd’s role as a recruitment agency effectively means they’re supplying labor to a third party, Bank Corp, and retaining control over your work.

Unfortunately, your current arrangement – with Bank Corp directly managing your day-to-day tasks and TechRecruit handling payroll – doesn’t meet the criteria for a Skilled Worker visa. There isn’t a straightforward alternative arrangement that would satisfy the rules as they stand.

The situation requires TechRecruit Ltd to either directly employ you and be responsible for your duties at Bank Corp, or for you to find a role where you're directly employed by Bank Corp.

I understand this is disappointing news. Would you like me to reiterate the specific criteria from the Skilled Worker visa guidelines that are being violated, or perhaps explain the potential implications of this refusal?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly advised that my application would be refused because it violates the third-party ban rule, accurately explaining that TechRecruit is essentially acting as a recruitment agency supplying labor to Bank Corp, which is against Skilled Worker visa regulations.
