[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Leo, a Master's student from China looking into switching to a Skilled Worker visa before completing his course.

Hi, i'm Leo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Leo, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me what type of course you are currently studying?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm studying a Master's degree in Marketing at a university here in the UK. I've been here since last year on my Student visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And when does your current Student visa expire?

[evaluation_judge]: My Student visa is valid until September 2026, which is when my course is supposed to end. But I've actually received a job offer that would start in January 2026, so I'm trying to figure out if I can switch to a Skilled Worker visa before completing my course.

[root_agent]: I understand. And just to confirm, you’re currently in the UK studying for your Master's degree in Marketing, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm currently in the UK studying for my Master's degree in Marketing. It's December 2025 now, so I'm about halfway through the academic year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. To help me assess your situation, could you tell me whether you are a PhD student, or are you studying a regular Master’s degree?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm studying a regular Master's degree in Marketing, not a PhD.

[root_agent]: Alright. And approximately how many months have you already completed of your Master’s course so far?

[evaluation_judge]: I started in September last year, so I've completed about 15 months of my Master's course so far. I still have about 9 months left until completion in September 2026.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to be clear, your Student visa expires in September 2026, and you've completed approximately 15 months of your Master’s degree, with roughly 9 months remaining?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. My Student visa expires in September 2026 when my course is scheduled to end. I've completed about 15 months of my Master's degree, with around 9 months remaining before I graduate.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming all of that. Now, I need to ask you – have you completed the entire course, or have you finished all your exams and coursework?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't completed the entire course yet. I still have exams and coursework to finish in the coming months, plus my dissertation. Like I mentioned, I'm only about halfway through this academic year.

[root_agent]: I understand. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re studying a regular Master’s degree, your visa expires in September 2026, you’ve completed around 15 months, and you haven’t finished the entire course – you are not currently eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa from inside the UK.

Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why I'm not eligible to switch. I thought since I already had a job offer as a Marketing Executive starting in January 2026, I could switch to a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The criteria for switching to a Skilled Worker visa from inside the UK requires you to have completed your course, or for PhD students, at least 24 months of your studies. As you’ve explained, you haven’t completed your degree – you’re still halfway through your academic year and have exams and coursework remaining, plus your dissertation to write. 

Because you haven't met this requirement, you cannot switch to a Skilled Worker visa while you are still studying.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding this?

[evaluation_judge]: That's unfortunate. Is there any way I can still take this job? Would I need to leave the UK and apply from China instead? Or do I have to finish my degree first no matter what?

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible question, and it’s understandable you’re exploring all your options.

Essentially, yes, you would likely need to leave the UK and apply for the Skilled Worker visa from outside the country – this is often referred to as an “Entry Clearance” application. Switching while studying isn’t permitted.

Finishing your degree first is the most straightforward route to being eligible for a Skilled Worker visa.

Would you like me to explain a bit more about the process of applying for a Skilled Worker visa from outside the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain more about applying from outside the UK. If I decide to take this job opportunity, what would be the process? Would I need to explain why I'm not completing my degree? And how long would it typically take to get the visa approved if I apply from China?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s talk about applying for a Skilled Worker visa from outside the UK.

If you decide to leave the UK to apply, you’ll need to apply for a new visa – an Entry Clearance – as an applicant outside the UK. The application process is similar to applying from within the UK, but with some key differences.

You’ll need to demonstrate that you meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker visa, including proving your job offer and your qualifications. Importantly, you’ll need to explain your situation – highlighting that you’ve received a job offer and are choosing to pursue this opportunity. You won’t need to explain *why* you’re not completing your degree, but you'll need to demonstrate that you have no intention of abandoning your studies. Providing evidence of your progress so far (e.g., grades, dissertation outline) could be helpful.

Processing times for Entry Clearance applications can vary significantly, but it typically takes around 6-8 weeks, though it can sometimes take longer depending on the complexity of the case and current demand. Processing times from China can be slightly longer due to the distance and potential for additional administrative steps.

Would you like me to delve into any specific aspect of this process, such as the required documents or the cost of the application?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave incorrect information. They stated I would need to "demonstrate that you have no intention of abandoning your studies" when applying from outside the UK, which contradicts the scenario where I would be dropping out of my course to take the job. The agent correctly identified I'm ineligible to switch from within the UK since I haven't completed my course, but provided misleading information about the overseas application process.
