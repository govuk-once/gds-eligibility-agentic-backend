[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Priya, who is seeking information about her eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa extension with a new employer, based on the transitional arrangements.

Hi, i'm Priya and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Priya, thank you for reaching out. I’m happy to help you explore your options.

To start, could you confirm whether you currently have a sponsor in place for your Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a sponsor. I've been working in the UK as a Marketing Manager on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022, but I've received a job offer from a new marketing agency. They're offering me £32,000 per year, and I want to understand if I'm eligible to switch to this new employer while keeping my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Priya. 

To help me assess your situation, could you tell me approximately when you initially obtained your Skilled Worker visa in 2022? Was it before or after April 4, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh yes, I obtained my Skilled Worker visa in 2022, so definitely before April 4, 2024. I've been working and living in the UK continuously since then.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news, Priya. Knowing you held your Skilled Worker visa before April 4, 2024, and have been continuously residing in the UK since then, is a key piece of information.

Could you please confirm the specific salary you’ve been offered by this new marketing agency?

[evaluation_judge]: The new marketing agency has offered me £32,000 per year for the Marketing Manager position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Priya. Now, let’s look at the relevant salary thresholds. The standard going rate for a Marketing Manager is currently £41,700. 

Considering your situation, does your new salary of £32,000 meet the General Salary Threshold, which is capped at £29,000 for those with existing visas under transitional arrangements?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the £32,000 they're offering me is above the £29,000 threshold. I was aware the general threshold had increased recently, so I was concerned about whether I'd qualify with my new employer offering £32,000, especially since I know the standard going rate for Marketing Managers is much higher now.

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya, that’s very helpful to know. 

Just to confirm, does your new employer’s offer, at £32,000, also exceed the Transitional Going Rate, which is currently set at £30,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my new salary offer of £32,000 does exceed the £30,000 transitional going rate.

[root_agent]: Great. Thank you for confirming that, Priya.

Based on the information you’ve provided – holding a Skilled Worker visa before April 4, 2024, with a salary of £32,000 and exceeding both the General and Transitional Going Rates – it appears you *do* qualify for the Transitional Arrangements under the Skilled Worker visa route. 

Would you like me to elaborate on what those arrangements entail, or would you like me to move on to another aspect of your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: That's a relief to hear! Could you just briefly confirm what these transitional arrangements mean for me? I've been quite worried about these new salary requirements I've been hearing about, so I want to make sure I fully understand why I qualify despite the new higher thresholds.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Priya. The Transitional Arrangements, often referred to as the “Grandfather” clause, are in place to protect those who initially qualified for a Skilled Worker visa before certain salary thresholds were increased. 

Because you held your visa before April 4, 2024, you are eligible to apply for an extension or switch to a new employer with a lower General Salary Threshold (£29,000) and a lower Going Rate (£30,000) than a new applicant would be entitled to. This means your salary of £32,000 is still acceptable under these arrangements. 

Does that explanation help clarify things for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense now. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. So basically, because I've been on the Skilled Worker visa since before the recent changes, I'm allowed to continue under more favorable salary requirements rather than the new higher ones that would apply to someone just entering the UK now. My £32,000 salary is above both the transitional general threshold of £29,000 and the transitional going rate of £30,000, so I qualify. That's such a relief!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Priya! I’m so glad I could clarify things and that it’s a relief for you. It sounds like you’re in a good position to proceed with your visa extension. 

Is there anything else I can assist you with today regarding your Skilled Worker visa application, or perhaps some information about the next steps you should take?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that covers everything I needed to know about my eligibility. This has been really helpful and reassuring. I'll get started on my application right away. Thank you so much for your time and clear explanation!

✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for the Skilled Worker visa under transitional arrangements, accurately explaining that my £32,000 salary exceeds both the transitional general threshold (£29,000) and transitional going rate (£30,000), matching the expected outcome.
