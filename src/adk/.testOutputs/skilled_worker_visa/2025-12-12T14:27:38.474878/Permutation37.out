[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Maria, a nurse on a Skilled Worker visa who has questions about supplementary work.

Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Maria, it’s nice to meet you. I’m here to help clarify things about your Skilled Worker visa. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current job as a Nurse? Specifically, what is your main occupation code?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, thanks for helping me. I work as a registered nurse at a hospital here in London on a Skilled Worker visa. I believe my occupation code is 2231 for nurses. I've been here for about a year now. I'm particularly concerned about some extra work I've been doing.

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria, thank you for that information. So, you’re a registered nurse with occupation code 2231. That’s helpful.

I understand you’re concerned about some extra work you've been doing. To clarify, could you tell me what kind of extra work you've been taking on?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been picking up some extra shifts at another hospital through a nursing agency. They needed help with staffing shortages, so I've been working there in addition to my main job. It's still nursing work - same role, same responsibilities, just at a different location. Last week was particularly busy and I ended up working about 25 hours at this second hospital. I'm wondering if this is allowed under my Skilled Worker visa or if I might have violated some conditions.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that, Maria. It sounds like you’re performing nursing duties at another hospital. 

Let’s focus on the hours you’ve been working. You mentioned working approximately 25 hours last week. Could you confirm how many hours you’re typically working at the agency hospital *per week*, on average?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, it varies depending on staffing needs. Most weeks I've been working between 15-20 hours at the agency hospital, but last week was exceptional because they were really short-staffed and asked if I could help more. That's when I did those 25 hours. My regular job is still full-time at my main hospital, and these agency shifts are on top of that. I'm just concerned about whether working those extra 25 hours last week might have been a problem for my visa status.

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria. Thank you for clarifying the variability in your hours.

Let’s talk about the rules surrounding supplementary work for Skilled Worker visa holders. It’s important to understand that you can take on a second job, but it needs to meet specific criteria.

Could you tell me, is the work you’re doing at the agency hospital in the same occupation code as your main job (which is 2231 for nurses)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's exactly the same work. I'm working as a registered nurse at both places - at my main hospital where I'm sponsored and at the agency hospital where I pick up extra shifts. The duties, responsibilities, and qualifications needed are identical. It's the same occupation code 2231 at both places.

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria, that’s very clear. You’re performing the exact same nursing duties and qualifications at both hospitals, and it’s the same occupation code (2231).

Now, regarding the hours you’ve been working, the rules state that you can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week in supplementary work *outside* of your contracted hours.

Considering you worked 25 hours last week, would you agree that this exceeds the permitted limit?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I see. So the 25 hours I worked last week at the agency hospital is above the 20-hour limit. I didn't realize there was such a strict cap on supplementary work hours. This is concerning - does this mean I've violated my visa conditions? What might the consequences be? I certainly don't want to jeopardize my immigration status.

[root_agent]: You’re right to be concerned, Maria. Based on the information you’ve provided, it does appear that working 25 hours last week exceeds the permitted 20-hour limit for supplementary work under your Skilled Worker visa.

While I can’t definitively say whether a violation has occurred – that would require a full assessment – exceeding this limit *can* lead to a visa violation and potentially jeopardize your immigration status. Potential consequences could include future refusals for visa extensions, or even the possibility of your visa being curtailed if the Home Office becomes aware of the breach.

Would you like me to explain a bit more about the process if the Home Office were to investigate this potential violation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain what might happen if the Home Office investigates this. I'm quite worried now because I honestly didn't know about the 20-hour limit. I just assumed that as long as I was doing the same type of work, it would be fine. Should I report this myself or just make sure I stay within the limit going forward? Also, is this something that could come up if I apply to extend my visa later?

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria, let’s talk about what might happen if the Home Office investigates and what you can do moving forward.

If the Home Office were to investigate a potential breach of your visa conditions, they would likely:

1.  **Review your visa documentation:** They’ll examine your Skilled Worker visa application and any supporting documents to verify the information you’ve provided.
2.  **Contact both hospitals:** They may contact your main employer and the agency hospital to confirm your working hours and job duties.
3.  **Request further evidence:** They could ask for timesheets, payslips, or any other documentation to substantiate your claims.

The outcome of an investigation could range from a warning to a refusal of a visa extension or, in more serious cases, a curtailment of your visa.

Regarding reporting it yourself – it’s a good idea to be proactive. You can notify the Home Office of the over-hours working, explaining that you were unaware of the 20-hour limit and are committed to adhering to the conditions of your visa from now on. A prompt and honest disclosure *could* mitigate the consequences, but it’s not a guarantee.

As for your visa extension application, yes, this instance of exceeding the hours limit *could* be raised during the assessment.  A clear explanation of the situation, and evidence of your commitment to compliance going forward, will be important.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps discuss strategies for ensuring you stay within the 20-hour limit in the future?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent correctly identified that working 25 hours in supplementary employment exceeds the 20-hour limit, but they failed to definitively state this was a visa violation as per the expected outcome. They hedged with "it appears" and "can lead to a visa violation" rather than clearly confirming it was a breach of visa conditions.
