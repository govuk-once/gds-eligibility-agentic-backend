[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Sarah and engage with the agent to test their knowledge on skilled worker visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Sarah, it’s lovely to meet you. I’d be happy to help you explore that. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the kind of work you do?

[evaluation_judge]: I work as an IT consultant. I specialize in cybersecurity systems and database management. I've been in the industry for about 7 years now and I'm currently looking at a job opportunity with a UK IT firm.

[root_agent]: That’s very helpful to know. And how is this particular job opportunity structured? Are you being offered a standard employment contract, or are you being asked to invoice the company as a contractor?

[evaluation_judge]: They want to hire me as a skilled worker, and they're offering to sponsor me with a Certificate of Sponsorship. But instead of putting me on their payroll, they've suggested I invoice them as a contractor to save on National Insurance contributions. They're calling it a "Consultancy Agreement" rather than an employment contract. They said this arrangement is quite common.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Just to be clear, are you receiving a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) from the company for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they've said they'll issue me a Certificate of Sponsorship. They mentioned that they're a licensed sponsor and can support my visa application while I work for them as a contractor under this Consultancy Agreement.

[root_agent]: I appreciate you confirming that. Now, thinking about this arrangement, does the company intend to issue you a Payslip (CoS) as part of this “Consultancy Agreement”?

[evaluation_judge]: They actually said I wouldn't get a payslip since I'd be invoicing them as a contractor. They mentioned it would be a more flexible arrangement where I invoice them monthly for my services. That's why they called it a "Consultancy Agreement" rather than an employment contract. They'd provide the CoS for my visa, but I wouldn't be on their PAYE system.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that detail, Sarah. Just to be absolutely sure, are you invoicing the company directly for your services, without a formal employment contract outlining your role and responsibilities?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. There would be no formal employment contract. I'd have the Consultancy Agreement which outlines my services and rates, and I would invoice them directly as a contractor. The company explained this would be beneficial for both of us tax-wise, and they'd still provide the Certificate of Sponsorship needed for my visa.

[root_agent]: Okay Sarah, thank you for providing all of this information. Based on what you’ve told me, it appears this arrangement may present a challenge for the Skilled Worker Visa. The criteria requires that a Skilled Worker must be an employee (PAYE). Because you’re invoicing as a contractor with no formal employment contract and no Payslip, it doesn't align with this requirement. 

Therefore, I have to advise that this arrangement is unlikely to be suitable for a Skilled Worker Visa.

Would you like me to explain why this is the case in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you explain why? I'm a bit confused because the company seemed very confident about this arrangement. They've sponsored people before, so I assumed they knew what they were talking about when they offered the CoS with a contractor arrangement.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker Visa specifically requires that sponsored individuals be employees, meaning they are part of the employer’s payroll and subject to Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax and National Insurance. The Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) confirms that the employer is licensed to sponsor you, but it only validates that they’re meeting the requirements for *employment*, not that you are *employed* in the traditional sense.

Because you’re invoicing as a contractor – a self-employed individual – you aren’t classified as an employee and therefore don’t meet the visa criteria. The “Consultancy Agreement” and the CoS don’t change the fundamental fact that you’re operating as a self-employed contractor.

Essentially, the employer is trying to use the CoS to facilitate a sponsorship, but without the correct employment structure, it won’t be accepted. 

Do you have any further questions about this, or would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of why this arrangement isn’t compliant?

[evaluation_judge]: That's surprising. So if they want to sponsor me properly, they would need to hire me as an actual employee on their payroll with PAYE tax deductions, not as a contractor with a consultancy agreement? Why would they suggest this arrangement if it doesn't work with the visa system?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit upon a very important point, Sarah. It’s understandable why you’re surprised. Often, companies suggest contractor arrangements to avoid National Insurance contributions for themselves. However, this method isn't a viable way to secure a Skilled Worker Visa.

They might have been operating under the assumption that the CoS could be used regardless of the employment structure, but as we’ve established, the visa rules are very specific about the need for an employment relationship.

It’s possible they weren't fully aware of the complexities of the Skilled Worker Visa criteria or perhaps they were hoping to work within a grey area. However, the regulations are quite clear.

Would you like me to explain the potential consequences of pursuing this arrangement, given the visa requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain what the consequences might be if I went ahead with this arrangement. Would my visa application be refused? Could there be other issues I should know about?

[root_agent]: Yes, absolutely. If you proceed with this arrangement and attempt to apply for the Skilled Worker Visa, your application would almost certainly be refused. The Home Office scrutinizes these applications very carefully, and the lack of a genuine employment contract and PAYE status would be a significant red flag.

Beyond a refusal, there could be further complications:

*   **Visa Revocation:** If you were granted a visa based on incorrect information, the Home Office could later revoke it.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Repeated attempts to circumvent immigration rules can damage your reputation as a genuine applicant.

It’s also worth noting that the company providing the CoS could face scrutiny and potential penalties for incorrectly sponsoring a worker who doesn’t meet the required employment criteria.

It's a complex situation, and proceeding could lead to significant delays and potential difficulties in the future.

I understand this might be disappointing, but it's crucial to be aware of these potential consequences.

Do you want me to help you explore alternative options for securing a Skilled Worker Visa, such as confirming a standard employment contract?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really helpful information, thank you. It sounds like I need to go back to the company and explain that I can only accept a proper employment contract with PAYE if they want to sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa. Could you just summarize for me one more time what I should tell them about why their contractor arrangement won't work for visa purposes?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s quickly recap what you need to communicate to the company, Sarah:

“The Skilled Worker Visa requires that I be an *employee* under PAYE, meaning I’m part of their payroll. The 'Consultancy Agreement' and invoicing as a contractor doesn’t fulfil this requirement. The Certificate of Sponsorship confirms they’re a licensed sponsor, but it’s linked to an *employment* relationship, not a self-employment one. Because I’m not receiving a payslip and not subject to PAYE, this arrangement is not compliant with the visa rules and would result in a refusal.”

Do you feel this summary accurately reflects the situation, and is there anything else you’d like me to clarify before you speak to them?

[evaluation_judge]: That's a perfect summary, thank you so much for your help! I'll definitely speak to them about changing the arrangement to a proper employment contract with PAYE if they want to sponsor me. I appreciate your guidance on this matter.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Sarah! I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. It’s good to hear you’re taking a proactive approach. Best of luck with your conversation, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that the Skilled Worker visa requires an actual employment relationship with PAYE, not a contractor arrangement with a consultancy agreement. They accurately explained that this arrangement would lead to visa refusal, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
