[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of a UK resident seeking benefit eligibility information.

Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj, it’s good to meet you. I’m happy to help you explore your options. To start, could you tell me a bit about your current employment situation? Specifically, what is your current job title and occupation code?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently working as an IT Project Manager at a tech company. I've been with the company for about 2 years now, but I was recently promoted from Web Developer to IT Project Manager about a month ago. My previous occupation code was 2137, and my current one is 2135. My salary increased to £50,000 with the promotion. I'm on a Skilled Worker visa, and I'm wondering if everything is okay with my visa after this job change.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detailed information, Raj. It’s good to have that clarity.

Just to be absolutely sure I understand, you’re currently a Skilled Worker visa holder, previously working as a Web Developer (occupation code 2137), and you’ve recently been promoted to IT Project Manager (occupation code 2135) at the same company. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I was working as a Web Developer with occupation code 2137 on my Skilled Worker visa. About a month ago, I got promoted to IT Project Manager with occupation code 2135, still at the same company. My HR department updated something in their system called SMS, but they said I didn't need to apply for a new visa since it's the same company. I just want to make sure everything is in order with my visa status.

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj. Thank you for clarifying. It sounds like your HR department has taken care of the necessary updates within the SMS system.

Let’s delve a little deeper into this. Since you’re now working under a different occupation code (2135) – which is a change from your previous code (2137) – does the company you work for require you to apply for a new visa, or a Change of Employment visa, as part of this promotion?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's what confused me. HR just said they updated the SMS system but told me I didn't need to apply for a new visa since I'm still with the same company. They didn't mention anything about a Change of Employment visa. I started the new role right away after the promotion. Should I have applied for something? I'm worried now that there might be an issue with my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Raj. That’s really helpful to know.

Based on what you’ve told me – that you’ve changed jobs within the same company, but your new role has a different occupation code – it appears there may be an issue. According to the Skilled Worker Visa guidelines, a change of occupation requires a fresh application, often referred to as a “Change of Employment” visa. 

To confirm, could you tell me, when you started your role as IT Project Manager, did your sponsor (the company employing you) formally apply for a “Change of Employment” visa on your behalf within the SMS system?

[evaluation_judge]: No, they definitely didn't apply for a "Change of Employment" visa for me. They just updated my details in the SMS system and told me everything was fine because I was staying with the same company. I started working in my new role immediately after the promotion. Should they have filed for a Change of Employment? Am I working illegally now?

[root_agent]: You are raising a very important point, Raj. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

It sounds like there might be a compliance breach. As I mentioned earlier, if a currently sponsored Skilled Worker changes jobs within the *same* company but the new job falls under a different Occupation Code, they *must* apply for a “Change of Employment” visa before starting the new role. Simply updating the SMS system is not sufficient.

The potential consequence of not doing so is that the sponsor could lose their license, and your visa could be curtailed. 

To help me fully understand the situation, could you tell me, do you know who your sponsor is – the company employing you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my sponsor is the tech company I work for - TechSolutions Ltd. They're the ones who originally sponsored my Skilled Worker visa when I joined as a Web Developer two years ago. They've been my sponsor the whole time, and they handle all the visa paperwork. I'm really concerned now - I had no idea I needed to apply for a new visa before starting my new role. HR made it sound like everything was fine as long as they updated the system.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Raj, for confirming that TechSolutions Ltd. is your sponsor. That’s crucial information.

Given that TechSolutions Ltd. is your sponsor and you’ve transitioned to a different occupation code within the same company without applying for a “Change of Employment” visa, it’s highly likely that this represents a compliance breach. 

I want to be upfront with you: continuing to work in this role without the correct visa documentation carries significant risks. The potential consequences, as we’ve discussed, could include the loss of TechSolutions Ltd.’s sponsorship license and the curtailment of your visa.

To help me assess the situation more thoroughly, could you tell me, what steps has TechSolutions Ltd. taken since the promotion to address this potential issue? Have they contacted UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) or a legal professional regarding this Change of Employment requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: They haven't taken any steps as far as I know. When I got the promotion, HR just said they updated my details in the SMS system and told me that was all that was needed since I was staying with the same company. They never mentioned anything about needing to apply for a new visa or contacting UKVI. 

I don't think they've consulted any legal professionals about this either. It seemed like they genuinely believed updating the SMS was sufficient. This is really concerning - I had no idea I might be working illegally. What should I do now? Can this be fixed retroactively?

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj, thank you for being so candid about this. It’s understandable that you’re feeling concerned and unsure of what to do.

Given that TechSolutions Ltd. has not taken any proactive steps to address the potential compliance breach – and that they seemingly operated under the assumption that updating the SMS was sufficient – it does raise significant red flags.

Unfortunately, it's unlikely that this can be resolved retroactively. The rules around Skilled Worker visas are very strict regarding occupation changes. Applying for a “Change of Employment” visa *after* starting the new role is often difficult and not always successful.

However, the most important thing now is to act swiftly to mitigate the risks. Here's what I recommend:

1.  **Speak to HR Immediately:** You need to formally request a detailed explanation from HR regarding why they didn't advise you about the “Change of Employment” visa requirement. Document this conversation thoroughly.
2.  **Contact TechSolutions Ltd.’s Legal Department:** They should have a legal team that can advise on the best course of action and liaise with UKVI if necessary.
3.  **Consider Seeking Independent Legal Advice:** It would be prudent to consult with an immigration lawyer to fully understand your rights and potential options.

I understand this is a stressful situation, Raj. Would you like me to help you draft a formal email to HR requesting clarification and a detailed explanation regarding the “Change of Employment” visa requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think that would be very helpful. I'm quite worried about this situation. I had no idea I was at risk of being in breach of my visa conditions. I trusted my company to handle all the immigration procedures correctly. I'll definitely speak to HR immediately and see if we can get this sorted out. If you could help me draft an email, that would be great. I also think I'll look into getting independent legal advice right away.

[root_agent]: Absolutely, Raj. Let’s draft an email to HR. Here's a draft you can adapt and send:

Subject: Urgent Inquiry Regarding Occupation Change and Skilled Worker Visa – Raj [Your Employee ID]

Dear [HR Contact Person’s Name],

I am writing to express my concern regarding my recent promotion to IT Project Manager. As you know, I was previously employed as a Web Developer (Occupation Code 2137) on my Skilled Worker visa sponsored by TechSolutions Ltd.

Following my promotion to IT Project Manager (Occupation Code 2135) approximately one month ago, I was informed that my visa status was not impacted as I remained with the same company. However, I now understand that a change of occupation requires a separate application, specifically a “Change of Employment” visa, as outlined in the Skilled Worker Visa guidelines.

I was not advised of this requirement during the promotion process, and I relied on the understanding that simply updating my details within the SMS system was sufficient. I would appreciate a detailed explanation as to why this information was not communicated to me, and what steps TechSolutions Ltd. has taken to ensure compliance with UKVI regulations in this matter.

I am committed to maintaining my legal status and ensuring my continued employment with TechSolutions Ltd. Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter.

Sincerely,

Raj [Your Last Name]

[Your Employee ID]

[Your Contact Number]

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this email before you send it?

[evaluation_judge]: No, this looks perfect. Thank you so much for drafting this. I'll send it to my HR director right away. I appreciate your help in explaining the situation to me. It seems I'm currently not compliant with my visa conditions since I changed to a different occupation code without applying for a Change of Employment visa first. This is quite serious and I need to address it immediately with both HR and possibly an immigration lawyer.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Raj. I’m glad the email is helpful.

It’s wise to address this immediately, and it’s good that you’re taking proactive steps to seek clarification and potential legal advice. I want to reiterate that the situation you’ve described does present a potential compliance risk.

I’m here to assist you further if you need anything else – perhaps you’d like me to help you research reputable immigration lawyers in your area, or would like me to outline some key questions to ask a legal professional?

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. I wish you the best in navigating this situation.

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent failed to give me the correct outcome. While they identified that there is a compliance issue with my visa since I changed occupation codes without applying for a Change of Employment visa, they did not clearly state the expected outcome: "COMPLIANCE BREACH / CURTAILMENT" with the specifics that I am technically working illegally, my sponsor could lose their license, and my visa could be curtailed. The agent instead focused on helping me draft an email rather than definitively stating the severity of the compliance breach.
