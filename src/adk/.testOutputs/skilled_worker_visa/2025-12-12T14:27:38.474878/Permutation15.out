[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Lina seeking benefit information from the agent under test.

Hi, i'm Lina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Lina, it’s nice to meet you. I’m here to help you with that. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’re considering? Specifically, what is the job title?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Construction Labourer in the UK. I'm trying to find out if I would be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. And to confirm, you’ve been offered a job as a Construction Labourer. Could you tell me what level qualification or training this job requires?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the job doesn't require many qualifications. I have experience in construction work from my home country, but it's mostly manual labor. I believe it's considered a lower skill level job, maybe Level 1 or 2.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Just to be completely sure, could you tell me which qualification framework your previous construction experience falls under? For example, is it a specific apprenticeship or vocational training program?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have any formal qualifications or training program completion for construction work. I learned on the job over the past few years. The employer didn't mention any required certificates or qualifications when offering me the position - they just wanted someone with practical experience.

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. So, based on that, let’s look at the requirements for the Skilled Worker visa. Could you tell me, roughly, what level you believe this Construction Labourer role is classified under, according to the UK’s skills framework – would you say it’s Level 3 or above?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not very familiar with the UK's skills framework, but from what the employer told me, I believe this Construction Labourer role would be classified below Level 3 - probably Level 1 or 2. It's considered an entry-level position that doesn't require advanced qualifications.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Lina. That’s very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, it seems this role is likely considered a lower-skilled occupation. According to the Skilled Worker visa criteria, the job must be at RQF Level 3 or above. Since this position appears to be at Level 1 or 2, I’m afraid you wouldn’t currently be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa.

Do you understand why that is?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think I understand. So because the Construction Labourer job is considered a lower skill level - below Level 3 - I can't apply for a Skilled Worker visa, even though the salary is actually quite good at £45,000. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Lina. The salary is a positive factor, but the core requirement for a Skilled Worker visa is that the job must meet a certain skill level threshold, which isn’t met with a role below RQF Level 3.

I’m sorry I couldn’t offer you better news today. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding other potential benefits, or perhaps information about different visa options?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was ineligible for a Skilled Worker visa because the Construction Labourer job is below RQF Level 3, regardless of the high salary offer.
