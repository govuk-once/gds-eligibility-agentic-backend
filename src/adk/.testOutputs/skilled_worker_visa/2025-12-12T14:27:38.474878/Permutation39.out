[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Layla and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Layla. It’s good to meet you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you tell me when your visa was officially granted?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi, my visa was actually granted on January 1st. I'm already a Skilled Worker visa holder, but I'm concerned because I was supposed to start work on January 1st according to my Certificate of Sponsorship. However, I had some personal affairs to settle back home and only arrived in the UK on February 15th to start my job. My employer hasn't mentioned any issues with this delay. I'm an Architect by profession. I'm just wondering if this late arrival could affect my visa status?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Layla. It’s helpful to have that detail. Let’s focus on the start date then. Could you tell me what date was listed on your Certificate of Sponsorship as the official start date for your employment?

[evaluation_judge]: My Certificate of Sponsorship had January 1st listed as my official start date. That's the same date my visa was granted.

[root_agent]: Okay, Layla. Thank you for confirming that. Just to be clear, your Certificate of Sponsorship and your visa grant date are both January 1st. And you arrived in the UK on February 15th. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My Certificate of Sponsorship and visa grant date were both January 1st, but I didn't arrive in the UK until February 15th. I started work immediately after arriving.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming all of that, Layla. Let me ask you this: Does your employer have a reason for the delay in your start date that they’ve communicated to you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my employer hasn't communicated any concerns about the delay. When I arrived on February 15th, they just had me start work right away. I mentioned that I had personal affairs to settle before coming to the UK, but as far as I know, they haven't reported this delay to anyone. They seemed to assume everything was fine.

[root_agent]: Okay, Layla. Thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me – your visa granted on January 1st, your Certificate of Sponsorship also stating January 1st, and your arrival on February 15th – it appears there’s a potential issue. The rules state a Skilled Worker must usually start their job within 28 days of either the CoS start date or the visa grant date, whichever is later. Since your arrival was 45 days after the grant date, and your employer hasn’t reported a valid reason for the delay, it looks like there could be a compliance breach.

Would you agree that you were delayed in starting work beyond the 28-day window?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I was definitely delayed in starting work beyond the 28-day window. My delay was about 45 days from when both my visa was granted and my CoS start date. I didn't realize there was a 28-day rule. Is this going to be a problem?

[root_agent]: You’re right to ask about that, Layla. The 28-day rule is quite important. Given that you were delayed for 45 days and your employer hasn’t reported the delay, this does present a compliance risk. Typically, if a Skilled Worker doesn’t start work within the stipulated timeframe, the sponsorship needs to be cancelled unless there's a valid reason provided to UK Visas and Immigration.

To help me assess the situation fully, could you tell me, does your employer have any documentation – such as an official letter – that confirms the start date of January 1st and outlines the role and responsibilities you were expected to fulfill?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any documentation from my employer about the delay. All I have is my original employment contract which shows the January 1st start date, matching my CoS. When I arrived on February 15th, they just had me sign in and start working as if everything was normal. Should my employer have reported the delay to UK Visas and Immigration?

[root_agent]: That’s very helpful to know, Layla. It seems your employer simply proceeded with your employment as if the delay hadn’t occurred. You are correct; in this situation, your employer should have proactively notified UK Visas and Immigration about the extended start date.

Based on the information you’ve provided – your visa granted on January 1st, your Certificate of Sponsorship on January 1st, your arrival on February 15th, and the lack of reporting from your employer – this situation does appear to be a compliance breach.

Given this, I must advise you that there’s a significant risk of curtailment or cancellation of your visa. Is there anything you’d like me to clarify about this potential issue, or would you like me to outline the next steps you might consider?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please tell me what this means for me right now. Could I be stopped at the border next time I travel? Could they cancel my visa? What should I do about this situation?

[root_agent]: Okay, Layla, let’s address your concerns directly.

**Regarding Border Control:** Yes, it's possible you could be stopped at the border when you travel again. Immigration officers have the authority to scrutinize your visa status and can question you about your employment history and start date. If they discover the delay and lack of reporting, they could potentially investigate further.

**Regarding Visa Cancellation:** Yes, your visa could be curtailed – meaning it’s cancelled while you’re still in the UK – or even revoked entirely. This would likely lead to you being required to leave the country.

**What you should do:**

1.  **Contact Your Sponsor Immediately:** You need to speak with your employer’s legal department or HR department right away and formally explain the situation. They need to take immediate action to rectify the breach.

2.  **Request a Sponsor Licence Update:** Your employer needs to submit an updated sponsor licence application to UK Visas and Immigration. This application MUST include a detailed explanation for the delay, a justification for why it wasn't reported, and evidence of your current employment.

3.  **Seek Legal Advice:** Given the potential seriousness of this situation, I strongly recommend you consult with an immigration lawyer. They can advise you on the best course of action and help your employer navigate this compliance issue.

Do you want me to elaborate on any of these steps, or perhaps focus on getting in touch with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the clear explanation. I'll contact my employer immediately to discuss this. I had no idea we were in breach of the rules. I'll also look into getting immigration legal advice as you suggested. 

Is there any documentation I should prepare before speaking with my employer to help explain the situation?

[root_agent]: That’s a wise decision, Layla. Absolutely, preparing some documentation beforehand will be beneficial. Here's a list of things you should gather and potentially provide to your employer:

*   **Copy of your Visa Grant Letter:** This confirms the date your visa was granted.
*   **Copy of your Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):** This details the start date and the nature of your employment.
*   **Copy of your Employment Contract:** This will highlight the agreed-upon start date of January 1st.
*   **Proof of Arrival in the UK:** A flight itinerary or boarding pass showing your arrival on February 15th.
*   **Any correspondence with your employer:** Any emails or messages discussing the delay or your arrival.

Having these documents readily available will demonstrate that you’re being proactive and transparent. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before you reach out to your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for explaining the situation so clearly. I'll gather those documents and speak with my employer as soon as possible. I really appreciate your help with this matter.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Layla. I’m glad I could help clarify the situation and provide you with some actionable steps. It’s certainly a stressful situation, but taking a proactive approach is key. Please don’t hesitate to reach out again if you have any further questions or concerns. Best of luck with your discussions with your employer – I hope everything resolves smoothly.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my situation represents a compliance breach because I started work more than 28 days after my visa grant date and CoS start date (45 days later), and my employer didn't report this delay. The agent properly explained that this puts me at risk of visa curtailment or cancellation and provided appropriate next steps.
