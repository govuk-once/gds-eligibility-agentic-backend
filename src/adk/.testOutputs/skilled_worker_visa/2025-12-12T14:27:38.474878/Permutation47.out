[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Aris and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Dr. Aris, it’s good to meet you. To help me understand your situation and determine your eligibility, could you tell me, what is your current employment situation? Specifically, what are you currently doing for work?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently working as a university lecturer on a skilled worker visa. I work about 20 hours per week at the university. I've recently been offered a researcher position at a private think-tank for an additional 20 hours per week. I'm trying to understand if I can take this second job and what the process would be.

[root_agent]: Okay, Dr. Aris, thank you for clarifying. It sounds like you’re looking into the possibility of holding two sponsored visas simultaneously.

To start, could you tell me, do you currently have a Certificate of Sponsorship from your employer at the university?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a Certificate of Sponsorship from the university for my lecturer position. My current visa is a Skilled Worker visa that was granted based on that sponsorship.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news. So, you already have a Skilled Worker visa in place due to a Certificate of Sponsorship from your university role. 

To help me assess your situation fully, could you tell me, does the think-tank you’ve been offered the researcher position also have a Certificate of Sponsorship for you?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the think-tank is willing to sponsor me. They mentioned they can provide a Certificate of Sponsorship for the researcher position if needed. They're registered as a sponsor with the Home Office. I just wasn't sure if I needed to get a whole new visa or if there was some other process since I already have one Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. It sounds like the think-tank is prepared to sponsor you for the researcher role.

Let me ask this: are both the university lecturer position and the researcher role at the think-tank, if you were to take them, requiring you to work a total of 40 hours per week?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I currently work 20 hours per week at the university as a lecturer, and the researcher position at the think-tank would be for an additional 20 hours per week. So in total, it would be 40 hours across both positions.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Dr. Aris. This is key information.

Considering you already have a Skilled Worker visa and the think-tank is willing to sponsor you for an additional 20 hours, my understanding is that you may be eligible for a ‘Concurrent Employment’ visa.

To confirm my understanding, are both of these jobs sponsored by separate employers – the university and the think-tank?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The university is my current sponsor for my lecturer position, and the think-tank would be a separate, second sponsor for the researcher position. They're completely different organizations.

[root_agent]: Excellent. That confirms it perfectly.

Based on the criteria, you *are* eligible for a Concurrent Employment visa.

To be absolutely clear, you’ll need two Certificates of Sponsorship—one from the university and one from the think-tank—and then you’ll apply for a separate visa specifically marked as “Concurrent Employment.” 

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of that process, such as what information is required on the application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful. I'd like to understand the application process better. What specific information will I need for the concurrent employment application? And will I need to submit anything special to make sure the second visa doesn't cancel my first one? I want to make sure I don't make any mistakes that could jeopardize my current position.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s address that. For the Concurrent Employment application, you’ll need to provide the following:

*   **Completed application form:** Available on the GOV.UK website.
*   **Copy of your current Skilled Worker visa:** This confirms your initial eligibility.
*   **Two Certificates of Sponsorship:** One from the university and one from the think-tank, detailing your roles, salary, and hours worked.
*   **Proof of address:** Utility bills or bank statements.
*   **Passport details:** Valid passport information.

Crucially, to ensure your current visa isn’t affected, you *must* clearly indicate on the application that you are seeking “Concurrent Employment.” Failing to do this could lead to your existing visa being cancelled.

Do you want me to provide a direct link to the application form so you can start gathering the necessary documents?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, a link to the application form would be very helpful. I also want to make sure I understand correctly - will I need to pay another visa fee and healthcare surcharge for this second concurrent visa? And is there anything specific I should be aware of regarding the salary requirements for the second job?

[root_agent]: You’re absolutely right to check on those points. Let’s address them now.

Here’s the link to the Skilled Worker Visa - Concurrent Employment application form: [https://www.gov.uk/apply-concurrent-employment](https://www.gov.uk/apply-concurrent-employment)

Regarding your questions:

*   **Visa Fees & Surcharge:** Yes, you will need to pay both a new visa application fee *and* a new healthcare surcharge for the Concurrent Employment visa. The exact amount will be listed on the application form.

*   **Salary Requirements:** The think-tank *must* demonstrate that your salary for the researcher role meets the minimum threshold requirements. Currently, this is £38,700 per year (as of November 2023). While the specific threshold may change, it's crucial that the think-tank accurately reflects your salary on the Certificate of Sponsorship. They may also need to show the salary meets the national minimum wage for the relevant job code.



Do you want me to clarify anything further about the fees, salary requirements, or any other aspect of the application process?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for clarifying those details. Just to be sure about the salary requirement - since my researcher position is only 20 hours per week (part-time), would the salary threshold be pro-rated? Or does it still need to meet the full £38,700 threshold even though it's not a full-time position? 

[root_agent]: That’s an excellent and very important question, Dr. Aris. You are correct to think about the salary being pro-rated.

The £38,700 salary threshold *is* calculated on an hourly basis, and it *is* pro-rated for part-time roles. The think-tank will need to demonstrate that your total annual earnings for the 20 hours per week position meet the equivalent of £38,700 per full-time year.

To calculate this, they’ll need to multiply your hourly rate by the number of hours you’re contracted to work annually (20 hours/week * 52 weeks/year = 1040 hours). Then, they’ll compare that figure to £38,700.

It’s worth confirming with the think-tank to ensure they understand this pro-rationing requirement and are prepared to provide the correct documentation.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this application, or would you like me to summarise the key requirements again?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense about the pro-rating, thank you. I think I have a good understanding now of what I need to do. To summarize what I've learned: I can hold two Skilled Worker visas simultaneously through the Concurrent Employment route. I'll need a second Certificate of Sponsorship from the think-tank, complete a new visa application clearly marked as "Concurrent Employment," pay the visa fees and healthcare surcharge again, and ensure the salary for the researcher role meets the pro-rated minimum threshold. 

Is there anything important I might have missed or should be particularly careful about in this process?

[root_agent]: That’s a fantastic summary, Dr. Aris – you’ve identified all the key elements clearly!

Looking back, there’s one additional point that’s worth bearing in mind: the think-tank *must* confirm that they are happy to continue sponsoring you for both positions throughout the duration of the Concurrent Employment visa. It’s a good idea to confirm this with them in writing.

Beyond that, you’ve covered everything. You're well-prepared for the application process. 

If any questions or concerns arise during your application, please don't hesitate to ask. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all the information I need for now. Thank you for your help! I'll get in touch with the think-tank and start preparing my application for the Concurrent Employment visa.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Dr. Aris! I’m glad I could assist you. Wishing you the very best with your application – I hope it’s awarded successfully. 

If you do have any further questions down the line, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly advised that I am eligible for Concurrent Employment, requiring two Certificates of Sponsorship and a second visa application specifically marked as "Concurrent Employment," which matches the expected outcome of AWARDED.
