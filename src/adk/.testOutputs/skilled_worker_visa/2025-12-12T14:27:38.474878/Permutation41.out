[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Ken to test the other agent's understanding of Immigration Skills Charge requirements in a sponsorship scenario.

Hi, i'm Ken and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Ken, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’re applying for? Specifically, what is your job title and what does your role involve?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm applying for a Marketing Lead position at a large multinational bank. I'll be overseeing their digital marketing campaigns across European markets. They've already offered me the position and are sorting out sponsorship details now.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s excellent information, Ken. Thank you. And to clarify, you said the bank is a “large multinational bank”? Could you tell me a little more about the size of the company – for example, roughly how many employees do they have?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's definitely a large multinational bank with offices across Europe, Asia, and North America. I believe they employ over 10,000 people globally, with about 2,000 in the UK offices. It's one of the major financial institutions.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detailed information, Ken. Just to confirm, the bank has offices in multiple countries – Europe, Asia, and North America – and employs over 10,000 people worldwide, with approximately 2,000 in the UK?

Now, regarding the sponsorship process, have you been informed about any specific fees associated with your sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct about the bank's size. Regarding fees, I haven't been given too many details about the sponsorship costs. The HR person I've been speaking with mentioned something about an Immigration Skills Charge, but I don't know the exact amount they're paying. I do know they've been processing the Certificate of Sponsorship recently. Is the fee amount something I should be concerned about?

[root_agent]: That’s very helpful to know, Ken. It sounds like you’re still awaiting full details about the sponsorship costs. Let’s focus on the Immigration Skills Charge for now.

Could you tell me how the bank classifies itself within their internal systems – are they considered a large business, a small business, or perhaps something else?

[evaluation_judge]: From everything I know, they definitely classify as a large business. Though, I did notice something odd when I was reviewing some of my sponsorship paperwork. There was a section that mentioned the Immigration Skills Charge being calculated at what seemed like a lower rate - I think it said something about £364 per year rather than a higher amount. When I asked about it, the HR person seemed a bit evasive and just said they were "handling all the details." I found that strange since it's clearly a large company.

[root_agent]: Okay, Ken, this is very important information. It sounds like there might be an error in how the bank is classifying themselves for the Immigration Skills Charge.

Just to be clear, you’re saying that the bank is classifying themselves as a “small” business for the purposes of this charge, despite them being a large multinational bank with over 10,000 employees?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's what appears to be happening. From the paperwork I've seen, they seem to be paying the Immigration Skills Charge at the small business rate (around £364 per year), even though they're clearly a large multinational with thousands of employees. I wasn't sure if this would affect my application in any way, which is why I wanted to check about my eligibility.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Ken. Based on what you’ve described – the bank classifying itself as a small business to pay a reduced Immigration Skills Charge – the sponsorship is unfortunately invalid.

**No.** The sponsor underpaid the mandatory government charge.

The Home Office usually contacts the sponsor to request a “top-up” payment. If the sponsor does not pay within 10 working days, the visa is refused.

Do you have any questions about this outcome, or would you like me to explain anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that the sponsorship would be invalid due to the bank incorrectly classifying itself as a small business to pay the reduced Immigration Skills Charge (£364/year instead of £1,000). They accurately explained that the underpayment of this mandatory charge would result in the visa being refused if not corrected within the Home Office's timeframe.
