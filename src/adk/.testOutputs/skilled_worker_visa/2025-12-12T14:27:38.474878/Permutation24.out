[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of Dr. Banu from Turkey who is seeking information about visa eligibility based on her qualifications.

Hi, i'm Banu and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Banu, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the type of degree you have?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a PhD in Chemistry from a university in Turkey. I've been working as a researcher for several years, and I recently received a job offer here in the UK. I'm trying to understand if I qualify for a work visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Just to be sure, could you tell me the name of the university where you earned your PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: I earned my PhD from Eastern Mediterranean Science Academy in Turkey. It's a small private institution focused on scientific research. I completed my doctoral thesis on organic chemical synthesis.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Banu. And just to confirm, you mentioned it’s a small, private, unaccredited university, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. It's a small private institution and I understand it doesn't have the same accreditation as the larger state universities in Turkey. But I completed all the requirements for the PhD program, defended my dissertation, and was awarded the doctoral degree.

[root_agent]: I appreciate you explaining that, Banu. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me whether your PhD was verified by Ecctis?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I did have my qualification assessed by Ecctis. I submitted all my documents to them, but I was disappointed with the result. They determined that my qualification is only comparable to RQF Level 7, which is a Master's level, not doctoral level. They didn't recognize it as equivalent to a UK PhD.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. So, to confirm, the Ecctis verification didn’t confirm your PhD as equivalent to a UK PhD, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. The Ecctis verification report stated that my qualification is only comparable to a Master's level (RQF Level 7), not a UK PhD. This was quite disappointing as I completed what I believed was a full doctoral program.

[root_agent]: I understand that must be very disappointing, Banu. Considering the Ecctis verification didn’t confirm your PhD as equivalent to a UK PhD, are you aware of any pathways you could take to potentially gain ‘Tradeable Points’ for a visa, such as through an alternative assessment or recognition?

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't aware there might be other pathways. I have a job offer as a Senior Chemist with a UK company offering me £35,000 per year. I was hoping that my PhD would qualify me for some kind of salary discount since it's in a STEM field. Are there other ways I could get those tradeable points without my PhD being recognized?

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Let’s focus on the tradeable points for a moment. To assess your eligibility, could you tell me, do you have any other qualifications, such as a Master's degree or professional certifications, that might be eligible for tradeable points?

[evaluation_judge]: I do have a Master's degree in Chemistry from Istanbul Technical University, which is a well-respected institution in Turkey. I completed that before my PhD. I'm not sure if I have any professional certifications that would count - I'm a member of the Turkish Chemical Society, but I don't think that's what you mean.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Banu. So you have a Master’s degree in Chemistry from Istanbul Technical University. Now, regarding the Skilled Worker Visa, do you currently meet the minimum English language requirements as defined by the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. I took the IELTS test last year and scored above the required threshold in all four components. I've been using English academically for many years as most of my research papers were published in English-language journals.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news, Banu. Knowing you meet the English language requirements is helpful. Considering your PhD wasn't recognized by Ecctis and you don’t currently have tradeable points through other qualifications, are you aware of the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I know there are some salary requirements, but I'm not exactly sure what they are. As I mentioned, I have a job offer with a salary of £35,000 as a Senior Chemist. I was hoping that would be enough, especially with my PhD, but now I'm concerned since my PhD isn't being recognized at the doctoral level. What are the minimum salary requirements?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s look at the salary requirements. As of today, the minimum salary for the Skilled Worker Visa is £38,700. Given your job offer of £35,000, it appears you would need to rely on the STEM subject discount, which adds an additional £4,000 to your salary. However, this doesn't fully meet the minimum requirement.

To help me understand your situation fully, could you confirm that you are genuinely relying on the STEM subject discount to bring your salary up to the required level?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I was definitely counting on that STEM PhD discount. I thought my PhD would qualify me for that even though the salary offer of £35,000 is below the threshold you mentioned. I was under the impression that with a PhD in Chemistry, I'd be eligible for a substantial discount on the salary requirement. Is that not the case if my PhD isn't recognized as equivalent to a UK PhD?

[root_agent]: You’ve raised a very important point, Banu. You are correct to question that. Because your PhD isn't recognized as equivalent to a UK PhD, you wouldn’t be eligible for the full STEM subject discount. The discount only applies if the degree is recognized as equivalent to a UK PhD or Master’s degree.

Given this, and the current minimum salary requirement of £38,700, it appears that, without meeting that threshold, you wouldn’t be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa at this time.

Based on our conversation, it seems unlikely you’d be eligible for this particular benefit. Would you like me to clarify anything further about the requirements or perhaps explore alternative visa options?

[evaluation_judge]: This is really disappointing news. So just to be absolutely clear - because Ecctis only recognized my PhD as equivalent to a Master's level qualification, and my salary offer of £35,000 is below the minimum threshold of £38,700, I'm not eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa? Are there any exceptions or appeals I could make regarding the Ecctis assessment?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to seek clarity, Banu. Let me confirm: Based on the Ecctis assessment recognizing your PhD as a Master’s level qualification and your current salary of £35,000, you do not currently meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Regarding appeals, the Home Office does have a process for appealing Ecctis assessments. However, it’s a complex process, and the chances of success can be quite low, especially when the assessment is based on the degree being below the required doctoral standard. They would typically require compelling evidence to demonstrate the equivalence of your qualification.

I want to be transparent and state that, based on the information available to me, it appears you are not eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa at this time.

Would you like me to outline the steps involved in making an appeal to the Home Office, or would you prefer to explore other potential visa options?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. I appreciate your honesty about my situation. Before we discuss other options, could you just confirm once more - the main issue is that without my PhD being recognized at the doctoral level by Ecctis, my £35,000 salary doesn't meet the minimum requirement of £38,700 for the Skilled Worker Visa. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: Yes, that is absolutely correct, Banu. The primary reason for your ineligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa, based on the information we’ve discussed, is that your PhD, not being recognized at a doctoral level by Ecctis, prevents you from accessing the full STEM subject salary discount, and therefore your salary remains below the required £38,700.

Do you want to explore alternative visa options, or would you like me to summarise the key points of our conversation again?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information. The agent wrongly advised that the STEM PhD salary discount might still partially apply with a Master's level qualification, when in fact the applicant needs a recognized PhD to claim any STEM PhD discount. Without the discount, the applicant would need the full £41,700+ salary (for STEM occupations), not the £38,700 mentioned by the agent.
