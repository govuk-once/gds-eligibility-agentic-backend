[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Amara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Amara, thank you for reaching out. To help me assess your situation, could you please confirm your current nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm Nigerian. I'm currently considering a job offer in the UK as an architect, working part-time.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. And just to confirm, you’re currently living in Nigeria?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently living in Nigeria and considering a job offer in the UK. I've been offered a position as an architect working 3 days a week (22.5 hours) for £30/hour, which would give me an annual salary of £35,100. I want to work part-time so I can also study privately.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Amara. Let’s talk a bit about the salary. Could you tell me which general threshold you’d like me to use for this assessment – £33,400 or £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the general threshold for my profession would be £41,700 (Option A).

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Just to be completely clear, you’re stating that you believe the general threshold for architects is £41,700. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The general threshold for architects is £41,700 (Option A).

[root_agent]: Alright. Now, let’s consider your proposed salary. Based on your offer of £30 per hour for 22.5 hours a week, your annual salary would be £35,100. Would you agree that this is the actual gross salary you’re anticipating?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. My actual gross salary would be £35,100 per year based on working 22.5 hours per week at £30 per hour.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Now, let’s consider the hourly rate. Do you agree that your hourly rate of £30 meets the “Going Rate” for an architect?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think £30 per hour is above the going rate for architects. That would be equivalent to £58,500 annually if I were working full-time.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So, your hourly rate is indeed above the typical “Going Rate.” To confirm, you’re stating that your hourly rate is £30, which is equivalent to £58,500 annually if you worked full-time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, exactly. My hourly rate of £30 would equal £58,500 if I worked full-time, which exceeds the going rate for architects. But since I'll be working part-time (22.5 hours per week), my actual annual salary will be £35,100.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Let’s revisit the key requirement. Considering your anticipated annual salary of £35,100, does that meet the general threshold of £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my annual salary of £35,100 doesn't meet the general threshold of £41,700. It's about £6,600 short of the threshold.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – your nationality, your proposed part-time work as an architect, and your anticipated annual salary of £35,100 – I’m afraid I must advise that you are not currently eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. The requirement is for an actual gross salary of at least £41,700.

Do you have any questions about this decision?

[evaluation_judge]: Are there any exceptions for part-time workers? Since my hourly rate is high (equivalent to £58,500 full-time), I was hoping that might make a difference even though my actual annual salary is lower.

[root_agent]: You raise a really important point, Amara. Let’s look at that. The guidance states that the “General Threshold” is usually a hard floor that cannot be pro-rated (unless in a specific Health/Transitional group). However, it does acknowledge that the “Going Rate” can be pro-rated.

Since your hourly rate is significantly above the standard going rate for architects, it *could* be considered. However, your projected annual salary of £35,100 still falls short of the £41,700 threshold.

Therefore, unfortunately, based on the criteria and your current circumstances, I must confirm that you are not eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa at this time.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this decision, or perhaps discuss alternative options?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. So even though my hourly rate is high, I still need to meet the absolute floor of £41,700 in actual annual salary. Would I need to either increase my hours or negotiate a higher hourly rate to reach that threshold?

[root_agent]: That’s a very insightful question, Amara. You are absolutely correct. To be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa, you would need to either increase your working hours to a level that would result in an annual salary of at least £41,700, or negotiate a higher hourly rate that would achieve the same outcome.

Is there anything else I can help you explore regarding potential strategies to meet the salary requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for clarifying that. No further questions for now. I'll need to speak with my potential employer about either increasing my hours or negotiating a higher hourly rate to meet the £41,700 threshold.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Amara. I’m glad I could clarify the requirements for you. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Good luck with your discussions with your employer!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately explained that despite my high hourly rate (equivalent to £58,500 full-time), I must meet the absolute General Threshold of £41,700 in actual gross salary, which my part-time salary of £35,100 fails to do.
