[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Katarina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Katarina, it’s lovely to meet you. Thanks for reaching out.

To start, could you tell me a little bit about the event venue where you’ve been offered this waitressing job?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a waitress at The Royal Gardens, it's a really fancy venue that hosts weddings and corporate events. They've offered me £20 per hour which sounds great, but it's on a zero-hours contract. They told me they expect me to work around 40 hours a week though.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. 

Let’s talk about the contract itself. Regarding the 40 hours a week they’re expecting, is that figure guaranteed, meaning you’ll definitely work that many hours each week?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's the thing - they said they "expect" me to work around 40 hours a week because they're usually busy, but since it's a zero-hours contract, they can't actually guarantee those hours. I'd be called in based on their booking schedule and how busy they are.

[root_agent]: I understand. Thank you for clarifying that. 

Just to be clear, because the hours are not guaranteed, would you agree that the overall salary you’d receive – which they’re predicting to be around £41,600 – isn’t guaranteed either?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, exactly. That's what concerns me. They've said they "expect" I'll earn around £41,600 based on working 40 hours a week at £20 per hour, but since the hours aren't guaranteed, that total salary isn't guaranteed either. I could end up working much less depending on how busy they are.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Given that the salary you could earn isn't guaranteed due to the zero-hours contract, does the employer provide any written confirmation of the minimum number of hours you’re likely to work each week?

[evaluation_judge]: No, they haven't provided any written confirmation of minimum hours. The letter they gave me just says they "expect" me to work around 40 hours weekly, but there's no minimum guaranteed. That's the nature of the zero-hours contract - they don't have to give me any hours if they don't need me.

[root_agent]: Okay, Katarina. Thank you for clarifying that. Based on what you’ve told me – the zero-hours contract and the lack of guaranteed hours or salary – it appears this job offer wouldn’t meet the criteria for a Skilled Worker Visa. The Home Office requires a guaranteed minimum salary, and a zero-hours contract cannot provide that assurance.

Therefore, I have to advise that you wouldn’t be eligible for sponsorship under the Skilled Worker Visa scheme with this particular job offer.

Do you have any other questions about this, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. So even though the hourly rate is good at £20 per hour, because it's a zero-hours contract with no guaranteed hours, I can't get sponsored for a Skilled Worker Visa with this job offer?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct. As we’ve discussed, the lack of a guaranteed minimum number of hours and, consequently, a guaranteed minimum salary, is a key factor preventing this job offer from meeting the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa. It’s a common situation where a high hourly rate can be misleading if the hours aren’t reliably available.

I understand this is disappointing news. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding this situation, perhaps exploring alternative job options that might offer a more secure arrangement?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be refused for a Skilled Worker Visa because my zero-hours contract, despite the high hourly rate of £20, cannot guarantee the minimum salary threshold since there are no guaranteed hours.
