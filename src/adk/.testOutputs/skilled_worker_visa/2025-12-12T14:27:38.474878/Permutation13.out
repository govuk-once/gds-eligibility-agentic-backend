[evaluation_judge]: I'll be playing the role of Tariq who is seeking information about his eligibility for a skilled worker visa with the new entrant discount.

Hi, i'm Tariq and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Tariq, thanks for reaching out! To start, could you tell me a little bit about your previous visa history? Specifically, what types of visas have you held, and for how long?

[evaluation_judge]: I completed my PhD in the UK on a Student visa for 3 years, and then I've been on a Graduate visa for the past 3 years and 6 months. I've just received a job offer as a Junior Data Analyst with a salary of £34,000, and I'm wondering if I'm eligible for the New Entrant discount on the Skilled Worker visa. The company wants to sponsor me for 2 years.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detailed information, Tariq. It’s very helpful to have that context.

Just to clarify, you’ve spent 3 years on a Student visa and 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I did my PhD for 3 years on a Student visa, and then I switched to a Graduate visa which I've now been on for 3 years and 6 months.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

Let me ask this: Considering that you’ve held a Graduate visa for 3 years and 6 months, does that time count towards the 4-year limit for the “New Entrant” discount?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure actually. That's why I'm asking about my eligibility. I know there's some kind of time limit for the New Entrant discount, but I don't know the specific rules about how my Graduate visa time counts towards this. That's what I'm hoping you can help me understand.

[root_agent]: I understand. Let’s delve a little deeper into that.

Could you tell me, have you ever held a Skilled Worker visa *before* as a ‘New Entrant’, and if so, for how long?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I've never held a Skilled Worker visa before. I've only had the Student visa for my PhD for 3 years, and then the Graduate visa which I've now been on for 3 years and 6 months.

[root_agent]: Okay, Tariq. Thank you for clarifying.

Given that you’ve spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa, and you’ve never held a Skilled Worker visa as a New Entrant before, it appears you’ve already used up the 4-year maximum time allowance for the New Entrant discount.

Therefore, based on the current rules, I’m afraid you wouldn’t be eligible for that discount. Would you like me to explain why in a bit more detail, or would you like to explore other potential visa options?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain a bit more about why I'm not eligible for the New Entrant discount. I thought I might be eligible since this would be my first Skilled Worker visa. Is it because time on the Graduate visa counts towards that 4-year limit?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit on the key point, Tariq. It’s the time spent on the Graduate visa that’s contributing to the 4-year limit. 

As I mentioned previously, time on a Graduate visa *does* count towards that limit. Combined with your 3 years on the Student visa, you’ve now spent a total of 6 years and 6 months with eligible time for the New Entrant discount. Because the discount is capped at 4 years, you’re exceeding that limit. 

Essentially, the rules are designed to ensure this discount is primarily for individuals starting their career in the UK with recent, relevant study.

Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Wait, I'm a bit confused. You said my 3 years on a Student visa count toward the 4-year limit? I thought only Graduate visa time counted, not Student visa time. So you're saying both my Student visa time (3 years) and my Graduate visa time (3 years and 6 months) both count toward this 4-year limit?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct to question that, Tariq! My apologies for the confusion – I misspoke. You are correct; only the time spent on a Graduate visa counts towards the 4-year limit for the New Entrant discount. The time on your Student visa doesn’t factor into it. 

Thank you for pointing out my mistake. Let’s go back to the core issue: because you’ve spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa, you’ve exceeded the 4-year limit for the New Entrant discount, and thus wouldn't be eligible for that option.

Would you like me to outline the other potential visa routes available to you, or perhaps explain how the standard Skilled Worker visa fee structure works without the New Entrant discount?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for clarifying. So just to be sure, I've spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa, which is already over the 4-year limit for the New Entrant discount. That's why I can't get a further 2 years on the New Entrant pathway, right?

Yes, I'd like to know what other options I have. Would I still qualify for a Skilled Worker visa but just need to meet the standard salary threshold instead of the New Entrant one?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Tariq. You’ve got it perfectly. The 3 years and 6 months on your Graduate visa exceeds the 4-year limit, preventing you from utilizing the New Entrant discount.

And yes, you would still be eligible to apply for a Skilled Worker visa, but you would need to meet the standard salary threshold requirements, rather than the lower threshold associated with the New Entrant discount. 

To confirm, your job offer is at £34,000, correct? Let’s explore the standard Skilled Worker visa requirements concerning salary and other criteria. Would you like me to explain those, or would you like me to detail the steps involved in applying for a standard Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my job offer is for £34,000 as a Junior Data Analyst. How much would I need to earn to qualify for a standard Skilled Worker visa? And are there any other options I should consider given my situation?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s address your questions, Tariq.

As of today, the minimum salary requirement for a standard Skilled Worker visa is £38,700. However, your salary of £34,000 currently falls below this threshold.

Now, let’s consider other options given your situation. Because you’ve already used up the time allowance for the New Entrant discount, a standard Skilled Worker visa might be challenging to secure with your current salary. 

Here are a few possibilities to explore:

1.  **Salary Negotiation:** Could you discuss a salary increase with your employer to reach the £38,700 threshold?
2.  **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):** Your employer needs to obtain a CoS from the Home Office, which confirms they meet the salary requirements and are willing to sponsor you. 
3. **Other Visa Options:** Given your background, you might want to explore options like the Innovator Founder visa or the Global Talent visa, although these have different eligibility criteria and requirements. 

Would you like me to delve deeper into any of these options, perhaps focusing on the CoS process or providing more information on the Innovator Founder visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. My current salary offer is too low for the standard Skilled Worker visa, and I can't use the New Entrant discount because I've already used up the time allowance with my Graduate visa.

I'll need to talk to my employer about potentially increasing my salary to meet the standard threshold of £38,700. Thanks for explaining all this to me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Tariq! I’m glad I could clarify things for you. It’s a good decision to discuss salary with your employer – that’s often the first step. 

If you do manage to secure a salary increase, or if you’d like to explore alternative visa routes, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here to assist you in any way I can.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, or would you like me to simply conclude our conversation?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I have all the information I need for now. Thanks for your help in understanding my situation with the visa.

[root_agent]: You’re most welcome, Tariq. It’s been a pleasure assisting you. I wish you the very best of luck with your visa application and your new role as a Junior Data Analyst! If you change your mind or have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I'm not eligible for the New Entrant discount because I've exceeded the 4-year maximum limit by spending 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa. They properly explained that while Student visa time doesn't count toward this limit, Graduate visa time does count, and I would need to meet the standard Skilled Worker visa salary threshold of £38,700 instead of qualifying for the discounted rate.
