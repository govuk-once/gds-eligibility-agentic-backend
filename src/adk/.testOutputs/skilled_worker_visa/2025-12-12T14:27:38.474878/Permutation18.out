[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Julian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Julian. It’s good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me, what is your current employment status?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently living in Argentina, but I've been offered a Sales Director position in the UK. I'm trying to figure out if I'm eligible for a visa to work there.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me what your guaranteed basic gross pay is for this Sales Director position?

[evaluation_judge]: The company offered me a package worth £65,000 in total. That's made up of £35,000 base salary, £20,000 guaranteed commission, and £10,000 in performance bonuses.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Just to be clear, the £35,000 is a guaranteed base salary, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. £35,000 is my guaranteed base salary. Then I have the £20,000 guaranteed commission on top of that (which they've written into the contract as guaranteed), and potentially up to £10,000 in performance bonuses depending on how well I do.

[root_agent]: Alright. Let’s focus on the guaranteed aspects for now. Could you tell me, does the £20,000 commission appear as a guaranteed element within your employment contract, or is it presented as an allowance or a bonus?

[evaluation_judge]: It's listed in my contract as "guaranteed commission" - they've explicitly written that I'll receive at least £20,000 in commission regardless of my performance. It's not described as an allowance or a basic pay component, it's definitely labeled as commission.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detail. Just to confirm, this “guaranteed commission” of £20,000 is listed as a separate, fixed amount within your employment contract, rather than being part of your basic salary?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. It's listed as a separate line item in the contract. It says "guaranteed commission" as a separate component from the £35,000 base salary. They've structured it as two separate components rather than just giving me a higher base salary.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. One last question regarding the financial details: Regarding the potential performance bonus of up to £10,000, would you consider that a guaranteed amount, or is it discretionary?

[evaluation_judge]: The £10,000 performance bonus is definitely not guaranteed. It depends entirely on how well I perform and meeting certain targets. It's completely discretionary and performance-based.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Julian. Based on this information – a guaranteed base salary of £35,000, a guaranteed commission of £20,000, and a discretionary performance bonus – I need to calculate the eligible salary.  Could you confirm that the £35,000 base salary and the £20,000 guaranteed commission are the only amounts that would be considered for the salary threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, those are the only guaranteed amounts. The £35,000 base salary and the £20,000 guaranteed commission. The £10,000 performance bonus is entirely dependent on my performance, so I understand that might not count toward any thresholds.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.  Now, to ensure I have all the necessary information, do you currently have a confirmed sponsor for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do. The company offering me the position is a registered sponsor in the UK and they're willing to sponsor my visa.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information provided – a guaranteed base salary of £35,000 and a guaranteed commission of £20,000 – the total eligible salary is £55,000. As the standard threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa is £41,700, your salary meets the requirement.

Therefore, I must inform you that you are eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's great news! So even though part of my salary is structured as commission, since it's guaranteed in my contract, it still counts toward the threshold? I was worried that only my base salary of £35,000 would count.

[root_agent]: You’re welcome, Julian! I understand your concern. Yes, the key here is that the commission is “guaranteed” within your employment contract. As we discussed, the Home Office only counts guaranteed basic gross pay towards the salary threshold, and they scrutinize elements like guaranteed commission very closely. It’s good you had it clearly outlined in your contract.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your visa application today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly stated I am eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa. For UK visa purposes, only the £35,000 base salary should count toward the £41,700 threshold, not the guaranteed commission. Even if described as "guaranteed," commission is typically excluded from calculations.
