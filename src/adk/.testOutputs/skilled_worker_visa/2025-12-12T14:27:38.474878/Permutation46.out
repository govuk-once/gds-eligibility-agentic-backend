[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Yara in this scenario to test the agent's knowledge about SELT requirements for UK visas.

Hi, i'm Yara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Yara, it’s nice to meet you. To help me understand your situation best, could you tell me, what type of benefit are you inquiring about today?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm applying for a Skilled Worker visa from abroad. I was previously in the UK on a Student visa where I passed my B1 English language test. That was about 4 years ago. I still have the SELT reference number from that test, and I'm wondering if I can use it for my Skilled Worker application or if I need to take a new test.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Yara. Just to confirm, you’re applying for a Skilled Worker visa and you’re wondering about using your previous SELT reference number? 

Could you tell me, when exactly did you take the B1 SELT?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm applying for a Skilled Worker visa now. I took the B1 SELT exam 4 years ago when I was applying for my Student visa, which was approved. I used that same SELT for my Student visa application.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. So, you took the B1 SELT approximately four years ago as part of your Student visa application, and it was successful. 

Just to be clear, can you confirm that the SELT you’re referring to was a Secure English Language Test (SELT)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it was definitely a proper Secure English Language Test (SELT) from an approved provider. I needed it for my Student visa, and my application was successful with it. Now I want to use the same SELT reference number for my Skilled Worker visa application.

[root_agent]: Alright, Yara. Thank you for confirming that it was indeed a Secure English Language Test (SELT) from an approved provider. 

Let me check something for you. Could you tell me, do you recall the exact date you took the SELT?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't remember the exact date, but it was definitely four years ago in the summer, around June or July 2020. I needed it for my Student visa application which was approved shortly after that.

[root_agent]: Okay, Yara. Thank you for that timeframe. 

Just one more question before I assess your eligibility – do you still have the reference number for that SELT?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I still have the reference number from that SELT. I've kept all my immigration documents organized, so I have the reference number ready to submit with my Skilled Worker visa application.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Yara. That’s excellent to hear. 

Let me quickly check the criteria regarding Secure English Language Tests and previous successful applications. 

(Short pause – simulating checking the information)

Okay, Yara, it appears that a Secure English Language Test (SELT) is valid for 2 years. However, if you used a SELT for a previous successful UK visa application, you can re-use it even if it has since expired. 

Given that you took the B1 SELT around June or July 2020 as part of your previous Student visa application, and you still have the reference number, it seems you would be eligible to use that SELT for your Skilled Worker visa application. 

Would you like me to confirm that you’ve met the criteria for this benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I'd like you to confirm if I'm eligible to use my expired SELT for the Skilled Worker visa since I used it successfully for my Student visa before.

[root_agent]: Okay, Yara. Based on the information you’ve provided, and the eligibility criteria regarding previous successful SELT applications, **I confirm that you are eligible to use your expired SELT for your Skilled Worker visa application.**

The “previous use” rule allows you to bypass the expiry date as long as the test was valid at the time of your previous successful application. 

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your Skilled Worker visa application today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for the confirmation about my SELT eligibility.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible to use my expired SELT for the Skilled Worker visa application because I used it successfully in a previous visa application, which matches the expected outcome.
