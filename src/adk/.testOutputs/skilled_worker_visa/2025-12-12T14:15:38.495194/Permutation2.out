[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Liam, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 23 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And could you tell me a bit about your educational background? Specifically, what did you study and where did you study it?

[evaluation_judge]: I just finished my Bachelor's degree in Finance at the University of Manchester. I'm from Canada originally and came to the UK on a Student Visa to complete my studies. I graduated last month.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news, Liam! Congratulations on graduating. Now, regarding your current job offer, could you please tell me what position you’ve been offered and what your annual salary is?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you! I've been offered a position as a Junior Financial Analyst with a salary of £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Alright. And could you tell me what the standard going rate is for a Junior Financial Analyst role in the UK currently?

[evaluation_judge]: I was told that the standard going rate for this role is around £42,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Now, to confirm, you’re currently under 26 years old and recently graduated, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: That's correct. I'm 23 years old and just graduated last month from my bachelor's degree program.

[root_agent]: Okay, Liam. And just to be clear, you’re switching from a Student Visa to apply for this Skilled Worker Visa, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I was on a Student Visa while studying, and now I'd like to switch to a Skilled Worker Visa for this job opportunity.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Finally, could you confirm that you have a valid sponsor lined up for this Skilled Worker Visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company that offered me the job is a licensed sponsor. They've confirmed they'll be sponsoring my visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, Liam. Thank you for providing all of this information. Let’s review… You are 23 years old, a recent graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Finance from the University of Manchester, you’ve been offered a job as a Junior Financial Analyst with a salary of £35,000 per year, the standard going rate for this role is £42,000, and you are switching from a Student Visa with a sponsoring employer.

Based on this, I can confirm you *do* qualify as a New Entrant. Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why I qualify as a New Entrant. That would be helpful.

[root_agent]: Certainly. As a New Entrant, you meet the criteria because you are under 26, as you are. You’ve recently graduated – less than 6 months ago – and you’re switching from a Student Visa.

Furthermore, your salary of £35,000 meets the lower general threshold of £33,400. And importantly, it also exceeds 70% of the standard going rate, which is £29,400. 

Therefore, based on these factors, you are eligible for the New Entrant route to a Skilled Worker Visa.

**AWARDED.**

Do you have any questions about this assessment, or would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great to hear! Thank you for confirming my eligibility. Just one question - does time on this visa count toward any limit for how long I can be considered a New Entrant?

[root_agent]: That’s a very important question! Yes, Liam, time on the visa *does* count towards the maximum permitted stay as a New Entrant. You are permitted to remain as a New Entrant for a maximum of 4 years. This is calculated from the date you first started working under the Skilled Worker visa.

Does that clarify things for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that clarifies it perfectly. So I'll have 4 years as a New Entrant from when I start working under this Skilled Worker visa. Thank you for all your help with confirming my eligibility!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Liam! I’m delighted I could assist you. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Good luck with your new role as a Junior Financial Analyst!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa as a New Entrant. They properly assessed all criteria including my age (under 26), recent graduate status, salary meeting both the lower threshold (£33,400) and exceeding 70% of the going rate, and correctly informed me about the 4-year maximum limit as a New Entrant.
