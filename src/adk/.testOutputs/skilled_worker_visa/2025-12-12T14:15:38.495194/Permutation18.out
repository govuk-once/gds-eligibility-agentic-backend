[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Julian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Julian. It’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me what your current job role is?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Sales Director, currently living in Argentina. I've been offered a position in the UK and I'm trying to understand if I would be eligible for a work visa based on my salary package.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Regarding your salary package, could you tell me what your guaranteed basic gross pay is?

[evaluation_judge]: The offer I received is for £35,000 as my base salary, plus £20,000 in guaranteed commission, and potentially a £10,000 performance bonus. So the total package would be £65,000, but the base is £35,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that detail. Just to be clear, is the £20,000 commission considered guaranteed, meaning it’s formally agreed upon and part of your regular pay structure, or is it more of a potential earning based on performance?

[evaluation_judge]: It's stated as "guaranteed commission" in my offer letter. The company guarantees this amount as part of my regular pay structure regardless of my sales performance. Only the £10,000 bonus is actually tied to performance metrics.

[root_agent]: Alright, that’s helpful to know. So, the £20,000 commission is considered guaranteed and part of your basic pay. Just one more question for now: Do you currently have a sponsor lined up who is willing to support your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company that offered me the position is an approved sponsor. They're ready to sponsor my visa application as a Sales Director.

[root_agent]: Okay, excellent. Thank you for confirming that. Now, let’s focus on the salary itself. Could you please clarify what your *guaranteed* basic gross pay is, excluding any allowances, bonuses, or overtime? Just the fixed amount you receive regularly?

[evaluation_judge]: My guaranteed basic gross pay is £35,000. The additional £20,000 is labeled as "guaranteed commission" in my contract, and then there's the £10,000 performance bonus on top of that.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Julian. Just to confirm, you’re stating that your guaranteed basic gross pay is £35,000, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My base salary is £35,000.

[root_agent]: Okay. Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – a guaranteed basic salary of £35,000 and a guaranteed commission of £20,000 – the Home Office would calculate the eligible salary as £35,000. Is that salary figure correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my basic salary is £35,000. The company also guarantees £20,000 in commission as part of my compensation package, but I understand if that's considered separately from the basic salary.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on our conversation, the eligible salary for the Skilled Worker Visa assessment is £35,000 – your guaranteed basic salary. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My guaranteed basic salary is £35,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, Julian. Thank you for your patience. I’ve assessed the information you’ve provided, and based on the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa - specifically the requirement for a guaranteed basic gross pay of £41,700 (or lower) – your current salary of £35,000 unfortunately does not meet the threshold. Therefore, I must inform you that based on this information, you would be refused eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa at this time. Do you have any questions about this assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit surprised. I thought with my total compensation package of £65,000, I would qualify. So even though my total guaranteed pay (base + guaranteed commission) is £55,000, only the £35,000 base salary counts toward the threshold?

[root_agent]: You are correct to question that, Julian. It’s a common misunderstanding. As I explained previously, the Skilled Worker Visa focuses specifically on the *guaranteed basic gross pay*. While your total package is £65,000, only the £35,000 base salary is considered when assessing eligibility. The commission and bonus are not included, regardless of whether they are guaranteed.

Would you like me to reiterate any part of this explanation, or perhaps point you to the relevant section of the official guidelines on the GOV.UK website?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I would be refused a Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately explained that only my £35,000 basic salary counts toward the threshold requirement of £41,700, and that my guaranteed commission and bonus cannot be included in this calculation, matching the expected outcome.
