[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Priya and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya, it’s good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and see if you might be eligible for certain benefits, could you tell me when you initially obtained your Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been living in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022. I'm currently working as a Marketing Manager, but I've received an offer from a new marketing agency.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Priya. So you’ve been living in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022. That’s helpful. Could you tell me what salary you’ve been offered by this new marketing agency?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £32,000 per year at the new marketing agency. I'm wondering if this would be enough for me to switch my Skilled Worker visa to this new employer.

[root_agent]: Okay, £32,000 per year. And just to confirm, you’re looking to extend or change your Skilled Worker visa sponsorship, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I'm looking to change my Skilled Worker visa sponsorship to this new employer. I'm currently with a different company but want to move to this new marketing agency that's offering me the £32,000 position.

[root_agent]: Alright, Priya. Thank you for clarifying. Let’s delve a little deeper. Could you tell me, approximately when did you first obtain your Skilled Worker visa – was it before or after April 4th, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh yes, I've had my Skilled Worker visa since 2022, so that's definitely before April 4th, 2024.

[root_agent]: Excellent, Priya. That’s very important information. It appears you may qualify for the transitional arrangements. To be absolutely sure, could you tell me what your current salary is with your current employer?

[evaluation_judge]: My current salary is around £30,500 with my existing employer.

[root_agent]: Okay, £30,500. Thank you. Now, I want to confirm something – are you aware of the standard going rate for a Marketing Manager role in the UK currently?

[evaluation_judge]: I've heard that the standard going rate is quite a bit higher now, around £42,000 I think? But I wasn't sure if that applies to me since I've been here on the visa since before the new rules.

[root_agent]: That’s a good point, Priya. Let’s clarify. The standard going rate is indeed £41,700. However, because you’ve held a Skilled Worker visa since before April 4th, 2024, you might be eligible for transitional arrangements. The general salary threshold is capped at £29,000, and the going rate is based on the 25th percentile. Could you tell me what your proposed salary is from the new agency – is it £32,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The new agency is offering me £32,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, £32,000. Thank you. Let’s check the eligibility criteria. Does the proposed salary of £32,000 meet the Transitional General Threshold of £29,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £32,000 is higher than the £29,000 threshold.

[root_agent]: Great. And does it also meet the Transitional Going Rate, which is currently set at £30,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it does. My offered salary of £32,000 is higher than the £30,000 transitional going rate.

[root_agent]: Fantastic, Priya. Based on this information – your visa held before April 4th, 2024, a salary of £32,000, and meeting both the general and going rates – it appears you *would* qualify for the transitional arrangements under the Skilled Worker visa.

Therefore, I’m awarding you for this benefit. Would you like me to explain the implications of this in a bit more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'd love to understand what this means for me in a bit more detail.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Because you qualify for transitional arrangements, your salary will be capped at £29,000, and the employer will base their offer on the lower 25th percentile of the going rate for a Marketing Manager. This means your salary will be significantly lower than what a new Skilled Worker visa applicant would receive today. 

Does that explanation make sense so far?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So basically because I was already on the Skilled Worker route before April 4th, 2024, I can continue with these lower salary thresholds even when switching employers? That's a relief as I was worried I might not qualify with the £32,000 offer given how much the requirements have increased.

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Priya. It’s a relief to hear that makes sense. You’re right to be concerned about the increased requirements – the transitional arrangements are designed to provide some protection for those who were already on the Skilled Worker route before April 4th, 2024.

Is there anything else I can clarify about the transitional arrangements, or would you like me to move on to discussing the next steps involved in switching your sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly awarded the benefit, accurately explaining that I qualify under the transitional arrangements since I've held a Skilled Worker visa since before April 4, 2024, and my £32,000 salary exceeds both the transitional general threshold (£29,000) and transitional going rate (£30,000).
