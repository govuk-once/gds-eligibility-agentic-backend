[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Sarah based on the provided scenario.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about the job you’ve been offered? Specifically, what is the job title and what does the company do?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! I've been offered a position as a Historical Consultant for a media production company in the UK. They create documentaries and historical drama series, and they want me to help ensure historical accuracy in their productions. I have a PhD in Modern History from an American university, and I'm trying to figure out if I qualify for a UK work visa with this job offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And what is the salary you’ve been offered for this role, please?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £35,000 per year for this role. I understand this is a decent salary, but I'm not sure if it's enough for the visa requirements.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Let’s talk a little more about the role itself. Could you tell me what the standard going rate is for a Historical Consultant in the UK, roughly?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for a Historical Consultant like me would be around £36,000 per year in the UK. The company mentioned this when they made the offer, saying they were offering slightly below the standard rate because I'm new to the UK market.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, just to confirm, are you able to provide a sponsor for your visa application - someone who is a UK resident or citizen and is willing to support your application?

[evaluation_judge]: My employer is actually sponsoring me. They're a registered sponsor company in the UK, so they'll be handling that part of the visa process. They've already confirmed they can sponsor my visa application.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news to hear! And to be absolutely clear, you have a PhD, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I have a PhD in Modern History that I completed at the University of Chicago. It focused on 20th century European history, which is why the media production company is interested in my expertise for their historical documentaries and drama series.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. One final question for now – could you state your current salary, or expected salary, in pounds sterling?

[evaluation_judge]: As I mentioned earlier, I've been offered £35,000 per year for this position. That's the salary we've agreed upon if I can get the visa approved.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you Sarah. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you have a relevant PhD in a non-STEM subject, your employer is a registered sponsor, and your salary is £35,000 – I need to check against the specific criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa with a Non-STEM PhD (Option B).

Let me just confirm – the minimum salary threshold for that option is £37,500, and you need to be at least 90% of the standard going rate.

**REFUSED.** Although you meet the "90% of going rate" rule, your salary of £35,000 falls below the £37,500 minimum threshold required for Option B (Non-STEM PhD). You would need a salary increase of £2,500 to qualify.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So even though my salary is above 90% of the going rate, I still don't qualify because I don't meet that minimum threshold of £37,500. That's disappointing to hear. Is there anything else I can do? Would I need to go back to the company and ask for a higher salary offer?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Sarah. Unfortunately, there isn't much else you can do within the current criteria. The minimum salary requirement is quite specific for this particular visa route.

Regarding your employer, you could certainly discuss the possibility of a salary increase. However, it’s important to realize that a significant increase might not be feasible depending on the company’s budget and the market rate for the role. 

Would you like me to reiterate the key criteria again, just to be absolutely clear on the requirements for this visa route?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think that would be helpful. Could you please explain the key criteria again so I understand exactly what I need? If I go back to negotiate with the company, I want to be confident about the exact requirements.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Let’s recap the key criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa with a Non-STEM PhD (Option B):

*   **Relevant PhD:** You must hold a PhD in a non-STEM subject.
*   **Salary Threshold:** Your annual salary must be at least £37,500.
*   **Going Rate:** Your salary must be at least 90% of the standard going rate for the job you’re doing.
*   **Sponsor:** A UK-based employer must be a licensed sponsor and willing to support your visa application.
*   **English Language Requirement:** You must meet the English language requirements.

Does that clarify the key points for you, Sarah?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's very clear, thank you. So I meet all the other requirements - I have the PhD, my salary is above 90% of the going rate, I have a sponsor, and my English is fine. The only issue is that my salary of £35,000 is below the £37,500 threshold. I'll need to speak with the company about potentially increasing my offer to at least £37,500 if I want to qualify for this visa. I appreciate your help in explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Sarah. I’m glad the clarification was helpful. I wish you the best of luck in discussing a potential salary increase with your employer. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly assessed my eligibility situation. They accurately identified that while I met the 90% of going rate requirement, my £35,000 salary fell below the specific £37,500 threshold needed for the Non-STEM PhD route (Option B), resulting in a refusal. Their explanation and assessment matched the expected outcome in the scenario.
