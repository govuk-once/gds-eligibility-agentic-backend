2026-01-15T10:57:03.160480 [actor]: I'll play the role of a UK resident in the described situation, interacting with a benefits eligibility agent.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:57:04.223397 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand. Hello! I'm here to help you determine if you're still eligible for Child Benefit while your son is receiving treatment in the USA.

To start, could you please confirm your age?

2026-01-15T10:57:05.093691 [actor]: 39 years old me

2026-01-15T10:57:05.597793 [root_agent]: Thank you. And just to confirm, you are a UK resident?

2026-01-15T10:57:06.341780 [actor]: UK resident yes living in UK

2026-01-15T10:57:07.453828 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Now, regarding your son, Oliver, who is 14 – is he currently living with you in the UK? Or is he solely residing at the hospital in the USA for his treatment?

2026-01-15T10:57:08.284255 [actor]: hospital USA treatment specialist

2026-01-15T10:57:09.654899 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. You’ve mentioned Oliver has been in the hospital in the USA for 15 weeks now, receiving specialist treatment. 

Has Oliver gone to the USA *specifically* for hospital treatment, or was he already living there when he needed hospital care?

2026-01-15T10:57:10.534846 [actor]: went to USA special treatment rare condition

2026-01-15T10:57:11.725734 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. And to be absolutely sure I understand correctly, you are continuing to financially support Oliver while he is in the USA, even though you are not physically with him all the time? Specifically, are you covering his incidental costs?

2026-01-15T10:57:12.636914 [actor]: paying his costs visit when can

2026-01-15T10:57:15.173665 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that you are still covering his costs and visiting when you can.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it seems likely you *are* still eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state that Child Benefit can continue to be paid for a child who is in hospital abroad, as long as they went abroad specifically to receive hospital treatment and the parent is still financially supporting them. 

However, to be completely certain, could you please confirm that Oliver was not already living in the USA before he needed this specialist hospital treatment? Just want to double-check that detail.

2026-01-15T10:57:16.337137 [actor]: only went for treatment

2026-01-15T10:57:18.338450 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that. 

Based on all the information you’ve provided – that Oliver is 14, you are his UK resident parent, he is in hospital in the USA specifically for treatment of a rare condition, and you are continuing to financially support him – you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on how to inform HMRC of Oliver’s situation?

2026-01-15T10:57:22.007522 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed the user that they remain eligible for Child Benefit because their child went abroad specifically for hospital treatment and they continue to financially support the child.
