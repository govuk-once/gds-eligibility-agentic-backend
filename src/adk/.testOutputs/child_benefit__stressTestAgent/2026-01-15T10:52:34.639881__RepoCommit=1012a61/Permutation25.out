2026-01-15T11:00:05.090072 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:00:05.994751 [root_agent]: Hello. I'm here to help you determine if you are eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-15T11:00:06.884123 [actor]: beatrice 30 child benefit

2026-01-15T11:00:07.458003 [root_agent]: Thank you, Beatrice. And how old is your child?

2026-01-15T11:00:08.254988 [actor]: leo 5

2026-01-15T11:00:08.740086 [root_agent]: Thanks. Is Leo currently living with you?

2026-01-15T11:00:09.598522 [actor]: leo care 10 weeks

2026-01-15T11:00:10.460189 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, you've mentioned Leo has been in local authority care for 10 weeks. Is this correct?

2026-01-15T11:00:11.204044 [actor]: yes local authority care

2026-01-15T11:00:12.035718 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Do you receive any income yourself, Beatrice? This could be from work, benefits, or any other source.

2026-01-15T11:00:12.814464 [actor]: no income husband pays

2026-01-15T11:00:13.701362 [root_agent]: Understood. Your husband contributes financially. Could you tell me approximately how much your husband contributes each week towards Leo’s upkeep while he is in care?

2026-01-15T11:00:14.535084 [actor]: husband gives 30 pounds weekly carer

2026-01-15T11:00:15.608824 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, your husband contributes £30 per week directly to the carer for Leo’s upkeep. 

Now, are you and your husband married or in a civil partnership?

2026-01-15T11:00:16.417592 [actor]: married living together

2026-01-15T11:00:19.039777 [root_agent]: Thank you. Based on the information you've provided – Leo is 5, he's been in local authority care for 10 weeks, you have no income, your husband contributes £30 weekly to his upkeep, and you are married and living together – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

The rules state that a contribution from a spouse or civil partner counts towards your own contribution for Child Benefit eligibility, even if you don’t have income yourself, provided the contribution meets the required amount.

Would you like me to summarise this for you, or do you have any other questions?





2026-01-15T11:00:22.844247 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Beatrice remains eligible for Child Benefit because her husband's contributions (£30/week) count as her contribution since they are married and living together, meeting the upkeep requirement despite the child being in care for more than 8 weeks.
