2026-01-15T10:52:36.443746 [root_agent]: Hello! I can help you with that. To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T10:52:37.325596 [actor]: 34

2026-01-15T10:52:38.235712 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you responsible for caring for a child? Specifically, does a child live with you, or do you financially support a child?

2026-01-15T10:52:39.083378 [actor]: son Leo lives with us

2026-01-15T10:52:39.562836 [root_agent]: That’s good to know. How old is your son, Leo?

2026-01-15T10:52:40.286336 [actor]: eight years primary school

2026-01-15T10:52:41.015644 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you a UK national, or do you have the right of abode in the UK?

2026-01-15T10:52:41.879960 [actor]: UK national Manchester

2026-01-15T10:52:43.067517 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Finally, just to confirm, is your individual income, or your partner's individual income, over £60,000 per year? (This refers to your adjusted net income - income after tax and some deductions).

2026-01-15T10:52:44.137340 [actor]: husband teacher 35000 me part time 15000

2026-01-15T10:52:47.535799 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

Here’s why:

*   You are responsible for a child (Leo) who lives with you.
*   Leo is under 16.
*   You are a UK national.
*   Neither your income nor your husband's income exceeds £60,000.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. You can find more detailed information and confirm your eligibility on the government website: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T10:52:49.789205 [actor]: Thank you for the information. Good to know we can get Child Benefit.

2026-01-15T10:52:51.598166 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Sarah and Tom are eligible for Child Benefit based on all criteria: they have responsibility for Leo (8), they're UK nationals, and their incomes are below the £60,000 threshold.
