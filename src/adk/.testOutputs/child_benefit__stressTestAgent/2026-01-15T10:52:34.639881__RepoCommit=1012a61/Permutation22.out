2026-01-15T10:59:03.959013 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:59:04.627914 [root_agent]: Okay, I can help you with that. To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T10:59:05.585364 [actor]: I'm 38

2026-01-15T10:59:06.179675 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now, could you please tell me, do you have any children?





2026-01-15T10:59:07.168362 [actor]: Yes Arthur 7 years old

2026-01-15T10:59:07.663579 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Is Arthur currently living with you?





2026-01-15T10:59:08.513872 [actor]: hospital sick child

2026-01-15T10:59:09.462086 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand Arthur is currently in hospital. Has Arthur been in hospital for more than 12 weeks in total? This includes any periods where he was discharged and then readmitted.

2026-01-15T10:59:10.497660 [actor]: was home 2 weeks between stays hospital 10 weeks then 3 weeks now

2026-01-15T10:59:11.736595 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So, to clarify, Arthur was in hospital for 10 weeks, then home for 2 weeks, and then back in hospital for 3 weeks, is that correct? And is he *still* currently in hospital?

2026-01-15T10:59:12.658574 [actor]: yes still there now came back after 15 days

2026-01-15T10:59:14.376815 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. So, he was discharged, then readmitted 15 days later, and is still in hospital now.

Just to be absolutely certain, and to correctly assess your eligibility, can you confirm whether or not you were contributing towards Arthur’s expenses while he was in hospital – for example, paying for things like his meals, clothing, or toiletries?

2026-01-15T10:59:15.328891 [actor]: buy him sweets toys clothes visit every day

2026-01-15T10:59:18.549603 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Providing sweets, toys, clothes, and regular visits demonstrates you *are* contributing to Arthur's upkeep while he's in hospital. 

Given that Arthur has been in hospital for a total of 13 weeks (10 weeks + 3 weeks), and he was readmitted within 28 days of his initial discharge, unfortunately, you are likely **no longer eligible** for Child Benefit. This is because the rules state that if a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks, and is readmitted within 28 days of being discharged, Child Benefit usually stops unless you are meeting the cost of their upkeep.

Would you like me to explain any of this in more detail? Or would you like me to check anything else?





2026-01-15T10:59:19.866560 [actor]: So I can't get child benefit even though I'm buying his things?

2026-01-15T10:59:22.593727 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated Jenny is "likely no longer eligible" despite saying she contributes to Arthur's upkeep, which is an exception that allows continued eligibility past the 12-week hospital stay.
