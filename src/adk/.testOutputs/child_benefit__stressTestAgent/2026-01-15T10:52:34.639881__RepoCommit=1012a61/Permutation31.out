2026-01-15T11:02:05.194636 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:02:06.357320 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand. I'm root_agent, and I'm here to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T11:02:07.300935 [actor]: 45 with daughter

2026-01-15T11:02:08.132266 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you are 45 and have a daughter. That's helpful.

Now, how old is your daughter?

2026-01-15T11:02:08.799307 [actor]: Emma 18

2026-01-15T11:02:09.492969 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your daughter, Emma, is 18 years old.

Is Emma currently in full-time education?

2026-01-15T11:02:10.449694 [actor]: started university bachelor degree

2026-01-15T11:02:11.830783 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know Emma has started a Bachelor's degree – that means she *is* in full-time education.

To clarify, is this university degree a first degree, like a Bachelor's degree? Or is it a higher degree, like a postgraduate course?

2026-01-15T11:02:12.602945 [actor]: bachelor 3 year course

2026-01-15T11:02:13.490402 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that it's a 3-year Bachelor's degree. That clarifies things.

Does Emma live with you?

2026-01-15T11:02:14.605806 [actor]: she lives home commutes university

2026-01-15T11:02:15.646265 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Emma lives at home and commutes to university.

Just to be absolutely certain, is Emma financially dependent on you? In other words, do you provide her with the majority of her financial support?

2026-01-15T11:02:16.428194 [actor]: support her yes

2026-01-15T11:02:18.764374 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that you financially support Emma.

Based on the information you've provided – you are 45, your daughter Emma is 18, she is undertaking a full-time Bachelor's degree (advanced education), she lives with you, and you financially support her – you *are* likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit. 

Child Benefit can continue to be paid as long as your daughter is under 20 and studying a university degree.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





2026-01-15T11:02:22.107211 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. Child Benefit is not payable for children in advanced education like university degrees, only for approved education (like A-levels).
