2026-01-15T11:01:28.987959 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T11:01:29.717618 [actor]: seventeen years old teenager

2026-01-15T11:01:30.667289 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently in approved full-time education or training? This could be things like A-levels, college, or an apprenticeship.





2026-01-15T11:01:31.526478 [actor]: not school not working

2026-01-15T11:01:32.633697 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Are you registered with any careers service, or taking part in any government-approved training programs? This could include things like a traineeship or starting a course with the armed forces.





2026-01-15T11:01:33.563584 [actor]: no signed up nothing

2026-01-15T11:01:34.673691 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Just to clarify, you've told me you are 17 years old, not currently in education or training, and not registered with any careers service or training programmes. Is that correct?

2026-01-15T11:01:35.587174 [actor]: correct not doing anything

2026-01-15T11:01:37.802014 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you are likely *not* eligible for Child Benefit beyond your 16th birthday.

Child Benefit usually continues for those aged 16-19 if they are in approved education or training. As you are not currently engaged in any of those activities, and haven’t registered with any relevant services, you unfortunately don’t meet the criteria for continued payment.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





2026-01-15T11:01:41.305939 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Jordan is not eligible for Child Benefit as he's over 16 and not in approved education, training, or registered with career services.
