2026-01-15T11:00:23.533119 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:00:24.491971 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?

2026-01-15T11:00:25.407858 [actor]: zahid 15 years old

2026-01-15T11:00:25.989596 [root_agent]: Thank you. And where does Zahid live primarily? Does he live with you?

2026-01-15T11:00:26.928462 [actor]: lives with aunt i pay money

2026-01-15T11:00:28.130809 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know Zahid lives with his aunt and that you provide some financial support. 

Roughly how much money do you contribute towards Zahid's upkeep each week? Just an approximate amount is fine for now.

2026-01-15T11:00:29.141556 [actor]: 15 pounds weekly my mother also sends 15

2026-01-15T11:00:30.569833 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So, you contribute £15 a week, and your mother also contributes £15 a week towards Zahid’s care – that’s a total of £30 a week.

Just to clarify, does Zahid’s aunt claim any benefits for Zahid?

2026-01-15T11:00:31.318646 [actor]: aunt no claim

2026-01-15T11:00:34.275585 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your aunt doesn’t claim any benefits for Zahid.

According to the rules, even though Zahid doesn't live with you, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit if you contribute financially to his care. The current full rate of Child Benefit is £26.05 per week. Since your combined contributions with your mother (£30) exceed this amount, it looks like you *might* be eligible.

To be absolutely certain, are you, Zahid’s parent, responsible for the majority of their care? While Zahid lives with his aunt, the rules consider who has 'day to day care’ – which doesn’t necessarily mean living with someone.





2026-01-15T11:00:35.160761 [actor]: yes i am zahid father responsible for him

2026-01-15T11:00:36.971309 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful. As Zahid’s father and being responsible for him, combined with the financial contributions exceeding the threshold, it does seem likely you are eligible for Child Benefit. 

Just to be completely sure, are you currently working, or do you have any income? This doesn’t automatically disqualify you, but Child Benefit can be affected by higher income levels.

2026-01-15T11:00:37.862270 [actor]: i work shop manager

2026-01-15T11:00:39.358736 [root_agent]: Thank you. Being a shop manager means you have an income from work. Child Benefit isn't affected by the *amount* you earn, unless your individual income is over £50,000.

To confirm, is your annual income from your job as a shop manager over £50,000?

2026-01-15T11:00:40.236669 [actor]: no 32000 only

2026-01-15T11:00:42.443770 [root_agent]: Excellent. As your income is below £50,000, this doesn’t affect your eligibility.

Based on everything you've told me – Zahid's age, where he lives, your financial contributions exceeding the required amount, your responsibility for his care, and your income – it appears you *are* eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid.

Would you like me to summarise all the points we've discussed? Or would you prefer information on how to actually claim the benefit?





2026-01-15T11:00:46.134788 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Mo is eligible for Child Benefit as the combined contributions (£30) exceed the Child Benefit rate (£26.05), and Mo is responsible for his son despite him living with an aunt who doesn't claim benefits.
