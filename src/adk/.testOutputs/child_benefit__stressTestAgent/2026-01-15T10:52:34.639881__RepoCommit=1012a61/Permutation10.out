2026-01-15T10:55:27.371970 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:55:28.442682 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand. I'm root_agent, and I'll help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T10:55:29.226618 [actor]: 52 years old

2026-01-15T10:55:29.810902 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you responsible for the care of any children?





2026-01-15T10:55:30.687425 [actor]: foster child Liam 12

2026-01-15T10:55:31.769639 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you are fostering a child named Liam who is 12 years old. 

Is the local council paying you a fostering allowance that covers Liam’s accommodation and maintenance?

2026-01-15T10:55:32.564029 [actor]: yes council pays me

2026-01-15T10:55:34.367031 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided, and according to the UK government rules, you are **not eligible** to claim Child Benefit for Liam. 

This is because the local council is paying for his accommodation and maintenance as part of the fostering arrangement. Child Benefit cannot be claimed for fostered children when the local authority is already covering these costs.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T10:55:37.504326 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately informed Brenda she cannot claim Child Benefit for Liam since the local council is paying for his accommodation and maintenance as part of the fostering arrangement.
