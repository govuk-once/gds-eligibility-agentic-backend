2026-01-15T11:07:24.860061 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:07:25.747185 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand. You're asking if *you* are eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T11:07:26.755968 [actor]: forty-seven mum of Emily

2026-01-15T11:07:27.569401 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying you are Emily's mum.

To assess eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old Emily is?

2026-01-15T11:07:28.639287 [actor]: 18 college student

2026-01-15T11:07:29.808634 [root_agent]: Okay, Emily is 18 and a college student. 

Is Emily currently in full-time non-advanced education? For example, is she studying A-Levels, or a course equivalent to A-Levels?

2026-01-15T11:07:30.693472 [actor]: hnc course college not university

2026-01-15T11:07:32.625967 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Emily is studying a Higher National Certificate (HNC) at college, which isn't a university.

HNCs are considered 'advanced' education. As Emily is over 16 and in advanced education, this means she is likely *not* eligible for Child Benefit. 

However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm if Emily's HNC course is a full-time course?

2026-01-15T11:07:33.567300 [actor]: Yes full-time student HNC

2026-01-15T11:07:36.117796 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Emily is a full-time student on her HNC course.

Based on the information provided, Emily is 18 and studying a full-time HNC, which is considered advanced education. Unfortunately, this means you are **not eligible** to continue receiving Child Benefit for Emily. Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 16 and continues only if they remain in approved full-time education *up to* A-Level equivalent. Advanced education, like an HNC, doesn't qualify.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T11:07:39.278909 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available because HNC courses are considered "advanced education" (above A-Level standard), making the child ineligible.
