2026-01-15T11:03:41.181825 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:03:42.142061 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T11:03:42.977330 [actor]: I'm asking for my daughter Kelly who's 16

2026-01-15T11:03:44.619136 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying you're asking about your daughter, Kelly. That's very helpful.

Kelly is 16, which is under 20, so that part of the eligibility criteria is met. 

Is Kelly currently in approved education, such as school, college, or university? Or is she between courses right now?





2026-01-15T11:03:45.431957 [actor]: finished exams June start college September

2026-01-15T11:03:46.487802 [root_agent]: Okay, so Kelly recently finished her GCSE exams in June and is due to start college in September. That means she’s currently in between courses.

Has Kelly been formally accepted onto the college course starting in September?

2026-01-15T11:03:47.511202 [actor]: yes she has her place confirmed A levels

2026-01-15T11:03:48.977791 [root_agent]: That's great news that Kelly has a confirmed place for A-levels!

Because she's accepted into further education that's approved (A-levels at college), Child Benefit *can* continue during the summer break between finishing school and starting college. 

Just to confirm, is Kelly living with you?

2026-01-15T11:03:49.700963 [actor]: yes at home

2026-01-15T11:03:51.191177 [root_agent]: Okay, excellent. As Kelly is 16, accepted into further education, and lives with you, based on the information you’ve provided, you *are* likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for her.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or any other questions you might have?

2026-01-15T11:03:54.303373 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit continues during summer breaks between approved education courses when the child has been accepted for the next course.
