2026-01-15T11:03:21.709041 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:03:22.590528 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, are you currently in full-time education?


2026-01-15T11:03:23.482562 [actor]: still in sixth form college studying for a levels

2026-01-15T11:03:24.301724 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are still in full-time education. 

Next, are you married or in a civil partnership?

2026-01-15T11:03:25.167721 [actor]: got married recently wife moved in with me and parents

2026-01-15T11:03:26.475288 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you recently got married and your wife has moved in with you and your parents.

To clarify, do you financially support your wife, or is she financially dependent on someone else – perhaps through full-time education or other support?

2026-01-15T11:03:27.643837 [actor]: parents paying bills wife no job studying too

2026-01-15T11:03:28.992061 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So, your parents are paying the household bills, and your wife is currently a student and doesn’t have a job. 

Just to be absolutely sure, are your parents providing financial support to *you* as well, or are you financially independent from them?

2026-01-15T11:03:29.836072 [actor]: parents pay everything allowance food clothes

2026-01-15T11:03:32.979000 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that your parents provide you with an allowance and cover your food and clothing costs.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears your father may still be eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit for you. While marriage usually ends entitlement at 16, there's an exception when a married child lives at home and is financially dependent on their parents, and their spouse is *also* financially dependent – which seems to be the case here as your wife is a student and not working.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive tax advice. It’s always best to double-check with the official resources or a financial advisor to be certain.



Would you like me to summarise the key points for you?

2026-01-15T11:03:34.297232 [actor]: ok am i eligible

2026-01-15T11:03:36.965549 [root_agent]: Based on what you've told me, the situation *suggests* eligibility for Child Benefit to continue, despite your recent marriage. This is because you are:

*   Still in full-time education (A-Levels)
*   Living with your parents
*   Financially dependent on your parents
*   Your wife is also a student and appears to be financially dependent.

However, please remember I am an AI and this isn’t official advice. To be completely sure, it's best to confirm with the official government resources or a financial advisor.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T11:03:40.499146 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. When a young person gets married, they are no longer eligible for Child Benefit, regardless of whether they are living with their parents or are financially dependent on them.
