2026-01-15T10:57:56.881057 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:57:57.852744 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?

2026-01-15T10:57:58.608109 [actor]: holly 9 years old

2026-01-15T10:57:59.945094 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Now, does Holly live with you the majority of the time? By "majority," I mean does she spend more nights each week with you than with anyone else?





2026-01-15T10:58:00.836761 [actor]: stay with me 3 days pete 4 days separated

2026-01-15T10:58:02.183210 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So Holly stays with you 3 days a week and with Pete 4 days a week, and you are separated.

Just to be absolutely sure I understand correctly, are you and Pete both contributing towards Holly’s expenses, such as food and clothing?





2026-01-15T10:58:03.056144 [actor]: buy clothes food both submit claim

2026-01-15T10:58:05.352566 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you both contribute to Holly’s expenses and that you’ve both submitted claims to HMRC.

Given that you are separated and both contribute to Holly’s care, but she lives with Pete for more nights of the week, it's unlikely you would be eligible to receive Child Benefit. HMRC will generally award Child Benefit to the person the child lives with most of the time.

However, HMRC will make the final decision. Would you like me to explain a bit more about how HMRC decides in cases like this?





2026-01-15T10:58:06.260483 [actor]: why pete gets it not fair

2026-01-15T10:58:09.706422 [root_agent]: I understand your frustration - it *is* frustrating when things don’t feel fair. 

According to the rules, only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child, even if both parents contribute to their care. HMRC prioritises the person the child lives with the most. In your situation, as Holly spends 4 days a week with Pete and 3 days with you, HMRC will likely consider Pete the primary carer and award the benefit to him.

This isn’t about who contributes more financially, but where Holly spends the majority of her time. I can share the relevant information from the government website if you'd like a link directly to the guidance on this – though I'm not permitted to *provide* the link here, I can tell you where to find it on gov.uk. Would that be helpful?





2026-01-15T10:58:13.340026 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed the user that when parents cannot agree on who claims Child Benefit, HMRC makes the determination based on who the child lives with most of the time, which in this case would be Pete (4 days vs 3 days).
