2026-01-15T10:55:54.252177 [actor]: I'll help by role-playing as an 18-year-old named Liam in this situation. Let me begin the conversation as instructed.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:55:55.136150 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?





2026-01-15T10:55:55.994661 [actor]: 18 studying a levels

2026-01-15T10:55:56.624191 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And are you currently in full-time, approved education – like A-levels?

2026-01-15T10:55:57.377103 [actor]: yes doing a levels now

2026-01-15T10:55:58.294795 [root_agent]: Great. Now, are you financially dependent on a parent or guardian, or do you receive any benefits in your own right, such as Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance?

2026-01-15T10:55:59.115738 [actor]: universal credit

2026-01-15T10:56:00.708477 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. According to the rules, Child Benefit usually stops when a young person starts getting Universal Credit in their own right. 

Just to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that the Universal Credit you are receiving is specifically for *your* personal living costs, and not as part of a household claim with your mother?

2026-01-15T10:56:01.596285 [actor]: my money living costs

2026-01-15T10:56:03.855303 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that the Universal Credit is for your personal living costs.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that you are 18, in full-time education, and receiving Universal Credit in your own right for your living costs – it appears you are **not** eligible for Child Benefit. This is because receiving Universal Credit in your own right generally cancels Child Benefit entitlement.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you'd like me to clarify anything about this?

2026-01-15T10:56:06.923558 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops when a young person starts receiving Universal Credit in their own right, which applies to Liam's situation.
