2026-01-15T10:55:02.277598 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:55:03.146464 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you assess your eligibility for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please confirm how old your child is?


2026-01-15T10:55:04.200137 [actor]: looking for child benefit for my son 5 years old

2026-01-15T10:55:05.217888 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know your son is 5 years old. That age is within the eligible range for Child Benefit.

Are you responsible for the day-to-day care of your son?





2026-01-15T10:55:05.982483 [actor]: yes i take care of him

2026-01-15T10:55:07.514279 [root_agent]: Thank you. That’s good to know. 

As you’ve recently moved to the UK, could you please tell me about your current immigration status? For example, do you have Settled or Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme, or a different type of visa?





2026-01-15T10:55:08.268240 [actor]: pre-settled status from germany

2026-01-15T10:55:09.394858 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Having Pre-Settled Status is important.

Are you currently working in the UK, or are you currently unemployed? If you are unemployed, are you actively seeking work and registered as a jobseeker?

2026-01-15T10:55:10.535007 [actor]: looking for work registered jobseeker

2026-01-15T10:55:13.250690 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are actively looking for work and registered as a jobseeker. 

Based on the information you’ve provided – that you have Pre-Settled Status, you are responsible for the care of your 5-year-old son, and you are actively seeking work as a registered jobseeker – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit.

However, to be absolutely certain, I need to double-check. Do you have comprehensive sickness insurance, or sufficient resources to support yourself and your son without relying on public funds? (This is a part of the 'right to reside' test).





2026-01-15T10:55:14.030922 [actor]: looking for work regularly

2026-01-15T10:55:15.979860 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since you are actively looking for work regularly, and haven’t indicated you have comprehensive sickness insurance or sufficient resources, it further supports the likelihood that you are eligible for Child Benefit. 

Based on everything you've told me, you appear to meet the requirements for Child Benefit as a German citizen with Pre-Settled Status who is actively seeking work.

Would you like me to summarise the key reasons why you appear eligible?





2026-01-15T10:55:16.941253 [actor]: how much money i get for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:55:19.689092 [root_agent]: I understand you’d like to know how much Child Benefit you could receive.

Currently (as of the 2024/2025 tax year), the standard weekly rate for Child Benefit is £24.00 for your first child. As your son is your first child, this would be the amount you would receive each week.

However, Child Benefit is usually paid monthly, so you would receive £96.00 each month.

It’s important to note that Child Benefit is tax-free and doesn't affect most other benefits.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit?

2026-01-15T10:55:20.538083 [actor]: when will i get the money

2026-01-15T10:55:23.002859 [root_agent]: That's a good question!

If your claim is successful, it usually takes around 16 weeks for HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) to process your application and start paying Child Benefit. They will contact you if they need any more information.

You can find more information about when to expect your first payment on the gov.uk website, but I am unable to provide links directly. Just search for "Child Benefit when will I be paid" on gov.uk.



Would you like information on how to actually *make* a claim for Child Benefit?

2026-01-15T10:55:26.514081 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Lars, with Pre-Settled Status and registered as a jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work, is eligible for Child Benefit for his 5-year-old son.
