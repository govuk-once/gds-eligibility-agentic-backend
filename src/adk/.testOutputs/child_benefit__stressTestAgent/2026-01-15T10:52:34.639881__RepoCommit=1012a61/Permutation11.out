2026-01-15T10:55:38.254614 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:55:39.174046 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T10:55:39.919810 [actor]: 44 years

2026-01-15T10:55:40.508431 [root_agent]: Thank you. And could you please tell me how old your child is?





2026-01-15T10:55:41.204146 [actor]: ryan 17

2026-01-15T10:55:41.699309 [root_agent]: Thanks! Is Ryan currently in full-time education?

2026-01-15T10:55:42.701923 [actor]: started apprenticeship recently

2026-01-15T10:55:43.419447 [root_agent]: Okay, thanks for letting me know. Could you tell me if Ryan's apprenticeship is government-funded? And is it in England?

2026-01-15T10:55:44.519421 [actor]: yes england government apprenticeship intermediate

2026-01-15T10:55:46.507846 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Just to clarify, an intermediate apprenticeship is below level 3 isn't it?



*(Internal thought process: The rules state that starting an apprenticeship in England disqualifies a child from Child Benefit, regardless of level. It's important to confirm the level to be completely sure, but the core disqualifying factor is the start of the apprenticeship itself. I need to ensure I accurately reflect this in my next communication)*

2026-01-15T10:55:47.248568 [actor]: intermediate apprenticeship level 2 yes

2026-01-15T10:55:49.315057 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. 

Based on the information you've provided – you are 44, your son Ryan is 17 and has recently started a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship (Level 2) in England – unfortunately, it seems you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. 

Starting an apprenticeship in England is a disqualifying event, even for apprenticeships at Level 2.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T10:55:51.201019 [actor]: No thank you

2026-01-15T10:55:52.529973 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed Karen that she is not eligible for Child Benefit because her son has started an apprenticeship in England, which is a disqualifying event.
