2026-01-15T10:54:03.634955 [actor]: I'll roleplay as Mary in this scenario, a mother with a daughter in a hospital long-term.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:54:04.691034 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm root_agent, and I'm here to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please confirm how old your child is?





2026-01-15T10:54:05.552191 [actor]: my daughter is 6

2026-01-15T10:54:06.968592 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful. 

Now, is your daughter currently living with you?



I'm reflecting on the information so far – a 6-year-old child meets the age requirements for Child Benefit, but the next step is to understand the living arrangements.

2026-01-15T10:54:07.852578 [actor]: she's in hospital for 14 weeks now

2026-01-15T10:54:09.049249 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. 

To clarify, are *you* responsible for your daughter’s care?



I'm noting that the child is in hospital, which may affect eligibility. I need to confirm parental responsibility as a key factor.

2026-01-15T10:54:09.962425 [actor]: yes i am her mother visit her daily

2026-01-15T10:54:11.679697 [root_agent]: That’s good to know.

Approximately how much money, if anything, do you spend each month on things for your daughter while she is in hospital – things like food, clothing, or other items she needs?



I'm thinking about the rules around children in hospital and the potential for continued eligibility if the parent is contributing to the child's upkeep.

2026-01-15T10:54:12.525536 [actor]: 30 pounds a week books pyjamas food

2026-01-15T10:54:14.085070 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's approximately £120 a month.

And just to confirm, has your daughter been in hospital continuously for more than 12 weeks?



I'm considering the 12-week rule for hospital stays and how your contributions towards your daughter’s upkeep might affect the outcome.

2026-01-15T10:54:14.823145 [actor]: yes 14 weeks now

2026-01-15T10:54:18.036923 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you *are* likely still eligible for Child Benefit.

Here’s why: Your daughter is of the correct age, you are responsible for her care, and she has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks. Importantly, you are also contributing financially to her upkeep while she’s in hospital. According to the guidelines, this continued financial support means you can continue to claim Child Benefit beyond the initial 12-week period.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. It’s always best to double-check with the official government resources to ensure complete accuracy for your specific situation.



Does this information help? Would you like me to summarise the key points for you?

2026-01-15T10:54:21.760455 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent rightly concluded that Mary remains eligible for Child Benefit despite Chloe's hospital stay exceeding 12 weeks because she regularly contributes to Chloe's upkeep (£30/week), which is an exception to the 12-week hospital rule.
