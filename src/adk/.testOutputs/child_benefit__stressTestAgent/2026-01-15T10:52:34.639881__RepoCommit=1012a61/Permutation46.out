2026-01-15T11:06:46.632090 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:06:47.458337 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you are eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, are you currently employed?


2026-01-15T11:06:48.306038 [actor]: Unemployed looking for work

2026-01-15T11:06:49.146579 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And for how long have you been unemployed and actively looking for work? Please give me a number of days if possible.





2026-01-15T11:06:49.953232 [actor]: 95 days no job offers

2026-01-15T11:06:50.696644 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, you have Pre-Settled Status in the UK, is that correct?

2026-01-15T11:06:51.374604 [actor]: Yes pre-settled status

2026-01-15T11:06:53.206007 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

According to the rules, claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status is generally time limited to 91 days. As you’ve been looking for work for 95 days and don’t have a job offer, your right to reside for benefit purposes may have expired. 

Do you have any other source of income or resources currently?

2026-01-15T11:06:54.082697 [actor]: No resources looking every day for jobs

2026-01-15T11:06:56.814175 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Unfortunately, based on the information you’ve provided – being unemployed for 95 days with Pre-Settled Status, actively seeking work *without* a job offer, and having no other resources – it appears you are likely **no longer eligible** for Child Benefit at this time.

The rules state that the jobseeker provision generally lasts for 91 days. While diligently looking for work is important, without a genuine prospect of work (like a job offer) or other financial resources, the right to reside for benefit purposes expires.

Would you like me to summarise this, or would you like to discuss this further?





2026-01-15T11:06:57.790524 [actor]: Need money for child what to do now no benefit

2026-01-15T11:07:02.140646 [root_agent]: I understand this is a very difficult situation, and I'm sorry to hear that. It's incredibly stressful when you're facing financial hardship, especially when it impacts your child.

While I cannot advise you on your specific financial situation, I can point you towards resources that may be able to help. You may want to explore options like:

* **Universal Credit:** Even if you’re not eligible for Child Benefit, you may be able to claim Universal Credit.
* **Local Council Support:** Your local council may offer support schemes for families in need. You can find their contact details online.
* **Charitable Organisations:** There are many charities that provide financial assistance and support to families. Some examples include Citizens Advice, Family Action and Barnardo's.

I am programmed to only give information regarding Child Benefit eligibility and cannot provide financial advice. However, exploring these avenues may provide some assistance during this challenging time.



Would you like me to help you find links to these resources, or would you prefer to discuss the Child Benefit eligibility criteria further?

2026-01-15T11:07:03.414400 [actor]: I understand no child benefit for me now

2026-01-15T11:07:05.993580 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that with Pre-Settled Status, the right to reside as a jobseeker for benefit purposes is limited to 91 days, and since Hans has been unemployed for 95 days without a job offer, he is no longer eligible for Child Benefit.
