2026-01-15T10:54:22.648186 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:54:23.599195 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?


2026-01-15T10:54:24.442124 [actor]: child 14 years old

2026-01-15T10:54:25.012366 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you responsible for the care of this child?

2026-01-15T10:54:26.018744 [actor]: my son jack social services have him but comes home weekends

2026-01-15T10:54:26.835661 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just to clarify, how long has your son been in the care of social services? Is it more than 8 weeks?

2026-01-15T10:54:27.647532 [actor]: 3 months now

2026-01-15T10:54:28.725044 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And when Jack comes home on the weekends, does he stay with you for at least two nights in a row at any point during those weekends? For example, does he stay Friday and Saturday night?

2026-01-15T10:54:29.658548 [actor]: yes friday night saturday night goes back sunday

2026-01-15T10:54:31.969260 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided, it sounds like you *are* likely still eligible for Child Benefit. Even though Jack is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, because he spends at least two nights in a row with you each weekend, an exception applies.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. It's always best to double-check with the official government resources to be absolutely sure. Would you like me to summarise the key points relating to your situation?

2026-01-15T10:54:33.159735 [actor]: thank you information helpful

2026-01-15T10:54:35.470092 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly applied the exception to the 8-week care rule since the child stays with the father for 2 consecutive nights each weekend.
