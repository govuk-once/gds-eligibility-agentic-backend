2026-01-15T11:01:42.057927 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:01:43.046645 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you tell me roughly how much you earn in a year before tax?

2026-01-15T11:01:43.908881 [actor]: 18000 yearly wage

2026-01-15T11:01:44.964209 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. That's helpful.

Now, does your partner have an income? If so, could you tell me roughly how much they earn in a year before tax?





2026-01-15T11:01:46.005340 [actor]: wife makes 65000

2026-01-15T11:01:46.833890 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Just to clarify, are you the person who would be filling out the Child Benefit claim form and receiving any payments?

2026-01-15T11:01:47.780816 [actor]: yes i fill form payment my account

2026-01-15T11:01:49.633781 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

Based on the information you've provided so far, your income is below the threshold for Child Benefit eligibility. However, as your wife's income is over £60,000, there's a possibility of a High Income Child Benefit Charge. 

To confirm, are you and your wife married, or in a civil partnership?





2026-01-15T11:01:50.407114 [actor]: married 2 years

2026-01-15T11:01:52.175577 [root_agent]: Thank you. 

Given that you are married and your wife earns over £60,000, you *are* eligible to claim Child Benefit, but your wife will likely need to report the amount of the benefit you receive on her Self Assessment tax return and pay a High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Do you understand this, or would you like me to explain it in more detail?





2026-01-15T11:01:53.084298 [actor]: how much tax charge

2026-01-15T11:01:56.330018 [root_agent]: Certainly. The High Income Child Benefit Charge reduces the amount of Child Benefit you receive by 1% for every £100 your partner’s income exceeds £60,000. 

So, as your wife earns £65,000, that's £5,000 over the threshold. Therefore, the charge would be 5% of the total Child Benefit amount you receive per year.

For the current tax year (2024/2025), the full amount of Child Benefit is £21.80 per week for the eldest child and £14.45 per week for each additional child. 

Would you like me to calculate an estimate of the tax charge based on the number of children you have?

2026-01-15T11:01:57.410707 [actor]: yes one child

2026-01-15T11:02:00.025100 [root_agent]: Okay. For one child, the full weekly Child Benefit amount is £21.80. Over a year, that totals £1133.60.

The High Income Child Benefit Charge would be 5% of that amount, which is £56.68. 

Therefore, your wife would need to pay £56.68 in tax charge for the year. You would still receive the full Child Benefit payments, but it’s important your wife includes this information in her Self Assessment tax return.

Does that make sense? Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit?

2026-01-15T11:02:04.500417 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent made a calculation error - with a partner earning £65,000 (£5,000 over the threshold), the High Income Child Benefit Charge would be 100%, not 5%, as it's a 1% reduction for every £100 over £50,000, reaching 100% at £60,000+.
