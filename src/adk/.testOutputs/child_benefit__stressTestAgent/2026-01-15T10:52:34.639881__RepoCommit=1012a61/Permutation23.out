2026-01-15T10:59:23.461433 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:59:24.298399 [root_agent]: Okay, let's assess your potential eligibility for Child Benefit. 

To start, are you the parent or legal guardian of the child in question?


2026-01-15T10:59:25.234407 [actor]: have daughter Sarah 12 years old

2026-01-15T10:59:26.075164 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you have a daughter, Sarah, who is 12 years old.

Do you live with Sarah?

2026-01-15T10:59:26.732464 [actor]: don't live with sarah

2026-01-15T10:59:27.601709 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you don't live with Sarah.

Do you contribute financially towards the upkeep of Sarah?

2026-01-15T10:59:28.446874 [actor]: buy groceries clothes £120 every 4 weeks

2026-01-15T10:59:29.872036 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You mentioned you buy groceries and clothes for Sarah costing £120 every 4 weeks. 

Just to clarify, is this the *only* financial contribution you make towards Sarah’s upbringing? Or are there any other payments or contributions you make, even occasionally?

2026-01-15T10:59:30.702673 [actor]: deliver groceries clothes to her mother

2026-01-15T10:59:32.032515 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you deliver the groceries and clothes to Sarah's mother.

To confirm my understanding, the £120 you spend every 4 weeks on groceries and clothes for Sarah is given *to* her mother, and not directly to Sarah herself?

2026-01-15T10:59:32.891666 [actor]: deliver to mother for sarah

2026-01-15T10:59:34.473707 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that the groceries and clothes are delivered to Sarah’s mother, for Sarah’s use.

Considering you don’t live with Sarah and contribute £120 every 4 weeks towards her expenses, do you have a formal agreement - like a Child Maintenance Arrangement - in place with Sarah’s mother?

2026-01-15T10:59:35.283886 [actor]: no formal arrangement buy things deliver

2026-01-15T10:59:36.524082 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming there is no formal Child Maintenance Arrangement.

Just to be absolutely certain, you are contributing £120 every four weeks *without* a formal agreement, and this contribution is specifically for Sarah’s groceries and clothes? Is that correct?

2026-01-15T10:59:37.699510 [actor]: yes 120 pounds for sarah every 4 weeks

2026-01-15T10:59:40.385420 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. 

Based on the information you’ve provided - that you don’t live with Sarah, you contribute £120 every four weeks towards her groceries and clothes, and there’s no formal maintenance agreement - it appears you *may* be eligible to claim Child Benefit. This is because contributions don’t need to be weekly, and £120 over four weeks exceeds the weekly Child Benefit rate.

However, to be absolutely sure, could you confirm Sarah’s mother is also *not* claiming Child Benefit for Sarah? It's possible only one of you can claim.

2026-01-15T10:59:41.242259 [actor]: don't know if mother claims

2026-01-15T10:59:42.631986 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for your honesty. That's an important piece of information.

To determine your eligibility, we need to know if Sarah’s mother is claiming Child Benefit for her. Would you be willing to ask her and let me know? This is crucial to avoid any overpayment issues.

2026-01-15T10:59:43.444300 [actor]: can i claim child benefit

2026-01-15T10:59:46.131461 [root_agent]: You asked if you can claim Child Benefit.

Based on the information you’ve shared so far – that you don’t live with Sarah, contribute £120 every four weeks towards her expenses, there’s no formal maintenance arrangement, and you are unsure if her mother claims – it *could* be possible. However, we absolutely need to confirm whether Sarah’s mother is already claiming Child Benefit. 

If she *is* claiming, you won't be eligible. If she isn’t, you likely are.

Would you like me to summarise the key points so far, or would you prefer I ask a different question?

2026-01-15T10:59:48.193239 [actor]: I need to know if eligible

2026-01-15T10:59:50.068989 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent suggested Kevin might be eligible for Child Benefit when he's not eligible because a person who does not live with the child must contribute at least the weekly Child Benefit rate specifically toward "child maintenance", not just buying groceries and clothes.
