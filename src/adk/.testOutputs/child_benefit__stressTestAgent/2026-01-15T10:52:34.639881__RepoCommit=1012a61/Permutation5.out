2026-01-15T10:53:36.686636 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:53:37.668734 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are interested in claiming for?

2026-01-15T10:53:38.704868 [actor]: lucas 10 years old

2026-01-15T10:53:39.596535 [root_agent]: Thank you. Lucas is 10, which is under the eligible age.

Now, could you please tell me, does Lucas live with you?

2026-01-15T10:53:40.465357 [actor]: lives with jenny ex-wife

2026-01-15T10:53:41.266375 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know Lucas lives with his mother, your ex-wife, Jenny.

Does Jenny currently claim Child Benefit for Lucas?

2026-01-15T10:53:42.017565 [actor]: jenny no claim child benefit

2026-01-15T10:53:43.079847 [root_agent]: That's good to know. 

To help me understand your situation a little better, do you contribute financially towards Lucas’s upbringing? If so, approximately how much do you contribute each month?

2026-01-15T10:53:43.869106 [actor]: £150 monthly food clothes

2026-01-15T10:53:44.799502 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. £150 per month towards Lucas’s food and clothes is helpful to know.

Just to confirm, are you Lucas’s parent?

2026-01-15T10:53:45.539003 [actor]: lucas father

2026-01-15T10:53:47.583003 [root_agent]: Okay, great. So you are Lucas’s father.

Based on the information you’ve provided so far, it seems you *might* be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas, even though he lives with his mother and she isn't claiming. However, I need to be certain I have all the correct information.

Are you currently responsible for Lucas, even though he lives with his mother? This isn’t about contact, but about financial responsibility and care.

2026-01-15T10:53:48.528602 [actor]: pay £150 monthly for lucas

2026-01-15T10:53:49.726238 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you provide £150 monthly for Lucas. That contribution is helpful information.

To be absolutely sure, are you the only person contributing financially towards Lucas, aside from his mother? Or does anyone else provide financial support?

2026-01-15T10:53:50.538731 [actor]: only me and jenny

2026-01-15T10:53:52.858433 [root_agent]: Okay, so it’s just you and Jenny contributing financially to Lucas’s needs.

Given everything you’ve told me – Lucas is 10, lives with his mother Jenny who doesn’t claim Child Benefit, and you contribute £150 per month towards his expenses – it appears you *are* likely eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas. 

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. Would you like me to summarise the key points that suggest your eligibility, based on the information you’ve given me?

2026-01-15T10:53:53.688999 [actor]: yes tell me eligibility

2026-01-15T10:53:58.090129 [root_agent]: Certainly. Here’s a summary of why you appear eligible for Child Benefit for Lucas, based on the information you’ve provided:

* **Lucas’s Age:** He is 10 years old, which is within the eligible age range.
* **Living Arrangements:** Lucas lives with his mother, Jenny, but she does not claim Child Benefit.
* **Financial Contribution:** You contribute £150 per month towards Lucas’s expenses, which exceeds the current weekly Child Benefit rate. This demonstrates financial responsibility for the child.
* **Parental Responsibility:** You confirmed you are Lucas's father.
* **No Concurrent Claim:** Jenny is not currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucas.

Because of these factors, you meet the criteria to potentially claim Child Benefit, even though Lucas doesn’t live with you.

Remember, I’m an AI and this isn’t a guarantee. For a definitive answer, you may want to double-check the official government guidance or contact HMRC directly. Would you like me to reiterate any of these points or clarify anything further?

2026-01-15T10:54:02.086565 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Mark is eligible for Child Benefit because he contributes more than the Child Benefit amount to Lucas's upkeep (£150 > £113/month), Lucas is of eligible age (10), and no one else is currently claiming.
