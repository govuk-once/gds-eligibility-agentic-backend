2026-01-15T10:56:08.434057 [actor]: I'll help roleplay as Ali or Zara in this adoption scenario. Based on the information provided, I'll start the conversation with the agent under test using exactly the initial query requested.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:56:09.306880 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please confirm how old you are?

2026-01-15T10:56:10.156537 [actor]: 35

2026-01-15T10:56:10.686165 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is the child you are considering claiming for?

2026-01-15T10:56:11.586152 [actor]: maya 4 years

2026-01-15T10:56:12.101477 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Is Maya living with you?

2026-01-15T10:56:13.036102 [actor]: yes lives with us now

2026-01-15T10:56:13.845631 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming. Are you Maya’s biological parent? Or are you caring for her under other arrangements, such as adoption?

2026-01-15T10:56:14.800355 [actor]: adoption process not final yet placement

2026-01-15T10:56:16.155266 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Maya has been placed with you for adoption, but the final adoption order hasn’t been granted by the court yet.

Just to be clear, are *you* responsible for Maya? (Meaning you are providing her care and are meeting her needs).

2026-01-15T10:56:17.036687 [actor]: yes responsible care provide everything

2026-01-15T10:56:19.315921 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided – that Maya is living with you, you are responsible for her care, and she is placed with you for adoption even though the adoption order isn’t final – it sounds like you *are* eligible for Child Benefit.

You can claim as soon as a child is placed with you for adoption, you don’t need to wait for the final order to be granted. 

Would you like me to explain anything further, or perhaps discuss how to make a claim?

2026-01-15T10:56:22.443663 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility because they accurately informed me that I can claim Child Benefit for a child placed with me for adoption even before the final order is granted.
