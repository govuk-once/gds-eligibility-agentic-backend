2026-01-15T11:06:11.234388 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:06:12.354152 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand. Hello! I'm here to help you understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, are you the parent or legal guardian of the child you are claiming for?


2026-01-15T11:06:13.056360 [actor]: parent leo

2026-01-15T11:06:13.657703 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying.

Now, is Leo currently living with you?

2026-01-15T11:06:14.371301 [actor]: comes home saturdays

2026-01-15T11:06:15.782233 [root_agent]: Okay, so Leo comes home to stay with you on Saturdays. 

To clarify, how long does Leo stay with you each week, starting from when he arrives on Saturday to when he leaves? Please give me a specific time frame (e.g., Saturday 10am to Sunday 2pm).

2026-01-15T11:06:16.778020 [actor]: saturday 10am sunday 11am

2026-01-15T11:06:18.107504 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Leo is with you from 10am on Saturday until 11am on Sunday - that's 25 hours.

Is Leo in full-time care, such as being in a foster home or with a local authority?

2026-01-15T11:06:18.848094 [actor]: local authority care

2026-01-15T11:06:19.481448 [root_agent]: Thank you. And has Leo been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks?

2026-01-15T11:06:20.216617 [actor]: yes

2026-01-15T11:06:23.382719 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

Based on the information you've provided – Leo is your child, he is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, and he spends 25 hours with you each week – it appears you *may* be eligible for Child Benefit. 

However, to be absolutely certain, I need to double-check one detail. Even though he doesn’t stay for two full nights, the rules state eligibility if a child spends “at least 24 hours a week” with a parent. Since he spends 25 hours with you, this condition is met.

Are you currently receiving any other benefits for Leo? (This won’t affect eligibility, but it's good to know for a complete picture).

2026-01-15T11:06:24.053064 [actor]: no benefits

2026-01-15T11:06:26.738404 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know.

Based on all the information you've provided – Leo is your child, he is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, he spends 25 hours with you each week, and you are not currently receiving other benefits for him – it seems you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit.

However, I must state that I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. To be completely sure and to make a claim, you should visit the gov.uk website for Child Benefit. Would you like me to summarise the key points we’ve discussed?

2026-01-15T11:06:30.504362 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly recognized that since Leo spends 25 hours per week at home (exceeding the minimum 24 hours requirement), the parent is eligible for Child Benefit despite Leo being in local authority care for more than 8 weeks.
