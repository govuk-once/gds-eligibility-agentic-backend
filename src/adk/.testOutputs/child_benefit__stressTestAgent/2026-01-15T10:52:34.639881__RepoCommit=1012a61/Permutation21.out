2026-01-15T10:58:36.907136 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:58:37.834929 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, are you responsible for the care of any children?

2026-01-15T10:58:38.854733 [actor]: children yes sam 10 ella 8 divorced

2026-01-15T10:58:40.140670 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. So you have two children, Sam who is 10 and Ella who is 8, and you are divorced. 

Just to clarify, do Sam and Ella live with you, or do they live primarily with someone else?





2026-01-15T10:58:41.039246 [actor]: sam lives with me ella with ex-spouse

2026-01-15T10:58:41.966929 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that Sam lives with you and Ella lives with your ex-spouse.

To help me understand your situation fully, are you currently claiming Child Benefit for Sam?

2026-01-15T10:58:43.069427 [actor]: not claiming yet want to apply

2026-01-15T10:58:44.240050 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. You haven't claimed yet, but are looking to apply.

Considering you are newly separated and your children live in separate households, do you know if your ex-spouse is also planning to claim Child Benefit for Ella?





2026-01-15T10:58:45.087902 [actor]: ex spouse claiming ella

2026-01-15T10:58:46.629292 [root_agent]: Okay, so your ex-spouse is claiming for Ella. That’s good to know.

Given that you are claiming for Sam, and your ex-spouse is claiming for Ella, are you aware that you may both be entitled to claim the full 'eldest child' rate of Child Benefit for the child who lives with each of you?

2026-01-15T10:58:47.433758 [actor]: no didnt know that

2026-01-15T10:58:49.316078 [root_agent]: That’s perfectly alright – it’s a detail that isn’t always immediately obvious! 

The rules state that when parents are separated and children live with each of them, each parent can claim the full ‘eldest child’ rate (£26.05 per week) for the child they live with, even though the other child is older overall.

To confirm, is Sam the oldest child in *your* household?

2026-01-15T10:58:50.073717 [actor]: yes only sam with me

2026-01-15T10:58:51.778298 [root_agent]: Excellent. As Sam is the only child living with you, and you are responsible for his care, you should be eligible to claim the full 'eldest child' rate of Child Benefit for him.

To be absolutely sure, and to help me check everything is correct, what is your date of birth? (You can just provide the day and month if you prefer).

2026-01-15T10:58:52.743555 [actor]: january 12th

2026-01-15T10:58:53.290053 [root_agent]: Thank you. And just to confirm, are you a UK resident?

2026-01-15T10:58:53.995254 [actor]: yes uk london

2026-01-15T10:58:55.264747 [root_agent]: Great. And finally, to assess eligibility, could you tell me if you are undertaking 20 hours or more of approved educational courses per week? This includes things like A-Levels, or certain college courses. (Don't worry if you aren't!)

2026-01-15T10:58:56.229088 [actor]: no working full time

2026-01-15T10:58:59.167175 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that you are working full time and not undertaking 20 hours or more of education.

Based on everything you’ve told me: you are responsible for Sam (age 10) who lives with you, you are divorced with your ex-spouse claiming for Ella (age 8), you were born on January 12th, you are a UK resident living in London, and you work full-time. 

It appears you *are* eligible to claim Child Benefit at the full ‘eldest child’ rate for Sam.

Would you like me to summarise the key points, or would you like to know where you can start the application process?

2026-01-15T10:59:01.374860 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know. I'll claim child benefit for Sam. Where to apply?

2026-01-15T10:59:03.182069 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed that since the children are living separately, each parent can claim the full 'eldest child' rate for the child in their care.
