2026-01-16T16:25:44.489307 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To properly assess this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:25:45.278156 [actor]: I have my son Ryan. 17 years old.

2026-01-16T16:25:46.376143 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. You have a 17-year-old son named Ryan living with you.

Is Ryan currently in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:25:47.202842 [actor]: Just started apprenticeship. Not school anymore.

2026-01-16T16:25:48.848986 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Is your son's apprenticeship considered an approved training program? Approved training typically includes Foundation Apprenticeships, paid apprenticeships, or training programs approved by the government for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-16T16:25:49.801089 [actor]: Government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England. Lives at home.

2026-01-16T16:25:52.246888 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, your situation is promising for Child Benefit eligibility since your 17-year-old son Ryan:
- Lives with you
- Is on a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England, which would typically count as approved training

May I ask about your income? Specifically, do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-16T16:25:53.640205 [actor]: I'm 44. Single mum. Work part-time shop assistant.

2026-01-16T16:25:58.211087 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

As a single parent working part-time as a shop assistant, it sounds like your income is likely below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold (which starts to affect those with individual incomes over £50,000).

Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit because:
1. Your 17-year-old son Ryan lives with you
2. He is in approved training (government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship)
3. As a single parent with part-time employment, your income appears to be below the threshold that would reduce or eliminate the benefit

You should be eligible to receive Child Benefit payments until Ryan turns 19 or completes his current course of approved training, whichever comes first.

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to complete and submit form CH2 if you haven't already claimed. If you're already receiving it, it should continue while Ryan remains in his apprenticeship.

2026-01-16T16:26:00.959649 [actor]: I need to correct something important here. Based on UK government rules, an apprenticeship in England is actually considered a disqualifying event for Child Benefit. While approved education (like A-levels) would allow continued Child Benefit, apprenticeships in England are treated differently - they're considered employment rather than education for Child Benefit purposes.

So unfortunately, since Ryan has left school and started an Intermediate Apprenticeship in England, you would no longer be eligible for Child Benefit.

2026-01-16T16:26:03.128068 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent gave incorrect information by stating an apprenticeship qualifies for Child Benefit, when UK government rules clearly indicate apprenticeships in England are considered employment, not approved education or training, making the parent ineligible.
