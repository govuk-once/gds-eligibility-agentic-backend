2026-01-16T16:25:28.516199 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:25:29.434384 [actor]: foster child

2026-01-16T16:25:30.323232 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify, are you a foster carer for a child?

2026-01-16T16:25:31.106462 [actor]: yes Liam 12

2026-01-16T16:25:32.236628 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you're a foster carer for Liam, who is 12 years old. 

Is Liam placed with you by a local authority or health and social services trust?

2026-01-16T16:25:32.914997 [actor]: local council

2026-01-16T16:25:35.817438 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Liam is placed with you by the local council.

Based on the information you've provided, you would not typically be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam. When a child is placed with foster parents by a local authority (council), the foster parents cannot claim Child Benefit for that child. This is because foster carers receive foster care allowances from the local authority instead.

The local authority that placed Liam with you should be providing you with a foster care allowance to help with the costs of caring for him.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation or about other potential benefits you might be eligible for?

2026-01-16T16:25:36.523383 [actor]: fostering allowance council pays

2026-01-16T16:25:39.867648 [root_agent]: That's correct. As a foster carer for Liam who was placed with you by the local council, you receive fostering allowances from the council rather than Child Benefit.

The fostering allowance is designed to cover the costs of caring for Liam, including day-to-day expenses like food, clothing, and other needs. The amount typically varies depending on factors like the child's age and any specific needs they might have.

This fostering allowance system is separate from the Child Benefit system, which is why foster carers generally cannot claim Child Benefit for children placed with them by local authorities.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about the fostering allowance or other support that might be available to you as a foster carer?

2026-01-16T16:25:43.294489 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed that foster carers are not eligible for Child Benefit for children placed with them by a local authority, as they receive foster care allowances instead.
