2026-01-16T16:39:35.996332 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your situation properly, I need to ask you a few questions.

First, do you have any children living with you that you're responsible for?

2026-01-16T16:39:37.278381 [actor]: I need to play the role of a UK resident asking about child benefit eligibility in a specific scenario. Let me respond in character as described.

my son local authority care visits weekends

2026-01-16T16:39:38.837099 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand your son is in local authority care but visits you on weekends. This is an important factor in determining your Child Benefit eligibility.

Could you please tell me if the local authority care arrangement is voluntary or if it's through a care order?

2026-01-16T16:39:39.716001 [actor]: care order long time now visits saturdays

2026-01-16T16:39:42.725135 [root_agent]: I understand that your son is under a care order and has been for a long time, with visits to you on Saturdays.

Based on the rules for Child Benefit eligibility, when a child is in care under a care order, the local authority usually receives the Child Benefit payment rather than the parent. However, since your child regularly visits you on Saturdays, you might be eligible for what's called "shared care" payments.

When a child spends regular periods with you (like regular weekend visits), you may be able to receive a weekly payment of Child Benefit for these periods. The payment is calculated based on the number of days your child stays with you.

May I ask, how many nights per week does your son typically stay with you?

2026-01-16T16:39:43.758626 [actor]: saturday nights only comes 10 morning goes sunday 11

2026-01-16T16:39:47.366568 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your son stays with you overnight on Saturdays, arriving at 10 in the morning and leaving at 11 on Sunday.

Based on the UK government's Child Benefit rules for children in care, you may be eligible for some Child Benefit payment under the "shared care" arrangement since your son regularly stays with you one night per week. 

The amount you could receive would be calculated according to the number of nights your child stays with you, which in your case is one night per week. This would be a portion of the full Child Benefit amount.

To claim this payment, you would need to contact the Child Benefit Office and explain your specific circumstances regarding the care arrangement and your regular visits.

Would you like me to ask any additional questions to help clarify your eligibility further?

2026-01-16T16:39:48.617555 [actor]: so am I eligible for child benefit?

2026-01-16T16:39:50.850603 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that when a child is under a care order but has regular overnight visits, the parent may be eligible for a partial "shared care" Child Benefit payment based on the number of nights the child stays with them.
