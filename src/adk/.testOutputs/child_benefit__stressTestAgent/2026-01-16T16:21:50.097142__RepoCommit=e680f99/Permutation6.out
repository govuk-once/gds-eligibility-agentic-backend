2026-01-16T16:23:51.546951 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To make this assessment, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First question: Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:23:52.473862 [actor]: child daughter in hospital long time

2026-01-16T16:23:54.606951 [root_agent]: I understand that your child daughter is in hospital for a long time. Thank you for sharing that information.

To help determine your Child Benefit eligibility in this situation, may I ask: Are you still regarded as responsible for your daughter despite her being in hospital? (This typically means you're the person who would normally care for her when she's not in hospital.)

2026-01-16T16:23:55.370998 [actor]: chloe 6 years daughter hospital 14 weeks

2026-01-16T16:23:57.216887 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand your daughter Chloe is 6 years old and has been in hospital for 14 weeks.

If your child is in hospital, you can usually still get Child Benefit as long as you were eligible before they went into hospital and you still have responsibility for them.

May I ask if you were claiming Child Benefit for Chloe before she went into hospital?

2026-01-16T16:23:58.030520 [actor]: just want to know if eligible daughter hospital

2026-01-16T16:24:01.030050 [root_agent]: I understand you want to know if you're eligible for Child Benefit while your daughter is in the hospital.

Based on the UK government guidelines, you can generally continue to receive Child Benefit for a child who is in hospital, as long as you're still responsible for them. Hospital stays, even extended ones, don't typically affect your eligibility.

Since Chloe is 6 years old and you appear to be her parent/guardian, you would likely be eligible for Child Benefit, assuming you meet other standard criteria (such as living in the UK and having the right to reside).

Would you like me to ask about any other specific aspects of Child Benefit eligibility that you're concerned about?

2026-01-16T16:24:01.873100 [actor]: visit hospital every day spend money on her books clothes food

2026-01-16T16:24:05.325499 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. The fact that you visit your daughter in the hospital every day and provide her with books, clothes, and food clearly demonstrates that you're maintaining your parental responsibility for her.

This regular involvement and financial support strengthens your Child Benefit eligibility case. The UK government recognizes that parents of hospitalized children continue to incur expenses related to their child's care and wellbeing, which is why Child Benefit typically continues during hospital stays.

Based on what you've shared, you would be eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter even while she's in the hospital, as you're clearly maintaining your parental responsibilities and financial support for her.

Is there anything specific about the application process or payment details you'd like to know about?

2026-01-16T16:24:08.446248 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately stated that the user would be eligible for Child Benefit while their daughter is in hospital, as they continue to be responsible for the child and provide support through regular visits and purchasing necessities.
