2026-01-16T16:36:07.289827 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-16T16:36:08.088917 [actor]: rashid lives here with wife

2026-01-16T16:36:09.563207 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. To clarify about your situation specifically, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-16T16:36:10.529249 [actor]: son rashid 17 years old still school

2026-01-16T16:36:12.378534 [root_agent]: I understand that you have a son named Rashid who is 17 years old and still in school. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to confirm: are you responsible for Rashid? That means you're providing for his care and paying for things like food, clothing, or accommodation.

2026-01-16T16:36:13.245139 [actor]: yes feed him clothe him live my house with wife

2026-01-16T16:36:14.783196 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are responsible for your son Rashid, who lives with you.

To continue assessing your Child Benefit eligibility, is Rashid in approved education or training? This generally includes school, college, or certain types of training programs.

2026-01-16T16:36:15.454153 [actor]: a levels college

2026-01-16T16:36:16.664783 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Rashid is studying A levels at college.

Is Rashid under 20 years old? (I know you mentioned he's 17, but I just want to confirm this information)

2026-01-16T16:36:17.348758 [actor]: seventeen years old birthday december

2026-01-16T16:36:18.368224 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Rashid is 17 years old.

Now, regarding your residency status, do you live in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:36:19.039025 [actor]: uk yes bradford

2026-01-16T16:36:20.334192 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in Bradford in the UK.

Do you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-16T16:36:21.390275 [actor]: no money problems

2026-01-16T16:36:23.630612 [root_agent]: I understand that you mentioned "no money problems," but to assess your Child Benefit eligibility properly, I need to know more specifically about income levels. 

Does either you or your partner (if applicable) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-16T16:36:24.429278 [actor]: no not rich normal job

2026-01-16T16:36:27.442039 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that about your income situation.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you are likely eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You are responsible for Rashid, who is 17 years old
2. Rashid lives with you
3. Rashid is in approved education (A levels at college)
4. You live in the UK (Bradford)
5. Neither you nor your partner has an individual income over £60,000 per year

You can claim Child Benefit for Rashid until he turns 20, as long as he continues to be in approved education or training. 

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit?
