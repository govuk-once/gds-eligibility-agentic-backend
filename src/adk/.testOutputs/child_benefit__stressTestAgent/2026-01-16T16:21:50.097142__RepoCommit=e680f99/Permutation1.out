2026-01-16T16:21:51.603976 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. I'll need to ask you several questions to assess this properly.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:21:52.751439 [actor]: I need to answer about my child benefit eligibility.

My son Leo lives with us. He's 8 years old. Child benefit question.

2026-01-16T16:21:54.500021 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I understand that your son Leo, who is 8 years old, lives with you.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask if you are responsible for Leo's care? By this, I mean are you the person who has the main responsibility for looking after him?

2026-01-16T16:21:55.332098 [actor]: Yes me and my husband take care of Leo. UK citizens Manchester area.

2026-01-16T16:21:57.152223 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that both you and your husband are responsible for caring for Leo, and you're UK citizens living in the Manchester area.

Is either you or your husband earning over £50,000 per year individually? This is important for determining if the High Income Child Benefit Charge might apply to your situation.

2026-01-16T16:21:58.200779 [actor]: Husband teacher £35,000 I work part-time £15,000

2026-01-16T16:22:00.261364 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared, since neither you nor your husband earn over £50,000 individually (your husband earns £35,000 and you earn £15,000 part-time), you wouldn't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Is Leo attending full-time non-advanced education (like school) or approved training?

2026-01-16T16:22:01.069396 [actor]: Primary school normal classes

2026-01-16T16:22:02.178103 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Leo attends normal classes at primary school.

Is Leo a UK resident? And are you and your husband also UK residents?

2026-01-16T16:22:03.272115 [actor]: Born here all UK citizens

2026-01-16T16:22:07.274609 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Leo was born in the UK and you're all UK citizens and residents, that meets the residency requirements.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit for your son Leo because:

1. Leo is under 16 years old (he's 8)
2. Leo lives with you and your husband, and you are responsible for his care
3. Leo is in full-time education (primary school)
4. You are all UK residents
5. Neither you nor your husband earn above the £50,000 threshold that would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge

This means you should be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit payment without any tax charge. If you haven't already applied, you can do so using the Child Benefit claim form CH2.

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:22:09.072804 [actor]: Thanks that answers my question about eligibility.

2026-01-16T16:22:10.724133 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information based on the facts given: the child is under 16, lives with the parents who care for him, attends school, all are UK residents, and neither parent earns over £50,000.
