2026-01-16T16:24:09.905663 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you that you're responsible for?

2026-01-16T16:24:11.830129 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. To clarify, is the child primarily living in care, but visits you on weekends?

2026-01-16T16:24:12.666683 [actor]: son jack care 3 months weekend stays friday sunday

2026-01-16T16:24:15.819359 [root_agent]: I understand that your son Jack is in care and has been for 3 months, but stays with you on weekends from Friday to Sunday.

Based on this information, I need to consider the specific rules about Child Benefit when a child is in care.

For a child who is being looked after by a local authority (in care), Child Benefit can still be paid to the parent if the child regularly spends at least 2 nights a week with them. Since Jack stays with you from Friday to Sunday (which would typically be 2 nights), you may still be eligible to receive Child Benefit.

May I ask if you're still maintaining regular contact with Jack during the weeks as well?

2026-01-16T16:24:16.629449 [actor]: friday evening to sunday evening every weekend

2026-01-16T16:24:18.916283 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since Jack stays with you from Friday evening to Sunday evening every weekend, that's consistently 2 nights per week.

According to the Child Benefit rules for children in care, you can still get Child Benefit if your child regularly spends at least 2 nights a week with you. Since Jack meets this requirement by staying with you every weekend for 2 nights, you should be eligible for Child Benefit.

However, I should ask: Has the local authority or care provider informed you about any specific arrangements regarding benefits for Jack while he's in care?

2026-01-16T16:24:19.674803 [actor]: no information benefits care home

2026-01-16T16:24:23.361784 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, since Jack stays with you regularly for 2 nights every weekend (Friday evening to Sunday evening), you should be eligible to receive Child Benefit even though he's in care the rest of the time. 

The rules state that if a child in care regularly spends at least 2 nights a week with a parent or guardian, that person can still claim Child Benefit. Your weekend arrangement meets this requirement.

I would recommend that you apply for Child Benefit if you haven't already done so, or contact the Child Benefit Office if you were receiving it before Jack went into care to ensure your claim continues correctly.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit or who to contact about your specific situation?

2026-01-16T16:24:26.769524 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that the user is eligible for Child Benefit since their child in care stays with them regularly for 2 nights every weekend, which meets the requirement for continued eligibility.
