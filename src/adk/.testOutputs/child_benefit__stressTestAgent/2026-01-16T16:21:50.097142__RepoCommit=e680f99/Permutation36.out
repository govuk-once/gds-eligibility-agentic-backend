2026-01-16T16:36:32.789630 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. Let me ask you questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:36:33.550223 [actor]: Kelly sixteen summer break

2026-01-16T16:36:35.607251 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. To clarify about Kelly who is sixteen and on summer break - I'll need to ask some specific questions about your situation to determine Child Benefit eligibility.

Is Kelly in approved education or training? For Child Benefit purposes, approved education typically includes A-levels, NVQs, or other courses that qualify.

2026-01-16T16:36:36.628836 [actor]: finished GCSEs college September

2026-01-16T16:36:39.138192 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Kelly has finished her GCSEs and will be starting college in September.

For Child Benefit eligibility, this transition period is important. Since Kelly is 16 and has finished her GCSEs, you can continue to receive Child Benefit during this summer break if Kelly will be starting approved education or training in September.

May I ask if Kelly has been accepted into or enrolled in the college course that will begin in September?

2026-01-16T16:36:39.809014 [actor]: Yes accepted A levels

2026-01-16T16:36:41.711736 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Kelly has been accepted to study A levels starting in September.

This is good news for your Child Benefit eligibility. Since Kelly is 16, has finished GCSEs, and has been accepted to study A levels (which is approved education) starting in September, you should remain eligible for Child Benefit during this summer break and while she continues her A level studies.

Is Kelly living with you most of the time?

2026-01-16T16:36:42.912299 [actor]: at home with me

2026-01-16T16:36:45.569111 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Kelly lives at home with you. This is another important eligibility factor.

Since Kelly:
- Is 16 years old
- Has finished her GCSEs
- Has been accepted to study A levels (approved education) starting in September
- Lives at home with you

You should remain eligible for Child Benefit during this summer break and while she continues her A level education (up to age 20).

One more question - is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Kelly?

2026-01-16T16:36:46.311174 [actor]: no one else claiming

2026-01-16T16:36:49.016354 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Kelly.

Based on all the information you've provided, you are eligible for Child Benefit for Kelly because:

1. Kelly is 16 years old
2. She has finished her GCSEs and has been accepted to study A levels (which is approved education) starting in September
3. She lives with you at home
4. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

You should continue to receive Child Benefit during this summer break period and while Kelly continues her A level studies, potentially up to age 20 if she remains in approved education.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-16T16:36:52.000796 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately stated that Child Benefit continues during the summer break for a 16-year-old who has completed GCSEs and is enrolled to start A levels in September.
