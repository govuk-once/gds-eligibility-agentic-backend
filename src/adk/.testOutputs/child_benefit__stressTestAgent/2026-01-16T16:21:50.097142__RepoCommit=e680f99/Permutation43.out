2026-01-16T16:39:22.879530 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine Child Benefit eligibility for your 17-year-old son in Glasgow.

Is your son living with you?

2026-01-16T16:39:23.440360 [actor]: lives with father Glasgow

2026-01-16T16:39:25.144309 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Is your son currently in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:39:25.823498 [actor]: modern apprenticeship started

2026-01-16T16:39:27.042706 [root_agent]: I see that your son is on a modern apprenticeship. 

To confirm, is this a paid apprenticeship where your son is receiving a wage?

2026-01-16T16:39:27.763302 [actor]: yes paid apprenticeship getting wage

2026-01-16T16:39:31.391553 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on the UK government's Child Benefit eligibility rules, you may not be eligible for Child Benefit for your 17-year-old son if he is on a paid apprenticeship where he's receiving a wage.

Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. However, paid apprenticeships where the young person receives a wage are generally not considered approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

If your son's apprenticeship pays a wage that counts as "advanced education" rather than "non-advanced education," then Child Benefit would not be payable.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other potential support that might be available?

2026-01-16T16:39:32.439787 [actor]: I understand now not eligible for child benefit

2026-01-16T16:39:34.484894 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed the user that they are not eligible for Child Benefit because their 17-year-old son is on a paid apprenticeship receiving a wage, which is not considered approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.
