2026-01-16T16:28:38.949126 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your eligibility properly.

First question: Do you have any children who live with you?

2026-01-16T16:28:41.529294 [root_agent]: Thank you for the additional context. Let me continue with questions to determine your eligibility for Child Benefit regarding your 19-year-old son who is a student.

Is your son in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs, or other approved courses.

2026-01-16T16:28:42.206475 [actor]: son a levels full time

2026-01-16T16:28:43.417129 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is your son under 20 years old? (I understand he's 19, but I just want to confirm this explicitly.)

2026-01-16T16:28:44.134413 [actor]: birthday next month turns 20

2026-01-16T16:28:47.733991 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is an important detail.

When your son turns 20 next month, Child Benefit will stop. Child Benefit can be paid for children in approved education (like A-levels) until they turn 20.

Once your son reaches his 20th birthday, he will no longer qualify for Child Benefit, even if he continues his A-level studies.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your current eligibility until his birthday or about the process when payments will stop?

2026-01-16T16:28:48.559570 [actor]: so eligible until birthday

2026-01-16T16:28:51.937896 [root_agent]: That's correct. Based on the information you've provided:

- You are eligible to receive Child Benefit for your 19-year-old son until he turns 20 next month
- This is because he is under 20 years old and in approved full-time education (A-levels)
- The payments will automatically stop when he reaches his 20th birthday

If you're currently receiving Child Benefit, you don't need to do anything - the payments will stop automatically when he turns 20. If you're applying for the first time, you should do so as soon as possible to receive the benefit for the remaining time before his birthday.

Is there anything specific about the payment schedule or the stopping process you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-16T16:28:53.990495 [actor]: I already get money now. What happens after birthday?

2026-01-16T16:28:55.367069 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is payable for children in approved education until they turn 20, and that eligibility continues until the child's 20th birthday next month.
