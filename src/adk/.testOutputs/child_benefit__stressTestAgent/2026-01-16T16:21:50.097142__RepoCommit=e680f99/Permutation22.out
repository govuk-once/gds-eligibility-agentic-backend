2026-01-16T16:30:19.628099 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility based on UK government rules.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:30:20.460573 [actor]: child benefit my son hospital

2026-01-16T16:30:21.545129 [root_agent]: I understand your situation involves your son who is in the hospital. This is important information for determining Child Benefit eligibility.

Could you tell me how old your son is?

2026-01-16T16:30:22.395792 [actor]: arthur 7 hospital

2026-01-16T16:30:23.745475 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that your son Arthur is 7 years old and in the hospital. This information helps with assessing your Child Benefit eligibility.

May I ask how long Arthur has been in the hospital?

2026-01-16T16:30:24.669532 [actor]: 10 weeks then home 2 weeks then hospital again 3 weeks now

2026-01-16T16:30:27.156881 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I understand that Arthur has been in the hospital for different periods - first for 10 weeks, then home for 2 weeks, and now back in the hospital for 3 weeks.

For Child Benefit eligibility while a child is in hospital, the rules are important to consider. 

Are you still responsible for Arthur's care, even while he's in the hospital? By this I mean, do you visit him, provide clothes, make decisions about his care, etc.?

2026-01-16T16:30:28.610519 [actor]: visit him clothes toys

2026-01-16T16:30:30.828011 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you visit Arthur and provide him with clothes and toys while he's in the hospital. This shows you're maintaining your parental responsibility.

Based on the UK government rules, you can continue to receive Child Benefit while your child is in the hospital if you're still responsible for them - which it sounds like you are through your visits and providing for his needs.

Do you currently receive Child Benefit for Arthur, or are you applying for the first time?

2026-01-16T16:30:31.641650 [actor]: yes get money

2026-01-16T16:30:34.922531 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you already receive Child Benefit for Arthur.

Based on the information you've provided and the UK government guidelines, you remain eligible for Child Benefit while Arthur is in the hospital because:

1. You continue to be responsible for him (visiting him and providing clothes and toys)
2. He is under 16 years old (he's 7)
3. You're maintaining your parental responsibility during his hospital stay

The UK government rules state that Child Benefit can continue while a child is in hospital as long as the parent maintains responsibility for the child. Since you're still involved in Arthur's care through regular visits and providing personal items, you should continue to receive your Child Benefit payments.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit while Arthur is in the hospital?

2026-01-16T16:30:38.319431 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit while their child is in hospital as they're still maintaining parental responsibility through visits and providing clothes and toys.
