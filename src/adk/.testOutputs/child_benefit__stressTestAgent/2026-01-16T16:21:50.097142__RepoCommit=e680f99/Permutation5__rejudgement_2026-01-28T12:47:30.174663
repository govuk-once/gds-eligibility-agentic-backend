2026-01-28T12:56:16.826638 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit. According to UK rules, non-resident parents who contribute financially to a child's upkeep that exceeds the Child Benefit amount (which the user does at £150/month vs the £113/month benefit rate) are eligible to claim if the person the child lives with is not claiming, which is the case here since Jenny is not claiming.
