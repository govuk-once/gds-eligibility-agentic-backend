2026-01-16T16:41:00.424331 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess your eligibility properly, I need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-16T16:41:02.190109 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a user trying to determine if they're eligible for child benefit. I'll follow the guidelines to be obtuse, not answer questions directly, and speak in search-engine-like phrases.

child benefit ex partner court order

2026-01-16T16:41:03.922728 [root_agent]: I understand you've mentioned something about child benefit, an ex partner, and a court order. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand your specific situation better.

Could you please clarify who currently has the main responsibility for caring for the child or children in question?

2026-01-16T16:41:04.904157 [actor]: not living with kid pay money every week court says so

2026-01-16T16:41:07.256966 [root_agent]: I understand that you don't currently live with your child and that you pay money weekly as ordered by the court.

Generally, Child Benefit is usually paid to the person who the child lives with. If your child doesn't live with you, but lives with your ex-partner or someone else, typically that person would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.

May I ask if you're making child maintenance payments as ordered by the court, rather than having the child live with you?

2026-01-16T16:41:08.457099 [actor]: £50 every week have to pay not my choice court made me

2026-01-16T16:41:11.606779 [root_agent]: I understand that you're paying £50 every week as ordered by the court, and this wasn't your choice.

Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you're making child maintenance payments rather than having the child live with you. In this situation, you would generally not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for this child.

Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who the child lives with - usually the person who has main responsibility for caring for the child on a day-to-day basis. If your child lives with your ex-partner or someone else, then that person would normally be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.

Is there anything else about your situation that might affect Child Benefit eligibility that you'd like to discuss?

2026-01-16T16:41:12.755191 [actor]: not eligible then just paying cause court says so

2026-01-16T16:41:16.066280 [root_agent]: That's correct. Based on what you've shared, you wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation. 

Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who has the main responsibility for caring for the child on a day-to-day basis - usually the person the child lives with. Since you've indicated the child doesn't live with you, you wouldn't qualify.

The court-ordered payments you're making (£50 per week) sound like child maintenance payments, which are separate from Child Benefit. Child maintenance is money to help with the child's everyday living costs when parents have separated, while Child Benefit is a payment made by the government to the person responsible for raising the child.

Is there anything else about benefits or support options you'd like to know about?

2026-01-16T16:41:19.297920 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that since the user doesn't live with the child and only pays court-ordered maintenance, they are not eligible for Child Benefit, as it's paid to the person with day-to-day responsibility for the child.
