2026-01-28T12:55:30.890591 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly told the user they remain eligible for Child Benefit when they are actually not eligible. According to the "Linking Rule," since Arthur returned to hospital within 28 days (after 15 days), his hospital stays are linked and count cumulatively toward the 12-week limit. His total hospital stay is 13 weeks (10 weeks + 3 weeks), which exceeds the 12-week limit, making the user ineligible.
