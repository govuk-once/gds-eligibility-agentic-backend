2026-01-16T16:28:56.775515 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility correctly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:28:58.378642 [actor]: I'll be playing the role of someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility in the UK. I'll be intentionally obtuse and speak in search-engine style responses, as requested.

child benefit divorced parents

2026-01-16T16:29:00.182500 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about child benefit in a situation involving divorced parents. Let me ask you some specific questions to help determine eligibility.

In cases of divorced parents, Child Benefit is typically paid to the parent who has the child living with them. So my first question is: Does the child live with you, even if only part of the time?

2026-01-16T16:29:01.018778 [actor]: holly stays with me 3 days sue has her 4 days

2026-01-16T16:29:03.508159 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that Holly stays with you for 3 days of the week and stays with Sue for 4 days.

Since Holly spends more days living with Sue than with you, Sue would typically be considered the main carer and would normally be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for Holly.

However, I'd like to ask: Has there been any formal agreement or court decision about who should receive Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-16T16:29:04.325183 [actor]: no agreement both submitted claims hmrc

2026-01-16T16:29:07.392264 [root_agent]: I understand that there's no formal agreement, and both you and Sue have submitted claims for Child Benefit to HMRC.

In this situation, where both parents have made a claim and the child divides time between households, HMRC typically makes a decision based on who has the main responsibility for the child. Since Holly stays with Sue for 4 days and with you for 3 days, HMRC would likely consider Sue to be the main carer.

However, HMRC looks at various factors beyond just counting days. May I ask, who takes care of Holly's day-to-day needs like clothing, food, and school arrangements?

2026-01-16T16:29:08.135558 [actor]: both buy clothes food school uniform

2026-01-16T16:29:10.862448 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that both you and Sue contribute to Holly's needs like clothing, food, and school uniforms.

When both parents share care and expenses, HMRC will look at the whole picture to determine who has the main responsibility for the child.

Since Holly spends more nights at Sue's home (4 days versus 3 days), this creates a presumption that Sue might be considered the main carer for Child Benefit purposes.

May I ask, who receives other benefits for Holly, if any? For example, who claims child elements of Universal Credit or Child Tax Credit?

2026-01-16T16:29:11.607852 [actor]: no other benefits claimed

2026-01-16T16:29:13.834776 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that no other benefits are being claimed for Holly.

Given that Holly spends 4 days with Sue and 3 days with you, and both of you contribute to her care and expenses, HMRC will typically award Child Benefit to the parent with whom the child spends more time. In this case, that appears to be Sue.

However, HMRC does consider other factors in making their decision. Has HMRC already responded to either of your claims? Or have they asked for additional information from either of you?

2026-01-16T16:29:14.609500 [actor]: waiting for hmrc decision

2026-01-16T16:29:17.880308 [root_agent]: I understand you're currently waiting for HMRC to make a decision on the Child Benefit claims for Holly.

Based on the information you've provided:
- Holly stays with Sue for 4 days and with you for 3 days per week
- Both of you contribute to her care needs (clothing, food, school uniform)
- No other benefits are being claimed for Holly
- There's no formal agreement about who should receive Child Benefit

Since Holly spends more nights with Sue, HMRC is likely to consider Sue as the main carer and may award the Child Benefit to her. However, HMRC will review all the information provided by both parties before making their final decision.

While you wait for HMRC's decision, is there anything specific about Child Benefit eligibility that you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-16T16:29:18.673894 [actor]: so not eligible?

2026-01-16T16:29:22.830205 [root_agent]: Based on what you've shared, I'm not saying you're definitely ineligible for Child Benefit for Holly, but there are challenges to your claim.

Since Holly spends more time with Sue (4 days versus your 3 days), HMRC typically considers the parent with whom the child spends more nights as the main carer. This creates a presumption in favor of Sue receiving the benefit.

However, HMRC considers multiple factors in these decisions, not just counting days. They look at the overall care arrangement and who has primary responsibility for the child.

When HMRC reaches their decision, they'll inform both you and Sue about the outcome. If you disagree with their decision when it comes, you would have the right to appeal and provide additional information about why you believe you should receive the benefit.

Would you like to know about the appeals process in case HMRC's decision isn't in your favor?

2026-01-16T16:29:25.787746 [actor]: Based on what I've learned, I'm likely not eligible to receive Child Benefit for Holly since she stays with Sue for 4 days compared to my 3 days. HMRC will probably determine Sue is the main carer since Holly spends more nights with her. I'll wait for HMRC's official decision on our competing claims.

2026-01-16T16:29:27.902376 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly explained that in cases of competing claims with divorced parents, HMRC is likely to award Child Benefit to Sue (who has the child 4 days versus the user's 3 days), which aligns with UK government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility.
