2026-01-16T16:39:02.621166 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you a series of questions to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-16T16:39:03.412694 [actor]: Sian lives with me Cardiff

2026-01-16T16:39:04.436917 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To understand your situation better, may I ask if you are personally responsible for a child who lives with you in Cardiff?

2026-01-16T16:39:05.141661 [actor]: yes daughter Sian

2026-01-16T16:39:06.534792 [root_agent]: I understand that you have a daughter named Sian who lives with you in Cardiff. To continue determining your Child Benefit eligibility, may I ask how old Sian is?

2026-01-16T16:39:07.248055 [actor]: 17 years old

2026-01-16T16:39:09.609779 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Sian is 17 years old, I need to check a few more details to determine your eligibility.

Is Sian in approved education or training? This would include things like:
- A-levels or similar qualifications
- Scottish Highers
- NVQs up to level 3
- Home education (if it started before age 16)
- Traineeships in England

2026-01-16T16:39:10.208855 [actor]: foundation apprenticeship wales

2026-01-16T16:39:12.001179 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

A Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales would typically qualify as approved education or training, which is good news for your Child Benefit eligibility.

May I ask if you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-16T16:39:12.872804 [actor]: no income that high

2026-01-16T16:39:15.791354 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information about your income.

Based on what you've shared with me, it appears you are likely eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have responsibility for your daughter Sian who lives with you
2. Sian is 17 years old and in approved education (Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales)
3. Neither you nor a partner has an individual income over £60,000 per year

You should be able to receive Child Benefit for Sian until she turns 20, as long as she continues in her approved education or training.

Would you like me to explain how to apply for Child Benefit or provide any other information about the benefit?

2026-01-16T16:39:19.786259 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit as they have responsibility for a 17-year-old daughter in approved education (Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales) and their household income is below £60,000.
