2026-01-16T16:22:12.292632 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility according to UK government rules.

First, do you have any children that you're responsible for who are under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:22:12.998634 [actor]: daughter studying

2026-01-16T16:22:14.000247 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that you have a daughter who is studying. Could you tell me how old your daughter is?

2026-01-16T16:22:14.611798 [actor]: 17

2026-01-16T16:22:16.883738 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your daughter is 17, she's over 16 but potentially still eligible if she's in approved education or training. 

Could you please tell me what type of education or training your daughter is currently undertaking? For Child Benefit purposes, approved education typically includes things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other similar full-time education courses.

2026-01-16T16:22:17.531559 [actor]: a levels

2026-01-16T16:22:19.181581 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your daughter is studying A-levels. This is considered approved education for Child Benefit purposes.

Are you responsible for your daughter? This typically means that she lives with you or you're paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit toward her upkeep.

2026-01-16T16:22:19.847777 [actor]: yes daughter living with me

2026-01-16T16:22:20.816870 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your daughter is living with you. 

Now I need to ask about your residency status. Are you living in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:22:21.458998 [actor]: london

2026-01-16T16:22:23.200772 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in London, which means you are living in the UK.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year? This is important because if either of you earn over this amount, you may have to pay back all of the Child Benefit as a tax charge.

2026-01-16T16:22:24.066837 [actor]: £40000

2026-01-16T16:22:25.758427 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that your income is £40,000. This is below the £60,000 threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge would apply in full.

Is your daughter a UK citizen, or does she have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:22:26.577686 [actor]: born uk

2026-01-16T16:22:29.626505 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your daughter was born in the UK, which indicates she is likely a UK citizen.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have a daughter who is 17 years old and studying A-levels (approved education)
2. Your daughter lives with you, and you are responsible for her
3. You live in the UK (London)
4. Your income is £40,000, which is below the threshold where you would have to pay back all the benefit
5. Your daughter was born in the UK

You should be able to receive Child Benefit until your daughter finishes her approved education, or until she turns 20, whichever comes first.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:22:33.320556 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility criteria and correctly concluded that a parent with a 17-year-old studying A-levels, living in the UK with an income below £60,000 would be eligible.
