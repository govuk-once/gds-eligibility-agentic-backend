2026-01-16T16:35:49.870545 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:35:50.827389 [actor]: child benefit son not living with me in youth detention center Mark 15 years old

2026-01-16T16:35:52.933085 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I understand your son Mark is 15 years old and is currently in a youth detention center rather than living with you.

Let me ask you: Are you responsible for Mark? For example, were you responsible for him before he entered the youth detention center, and do you regularly contact him or incur costs for him?

2026-01-16T16:35:54.143626 [actor]: yes Mark my son custody 10 weeks prison sentence 6 months was getting child benefit before

2026-01-16T16:35:57.905827 [root_agent]: I understand that Mark is your son who is currently serving a 10-week prison sentence with a 6-month custody period, and you were receiving Child Benefit for him before this situation.

According to UK government rules, if your child is in custody serving a sentence, Child Benefit payments are usually stopped. However, if the detention is expected to last 8 weeks or less, you can continue to receive Child Benefit.

Since you mentioned Mark is serving a 10-week prison sentence, which is longer than 8 weeks, you would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit while he is in detention.

When Mark is released and returns to live with you, you should be able to claim Child Benefit again if you remain responsible for him.

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

2026-01-16T16:35:58.813379 [actor]: not eligible for child benefit now for Mark?

2026-01-16T16:36:02.039868 [root_agent]: That's correct. Based on what you've told me, you are not eligible for Child Benefit now for Mark while he is serving his 10-week sentence in the youth detention center.

The UK government rules state that Child Benefit stops when a child goes into custody serving a custodial sentence. It can only continue if the detention is expected to last 8 weeks or less. Since Mark's sentence is 10 weeks, which is longer than the 8-week threshold, Child Benefit payments would be stopped during this period.

Once Mark is released and returns to live with you, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit again, assuming you still meet all other eligibility criteria and Mark is still under 16 (or under 20 if in approved education or training).

2026-01-16T16:36:03.553457 [actor]: I understand. So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit for Mark while he's in the youth detention center since he's been there for 10 weeks, which is over the 8-week threshold.

2026-01-16T16:36:06.011731 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops when a child is in custody for more than 8 weeks, and since the son is serving a 10-week sentence, the parent is not eligible during this period.
