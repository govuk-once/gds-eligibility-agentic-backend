2026-01-27T22:09:02.796007 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judgment. The agent failed to consider Rashid's marital status, which is a key factor affecting eligibility. According to the expected outcome, this should be "Eligible (via Exception)" since Rashid is married, but the agent didn't address this exception at all.
