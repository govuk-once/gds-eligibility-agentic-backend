2026-01-27T22:08:45.057115 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly determined eligibility. According to gov.uk guidelines, education only counts as "approved" if it is NOT paid for by an employer. Since Bella's training is fully funded by her employer (the local travel agency), the correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
