2026-01-16T16:31:23.340750 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you assess if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to determine this.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:31:24.852744 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the instructions to be obtuse, answer indirectly, and use search-engine-like responses.

child benefit Leo 5 years

2026-01-16T16:31:26.578822 [root_agent]: I notice you've mentioned Leo who is 5 years old. To help assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to confirm: Are you responsible for caring for Leo? This would typically mean Leo lives with you or you're paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit rates toward their upkeep.

2026-01-16T16:31:27.484977 [actor]: Leo care home 10 weeks no money husband pays

2026-01-16T16:31:29.032436 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To understand your situation better: Is Leo temporarily staying in a care home for 10 weeks, or is this a permanent arrangement? This will help me determine how this affects your Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-16T16:31:29.923594 [actor]: local authority care Leo stepfather pays £30 weekly

2026-01-16T16:31:32.361242 [root_agent]: I understand that Leo is in local authority care and his stepfather pays £30 weekly toward his care. This is important information for determining Child Benefit eligibility.

For children in local authority care, Child Benefit is usually affected. Since Leo is being looked after by the local authority, Child Benefit payments would typically stop after 8 weeks of care.

However, I need to ask: Are you still paying at least £23.80 per week (the current Child Benefit rate for a first child) toward Leo's maintenance while he's in care?

2026-01-16T16:31:33.361685 [actor]: no money husband pays carer £30 weekly

2026-01-16T16:31:36.817247 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that your husband pays £30 weekly toward Leo's care, but you yourself are not contributing financially.

Based on this information, you would likely not be eligible for Child Benefit for Leo while he is in local authority care. This is because:

1. Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks when a child goes into local authority care
2. To maintain eligibility while a child is in care, the person claiming Child Benefit needs to be contributing at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate toward the child's upkeep
3. Since your husband is making the payments rather than you, and you've indicated you're not contributing financially, you wouldn't meet this requirement for claiming Child Benefit

If your circumstances change or if Leo returns to live with you, you may become eligible again. Would you like to know any other information about Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:31:37.641095 [actor]: husband wife live together married

2026-01-16T16:31:41.614391 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. I understand that you and your husband are married and live together.

In this case, even though your husband is the one making the £30 weekly payments for Leo's care, if you're applying as a family unit, this could potentially affect the eligibility assessment.

However, based on the UK government guidelines, when a child is in local authority care, Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks unless:
- The person claiming is contributing at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate toward the child's maintenance
- The child regularly returns home to stay with the claimant

While your husband is contributing above the minimum amount required (£30 is more than the £23.80 Child Benefit rate), the claim would need to be in the name of the person who is responsible for the child.

May I ask, was Child Benefit being paid to you before Leo went into care? And does Leo regularly return home to stay with you?

2026-01-16T16:31:42.473236 [actor]: wife claiming child benefit husband money counts as mine

2026-01-16T16:31:47.519030 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that you're the one claiming Child Benefit for Leo, and since you and your husband are married and living together, you consider his financial contributions as shared resources.

This is an important point. In the context of a married couple living together, the financial contributions made by your husband toward Leo's care can indeed be considered as contributions from the household.

Given this information, you may be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Leo while he's in local authority care because:

1. Your household is contributing more than the minimum required amount (£30 weekly exceeds the Child Benefit rate of £23.80)
2. You are the established claimant
3. As a married couple living together, your husband's financial contributions can be considered as part of the household's support for Leo

However, if Leo remains in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, you should notify the Child Benefit Office about his change in circumstances to ensure your payments are correct. They may review your specific situation to make a final determination.

Would you like to know how to update the Child Benefit Office about Leo's current living situation?

2026-01-16T16:31:50.964960 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly recognized that as a married couple where the husband's financial contributions count as household contributions, the wife remains eligible for Child Benefit since the household is paying more than the required amount while Leo is in care.
