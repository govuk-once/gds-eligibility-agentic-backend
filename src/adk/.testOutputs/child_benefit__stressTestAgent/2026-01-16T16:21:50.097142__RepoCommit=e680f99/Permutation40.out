2026-01-16T16:38:25.114869 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you assess your eligibility for Child Benefit in the UK. To determine this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:38:26.029691 [actor]: Child benefit Simon 15 mental health hospital secure unit

2026-01-16T16:38:28.238371 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand you're asking about Child Benefit for Simon, who is 15 and currently in a mental health hospital secure unit.

Let me ask you: Are you responsible for Simon (such as being their parent or guardian) even though they are currently staying in a hospital?

2026-01-16T16:38:29.017797 [actor]: yes parent secure unit mental health act detention

2026-01-16T16:38:31.235732 [root_agent]: I understand that you're Simon's parent, and he's currently detained in a secure mental health unit under the Mental Health Act.

In this case, you can generally continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 52 weeks while Simon is in hospital, as long as you were eligible before he was admitted and you continue to contribute financially to his care or maintenance in some way.

How long has Simon been in the hospital so far?

2026-01-16T16:38:32.442138 [actor]: 10 weeks secure unit

2026-01-16T16:38:35.115808 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Simon has been in the secure unit for 10 weeks, which is less than the 52-week limit, you should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him.

As his parent who was presumably receiving Child Benefit before his admission, you can continue to receive it while he's in the hospital, as long as you're still contributing in some way to his upkeep or maintenance (even small contributions like clothing, toiletries, or pocket money).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility in this situation?

2026-01-16T16:38:36.942010 [actor]: So I am eligible for child benefit?

2026-01-16T16:38:38.892321 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit can continue for up to 52 weeks while a child is in hospital, and since Simon has only been there for 10 weeks, the parent remains eligible.
