Let me assess this person's eligibility for Child Benefit based on UK government rules. I need to ask a series of questions to determine eligibility, but I should ask only one question at a time. I'll need information about:
- Whether they have any children living with them
- The age of any children
- Whether they're responsible for the child
- Whether they meet residency requirements
- Their income (for the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

I'll start with the most basic question about whether they have children living with them.

Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. 

To start, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:24:52.553598 [actor]: child benefit eligibility with son

2026-01-16T16:24:55.101204 [root_agent]: #thought
The person has mentioned having a son, which is helpful, but I need more specific information to determine eligibility for Child Benefit.

According to gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, to qualify for Child Benefit, the person must be responsible for raising a child who is:
- under 16, or
- under 20 if they stay in approved education or training

I should ask about the age of their son next, as this is a key eligibility criterion.
#end_thought

Thank you for that information. May I ask how old your son is?

2026-01-16T16:24:55.905978 [actor]: Hans 5 years old

2026-01-16T16:24:59.546857 [root_agent]: #thought
The person has indicated their son Hans is 5 years old, which means he's under 16. This meets one of the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

Now I need to confirm whether the person is responsible for raising this child, which is another key requirement. I also need to understand their residency status in the UK, as this affects eligibility.

According to gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, you can get Child Benefit if you're responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training) and you live in the UK.
#end_thought

Thank you. Since Hans is 5 years old, he meets the age requirement for Child Benefit. 

Are you the person who is primarily responsible for raising Hans? By this I mean, does he live with you and do you provide for his day-to-day care?

2026-01-16T16:25:00.237649 [actor]: yes responsible for Hans

2026-01-16T16:25:03.848783 [root_agent]: #thought
Good, the person has confirmed they are responsible for Hans, which is another key eligibility criterion for Child Benefit.

Next, I need to understand their residency status in the UK. According to gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, you can claim Child Benefit if you live in the UK. There are also rules about immigration status that might affect eligibility.

I should also eventually ask about income levels because of the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which applies if an individual or their partner has an adjusted net income over £50,000.

But for now, I'll focus on residency status.
#end_thought

Thank you for confirming that. Do you normally live in the UK? Your UK residency status is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-16T16:25:04.649026 [actor]: German EU settlement status looking for work

2026-01-16T16:25:08.704005 [root_agent]: #thought
The person has mentioned they have EU Settlement Status from Germany and they're looking for work. This gives me important information about their residency status.

EU Settlement Status generally allows individuals to live and work in the UK, which would likely satisfy the residency requirement for Child Benefit. However, I should confirm their specific type of settlement status, as there are two types:

1. Pre-settled status - for those who haven't lived in the UK for 5 years continuously
2. Settled status - for those who have lived in the UK for a continuous 5-year period

Both statuses typically allow for claiming benefits like Child Benefit, but I should confirm this directly.

Additionally, I should inquire about whether they meet any other requirements or if there are any restrictions on their status that might affect eligibility.
#end_thought

Thank you for sharing that information. Having EU Settlement Status means you may be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Could you please clarify whether you have pre-settled status or settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme? This might affect your eligibility for certain benefits.

2026-01-16T16:25:09.561064 [actor]: pre settled status jobseeker

2026-01-16T16:25:15.391027 [root_agent]: #thought
The person has pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme and is a jobseeker. This is important information for determining their Child Benefit eligibility.

With pre-settled status, EU citizens can generally access benefits like Child Benefit, but there are some additional requirements. They typically need to be exercising EU treaty rights, such as:
- Being a worker
- Being self-employed
- Being a jobseeker (with genuine chances of being employed)
- Being self-sufficient
- Being a student

Since they mentioned being a jobseeker, they may be eligible as long as they have a genuine chance of finding employment. However, there might be additional requirements or restrictions based on their specific situation.

I should now ask about any income considerations, as the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies if they or their partner earn over £50,000 per year.
#end_thought

Thank you for that clarification. With pre-settled status as a jobseeker, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit, especially since you're responsible for a child under 16 years old.

I'd now like to ask about your income situation. Do you or a partner you live with have an individual income over £50,000 per year? This is important because of the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which may affect how much benefit you receive.

2026-01-16T16:25:16.189114 [actor]: no income job searching

2026-01-16T16:25:23.556695 [root_agent]: #thought
The person has confirmed they have no income as they are currently job searching. This means:

1. They would not be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which only applies to individuals earning over £50,000 per year.

2. Since they have pre-settled status as an EU citizen, are responsible for a 5-year-old child, and are actively seeking work, they likely meet the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

Based on the information provided so far:
- They are responsible for a child under 16 (Hans, who is 5)
- They have legal residency in the UK (pre-settled status)
- They have no income that would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge

One additional question I might want to ask is whether they have already been in the UK for a certain period or if they've just arrived, as this might affect the specific rules that apply to their situation. Also, I should check if there are any other benefits they might be eligible for given their current situation as a jobseeker with a young child.

Based on the information provided, I believe they would likely be eligible for Child Benefit.
#end_thought

Thank you for this information. Based on what you've shared:

- You're responsible for Hans, who is 5 years old
- You have pre-settled status in the UK
- You're actively job searching with no current income

It appears you would likely be eligible for Child Benefit. As someone with pre-settled status who is actively seeking work, you generally qualify for Child Benefit as long as you're responsible for a child under 16.

You would not be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge since your income is below the £50,000 threshold.

Would you like me to explain how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:25:27.320900 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that someone with pre-settled status who is responsible for a child under 16 and actively seeking work would likely qualify for Child Benefit, especially with no income that would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
