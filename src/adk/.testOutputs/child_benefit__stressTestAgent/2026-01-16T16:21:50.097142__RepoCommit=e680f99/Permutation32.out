2026-01-16T16:34:41.571049 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine your eligibility for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:34:42.467677 [actor]: child benefit eligibility teenager at home

2026-01-16T16:34:43.424919 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing more context. I'd like to understand your situation better regarding Child Benefit eligibility for a teenager at home.

How old is the teenager who lives with you?

2026-01-16T16:34:44.351088 [actor]: john 17 lives with me

2026-01-16T16:34:46.040379 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit for 17-year-old John who lives with you, I need to know:

Is John in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or certain traineeships.

2026-01-16T16:34:46.744681 [actor]: college GCSEs resit

2026-01-16T16:34:48.581904 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Resitting GCSEs at college counts as approved education, which is good for Child Benefit eligibility.

Are you responsible for John? By this I mean, do you pay towards his costs of accommodation, clothing, food, etc.?

2026-01-16T16:34:49.318744 [actor]: father

2026-01-16T16:34:51.238173 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're John's father. 

Does anyone else also have parental responsibility for John (such as his mother), and if so, do they live with you and John?

2026-01-16T16:34:51.971966 [actor]: single dad pete

2026-01-16T16:34:53.351598 [root_agent]: Thank you, Pete. I understand you're a single father caring for John.

Do you or John receive any other benefits from the government, such as Universal Credit or tax credits?

2026-01-16T16:34:54.128418 [actor]: no benefits

2026-01-16T16:34:56.811693 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you're not receiving any other benefits.

Is your individual income over £60,000 per year? (This is relevant as it affects whether the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply.)

2026-01-16T16:34:57.525412 [actor]: low income

2026-01-16T16:34:58.885250 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since you have a low income, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Is John a UK resident? (This is another key eligibility factor for Child Benefit.)

2026-01-16T16:34:59.602154 [actor]: uk born and raised

2026-01-16T16:35:03.481080 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that John was born and raised in the UK.

Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for John because:

1. John is 17 years old and still in approved education (resitting GCSEs at college)
2. You are John's father and responsible for him as a single parent
3. You have a low income, so won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge
4. John is a UK resident
5. No one else appears to be claiming Child Benefit for John

You can continue to receive Child Benefit for John until he turns 20 if he remains in approved education or training. If he leaves education or training, your entitlement would typically end on the 31st August after his 16th birthday.

Would you like me to explain how to make a claim for Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:35:04.223602 [actor]: how many hours college

2026-01-16T16:35:06.512638 [root_agent]: That's a good question. For Child Benefit eligibility, the education or training that John is undertaking should be "non-advanced" education or "approved" training, and it needs to average more than 12 hours per week of supervised study.

How many hours per week does John attend his GCSE resit courses at college?

2026-01-16T16:35:07.230294 [actor]: six hours only

2026-01-16T16:35:11.996357 [root_agent]: I need to carefully think about this information. Since John only attends college for six hours per week for his GCSE resits, this falls below the minimum requirement of more than 12 hours of supervised study per week that's needed for Child Benefit eligibility for a child over 16.

Based on this new information, I need to revise my previous assessment. It appears that you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for John because:

While John is 17 and in education (resitting GCSEs), the number of hours he spends in supervised study (6 hours) is below the required threshold of more than 12 hours per week that's needed for Child Benefit eligibility for someone his age.

For a young person aged 16-19 to qualify for continued Child Benefit, they must be in what's considered "full-time" non-advanced education or approved training, which typically means more than 12 hours per week of supervised study.

Is there any possibility that John might increase his hours at college, or is he participating in any other forms of education or training that could count toward this total?

2026-01-16T16:35:15.541310 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that Child Benefit eligibility for a 17-year-old requires more than 12 hours of supervised study per week, and correctly concluded ineligibility when informed the teenager only attends college for 6 hours weekly.
