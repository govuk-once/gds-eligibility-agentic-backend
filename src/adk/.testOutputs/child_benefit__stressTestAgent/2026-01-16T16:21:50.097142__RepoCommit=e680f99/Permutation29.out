2026-01-16T16:33:34.887365 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children that you're responsible for who are under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:33:39.767879 [root_agent]: #thinking
Let me analyze the context provided about Jordan:
- Jordan is 17 years old
- Jordan is not working
- Jordan is not in college/education

Based on Child Benefit eligibility rules:
- Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 16
- For children 16-19, they must be in approved education or training
- Since Jordan is 17 and not in education or training, they would not qualify for Child Benefit

I need to confirm this information directly with the person to make a proper assessment.

Thank you for providing that information. Based on what you've shared about Jordan who is 17 years old and not in education or training, I need to clarify something further.

For Child Benefit eligibility, a young person aged 16-19 needs to be in approved education or training for you to qualify. Since Jordan is 17 but not in college or other approved education, would you be able to tell me if there are any plans for Jordan to start approved education or training soon?

Let me analyze this additional information:
- Jordan is not registered in any education or training
- Jordan lives with their father (not with the person I'm speaking with)

This raises two important considerations:
1. Since Jordan is 17 and not in approved education or training, they don't meet the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit
2. Additionally, since Jordan lives with their father rather than the person I'm speaking with, the person I'm speaking with would not be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit even if Jordan did meet the criteria

To be eligible for Child Benefit:
- The child must be under 16, or under 20 if in approved education or training
- The person claiming must be responsible for and living with the child (with some exceptions)

Based on both these factors, the person appears not to be eligible.

Thank you for that additional information. Based on what you've shared, it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Jordan for two reasons:

1. Child Benefit can only be paid for children aged 16-19 if they are in approved education or training. Since Jordan is 17 and not registered in education or training, this requirement is not met.

2. Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who is responsible for and living with the child. Since Jordan lives with their father rather than with you, the father would generally be the person who could claim Child Benefit (if Jordan met the other eligibility criteria).

Is there anything else about your situation that you think might affect your eligibility for Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:33:50.498747 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the person would not be eligible for Child Benefit because Jordan is 17 and not in approved education or training, and because Jordan lives with their father rather than with the person asking.
