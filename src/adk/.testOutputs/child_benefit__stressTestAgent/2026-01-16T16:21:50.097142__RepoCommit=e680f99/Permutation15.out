2026-01-16T16:27:20.102106 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To give you the most accurate assessment, I'll need to ask you a series of questions, one at a time.

First, are you responsible for raising a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-16T16:27:21.648161 [actor]: I need to roleplay as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll respond as someone who is being obtuse, not directly answering questions, and speaking like they're using search terms.

Emma daughter lives mother not me child benefit question

2026-01-16T16:27:23.528460 [root_agent]: I'll try to understand your situation better. It sounds like you're asking about Child Benefit for Emma, who is your daughter but lives with her mother rather than with you.

To clarify your situation: Are you asking whether you personally can claim Child Benefit for your daughter Emma, who lives with her mother?

2026-01-16T16:27:25.053145 [actor]: daughter 12 years old emma ex wife house not me claim benefits possible?

2026-01-16T16:27:28.998674 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about whether you can claim Child Benefit for your 12-year-old daughter Emma who lives with your ex-wife.

Generally, Child Benefit is paid to the person who the child lives with. Since Emma lives with your ex-wife rather than with you, your ex-wife would normally be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.

Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child, and this is typically the person who the child lives with. If you and your ex-wife cannot agree who should claim, priority usually goes to the person the child lives with.

Do you provide any financial support for Emma or have a family-based arrangement with your ex-wife regarding Emma's care?

2026-01-16T16:27:29.947540 [actor]: send birthday present money for food £10 weekly ex doesn't claim

2026-01-16T16:27:34.325650 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you send birthday presents and contribute £10 weekly for food expenses for Emma, and you've mentioned that your ex-wife doesn't claim Child Benefit.

This is an important point. If your ex-wife is not claiming Child Benefit for Emma, and you contribute financially to Emma's upbringing (even if she doesn't live with you), you may be able to make a claim.

However, the claim would need to be assessed based on who has the main responsibility for Emma. The fact that you provide some financial support is helpful, but the UK government typically considers factors like:

1. Who Emma lives with most of the time
2. Who has the main day-to-day responsibility for Emma's care
3. Who pays for most of Emma's upkeep

Since Emma lives with your ex-wife, does your ex-wife handle most of Emma's day-to-day care?

2026-01-16T16:27:35.443856 [actor]: ex wife takes care school meals homework daily stuff i send money 10 pounds weekly

2026-01-16T16:27:39.783499 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. From what you've shared, it sounds like:

- Your ex-wife handles Emma's day-to-day care (school, meals, homework, daily supervision)
- You contribute £10 weekly for expenses
- Your ex-wife isn't currently claiming Child Benefit for Emma

Based on this information, while you do provide some financial support, your ex-wife appears to have the main responsibility for raising Emma since she lives with her and handles her daily care needs.

In this situation, your ex-wife would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit. You would generally not be eligible to claim it yourself since Emma doesn't live with you and your ex-wife has the primary caring responsibility.

If you feel there are special circumstances in your case, you could contact the Child Benefit Office directly for specific advice about your situation. Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit that might be relevant to your situation?

2026-01-16T16:27:40.815509 [actor]: not eligible for child benefit because don't pay enough money weekly?

2026-01-16T16:27:44.587856 [root_agent]: I want to clarify something important: The amount of money you contribute weekly is not the determining factor for Child Benefit eligibility.

The main criteria for Child Benefit eligibility relates to who has the primary responsibility for raising the child - which typically means who the child lives with most of the time and who handles their day-to-day care needs.

In your case, you're not eligible for Child Benefit primarily because Emma lives with your ex-wife who handles her daily care, not because you only contribute £10 weekly.

Even if you were contributing significantly more money, the eligibility would still likely go to the person Emma lives with (your ex-wife), as they're considered to have the main responsibility for her.

So to be clear: It's not about the amount of money you provide - it's about who has the main responsibility for raising Emma day-to-day.

2026-01-16T16:27:46.809902 [actor]: I understand now. If I want to claim Child Benefit, I would need to contribute at least £26.05 per week to Emma's upkeep because that's the same amount as the Child Benefit payment. My £10 contribution isn't enough to be considered responsible for her since she lives with her mother.

2026-01-16T16:27:49.875798 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent provided incorrect information in their final response by not correcting the user's mistaken belief that eligibility depends on contributing an amount equal to the Child Benefit payment. Eligibility is based on who has primary caring responsibility for the child, not the amount of financial contribution.
