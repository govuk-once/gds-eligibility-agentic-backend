2026-01-19T12:33:38.155614 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:33:39.904287 [actor]: I need to gather information to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Based on the context provided, I'll play the role of Hans, who has Pre-Settled Status, has been unemployed and claiming Child Benefit as a "Jobseeker" for 95 days, and has no imminent job offer.

have child yes

2026-01-19T12:33:40.905156 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that you have a child. 

May I ask, does the child live with you?

2026-01-19T12:33:42.011607 [actor]: live with child yes our flat

2026-01-19T12:33:43.337757 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that the child lives with you in your flat.

Could you tell me if you are responsible for the child? By responsible, I mean you are the main person looking after them.

2026-01-19T12:33:44.136076 [actor]: yes feed clothe school everything

2026-01-19T12:33:45.551747 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're responsible for your child, including feeding, clothing, and schooling them.

May I ask, what is your immigration or residency status in the UK?

2026-01-19T12:33:46.239104 [actor]: pre settled status

2026-01-19T12:33:47.631631 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you have pre-settled status.

Are you currently working in the UK, or have you been looking for work? I'm asking because this relates to your right to reside in the UK, which can affect Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-19T12:33:48.602859 [actor]: looking for work 95 days no job yet

2026-01-19T12:33:51.451751 [root_agent]: I understand you've been looking for work for 95 days and don't have a job yet.

Since you have pre-settled status and are a jobseeker, there may be some time limitations to consider. Under current rules, EEA nationals with pre-settled status generally have a right to reside as a jobseeker for up to 6 months (approximately 182 days).

Since you've been looking for work for 95 days without securing employment, you're still within this period, but it's important to be aware of this time limit.

Does anyone in your household earn over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T12:33:52.297042 [actor]: no money poor need help

2026-01-19T12:33:55.835849 [root_agent]: I understand your financial situation is difficult. Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on what you've told me, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have responsibility for a child who lives with you
2. You have pre-settled status in the UK
3. You're currently exercising EU treaty rights as a jobseeker (within the allowed period)
4. You don't have high household income that would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge

Since you've been seeking work for 95 days, you're still within the typical 6-month period that jobseekers with pre-settled status are permitted to claim benefits. However, I should mention that you may need to show you're genuinely seeking work and have a reasonable chance of finding employment.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-19T12:33:59.325799 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that someone with pre-settled status who has been seeking work for 95 days (within the 6-month limit for jobseekers) and is responsible for a child living with them would be eligible for Child Benefit.
