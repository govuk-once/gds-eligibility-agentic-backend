2026-01-19T12:34:47.732353 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T12:34:48.999181 [actor]: I'll help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit by roleplaying as a user seeking this information.

2026-01-19T12:34:50.314159 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit for your son Tom. To do this properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

How old is your son Tom?

2026-01-19T12:34:51.126561 [actor]: Tom 17 years old

2026-01-19T12:34:53.454993 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing Tom's age. Since Tom is 17, I need to know a bit more about his situation.

Is Tom still in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved education courses.

2026-01-19T12:34:54.494246 [actor]: computer coding course not paid employer pays join after finish

2026-01-19T12:34:56.105166 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

To clarify, is this computer coding course that Tom is attending considered an approved education or training course recognized by educational authorities? (For Child Benefit purposes, approved education generally means full-time non-advanced education or approved training.)

2026-01-19T12:34:57.081289 [actor]: course employer agreement get job after

2026-01-19T12:34:58.538603 [root_agent]: I understand Tom is 17 and taking a computer coding course that's part of an employer agreement where he would get a job after completion.

Does this course involve at least 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience?

2026-01-19T12:34:59.351975 [actor]: coding 30 hours week

2026-01-19T12:35:00.757010 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 30 hours per week is certainly substantial.

Is Tom living with you in the UK? And are you primarily responsible for him?

2026-01-19T12:35:01.833120 [actor]: yes lives with me UK

2026-01-19T12:35:03.222694 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Tom lives with you in the UK and you're responsible for him.

Is either you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year in individual income?

2026-01-19T12:35:03.996350 [actor]: earning below that amount

2026-01-19T12:35:08.887461 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for your son Tom because:

1. He is 17 years old, which is under the age limit of 20
2. He is in what appears to be qualifying training (a substantial coding course of 30 hours per week)
3. He lives with you in the UK
4. You are responsible for him
5. Your earnings are below the £60,000 threshold where Child Benefit starts to be affected

However, I should note that for the training to fully qualify, it needs to be on the list of approved training courses. Many vocational and work-based training programs qualify, especially if they're recognized qualifications.

You can apply for Child Benefit online or by post using form CH2. If you're already receiving Child Benefit for Tom, it should continue as long as he remains in qualifying education or training until his 20th birthday.

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of Child Benefit in more detail?

2026-01-19T12:35:12.708304 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent failed because employer-arranged courses that pay a wage (as suggested by "employer agreement get job after") typically don't qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.
