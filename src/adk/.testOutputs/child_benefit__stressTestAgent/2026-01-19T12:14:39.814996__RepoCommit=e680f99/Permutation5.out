2026-01-19T12:16:01.928708 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T12:16:03.537905 [actor]: I need to roleplay as a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. Let me respond to the agent's question as instructed.

divorced son lives with ex wife send money each month

2026-01-19T12:16:05.150665 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that you're divorced and your son lives with your ex-wife, and that you send money each month for your son's support.

Does your ex-wife currently receive Child Benefit for your son?

2026-01-19T12:16:05.939873 [actor]: ex wife not claiming benefit

2026-01-19T12:16:07.791976 [root_agent]: I understand that your ex-wife is not claiming Child Benefit for your son.

Do you have a family-based arrangement or court order that gives you some responsibility for looking after your son, such as regular contact or overnight stays with you?

2026-01-19T12:16:08.735116 [actor]: send 150 pounds monthly food clothes lucas

2026-01-19T12:16:10.093725 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you send £150 monthly to help with food and clothes for Lucas.

How often does your son stay overnight with you, if at all?

2026-01-19T12:16:10.971080 [actor]: not stay with me divorced send money only

2026-01-19T12:16:14.627828 [root_agent]: I understand that your son doesn't stay with you, and your involvement consists of sending money to support him while he lives with your ex-wife.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with. Since your son lives with your ex-wife full-time and you don't have overnight care responsibilities, she would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.

If your ex-wife is not currently claiming the benefit, you might want to let her know she could be eligible to apply. The financial support you provide is commendable, but for Child Benefit purposes, the primary eligibility factor is who the child lives with.

Would you like me to explain anything else about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-19T12:16:15.619855 [actor]: but I pay more than benefit amount she not claiming

2026-01-19T12:16:19.327575 [root_agent]: I understand your perspective, and I appreciate that you're providing significant financial support for your son - more than what the Child Benefit amount would be. It's commendable that you're supporting your child financially.

However, I need to clarify that Child Benefit eligibility isn't determined by who provides the most financial support, but rather by who has the main responsibility for caring for the child. Since your son lives with your ex-wife full-time, she would be considered the person with main responsibility for him under Child Benefit rules.

The fact that your ex-wife isn't claiming the benefit doesn't automatically transfer eligibility to you. For you to be eligible, your son would generally need to live with you.

If you believe there are special circumstances in your case, you could contact the Child Benefit Office directly for specific advice about your situation.

2026-01-19T12:16:20.210134 [actor]: how much money need to send for eligibility

2026-01-19T12:16:24.310746 [root_agent]: I need to clarify something important: eligibility for Child Benefit isn't determined by how much money you send to support your child. The primary factor is who the child lives with and who has the main day-to-day caring responsibility.

Under the current UK government rules, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with. Since your son lives with your ex-wife full-time, she would be the person eligible to claim, regardless of how much financial support you provide.

Simply sending money - even if it's a substantial amount - doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit if your son doesn't live with you. The benefit is designed to help the person who has the day-to-day responsibility of caring for the child.

If you want to explore other forms of support or recognition for the financial contribution you make, you might want to seek advice regarding child maintenance arrangements or speak to Citizens Advice about your specific situation.

2026-01-19T12:16:25.410265 [actor]: gov uk says contributing to upkeep eligible

2026-01-19T12:16:30.808811 [root_agent]: Thank you for bringing this up. Let me clarify the eligibility criteria more precisely.

You're right that contributing to a child's upkeep is one factor in Child Benefit eligibility, but it needs to be considered alongside other requirements. According to the official guidelines, to claim Child Benefit, you must be "responsible for a child" - and this has a specific meaning.

You're considered responsible for a child if they live with you or if you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or more) towards their upkeep. However, if someone else is already claiming Child Benefit for the child, this creates a different situation.

In cases where parents are separated, only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. If there's a dispute about who should receive it, the government considers factors including:
- Who the child lives with
- Who contributes most to the child's upkeep

Since your son lives permanently with your ex-wife, she would typically have the primary claim. However, since she isn't claiming, and you're contributing significantly to your son's upkeep, you may have grounds to claim.

I'd recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly to discuss your specific situation, as they can provide definitive guidance based on all the details of your case.

2026-01-19T12:16:32.453770 [actor]: so I'm eligible if ex wife not claiming

2026-01-19T12:16:36.844754 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided and my understanding of the eligibility criteria, yes - you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit if:

1. You're contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or more) toward your son's upkeep, which at £150 per month you appear to be doing
2. Your ex-wife is not claiming Child Benefit for your son

The key eligibility requirement is being "responsible for a child," which can be met either by having the child live with you OR by paying at least the equivalent of Child Benefit toward their upkeep.

Since your ex-wife isn't claiming the benefit, and you're making regular financial contributions that exceed the Child Benefit amount, you could have grounds to claim.

To proceed with a claim, you would need to complete a Child Benefit claim form (CH2) and may need to provide evidence of your financial contributions to your son's upkeep.

I would still recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly before applying, as they can provide guidance specific to your circumstances and confirm your eligibility.

2026-01-19T12:16:40.538801 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that while Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with, someone who contributes at least the Child Benefit amount toward a child's upkeep may be eligible if the primary caregiver is not claiming.
