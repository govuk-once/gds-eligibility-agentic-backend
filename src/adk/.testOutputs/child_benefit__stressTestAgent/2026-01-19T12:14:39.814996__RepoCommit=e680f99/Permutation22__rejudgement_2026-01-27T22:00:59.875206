2026-01-27T22:03:00.601192 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed to correctly identify that Arthur has been in hospital for a total of 13 weeks (10 weeks initially + 3 weeks currently) with only a 15-day gap between stays, which triggers the "linking rule." Since this exceeds the 12-week limit and the gap was less than 28 days, Jenny is not eligible for Child Benefit unless she's providing substantial financial support during the hospital stay, which wasn't established.
