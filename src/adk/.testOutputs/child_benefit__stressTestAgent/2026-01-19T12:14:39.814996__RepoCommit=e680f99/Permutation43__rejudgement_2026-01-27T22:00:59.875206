2026-01-27T22:03:29.580191 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ The agent's determination is incorrect. Modern apprenticeships in Scotland do NOT qualify for Child Benefit. According to gov.uk guidance, you generally cannot get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship in Scotland (unlike specific Welsh exceptions). The agent gave erroneous information by stating the son would be eligible when the expected outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
