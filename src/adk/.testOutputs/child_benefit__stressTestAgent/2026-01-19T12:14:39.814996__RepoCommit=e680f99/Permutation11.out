2026-01-19T12:18:47.123816 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:18:48.701101 [actor]: I need to role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the instructions to be obtuse, speak like using search terms, and not directly answer questions.

son ryan apprenticeship living at home

2026-01-19T12:18:49.775217 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit for your son Ryan who is doing an apprenticeship and living at home.

How old is Ryan?

2026-01-19T12:18:50.728544 [actor]: ryan 17 birthday september

2026-01-19T12:18:52.710575 [root_agent]: I understand Ryan is 17 and his birthday is in September. 

Is Ryan's apprenticeship considered an approved education or training program in the UK? (Approved education generally includes A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other equivalent qualifications)

2026-01-19T12:18:53.578175 [actor]: intermediate apprenticeship england government funded just started left school

2026-01-19T12:18:55.339279 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Since Ryan is 17 and on an intermediate apprenticeship that's government funded in England, this likely qualifies as approved education or training.

Do you normally live in the UK? (This includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland)

2026-01-19T12:18:56.224821 [actor]: nottingham council house 12 years

2026-01-19T12:18:57.717827 [root_agent]: I understand you've been living in a council house in Nottingham for 12 years.

Are you responsible for Ryan's care? This generally means he lives with you and you're responsible for his day-to-day care.

2026-01-19T12:18:58.724441 [actor]: cook dinner everyday laundry bills mother

2026-01-19T12:19:00.271250 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It sounds like you're Ryan's mother and are responsible for his day-to-day care, including cooking, laundry, and bills.

Is there anyone else who might be claiming Child Benefit for Ryan? For example, another parent or guardian?

2026-01-19T12:19:01.131989 [actor]: no father picture

2026-01-19T12:19:02.778272 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're the only one who might claim Child Benefit for Ryan, as his father is not in the picture.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T12:19:03.665183 [actor]: part time cleaner benefits low income

2026-01-19T12:19:07.366766 [root_agent]: I understand you work as a part-time cleaner, receive some benefits, and have a low income.

Based on the information you've provided:
- Your son Ryan is 17 and on a government-funded intermediate apprenticeship (qualifying as approved education)
- You live in the UK (Nottingham) and have done so for many years
- You're responsible for Ryan's day-to-day care as his mother
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Ryan
- You have a low income as a part-time cleaner and receive some benefits

It appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit for Ryan until he turns 20, as long as he continues in his approved apprenticeship program.

Would you like information about how to claim Child Benefit or how much you might receive?

2026-01-19T12:19:09.534510 [actor]: I see. Child benefit how much money weekly?

2026-01-19T12:19:11.382853 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that a 17-year-old on an intermediate apprenticeship who lives at home with their parent qualifies for Child Benefit, and properly assessed all eligibility criteria.
