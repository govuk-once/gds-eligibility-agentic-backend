2026-01-19T12:20:16.290258 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First question: Are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you in the UK?

2026-01-19T12:20:17.482817 [actor]: child benefit Emma 12 daughter doesn't live with me. I want to claim. her mum doesn't claim.

2026-01-19T12:20:19.080358 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. 

To understand your situation better, may I ask: Do you have any caring responsibilities for your 12-year-old daughter Emma, even though she doesn't live with you? For example, do you have regular contact with her or contribute to her upbringing financially?

2026-01-19T12:20:19.989270 [actor]: birthday present £10 weekly food money

2026-01-19T12:20:21.412263 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Do you have a formal arrangement regarding your daughter, such as shared parental responsibility or a court order that outlines your involvement in her care?

2026-01-19T12:20:22.344064 [actor]: send money to ex wife for Emma

2026-01-19T12:20:23.456353 [root_agent]: I understand you send money to your ex-wife for Emma's care. 

Could you tell me who Emma primarily lives with on a day-to-day basis?

2026-01-19T12:20:24.183665 [actor]: lives with mother full time

2026-01-19T12:20:25.610900 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Emma lives with her mother full time.

You mentioned earlier that Emma's mother doesn't claim Child Benefit for her. Do you know if anyone else is currently claiming Child Benefit for Emma?

2026-01-19T12:20:26.480595 [actor]: nobody claims for her

2026-01-19T12:20:30.513201 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, I need to explain the Child Benefit eligibility criteria in your situation. Generally, Child Benefit can typically only be claimed by the person who the child lives with. Since Emma lives full-time with her mother, her mother would normally be the eligible person to claim.

Even though you provide some financial support (£10 weekly food money and birthday presents), this doesn't typically qualify as having main responsibility for the child under the Child Benefit rules.

For you to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma, you would generally need to have Emma living with you or have equal shared care arrangements. 

Would you like me to explain what steps could be taken regarding Emma's mother making a claim, as she appears to be the eligible person?

2026-01-19T12:20:33.276803 [actor]: I don't understand not eligible

2026-01-19T12:20:37.696860 [root_agent]: I understand this can be confusing, so let me explain more clearly why you're likely not eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma based on the information you've shared:

1. Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who has main responsibility for raising a child.

2. According to UK government rules, "main responsibility" generally means the child lives with you.

3. Since Emma lives full-time with her mother, her mother is considered to have the main responsibility for her care.

4. While you provide some financial support (£10 weekly and birthday presents), this alone doesn't constitute having main responsibility under the Child Benefit rules.

5. The person the child lives with is normally the one eligible to claim, even if they choose not to do so.

Your ex-wife appears to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma since Emma lives with her full-time. If she isn't claiming it currently, she may want to consider doing so as she would likely be entitled to this support.

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

2026-01-19T12:20:40.096270 [actor]: I see, so not eligible because Emma lives with mother and £10 per week not enough. Her mum should claim instead.

2026-01-19T12:20:41.736634 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit can only be claimed by the person the child lives with (the mother in this case), and occasional financial support doesn't qualify the father for Child Benefit.
