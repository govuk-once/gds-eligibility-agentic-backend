2026-01-19T12:34:23.287415 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine your eligibility for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T12:34:24.384103 [actor]: HNC education child benefit

2026-01-19T12:34:26.012235 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're asking about Child Benefit in relation to HNC education.

To clarify, do you have a child who is studying for a Higher National Certificate (HNC)? And could you tell me how old they are?

2026-01-19T12:34:27.100032 [actor]: daughter emily 18 college HNC

2026-01-19T12:34:29.132986 [root_agent]: I understand that you have an 18-year-old daughter named Emily who is studying an HNC at college. 

For Child Benefit eligibility with a child over 16, the education they're in needs to be "approved education." 

Could you tell me if Emily's HNC course is full-time (at least 12 hours of supervised study per week)?

2026-01-19T12:34:30.093586 [actor]: yes full time course

2026-01-19T12:34:31.965462 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Emily is on a full-time course.

Higher National Certificates (HNCs) generally qualify as approved education for Child Benefit purposes when they're full-time courses.

Could you tell me if you are the person who Emily normally lives with or who is primarily responsible for her care?

2026-01-19T12:34:32.814405 [actor]: emily lives with me

2026-01-19T12:34:35.020218 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Emily lives with you.

Based on what you've told me so far, it sounds like you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Emily. 

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year? This is important because of the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-19T12:34:36.016547 [actor]: income below 60000

2026-01-19T12:34:37.979202 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your income is below £60,000.

That's good news regarding your Child Benefit claim, as it means you won't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

One more question - is Emily receiving any other benefits in her own right, such as Universal Credit or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance?

2026-01-19T12:34:38.719437 [actor]: no other benefits

2026-01-19T12:34:42.485523 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Emily is not receiving other benefits.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter Emily because:

1. She is 18 years old and in approved full-time education (HNC course at college)
2. She lives with you
3. Your income is below £60,000, so you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge
4. Emily is not claiming other benefits that might affect eligibility

You should be able to receive Child Benefit payments until Emily completes her approved education course or reaches age 20, whichever comes first.

If you haven't already applied, you can do so using the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which is available from the UK government.

2026-01-19T12:34:43.798064 [actor]: I understand now. Thank you for checking my eligibility for Child Benefit.

2026-01-19T12:34:46.310402 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for their 18-year-old daughter in full-time HNC education who lives with them, with income below £60,000 and no other benefits being claimed.
