2026-01-19T12:19:13.077618 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:19:14.872915 [actor]: I'll play the role of a UK resident inquiring about child benefit eligibility, following the scenario where I'm an 18-year-old's mother who may not be eligible due to his Universal Credit status.

my son living at home still

2026-01-19T12:19:16.312772 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a son who is 18 and living at home with you. 

Is your son in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved courses.

2026-01-19T12:19:17.056127 [actor]: A-levels studying yes

2026-01-19T12:19:19.019515 [root_agent]: Thank you. Since your son is 18 and studying A-levels (which counts as approved education), that meets one of the criteria for Child Benefit eligibility.

Are you responsible for your son? By this I mean, do you provide care for him, buy most of his things like clothes and food, and is he living with you most of the time?

2026-01-19T12:19:19.766117 [actor]: mother son lives with me

2026-01-19T12:19:21.095600 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son lives with you and you're his mother.

Is your son currently receiving Universal Credit in his own right?

2026-01-19T12:19:21.898534 [actor]: yes universal credit his own

2026-01-19T12:19:25.233591 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. This is important information for determining Child Benefit eligibility.

I need to inform you that if your son is 18, studying A-levels (approved education), but is claiming Universal Credit in his own right, you would not be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him.

When a young person aged 16 to 19 claims benefits in their own name (such as Universal Credit), they're considered to be financially independent, which affects the Child Benefit eligibility. The government rules state that Child Benefit cannot be paid for a child or young person who claims certain benefits themselves, including Universal Credit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit rules or other potential support that might be available to you?

2026-01-19T12:19:26.400542 [actor]: ok not eligible then

2026-01-19T12:19:29.116311 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because my 18-year-old son is claiming Universal Credit in his own right, which makes him financially independent for benefit purposes.
