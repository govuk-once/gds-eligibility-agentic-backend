First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T12:18:38.655424 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. So you are fostering a child named Liam who is 12 years old and living with you.

Do you receive any payments from your local council or authority for fostering Liam?

2026-01-19T12:18:39.418832 [actor]: council pays fostering allowance for him

2026-01-19T12:18:42.108393 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, since you're receiving a fostering allowance from the council for Liam, you would typically not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him.

According to the UK government guidelines, Child Benefit usually cannot be claimed for a foster child when you're receiving fostering allowances from a local council or authority. The fostering allowance you receive is designed to cover the costs of caring for Liam.

However, if you have other children who are not foster children and for whom you're responsible, you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for them, depending on other eligibility criteria.

2026-01-19T12:18:45.311611 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that foster children for whom a fostering allowance is being received from the local council are not eligible for Child Benefit.
