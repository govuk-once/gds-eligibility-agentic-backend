2026-01-19T12:23:26.889596 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in London.

Could you please tell me if you were receiving Child Benefit for Arthur before he went into the hospital?

2026-01-19T12:23:27.741254 [actor]: yes got child benefit

2026-01-19T12:23:30.067025 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you were already receiving Child Benefit for Arthur before his hospitalization.

Based on the information provided so far, it appears you remain eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit while Arthur is in the hospital. 

According to government guidelines, if your child goes into hospital, you can continue to get Child Benefit as long as you were eligible before they went in, and you still meet the other eligibility requirements.

Do you visit Arthur regularly while he's in the hospital?

2026-01-19T12:23:30.893409 [actor]: visit everyday bring clothes toys

2026-01-19T12:23:33.489977 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that you visit Arthur every day and bring him clothes and toys. This demonstrates that you're maintaining your parental responsibility while he's in the hospital.

This is good information, as it further confirms your continued eligibility for Child Benefit. When a child is in hospital, parents who maintain their parental responsibility by staying in regular contact and providing personal items remain eligible.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit while Arthur is in the hospital?

2026-01-19T12:23:35.707281 [actor]: Thank you for helping me understand. When will get money

2026-01-19T12:23:37.361282 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that a parent remains eligible for Child Benefit when their child is temporarily in hospital, as long as they were eligible before hospitalization and maintain parental responsibility.
