2026-01-19T12:28:08.216804 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine whether you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:28:09.244783 [actor]: Rashid son school A-levels

2026-01-19T12:28:10.831664 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son Rashid is in school studying A-levels. 

To clarify, are you responsible for Rashid (meaning you're raising him and he lives with you or you contribute substantially to his cost of living)?

2026-01-19T12:28:11.686157 [actor]: Yes he lives in our house

2026-01-19T12:28:12.678776 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Rashid lives in your house.

Is Rashid under 20 years old?

2026-01-19T12:28:13.397582 [actor]: 17 years

2026-01-19T12:28:14.931306 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Rashid is 17 years old and studying A-levels, that meets one of the key eligibility criteria.

Do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-19T12:28:15.689297 [actor]: Bradford UK yes

2026-01-19T12:28:17.185877 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you live in Bradford, UK.

Are you a UK citizen, or do you have the right to reside in the UK (such as having settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or being from the EEA with pre-settled status)?

2026-01-19T12:28:17.982766 [actor]: British citizen since birth

2026-01-19T12:28:19.569364 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you're a British citizen since birth.

Is your individual income (or your partner's if they earn more) over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T12:28:20.306610 [actor]: factory worker no rich

2026-01-19T12:28:23.040997 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you work in a factory and indicated your income isn't high.

To be more specific about the Child Benefit income threshold: If either you or a partner you live with has an individual income over £50,000 per year, you may have to pay a tax charge known as the "High Income Child Benefit Charge." This increases gradually until income reaches £60,000, at which point it effectively cancels out the benefit.

Is your individual income, or your partner's if you have one, over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-19T12:28:24.001570 [actor]: no money not rich

2026-01-19T12:28:28.054894 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your income situation.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have responsibility for your 17-year-old son Rashid who lives with you
- Rashid is studying A-levels (approved education)
- You live in the UK (Bradford)
- You're a British citizen
- Your income is below the £50,000 threshold

From this information, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. You meet all the key criteria - you're responsible for a child under 20 who is in approved education, you normally live in the UK, have the right to reside here, and your income doesn't trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to fill out the CH2 form which is available on the government website or by phone from the Child Benefit Office. If you haven't claimed before for Rashid, you can claim retrospectively for up to 3 months.

Is there anything specific about the Child Benefit that you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-19T12:28:29.046280 [actor]: Rashid got married recently wife moved in

2026-01-19T12:28:32.778500 [root_agent]: I appreciate you sharing this important information about Rashid getting married and his wife moving in. This changes the assessment.

When a young person gets married or enters into a civil partnership, they are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Even though Rashid is 17 and in approved education, his marriage status affects your eligibility to claim Child Benefit for him.

Based on this new information, you would not be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Rashid since he is married. The UK government considers married individuals to have formed their own family unit, even if they're still living in your home and in education.

If you're currently receiving Child Benefit for Rashid, you should inform the Child Benefit Office about this change in circumstances as soon as possible to avoid any overpayments that might need to be paid back.

2026-01-19T12:28:36.297075 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent gave correct information that Child Benefit is not payable for a young person who is married, as the UK government considers married individuals to have formed their own family unit.
