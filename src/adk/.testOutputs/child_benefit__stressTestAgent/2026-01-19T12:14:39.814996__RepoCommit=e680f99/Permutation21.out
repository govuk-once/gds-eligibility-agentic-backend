2026-01-19T12:22:44.550369 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T12:22:46.088445 [actor]: I'll help you engage with the agent as a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the role of someone in the situation where you're divorced with split custody of children.

Divorce kids split households

2026-01-19T12:22:47.658861 [root_agent]: I understand your situation involves divorce and split custody of your children. To help determine your Child Benefit eligibility, I'll ask questions one at a time.

In your case of split custody, do the children live with you at least part of the time?

2026-01-19T12:22:48.652698 [actor]: Live with my son Sam he's 10 ex has Ella

2026-01-19T12:22:50.673366 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that you live with your son Sam who is 10 years old, and your ex-partner has your daughter Ella.

Is Sam living with you on a permanent basis? Or is this a shared custody arrangement where he lives with you for a specific portion of time?

2026-01-19T12:22:51.411555 [actor]: Full time with me since divorce

2026-01-19T12:22:53.242443 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that your son Sam lives with you full time since your divorce.

Is Sam under 16 years old? (I know you mentioned he's 10, but I just need to confirm this for eligibility purposes.)

2026-01-19T12:22:54.188036 [actor]: Yes 10 years old school year 5

2026-01-19T12:22:55.720141 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Sam is 10 years old and in Year 5.

Are you responsible for raising Sam? This means you're the person who has the main day-to-day responsibility for his care.

2026-01-19T12:22:56.656874 [actor]: Yes do everything for him school meals homework bedtime

2026-01-19T12:22:57.880215 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you handle all aspects of Sam's daily care including school meals, homework, and bedtime routines.

Do you or your ex-partner already receive Child Benefit for Sam?

2026-01-19T12:22:58.918715 [actor]: Ex might claim not sure she has Ella

2026-01-19T12:23:01.000727 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. It's important to note that Child Benefit can only be claimed by one person for each child.

Do you know if your son Sam is still included in any Child Benefit claim your ex-partner might be making? This is important because if your ex-partner is still claiming for Sam despite him living with you full-time, this would need to be addressed.

2026-01-19T12:23:01.710623 [actor]: Don't know divorce last year

2026-01-19T12:23:04.277778 [root_agent]: I understand the divorce was recent and you're unsure about the current Child Benefit claims.

Since Sam now lives with you full-time and you're responsible for his care, you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him. If your ex-partner is currently receiving Child Benefit for Sam, they should notify HMRC about the change in circumstances.

Does anyone in your household (including yourself) have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-19T12:23:05.228385 [actor]: No teacher salary not that much

2026-01-19T12:23:08.018895 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your teacher's salary is below £50,000, you wouldn't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on what you've told me so far:
1. Your son Sam lives with you full-time
2. You're responsible for his day-to-day care
3. He is under 16 (10 years old)
4. Your income is below £50,000

You appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam. 

Would you like to know what you should do next to make a claim or update the existing arrangements?

2026-01-19T12:23:11.732625 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information based on the situation where the user has full custody of their 10-year-old son, meets all eligibility requirements, and has income below the £50,000 threshold.
