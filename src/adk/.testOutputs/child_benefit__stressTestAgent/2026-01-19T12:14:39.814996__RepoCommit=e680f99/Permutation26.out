2026-01-19T12:24:41.273455 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, are you responsible for raising a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T12:24:42.304987 [actor]: child benefit son Zahid 15 lives with aunt

2026-01-19T12:24:44.039795 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that your son Zahid is 15 years old and lives with his aunt. To help determine your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to understand more about this living arrangement.

Does Zahid's aunt receive Child Benefit for him already, or are you currently the person receiving Child Benefit for Zahid?

2026-01-19T12:24:45.075482 [actor]: aunt doesn't claim send £15 weekly to aunt for Zahid

2026-01-19T12:24:46.573214 [root_agent]: I understand that you send £15 weekly to Zahid's aunt for his care, and that his aunt doesn't currently claim Child Benefit for him.

To continue assessing your eligibility, could you clarify why Zahid lives with his aunt rather than with you? Is this a temporary or permanent arrangement?

2026-01-19T12:24:47.461321 [actor]: grandmother also sends money £15 per week

2026-01-19T12:24:49.351023 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that the grandmother also contributes £15 per week toward Zahid's care.

I need to understand more about the living arrangement. Is Zahid living with his aunt on a temporary basis or is this a permanent arrangement? And could you explain the circumstances of why he lives with his aunt rather than with you?

2026-01-19T12:24:50.381774 [actor]: permanent with aunt school near her house

2026-01-19T12:24:52.178575 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Zahid lives permanently with his aunt because her home is near his school.

For Child Benefit eligibility, I need to understand who is primarily responsible for Zahid's day-to-day care. Would you say that Zahid's aunt is the person who is primarily responsible for his day-to-day care, with you and the grandmother providing financial support?

2026-01-19T12:24:53.235251 [actor]: aunt takes care of him daily we send money

2026-01-19T12:24:57.288579 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Zahid's aunt takes care of him daily while you and the grandmother send money to support him.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears that Zahid's aunt would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for him since:

1. Zahid lives with her permanently
2. She is responsible for his day-to-day care
3. She lives near his school and provides his primary care

In situations where a child lives with someone else, the person who has day-to-day responsibility for the child is typically the one eligible to claim Child Benefit. Your financial contributions are important, but for Child Benefit purposes, it's the person providing the daily care who would normally be eligible to claim.

Would you like me to explain how Zahid's aunt could apply for Child Benefit if she hasn't done so already?

2026-01-19T12:24:58.155491 [actor]: how much is child benefit each week?

2026-01-19T12:25:01.363782 [root_agent]: Child Benefit is currently paid at two different rates:

- For the eldest or only child: £25.60 per week
- For each additional child: £16.95 per week

These are the current rates as of April 2024. Child Benefit is typically paid every 4 weeks on a Monday or Tuesday, though it can be paid weekly if the recipient is a single parent or if the family receives certain other benefits.

If Zahid's aunt were to claim Child Benefit for him, she would receive £25.60 per week if he's her only child, or £16.95 per week if she already receives Child Benefit for another child who is considered her eldest.

2026-01-19T12:25:02.253800 [actor]: name Mo age 40 son Zahid

2026-01-19T12:25:06.211340 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Mo. At age 40, with your son Zahid (15) living permanently with his aunt who provides his day-to-day care, it appears that his aunt would be the person eligible to claim the Child Benefit of £25.60 per week (if he's the only child she cares for) or £16.95 per week (if she already receives Child Benefit for another child).

While you're providing financial support by sending £15 weekly, which is certainly important, the eligibility for Child Benefit is typically based on who has the day-to-day caring responsibility for the child. In this case, that appears to be Zahid's aunt.

Would you like to know if there are any other benefits or support you might be eligible for as a parent who provides financial support to your child living elsewhere?

2026-01-19T12:25:07.363217 [actor]: is £15 + £15 from grandmother enough for benefit?

2026-01-19T12:25:11.477862 [root_agent]: I need to clarify something important: The financial contributions you and the grandmother make (£15 each, totaling £30 per week) don't affect Child Benefit eligibility in the way you might be thinking.

Child Benefit isn't based on how much money is contributed to a child's upkeep. Instead, it's based on who has the primary responsibility for caring for the child day-to-day.

Since Zahid lives permanently with his aunt and she provides his daily care, she would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for him - regardless of the amount of money you and the grandmother contribute.

The £30 total weekly contribution from you and the grandmother is helpful for Zahid's expenses, but it doesn't determine Child Benefit eligibility. The aunt would be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount (£25.60 per week if he's her only child) based on her caring role, not based on the financial contributions she receives from you and the grandmother.

Does that help clarify the situation?

2026-01-19T12:25:12.594231 [actor]: can claim child benefit if pay for child maintenance?

2026-01-19T12:25:15.676476 [root_agent]: No, paying child maintenance alone doesn't make you eligible to claim Child Benefit. 

Child Benefit eligibility is primarily based on who has the day-to-day responsibility for caring for the child, rather than who provides financial support. Since Zahid lives permanently with his aunt and she provides his daily care, she would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit, even though you pay child maintenance (your weekly £15 contribution).

This is because the UK government's Child Benefit system is designed to support the person who has the everyday responsibility for raising the child - in this case, Zahid's aunt.

Even though your financial support is important and commendable, it doesn't change the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, which is focused on who provides the actual day-to-day care.

2026-01-19T12:25:16.555161 [actor]: if send enough money can claim child benefit?

2026-01-19T12:25:19.633166 [root_agent]: I want to be very clear on this point: No, sending more money would not make you eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid.

The amount of money you contribute - whether it's £15, £150, or more per week - does not affect Child Benefit eligibility. Child Benefit is designed to go to the person who has the day-to-day caring responsibility for the child, not necessarily the person who provides financial support.

Since Zahid lives permanently with his aunt and she provides his daily care, she would remain the eligible person to claim Child Benefit regardless of how much financial support you provide.

The UK government's rules on this are quite specific - the key factor is who has the responsibility for the child's day-to-day care, not who provides financial support.

2026-01-19T12:25:23.770185 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent clearly explained that Child Benefit goes to the person with day-to-day caring responsibility (the aunt) rather than to someone who provides financial support remotely, which aligns with UK government rules.
