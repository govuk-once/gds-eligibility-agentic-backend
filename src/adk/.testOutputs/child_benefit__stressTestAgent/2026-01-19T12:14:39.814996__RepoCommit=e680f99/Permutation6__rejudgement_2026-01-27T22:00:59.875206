The UK government guidelines state that Child Benefit normally stops after 12 weeks of hospitalization, but continues if the parent spends money on the child's upkeep (which is the exception that applies here). The agent incorrectly stated that Child Benefit continues regardless of hospital stay length without mentioning this 12-week rule.
