2026-01-19T12:17:11.281472 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. To assess your eligibility accurately, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T12:17:12.203140 [actor]: child in care but comes home weekends

2026-01-19T12:17:13.791748 [root_agent]: I understand that your child is in care but comes home on weekends. Thank you for sharing that information.

To better understand your situation regarding Child Benefit eligibility, could you tell me if your child is in residential care provided by a local authority or in another care arrangement?

2026-01-19T12:17:14.647812 [actor]: social services care 3 months

2026-01-19T12:17:16.243895 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your child has been in social services care for 3 months and comes home on weekends.

For Child Benefit purposes, this is an important detail. Could you please confirm whether you were receiving Child Benefit for this child before they went into care?

2026-01-19T12:17:17.357079 [actor]: yes was getting money before

2026-01-19T12:17:22.090504 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information.

Based on what you've shared, you may still be eligible to receive Child Benefit while your child is in local authority care, since you were receiving it before they went into care and your child still regularly comes home to stay with you on weekends.

According to UK government guidelines, if your child is in residential care provided by a local authority but regularly spends time at home with you (like weekends in your case), you can usually continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks after they go into care.

Since your child has been in care for 3 months (approximately 12 weeks), you may be approaching the end of this period. To continue receiving Child Benefit beyond 12 weeks, the time your child spends at home with you needs to be frequent enough - generally at least one day each week.

Would you like me to explain what steps you might need to take regarding your Child Benefit claim given your current situation?

2026-01-19T12:17:22.956305 [actor]: child stays friday evening until sunday evening every week

2026-01-19T12:17:27.010955 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. This is very helpful.

Since your child stays with you from Friday evening until Sunday evening every week, this regular pattern of contact means you likely remain eligible for Child Benefit even beyond the initial 12-week period.

The UK government rules state that if your child regularly spends at least 24 hours with you, you can usually continue to receive Child Benefit. Your arrangement of weekend stays (Friday evening to Sunday evening) would typically meet this requirement as it's both regular and exceeds 24 hours each time.

Given this information, you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit despite your child being in local authority care. However, it would be advisable to inform the Child Benefit Office about your current arrangement if you haven't already done so, to ensure your payments continue correctly.

Is there anything specific about your Child Benefit payments that you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-19T12:17:27.956225 [actor]: so am I eligible or not

2026-01-19T12:17:30.918181 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, yes, you are eligible for Child Benefit.

Since:
- Your child was in your care before going into local authority care
- Your child has been in care for about 3 months
- Your child regularly stays with you from Friday evening to Sunday evening each week (which is more than 24 hours of regular contact)

These regular weekend stays mean you meet the UK government's requirements for continuing to receive Child Benefit for a child in local authority care.

If you haven't already done so, I would recommend informing the Child Benefit Office about your current arrangement to ensure your payments continue without interruption.

2026-01-19T12:17:33.476535 [actor]: Thank you for confirming. Will do that.

2026-01-19T12:17:35.079489 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit because their child regularly stays with them for more than 24 hours weekly while in local authority care.
