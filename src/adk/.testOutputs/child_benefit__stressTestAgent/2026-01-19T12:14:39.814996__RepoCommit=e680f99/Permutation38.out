2026-01-19T12:29:28.538686 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To properly assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:29:29.343689 [actor]: baby child benefit

2026-01-19T12:29:31.256336 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about Child Benefit for a baby. To determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit for your baby, I'll need to ask you some questions one by one.

First, are you responsible for caring for this baby? By responsible, I mean the baby lives with you, or you contribute to their upbringing and maintenance at least equal to the amount of Child Benefit.

2026-01-19T12:29:32.166344 [actor]: yes have baby 4 months

2026-01-19T12:29:33.158158 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. That's helpful information.

Is your baby living with you in the UK?

2026-01-19T12:29:34.078970 [actor]: yes baby tom jerry house

2026-01-19T12:29:35.603478 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your baby lives with you.

Is either you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control with the condition that you cannot claim public funds?

2026-01-19T12:29:36.375031 [actor]: not immigration uk citizen

2026-01-19T12:29:37.528316 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T12:29:38.321350 [actor]: no money under limit

2026-01-19T12:29:41.242328 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your income is under the limit.

Based on the information you've provided so far, it appears you are likely eligible for Child Benefit for your 4-month-old baby. You:
- Are responsible for caring for your baby
- Live with your baby in the UK
- Are a UK citizen (not subject to immigration control)
- Have an income under the £60,000 threshold

You can claim Child Benefit as soon as your baby is born or comes to live with you. The claim can be backdated for up to 3 months.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T12:29:43.346490 [actor]: we forgot to claim sooner can we get money from birth

2026-01-19T12:29:46.279883 [root_agent]: Yes, you can still get Child Benefit payments from when your baby was born, but with some limitations.

Child Benefit claims can be backdated for up to 3 months from the date your claim is received. Since your baby is 4 months old, you would be able to claim from when your baby was 1 month old, but unfortunately not from birth.

I would recommend submitting your claim as soon as possible to maximize the backdated amount you can receive. Even though you can't get payments all the way back to birth, you can still receive payments from the earliest eligible backdated date.

2026-01-19T12:29:47.595132 [actor]: not happy about missing money

2026-01-19T12:29:49.698270 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the person is eligible for Child Benefit with their 4-month-old baby and correctly explained that claims can only be backdated for up to 3 months.
