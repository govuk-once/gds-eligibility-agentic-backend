2026-01-19T12:28:37.611610 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T12:28:40.177328 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. So you're asking about Child Benefit for a 16-year-old named Kelly who is going to college in September.

To clarify, is Kelly your child or a child you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T12:28:41.162270 [actor]: daughter Kelly 16 just finished GCSEs going to college September A-levels

2026-01-19T12:28:43.400108 [root_agent]: I understand that Kelly is your 16-year-old daughter who has just finished her GCSEs and will be starting A-levels at college in September.

This is helpful information. Child Benefit can continue for children aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training.

Is Kelly going to be in full-time education (like A-levels) that's not advanced education (like a university degree)?

2026-01-19T12:28:44.403516 [actor]: Yes A-levels starting September worried about now August

2026-01-19T12:28:48.201545 [root_agent]: I understand your concern about the period between Kelly finishing her GCSEs and starting her A-levels in September.

Based on the information you've provided, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit for Kelly during this period (August) and when she starts her A-levels in September.

Child Benefit continues for a child who is 16 or over if they're in approved education, which includes A-levels. There's also typically a continuation of benefit during the period between leaving one course and starting another, as long as they've enrolled in the next course.

Do you currently receive Child Benefit for Kelly, or are you applying for the first time?

2026-01-19T12:28:49.075462 [actor]: Receiving worried stop August

2026-01-19T12:28:52.261547 [root_agent]: I understand your concern. You're currently receiving Child Benefit for Kelly and you're worried it might stop in August between her finishing GCSEs and starting A-levels in September.

Good news - your Child Benefit should continue during this period. Child Benefit payments typically continue during the short breaks between approved courses, such as the summer break between GCSEs and starting A-levels.

Since Kelly is 16 and will be continuing in approved education (A-levels) in September, your Child Benefit payments should continue without interruption through August and beyond as long as she remains in approved education up to age 19.

Is there anything specific about your situation that makes you concerned about the August payments?

2026-01-19T12:28:53.187966 [actor]: August gap not in school worried about payment

2026-01-19T12:28:56.891251 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying your concern. I understand you're worried about the August gap when Kelly is not in school and how it might affect your Child Benefit payments.

I can reassure you that Child Benefit should continue during the August gap between Kelly finishing her GCSEs and starting A-levels in September. The UK government recognizes these normal breaks in education, and your payments should continue uninterrupted.

You don't need to take any special action regarding your Child Benefit for this period, as long as Kelly is enrolled to start her A-levels in September and she's under 19 years old.

Is there anything else about your Child Benefit situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-19T12:29:00.582332 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit continues during the gap between GCSEs and starting A-levels, as long as the child is enrolled for approved education in September.
