2026-01-19T12:26:14.593594 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T12:26:15.435242 [actor]: child benefit question teen son

2026-01-19T12:26:16.525586 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit regarding your teenage son, I need to ask some specific questions.

How old is your teenage son?

2026-01-19T12:26:17.222924 [actor]: Jordan 17

2026-01-19T12:26:18.854798 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Jordan is 17, I need to understand a bit more about his current situation to determine Child Benefit eligibility.

Is Jordan currently in approved education or training? This would include things like school, college, or certain types of training programs.

2026-01-19T12:26:19.667071 [actor]: no college no work

2026-01-19T12:26:21.471237 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to clarify something about Jordan's current situation.

Since Jordan is 17 and you mentioned he's not in college or work, could you tell me if he is registered for work or training with a careers service, Connexions (in England), Careers Wales, or Skills Development Scotland?

2026-01-19T12:26:22.298145 [actor]: not registered anywhere finished GCSEs

2026-01-19T12:26:25.368712 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Jordan is not registered anywhere and has finished his GCSEs.

Based on this information, I need to inform you that you would likely not be eligible for Child Benefit for Jordan at this time. 

Child Benefit typically continues for children until they turn 16, or until they turn 20 if they stay in approved education or training. Since Jordan is 17, not in education or training, and not registered with a careers service, he doesn't meet the eligibility criteria for continued Child Benefit.

If Jordan's situation changes - for example, if he starts approved education or training before his 19th birthday, or registers with a careers service - you may become eligible again. Would you like me to explain more about what counts as approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:26:27.218701 [actor]: no money then for Jordan

2026-01-19T12:26:28.533374 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available for a 17-year-old who is not in approved education or training and not registered with a careers service.
