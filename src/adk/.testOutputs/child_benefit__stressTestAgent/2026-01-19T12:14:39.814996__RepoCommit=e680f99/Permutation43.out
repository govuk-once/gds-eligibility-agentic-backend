2026-01-19T12:31:18.967960 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:31:20.030766 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

son 17 apprentice glasgow

2026-01-19T12:31:21.746654 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I understand you have a 17-year-old son who is an apprentice in Glasgow.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you confirm whether your son's apprenticeship is considered approved education or training in the UK? Typically, most apprenticeships would qualify, but I want to make sure.

2026-01-19T12:31:22.595713 [actor]: modern apprenticeship scotland my son started last month

2026-01-19T12:31:24.553749 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Modern apprenticeships in Scotland typically do qualify as approved education or training, which means your 17-year-old son would generally meet this criterion for Child Benefit.

My next question is: Does your son normally live with you, or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit rates to support them?

2026-01-19T12:31:25.356330 [actor]: lives with me and his father glasgow

2026-01-19T12:31:27.876913 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your 17-year-old son lives with you and his father in Glasgow, that helps establish your eligibility.

Now I need to ask about your immigration status: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have the right to live in the UK? This could be through UK citizenship, settled status, or another immigration status that allows you to live in the UK.

2026-01-19T12:31:28.732649 [actor]: uk citizens both of us

2026-01-19T12:31:30.554227 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both you and your partner are UK citizens.

Now I need to ask about income levels, as this affects Child Benefit payments. Is either you or your partner's individual income over £50,000 per year (before tax)?

2026-01-19T12:31:31.559335 [actor]: no income not high

2026-01-19T12:31:35.252613 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that neither you nor your partner has an income over £50,000 per year.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have a 17-year-old son on a modern apprenticeship in Scotland (qualifying approved training)
- Your son lives with you and his father in Glasgow
- You and your partner are UK citizens
- Neither of you has an income over £50,000 per year

I can confirm that you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Since your son is in approved training and neither you nor your partner earns over £50,000 annually, you should be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount without the High Income Child Benefit Charge applying.

Would you like information about how to claim Child Benefit or the current payment rates?

2026-01-19T12:31:36.678103 [actor]: I understand you've determined my eligibility for Child Benefit. Thank you for confirming this information.

2026-01-19T12:31:38.835592 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a 17-year-old on a modern apprenticeship in Scotland with parents who are UK citizens and earn below £50,000 qualifies for Child Benefit.
