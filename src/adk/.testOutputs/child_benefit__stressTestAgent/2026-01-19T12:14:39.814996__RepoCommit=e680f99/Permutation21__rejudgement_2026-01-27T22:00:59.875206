2026-01-27T22:03:06.276402 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed to correctly explain that in a split family situation where each parent has one child living with them full-time, both parents are entitled to the higher "eldest child" rate (£26.05) for their respective child. This key information was missing from the agent's eligibility assessment.
