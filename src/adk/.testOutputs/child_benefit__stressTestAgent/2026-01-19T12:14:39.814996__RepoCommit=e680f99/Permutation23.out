2026-01-19T12:23:39.154737 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T12:23:40.898544 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user in the scenario you provided. I'll be playing Kevin, who doesn't live with his daughter Sarah but provides lump sum contributions for her care.

2026-01-19T12:23:42.457919 [root_agent]: I'll help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit based on your situation, Kevin. Let me ask questions one by one.

Since you don't live with your daughter Sarah, does anyone else have primary day-to-day responsibility for caring for her?

2026-01-19T12:23:43.405787 [actor]: daughter 12 lives with mother

2026-01-19T12:23:44.832126 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that your 12-year-old daughter Sarah lives with her mother.

Is Sarah's mother currently receiving Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-19T12:23:46.009965 [actor]: yes mother gets it

2026-01-19T12:23:49.618772 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Sarah's mother already receives Child Benefit for her.

Based on the information you've provided, you wouldn't be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah since:

1. You don't have primary day-to-day care responsibility for her
2. Her mother is already receiving Child Benefit for her

In the UK, only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. Since Sarah lives with her mother who already claims and receives the benefit, you wouldn't be eligible to claim it, even though you provide financial support through lump sum contributions.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other potential support available to you as a parent who doesn't have primary custody?

2026-01-19T12:23:53.277071 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Kevin is not eligible for Child Benefit since the child lives with the mother who already receives the benefit, and only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child.
