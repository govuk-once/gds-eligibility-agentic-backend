First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T12:21:16.565384 [actor]: I need to role-play as a UK resident seeking information about child benefit eligibility. I'll be intentionally obtuse and speak like I'm entering search terms into a search engine.

2026-01-19T12:21:18.488875 [root_agent]: I understand you have two children and there may be a connection to the army in Germany. To properly assess your Child Benefit eligibility, I'll need to ask some specific questions.

Are you or your partner a UK national who is serving in the armed forces and stationed in Germany?

2026-01-19T12:21:20.762467 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. As a UK soldier posted in Germany with your family living on base, I need to understand a bit more about your situation.

How old are your children?

2026-01-19T12:21:21.646060 [actor]: kids 8 and 10 years old

2026-01-19T12:21:22.942268 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your children are 8 and 10 years old.

Are both children living with you and your family on the base in Germany?

2026-01-19T12:21:23.887046 [actor]: yes both children germany military base with us

2026-01-19T12:21:28.159071 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both children are living with you on the military base in Germany.

Based on the information you've provided, you would generally be eligible for Child Benefit. UK armed forces personnel stationed abroad (including in Germany) with their families can claim Child Benefit for children living with them, as you're considered to be living in the UK for Child Benefit purposes.

UK armed forces families stationed overseas are treated as if they are still living in the UK for benefit purposes, which means you maintain your eligibility for Child Benefit while serving abroad.

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to complete the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can get through the UK government website or through your unit's welfare officer.

Is there anything specific about your Child Benefit eligibility that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-19T12:21:31.727675 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that UK armed forces personnel stationed abroad with their families can claim Child Benefit for their children as they're considered to be living in the UK for benefit purposes.
