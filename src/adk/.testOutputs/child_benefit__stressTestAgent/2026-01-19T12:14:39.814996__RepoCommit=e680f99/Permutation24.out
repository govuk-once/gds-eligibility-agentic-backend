2026-01-19T12:23:54.660661 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First, do you have any children who live with you?

2026-01-19T12:23:55.796738 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

disability son school residential accommodation council paid 10 weeks

2026-01-19T12:23:57.405241 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. To understand your situation better and assess your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to ask some specific questions.

Does your son with a disability stay in residential school accommodation that is paid for by the council for 10 weeks at a time?

2026-01-19T12:23:58.527244 [actor]: residential school council paid severe behavior needs 10 weeks so far not home tom 14

2026-01-19T12:24:00.898069 [root_agent]: I understand your son Tom, who is 14, has severe behavioral needs and is currently in a residential school that's council-funded. He's been there for 10 weeks so far and is not currently at home.

To continue assessing your Child Benefit eligibility, could you tell me if Tom comes home regularly for weekends or holidays, or is he staying at the residential school continuously?

2026-01-19T12:24:02.240631 [actor]: stays there all the time needs special care severe behavioral issues not coming home weekends

2026-01-19T12:24:03.802545 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that Tom stays at the residential school all the time due to his severe behavioral issues and special care needs, and he's not coming home on weekends.

In terms of your Child Benefit eligibility, may I ask if you were receiving Child Benefit for Tom before he entered the residential school?

2026-01-19T12:24:04.665348 [actor]: yes benefit before school started money helps with his needs

2026-01-19T12:24:08.003125 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Tom is in residential accommodation that's being paid for by the council, and he doesn't come home regularly, this affects your Child Benefit eligibility.

Based on UK government guidelines, Child Benefit usually stops after 12 weeks if your child enters residential care or accommodation provided by a local authority. Since Tom has been there for 10 weeks so far, you may still be eligible to receive Child Benefit for another 2 weeks.

However, I should ask - does Tom come home at all, even if rarely, such as for holidays or special occasions?

2026-01-19T12:24:09.457857 [actor]: no home time too difficult behavior council says stay there all time for now maybe review later

2026-01-19T12:24:12.779510 [root_agent]: I understand. Since Tom doesn't come home at all due to his behavioral challenges, and the council has advised he should stay at the residential school full-time for now (with a potential review later), this affects your Child Benefit eligibility.

Based on the UK government rules, if your child is in residential care provided by a local authority and doesn't come home regularly, Child Benefit payments typically stop after 12 weeks. As Tom has been there for 10 weeks, you may continue receiving Child Benefit for about 2 more weeks, but then it would likely stop.

When the council reviews the situation later, if Tom starts coming home regularly (such as weekends or holidays), you might become eligible again.

May I ask if you have any other children living with you?

2026-01-19T12:24:17.298659 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that for a child in council-funded residential accommodation who doesn't come home regularly, Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks, and since the child has been there for 10 weeks, they are still eligible for 2 more weeks.
