2026-01-19T12:15:49.735547 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility correctly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First question: Are you responsible for raising a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T12:15:50.849934 [actor]: Sofia my daughter 18 not school working receptionist

2026-01-19T12:15:53.146696 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since your daughter Sofia is 18 and working as a receptionist rather than being in approved education or training, I need to check a key eligibility factor.

Is Sofia currently in any form of approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, T levels, or other approved courses.

2026-01-19T12:15:54.217751 [actor]: Left school 2 years ago works 30 hours receptionist no courses

2026-01-19T12:15:57.066124 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Sofia left school 2 years ago, works 30 hours as a receptionist, and is not taking any courses.

Based on this information, I need to inform you that you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia. Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 16, or for young people aged 16-19 if they are in approved education or training.

Since Sofia is 18, not in education or training, and is working full-time as a receptionist, she doesn't meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-19T12:15:58.431463 [actor]: I understand now. Thank you for checking my eligibility for Child Benefit.

2026-01-19T12:16:00.617017 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available for an 18-year-old who is working and not in approved education or training.
