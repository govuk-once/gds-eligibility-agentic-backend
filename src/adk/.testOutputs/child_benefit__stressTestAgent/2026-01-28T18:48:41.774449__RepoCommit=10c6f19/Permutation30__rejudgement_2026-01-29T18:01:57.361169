**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user (Lucas) is **eligible for Child Benefit**. This aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points the agent got right:**

1. **Eligibility determination**: The agent correctly established that Lucas meets all the basic eligibility criteria (has a child under 16, lives in UK, child lives with him, he's the main caregiver).

2. **High Income Child Benefit Charge**: The agent properly identified that while Lucas earns £18,000 (under the threshold), his wife Emily earns £65,000 (over £60,000), which triggers the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

3. **Liability for the charge**: Most importantly, the agent correctly stated that **Emily (the higher earner) would be responsible for paying back the charge through Self Assessment**, not Lucas (the claimant). This matches the expected outcome exactly.

4. **Clear communication**: The agent clearly distinguished between eligibility (which Lucas has) and the tax charge (which Emily must pay).

The agent's final confirmation that "you are eligible for Child Benefit" directly communicates the correct outcome. The agent also properly explained that Lucas can receive the payments while Emily bears the tax liability, which is precisely the scenario described in the expected outcome.
