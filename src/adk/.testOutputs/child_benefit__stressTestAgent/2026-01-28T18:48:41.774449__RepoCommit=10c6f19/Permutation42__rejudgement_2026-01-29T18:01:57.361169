**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

The agent's assessment was thorough and accurate:

1. The agent correctly identified that the 17-year-old daughter qualifies as she is under 20
2. Crucially, the agent correctly recognized that **Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales** are considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes, noting they are "generally considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes as they're funded by the Welsh Government"
3. The agent verified all other eligibility criteria (residence, responsibility, no duplicate claims, no immigration restrictions)

This is particularly important because the scenario specifically tests knowledge of the **Regional Exception (Wales)** - while most apprenticeships would be disqualifying in England, Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are listed as "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes. The agent correctly applied this regional exception and communicated the correct eligible outcome to the user.
