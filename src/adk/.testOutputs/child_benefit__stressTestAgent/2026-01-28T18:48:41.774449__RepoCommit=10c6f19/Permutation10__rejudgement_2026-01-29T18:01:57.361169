**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that Brenda is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of the situation**: The agent properly identified that this was a formal local authority fostering arrangement where the council pays for Liam's upkeep.

2. **Accurate application of eligibility rules**: The agent correctly explained that foster carers cannot claim Child Benefit when the local authority is paying for the child's accommodation or maintenance, as confirmed by the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility.

3. **Clear communication**: The agent stated explicitly: "you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam" and provided the correct reasoning - that the local authority is considered responsible for the child in formal fostering arrangements where they pay for upkeep.

4. **Helpful additional information**: The agent appropriately mentioned circumstances under which eligibility could change (adoption, special guardianship, or kinship care arrangements).

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** as specified in Criteria 4 of the scenario, which states that Child Benefit cannot be claimed for a fostered child when the council is paying for their accommodation or maintenance.
