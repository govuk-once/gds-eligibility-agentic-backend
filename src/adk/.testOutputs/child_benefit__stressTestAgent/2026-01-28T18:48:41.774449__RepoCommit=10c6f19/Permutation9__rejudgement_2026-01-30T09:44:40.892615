**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Responsibility (Criterion 1):** The user confirmed they look after their 5-year-old son who lives with them - ✓

2. **Child's Age (Criterion 2):** The son is 5 years old, well under the 16-year threshold - ✓

3. **Residency and Right to Reside (Criterion 3):** This is the critical criterion. The user has Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme and is actively seeking work as a registered jobseeker. According to the scenario description, "Holders of Pre-Settled Status can claim Child Benefit if they are working or meet specific 'right to reside' tests, such as being a registered jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work." The user explicitly mentioned being a "jobseeker" in their first response - ✓

4. **No competing claims:** No one else is claiming Child Benefit for the child - ✓

5. **Not in hospital/care:** The child is not in hospital or local authority care - ✓

The agent appropriately recognized that Pre-Settled Status combined with jobseeker status provides a qualifying right to reside for Child Benefit purposes. The eligibility determination communicated by the agent matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
