**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of the key issue:** The agent properly identified that when a child doesn't live with the claimant, eligibility requires the claimant to contribute "at least as much" as the person the child lives with.

2. **Accurate assessment of contributions:** The agent recognized that the user's £10/week contribution (plus an annual birthday present) would be substantially less than what the mother contributes toward housing, accommodation, utilities, day-to-day food, clothing, and other living expenses.

3. **Clear communication:** The agent explicitly stated "you would likely not be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation" and provided a clear explanation of why.

4. **Alignment with criteria:** According to the scenario, to be considered "responsible" when the child doesn't live with you, contributions must be "at least the same amount as the Child Benefit payment (£26.05/week)." The user's £10/week falls well short of this threshold. The agent's reasoning, while not citing the specific £26.05 figure, correctly concludes ineligibility based on the insufficient contribution relative to what the resident parent provides.

The agent's eligibility determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
