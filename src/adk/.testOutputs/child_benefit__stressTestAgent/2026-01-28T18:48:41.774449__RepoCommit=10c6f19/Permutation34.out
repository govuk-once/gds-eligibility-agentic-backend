2026-01-28T19:09:58.826488 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this, I need to ask you a few questions.

Let me start with the first one:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:10:01.157242 [actor]: child benfit mark 15 yrs old in custdy for 10 weks

2026-01-28T19:10:03.375713 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Mark is 15 years old and is currently in custody for 10 weeks.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Before Mark went into custody, were you receiving Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T19:10:05.325513 [actor]: yes was gettin child benfit for mark before he went in

2026-01-28T19:10:07.402663 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Now I need to ask:

**Is Mark expected to return to live with you after the 10 weeks in custody are finished?**

2026-01-28T19:10:09.186585 [actor]: he comes bak in 2 months sentence is 6 months total

2026-01-28T19:10:11.821653 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Mark has a 6-month sentence and will be back with you in 2 months.

Let me ask you this:

**Are you still responsible for Mark's maintenance and care while he's in custody - for example, are you still providing financial support, staying in contact with him, or involved in decisions about his welfare?**

2026-01-28T19:10:13.409127 [actor]: still payin for his fone and visitin him every week

2026-01-28T19:10:15.707402 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information - it's clear you're maintaining contact and providing financial support for Mark while he's in custody.

Now, one more important question:

**Are you (or your partner if you have one) the person Mark normally lives with when he's not in custody?**

2026-01-28T19:10:17.302845 [actor]: yes mark lives with me normally hes my son

2026-01-28T19:10:22.565328 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility for Child Benefit.

**You should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Mark** while he's in custody. Here's why:

✓ Mark is under 16 years old (he's 15)
✓ You were already receiving Child Benefit for him before custody
✓ Mark normally lives with you - he's your son
✓ You're maintaining responsibility for him (visiting weekly, paying for his phone)
✓ He's expected to return to live with you after his sentence

**Important:** Child Benefit can continue for up to **8 weeks** while a child is in custody, as long as they're expected to return to live with you afterwards. However, since Mark's sentence is 6 months total, you'll need to be aware that:

- Child Benefit will continue for the first 8 weeks of his time in custody
- After 8 weeks, the payments will stop
- When Mark returns home to live with you, you can claim Child Benefit again

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-28T19:10:24.501321 [actor]: ok so i dont get it now because hes been in 10 weeks already?

2026-01-28T19:10:28.830046 [root_agent]: You're right to check that - let me clarify based on the timeline you've given me.

If Mark has already been in custody for **10 weeks**, then yes, your Child Benefit payments would have stopped after the first **8 weeks** of his custody.

This means:
- Weeks 1-8 of custody: You continued to receive Child Benefit ✓
- Week 9 onwards: Child Benefit stopped ✗

However, the good news is that **when Mark returns home to live with you**, you can claim Child Benefit for him again.

Since he has a 6-month sentence total and has already served 10 weeks, he should be coming home in the coming weeks. Once he's back living with you, you'll be able to restart your Child Benefit claim.

Does this make sense, or do you have any other questions about this?

2026-01-28T19:10:30.647187 [actor]: ok so not eligble now but can claim wen he comes home got it thanks

2026-01-28T19:10:32.946035 [root_agent]: That's exactly right! You've got it:

- **Not eligible now** - because he's been in custody for more than 8 weeks
- **Can claim again when he comes home** - as soon as Mark returns to live with you

You're welcome! If you have any other questions in the future about Child Benefit or when Mark comes home, feel free to ask.

Take care!

2026-01-28T19:10:39.087992 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit continues for only 8 weeks during custody, correctly identified that the claimant is not currently eligible since the child has been in custody for 10 weeks (exceeding the 8-week limit), and properly advised that eligibility can be reinstated when the child returns home.
