**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated the eligibility outcome that aligns with the expected outcome: **Pete is Not Eligible / Sue is Eligible**.

Here's why this assessment is correct:

1. **The agent identified Pete as the user**: The user stated the child "stays with me 3 days and ex 4 days," making the user Pete (3 days) and the ex-partner Sue (4 days).

2. **Correct application of priority rules**: The agent properly explained that:
   - Both meet basic eligibility criteria (Criteria 1: Dual Responsibility)
   - Only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child (Criteria 2: Priority Rule)
   - When parents cannot agree, HMRC decides based on who the child lives with most (Criteria 3: Decision Mechanism)

3. **Correct outcome communicated**: The agent clearly stated multiple times that the ex-partner (Sue, with 4 days) would "likely" or "probably" receive the benefit, while Pete (with 3 days) would not, which matches the expected outcome.

4. **Accurate explanation**: The agent correctly cited the relevant principle from gov.uk guidance that when care is disputed and relatively equal, the person with whom the child spends more time typically receives the benefit.

The agent's conclusion that "your ex-partner will probably get it because Hollie stays there 4 days compared to 3 days with you" directly communicates that Pete is not eligible while Sue is eligible, which matches the expected outcome perfectly.
