**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of "Eligible."

The agent's assessment was thorough and accurate:

1. **Responsibility**: Confirmed the applicant is responsible for the child (pays for food, clothes, rent, bills)
2. **Child's Age and Education**: Verified the daughter is 17 (under 20) and studying full-time A-levels at sixth form college (approved education)
3. **Residency and Immigration**: Confirmed UK citizen living in London
4. **Living Arrangements**: Established the daughter lives with the applicant
5. **No Duplicate Claims**: Verified no one else is claiming Child Benefit for the daughter
6. **High Income Child Benefit Charge**: Confirmed income of £40,000 is below the £60,000 threshold

The agent provided a clear, well-structured response explaining why the applicant is eligible and even noted that eligibility can continue until the daughter turns 20 as long as she remains in approved education. This matches perfectly with the expected outcome that Amit (the single father with a 17-year-old daughter studying A-levels and earning £40,000) is eligible for Child Benefit.
