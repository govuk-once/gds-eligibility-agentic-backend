**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** without any time limitation or qualification about the 12-week rule. The agent's final assessment stated: "Yes, based on the information you've provided, you should be eligible for Child Benefit" - presenting this as an ongoing, indefinite eligibility.

However, the **expected outcome** is: **Eligible (until week 12)**.

This is a critical distinction. According to the 12-week rule for children in residential accommodation, the user should only be eligible for Child Benefit until the child has been in residential school for 12 weeks total. Since the child has already been there for 10 weeks, eligibility would cease after 2 more weeks.

The agent failed to:
1. Identify and apply the 12-week rule for residential accommodation
2. Communicate that eligibility is time-limited
3. Explain that Child Benefit would stop after week 12 if the placement continues

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, noting that "eligibility would only continue until week 12, not indefinitely as the agent stated."

Therefore, the agent did **not** communicate the correct eligibility outcome, as they omitted the crucial time limitation that defines this particular scenario.
