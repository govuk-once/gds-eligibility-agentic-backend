2026-01-28T18:49:57.552251 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T18:49:59.625068 [actor]: son 17 job hunting registred careers servce

2026-01-28T18:50:02.102767 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old son who is job hunting and registered with a careers service.

To determine eligibility, I need to clarify: **Is your son currently in any approved education or training?**

This is important because Child Benefit can continue for 16-19 year olds if they're in approved education or training, but being registered with a careers service alone may not be sufficient.

2026-01-28T18:50:03.762863 [actor]: left scool june not in collge

2026-01-28T18:50:08.292131 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son left school in June and is not currently in college or any other education or training.

Based on the Child Benefit rules, I need to inform you that **Child Benefit generally stops when a young person turns 16, unless they continue in approved education or training**. In those cases, it can continue until they turn 20.

Since your 17-year-old son has left school and is not currently in approved education or training, you would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit for him, even though he is registered with a careers service and actively job hunting.

Child Benefit would have stopped after he left full-time education in June (specifically at the end of the term/academic year when he turned 16 or left education, whichever was later).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T18:50:09.793412 [actor]: its only august tho he just left

2026-01-28T18:50:13.435766 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right, and I apologize - let me reconsider this more carefully.

If your son only just left school in June and it's now August, this is an important detail.

**A key question: When did your son turn 16, or is he still 16 now?**

I need to understand his exact age and when he left education, because there are specific rules about when Child Benefit stops after a young person leaves approved education or training. The timing matters here.

2026-01-28T18:50:14.989570 [actor]: he is 17 now left in june registred with youth careers

2026-01-28T18:50:19.143223 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. So your son is 17 now, left school in June, and is registered with youth careers.

Let me ask an important question to assess this properly: **Is your son enrolled on any training course or apprenticeship program, even if he hasn't started it yet?**

Also, to be clear: **Is he registered with the careers service just for advice and job hunting support, or is he actually enrolled in any work-based learning or training program through them?**

This distinction is crucial because Child Benefit can continue for 16-19 year olds who are in "approved education or training," but this typically means they must be enrolled in a specific course or training program, not just receiving careers guidance.

2026-01-28T18:50:20.824217 [actor]: looking for apprenticship not on one yet just registred

2026-01-28T18:50:25.639856 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So to summarize your situation:
- Your son is 17 years old
- He left school in June
- He's registered with youth careers service for support
- He's looking for an apprenticeship but hasn't started one yet

Based on the Child Benefit eligibility rules, I need to inform you that you are **not currently eligible** for Child Benefit for your son.

Here's why: Child Benefit continues for 16-19 year olds only if they are **actively enrolled in approved education or training**. Simply being registered with a careers service for job hunting support, or looking for an apprenticeship, does not qualify as being "in approved education or training."

**However**, if your son does find and start an approved apprenticeship or training course in the future, you should be able to claim Child Benefit again at that point, as long as he's still under 20.

The Child Benefit would typically have stopped at the end of August following him leaving education (there's usually a short extension through the summer after leaving school).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-28T18:50:27.656021 [actor]: but i herd theres extenshun for 20 weeks if registred

2026-01-28T18:50:32.072169 [root_agent]: That's a really important point you've raised, and I want to make sure I give you accurate information.

Let me think about this carefully. You've heard there's an extension for 20 weeks if registered with a careers service.

**Can you tell me where you heard about this 20-week extension?** Was it from the careers service itself, or from someone else?

I want to verify this against the official guidance to make sure I'm giving you the correct information about whether such an extension exists and what the specific conditions might be. The rules I'm working from focus on young people being in approved education or training, but there may be specific provisions I need to check more carefully.

Could you also confirm: **Exactly when in June did your son leave school** - was it early June or the end of the school term?

2026-01-28T18:50:33.786638 [actor]: end of june school term gov uk website 20 week extention

2026-01-28T18:50:37.920353 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information - you're quite right to check the gov.uk website, and I apologize for not being fully accurate earlier.

You're correct that there can be an extension. Let me verify the specific details about this 20-week extension provision for young people registered with careers services.

To assess your eligibility properly, I need to ask: **Was your son registered with the careers service (or Connexions-type service) before he left education, or did he register after leaving school?**

Also: **In which part of the UK do you live** - England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland? 

This matters because the careers service arrangements and the specific rules can vary slightly between different parts of the UK.

2026-01-28T18:50:39.915357 [actor]: england registred after left school in august

2026-01-28T18:50:43.613160 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your son:
- Lives in England
- Left school at the end of June
- Registered with the careers service in August (after leaving school)

This is an important detail. The 20-week extension you mentioned typically applies when a young person is registered with careers services **before** they leave education, not after.

However, I want to make absolutely sure I'm giving you accurate information about the specific timing requirements and whether registering in August (shortly after leaving in June) might still qualify.

**One more question: Do you know the exact date your son registered with the careers service in August?** 

I need to understand if there's a specific time limit after leaving education within which they need to register to qualify for any extension period.

2026-01-28T18:50:45.448594 [actor]: early august dont remember exact date

2026-01-28T18:50:51.720400 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all this information. Let me be honest with you - I need to give you the most accurate guidance possible.

Based on what you've told me:
- Your son is 17
- He left school at the end of June
- He registered with careers services in early August
- He's in England

You've mentioned a 20-week extension on the gov.uk website for young people registered with careers services. While I'm familiar with the general rules that Child Benefit continues for those in approved education or training, I want to make sure I'm not missing specific provisions about extensions for those registered with careers services between leaving education and finding work or training.

**I would strongly recommend that you:**

1. **Contact the Child Benefit Office directly** on 0300 200 3100 to discuss your specific situation and the 20-week extension you've read about

2. **Have ready the specific gov.uk page** where you saw this information about the 20-week extension, as this will help them assess your case accurately

They will be able to give you definitive guidance on whether you qualify based on the exact timing of when your son left school and registered with the careers service.

Would you like any other information about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T18:50:53.447698 [actor]: so you dont know if im eligibl or not

2026-01-28T18:50:59.195072 [root_agent]: You're right to challenge me on this, and I apologize for the confusion.

Let me be direct: Based on the official guidance I have access to, **I cannot find specific confirmation of a 20-week extension for young people who register with careers services after leaving education.**

The rules I can verify state that Child Benefit continues for 16-19 year olds who are **in approved education or training** - which typically means actively enrolled in and attending a course, apprenticeship, or training program.

However, you've mentioned reading about a 20-week extension on gov.uk for those registered with careers services, which suggests there may be provisions I'm not fully aware of or cannot verify from my current information sources.

So to answer your question honestly: **I cannot definitively confirm whether you are eligible or not** because:
- You may be right about the 20-week extension
- I cannot verify this specific provision with certainty

That's why I genuinely recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly on 0300 200 3100 - they can check your son's specific circumstances and confirm whether this extension applies to your situation.

I apologize for not being able to give you a clearer answer.

2026-01-28T18:51:00.801056 [actor]: fine will call them thanks i guess

2026-01-28T18:51:05.023639 [root_agent]: I understand your frustration, and I'm sorry I couldn't give you a definitive answer about the 20-week extension you mentioned.

You're doing the right thing by calling them directly - they'll be able to confirm whether you're eligible based on your son's situation. When you call, mention:
- Your son is 17
- He left school end of June
- He registered with careers services in early August
- You've read about a 20-week extension on gov.uk

Have the reference to that gov.uk page handy if you can find it again, as it will help them quickly identify the right provision.

The number again is: **0300 200 3100**

I hope they're able to help you and that you get a clear answer. Good luck with your call!

2026-01-28T18:51:11.557805 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent failed to recognize the 20-week extension rule for young people registered with careers services in England, which would make the user eligible for Child Benefit. Despite the user repeatedly mentioning this provision from gov.uk, the agent could not confirm it and ultimately admitted they couldn't definitively determine eligibility, when in fact the user IS eligible for up to 20 weeks based on their son's registration with the careers service.
