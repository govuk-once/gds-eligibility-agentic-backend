2026-01-28T18:52:14.027006 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T18:52:15.568341 [actor]: daughter 6 years old hosptal

2026-01-28T18:52:17.778880 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a 6-year-old daughter who is in hospital.

To assess your eligibility properly, I need to ask: Is your daughter expected to be in hospital for more than 12 weeks continuously?

2026-01-28T18:52:19.473909 [actor]: yes been there 14 weeks alredy

2026-01-28T18:52:21.896913 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. I understand your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks already, which must be a difficult time for you.

Let me ask you this: Are you responsible for your daughter - meaning, did you look after her and contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards her care before she went into hospital?

2026-01-28T18:52:23.717081 [actor]: yes my daughter visit every day spend money on her

2026-01-28T18:52:26.442885 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It's clear you're actively caring for and supporting your daughter.

Now, an important question: Is the NHS paying the full cost of your daughter's hospital care, or are you paying for any of it yourself?

2026-01-28T18:52:28.013888 [actor]: nhs paying but I spend 30 pounds week books pyjamas special food

2026-01-28T18:52:30.094957 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's good to know you're contributing to your daughter's comfort and wellbeing while she's in hospital.

Let me ask you: Do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-28T18:52:31.739931 [actor]: yes live uk

2026-01-28T18:52:34.166597 [root_agent]: Thank you. And one more question to complete the assessment:

Are you the only person responsible for your daughter, or does someone else also have parental responsibility and contribute to her care (for example, a partner or the child's other parent)?

2026-01-28T18:52:35.748928 [actor]: just me only one

2026-01-28T18:52:40.947266 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, I can now assess your eligibility for Child Benefit.

**You should be eligible for Child Benefit** for your daughter, even though she's been in hospital for 14 weeks. Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 6-year-old daughter)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are responsible for her care
✓ Importantly, you are contributing at least £30 per week towards her care (books, pyjamas, special food), which is more than the current Child Benefit amount

**Key point about hospital stays:** Even though your daughter has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks, you can continue to receive Child Benefit because you're still contributing financially to her care - and your contributions (£30/week) exceed the amount of Child Benefit itself.

You should be able to claim or continue receiving Child Benefit. If you haven't already claimed, you can apply online or by post. If you're already receiving it and there are any issues, you should contact the Child Benefit Office to explain your situation.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T18:52:46.579877 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the exception for children in hospital care lasting more than 12 weeks when the parent contributes at least the amount of Child Benefit (or more) to the child's care, which the user does at £30/week.
