**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct eligibility determination**: The agent clearly stated "you would likely not be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation"

2. **Accurate reasoning**: The agent properly explained that when a child doesn't live with the claimant, they must contribute "at least as much" as the person the child lives with to be eligible

3. **Proper application to the scenario**: The agent correctly assessed that:
   - Mike's £10/week contribution (≈£40/month) plus an annual birthday present
   - Is substantially less than what the mother contributes (accommodation, utilities, daily food, clothing, living expenses)
   - Therefore does not meet the contribution threshold

4. **Alignment with expected outcome**: The scenario specifies that to be "responsible" when not living with the child, contributions must equal at least the Child Benefit rate (£26.05/week). Mike's £10/week falls short of this threshold, making him ineligible.

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and aligned with the eligibility criteria. The outcome communicated (not eligible) matches the expected outcome (not eligible).
