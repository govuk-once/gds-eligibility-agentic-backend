2026-01-28T19:02:40.752117 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:02:42.261462 [actor]: child beneffit grocery shopping daughter

2026-01-28T19:02:44.471072 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. So you have a daughter - that's helpful to know!

Let me ask you this:

**Is your daughter under 16 years old, or is she under 20 and in approved full-time education or training?**

2026-01-28T19:02:45.989805 [actor]: 12 years old buys groceries

2026-01-28T19:02:48.870941 [root_agent]: Thank you! So your daughter is 12 years old, which means she meets the age requirement.

Now, let me ask you the next important question:

**Do you live with your daughter, or does she live with someone else (such as another parent, relative, or caregiver)?**

2026-01-28T19:02:50.582226 [actor]: doesnt live with me buys groceries clothes every month

2026-01-28T19:02:52.956803 [root_agent]: I understand - so your daughter doesn't live with you, but you buy groceries and clothes for her every month.

This is an important distinction for Child Benefit eligibility. Let me ask:

**Who does your daughter live with most of the time - for example, does she live with her other parent, another relative, or someone else?**

2026-01-28T19:02:54.512407 [actor]: lives with her mother i send groceries 120 pounds every 4 weeks

2026-01-28T19:02:57.080827 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your daughter lives with her mother, and you send £120 every 4 weeks for groceries.

This is important for determining eligibility. Let me ask:

**Is the child's mother currently claiming Child Benefit for your daughter?**

(Only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child, and it's usually the person the child lives with.)

2026-01-28T19:02:58.770055 [actor]: dont know just want to know if i can get it grocerys 120 pounds 4 weeks

2026-01-28T19:03:02.371274 [root_agent]: I understand you want to know if you can claim it.

Let me explain the key rule: **Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child, and it's usually paid to the person the child lives with.**

Since your daughter lives with her mother, here's what I need to ask:

**Are you the main person responsible for your daughter - meaning, does she spend more time living with you than with her mother, or do you share care equally with weeks spent at each home?**

(If she lives primarily with her mother and just visits you, then her mother would typically be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit.)

2026-01-28T19:03:04.341376 [actor]: she lives with mum i buy groceries bulk 120 every 4 weeks clothes

2026-01-28T19:03:08.313408 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Based on what you've told me, I need to give you some important information:

**You would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation.**

Here's why: Child Benefit is paid to the person who the child lives with - in this case, that's your daughter's mother. Only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child, and it goes to the main caregiver who the child lives with.

The fact that you provide financial support by buying groceries and clothes is very important for your daughter's wellbeing, but it doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit when she lives with her mother.

**However, let me ask: Is your daughter's mother actually claiming Child Benefit currently, or has she told you she isn't claiming it?**

(If the mother isn't claiming it and won't claim it, there may be other considerations.)

2026-01-28T19:03:09.959900 [actor]: no she told me shes not claiming it i contribute 120 pounds grocerys 4 weeks

2026-01-28T19:03:13.311987 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important information - so the mother is not claiming Child Benefit.

This changes things. Let me ask you:

**Even though your daughter lives with her mother, are you the person who is mainly responsible for your daughter - meaning, do you make the main decisions about her care, welfare, and upbringing?**

(The rules state that if the person the child lives with isn't claiming Child Benefit, someone else who is responsible for the child and contributes to their costs *may* be able to claim it instead - but this depends on who has the main responsibility for the child.)

2026-01-28T19:03:14.820830 [actor]: i contribute 120 pound every 4 weeks grocerys clothes for daughter

2026-01-28T19:03:17.926504 [root_agent]: I understand you contribute £120 every 4 weeks for groceries and clothes.

Let me ask this more directly:

**Besides providing money for groceries and clothes, are you involved in making decisions about your daughter's life - such as decisions about her education, medical care, or day-to-day welfare? Or does her mother make those decisions?**

(Contributing money is important, but Child Benefit eligibility also depends on who has the main responsibility for the child's upbringing and care.)

2026-01-28T19:03:19.684166 [actor]: mum makes decisions i just send 120 groceries bulk order 4 weeks

2026-01-28T19:03:24.008101 [root_agent]: Thank you for being clear about that.

Based on what you've told me, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit** for your daughter.

Here's why:

- Your daughter **lives with her mother**
- Her mother **makes the decisions** about her care, education, and welfare
- You provide financial support (£120 every 4 weeks for groceries), but you're not the main person responsible for her day-to-day care

**Child Benefit is paid to the person who is responsible for the child and who the child lives with.** Even though her mother isn't currently claiming it, she would be the eligible person to claim it, not you.

**One final question: Are you paying child maintenance or child support through any formal arrangement, or is the £120 for groceries something you've arranged informally?**

(This won't change your Child Benefit eligibility, but it's important to understand your full situation.)

2026-01-28T19:03:25.468418 [actor]: informal arrangement 120 pounds groceries 4 weeks bulk order

2026-01-28T19:03:29.821084 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

To summarize your situation:

**You are not eligible to claim Child Benefit** because:
- Your daughter lives with her mother
- Her mother is responsible for making decisions about your daughter's care and upbringing
- You contribute financially through an informal arrangement (£120 every 4 weeks for groceries)

**Important points:**

1. **Child Benefit goes to the person the child lives with** - in this case, that's your daughter's mother, even if she's not currently claiming it.

2. Your financial contributions are separate from Child Benefit - you're doing the right thing by supporting your daughter financially, but this doesn't qualify you to claim Child Benefit.

3. If you wanted to formalize your child support arrangement, you might consider looking into the Child Maintenance Service, but that's separate from Child Benefit.

**If her mother wanted to claim Child Benefit (which she's eligible to do), she would be the one to apply.**

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T19:03:35.898049 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter lives with her mother, who is the primary caregiver making decisions about the child's care, even though I contribute £120 every 4 weeks for groceries and the mother is not currently claiming the benefit.
