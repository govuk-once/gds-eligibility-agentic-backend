**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **Not Eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of the apprenticeship issue:** The agent properly recognized that the 17-year-old is doing a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, which involves paid work.

2. **Proper application of the work hours rule:** The agent correctly applied the rule that young people working 24+ hours per week for pay do not qualify for Child Benefit purposes, even if their work includes training elements.

3. **Accurate understanding of approved training:** The agent appropriately distinguished between "approved education or training" (which can qualify for Child Benefit) and paid employment with training components (which does not qualify when working full-time).

4. **Consistent with government guidance:** According to gov.uk guidance, in Scotland (as in England and Northern Ireland), you generally cannot get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship, particularly when it involves full-time paid employment.

5. **Clear communication:** The agent provided a well-reasoned explanation of why the user is not eligible, citing the specific factors (17 years old, full-time work, paid apprenticeship, 24+ hours per week) that led to this conclusion.

The agent's determination aligns with the expected outcome that this situation results in **Not Eligible** status for Child Benefit.
