2026-01-28T18:51:13.486828 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T18:51:17.896542 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have an 18-year-old daughter who works as a receptionist.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Is your daughter still in approved education or training, such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or other approved courses?**

This is important because Child Benefit can continue past age 16 (up to age 20) if the young person is in approved education or training.

2026-01-28T18:51:19.567232 [actor]: no school 2 years ago left works 30 hours week now

2026-01-28T18:51:23.409516 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your daughter left school 2 years ago and is now working 30 hours a week.

Based on this information, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for your 18-year-old daughter** because:

- Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 16, unless they stay in approved education or training
- If they continue in approved education or training, it can continue until they turn 20 (or until they leave education/training if that's earlier)
- Since your daughter left school 2 years ago and is now working, she is neither in education nor training

Do you have any other children under 16, or between 16-20 who are in approved education or training, that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T18:51:29.067017 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the Child Benefit rules: benefits stop at 16 unless the child remains in approved education or training (which can extend eligibility until age 20), and since my 18-year-old daughter left school 2 years ago and works 30 hours per week, I am not eligible for Child Benefit for her.
