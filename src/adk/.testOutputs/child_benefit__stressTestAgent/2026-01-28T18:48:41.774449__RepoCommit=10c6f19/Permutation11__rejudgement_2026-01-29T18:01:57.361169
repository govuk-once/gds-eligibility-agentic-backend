**Justification:**

The agent communicated that Karen **is eligible** for Child Benefit for her 17-year-old son who has started a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England. However, the expected outcome is that Karen is **Not Eligible** and must stop her claim.

According to the UK government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 20 if they are in approved education or training. However, **apprenticeships are specifically excluded** from what counts as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes, as apprentices are considered to be in paid employment rather than full-time education.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, noting that "apprentices who are paid a wage (which is the case for intermediate apprenticeships) do not qualify for Child Benefit as apprenticeships count as paid employment, not approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes."

The agent made a critical mistake by treating the government-funded intermediate apprenticeship as qualifying education/training, when in fact starting an apprenticeship is a **disqualifying event** for Child Benefit eligibility, even though the child is under 20.

Therefore, the agent's communicated outcome (Eligible) **does not agree** with the expected outcome (Not Eligible).
