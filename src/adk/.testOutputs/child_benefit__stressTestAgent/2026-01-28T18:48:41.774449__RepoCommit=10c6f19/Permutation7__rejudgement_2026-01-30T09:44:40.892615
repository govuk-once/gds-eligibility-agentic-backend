**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome is that the user should be **Eligible (via Exception)**.

According to the scenario and the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit for children in care (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), there is a specific exception to the 8-week rule: if a child in local authority care spends at least 2 nights in a row or 24 hours a week at home with the claimant, Child Benefit can still be paid.

In this case:
- The child (Jack, 14) has been in local authority care for 3 months (more than 8 weeks)
- The child stays with David every weekend - specifically Friday night AND Saturday night (2 consecutive nights)
- David provides care during these visits

The user explicitly stated "weekends home two nights fridy saturdayy" which clearly meets the exception criteria of "at least 2 nights in a row."

The agent failed to recognize this exception and incorrectly concluded the user was ineligible, stating "Weekend visits, even regular ones where you provide food and care, don't change this eligibility rule." This is factually incorrect - the exception exists precisely for this situation.

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent (Not Eligible) does not agree with the expected outcome (Eligible via Exception).
