**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user is eligible for Child Benefit without qualification or time limitation, stating "you should be eligible for Child Benefit" and "you should still be eligible for Child Benefit."

However, the expected outcome is: **Eligible (until week 12)**.

According to the gov.uk guidance on child benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), when a child is in residential accommodation, there is a **12-week time limit** on Child Benefit eligibility. The child has been in residential school for 10 weeks, meaning the parent is currently eligible but will lose eligibility after week 12.

The agent failed to communicate this crucial time limitation. While the agent correctly identified that the user is currently eligible (since no care order exists and parental responsibility is retained), they did not inform the user that this eligibility has a 12-week cutoff for residential accommodation. The agent's response suggested ongoing, indefinite eligibility rather than time-limited eligibility.

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent (eligible without time qualification) does not agree with the expected outcome (eligible until week 12).
