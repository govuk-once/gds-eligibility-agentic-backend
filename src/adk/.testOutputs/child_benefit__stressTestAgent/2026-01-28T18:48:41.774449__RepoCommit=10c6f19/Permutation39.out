2026-01-28T19:14:02.391384 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T19:14:04.250424 [actor]: adopted 2 kids get allowance from council

2026-01-28T19:14:06.496585 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know you have 2 adopted children and receive an allowance from the council.

Let me ask you: **Are either or both of these adopted children under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T19:14:08.112542 [actor]: yes they are 6 and 8 years old

2026-01-28T19:14:10.943942 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. So you have two adopted children aged 6 and 8.

Now I need to ask: **Are you responsible for these children? This means do they live with you, or are you paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit toward their upkeep (even if they don't live with you)?**

2026-01-28T19:14:12.458286 [actor]: they live with us we adopted them

2026-01-28T19:14:15.182627 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Since your adopted children (aged 6 and 8) live with you, that's good for eligibility purposes.

Now I need to ask: **Do you normally live in the UK?** 

(This is an important requirement for Child Benefit eligibility)

2026-01-28T19:14:16.556230 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T19:14:19.137803 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

One more important question: **Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or are either of you claiming benefits or tax credits that include an amount for these children?**

(This helps me understand if there are any restrictions that might affect your eligibility)

2026-01-28T19:14:21.033548 [actor]: no immigration we are british

2026-01-28T19:14:23.744487 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful to know.

Just to complete my assessment, let me ask: **Are you or your partner currently claiming any other benefits or tax credits that already include an amount for these two children?** 

(For example, Universal Credit, Tax Credits, or Pension Credit that includes child amounts)

2026-01-28T19:14:25.313481 [actor]: no we dont claim anything else just the adoption allowance from council

2026-01-28T19:14:28.958829 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit!**

Here's why:
- ✓ You have two children aged 6 and 8 (under 16)
- ✓ They live with you and you're responsible for them
- ✓ You normally live in the UK
- ✓ You're not subject to immigration control
- ✓ You're not claiming other benefits that include amounts for the children

**Important note about your adoption allowance:** The adoption allowance you receive from the council should not affect your Child Benefit eligibility. Child Benefit is a separate payment and you can claim it in addition to your adoption allowance.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, such as how to apply or how much you might receive?**

2026-01-28T19:14:34.155056 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on having two adopted children aged 6 and 8 who live with them in the UK, with no immigration control issues and no conflicting benefit claims, and correctly noted that the adoption allowance does not affect Child Benefit eligibility.
