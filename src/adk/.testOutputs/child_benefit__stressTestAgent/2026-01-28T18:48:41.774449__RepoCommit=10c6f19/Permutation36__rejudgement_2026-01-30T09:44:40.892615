**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Age criterion met**: The daughter is 16 years old (under 20)

2. **Terminal dates properly applied**: The agent correctly recognized that Child Benefit continues during the summer gap between GCSEs and A-levels when the child has been accepted into approved further education

3. **Approved education**: A-levels starting in September constitute approved education

4. **Responsibility criterion met**: The mother lives with and is responsible for her daughter

5. **Residency criterion met**: They live in the UK

6. **No duplicate claims**: No one else is claiming Child Benefit

The agent specifically addressed the mother's concern about the summer gap, explaining: "There is typically allowance for gaps between finishing one course (like GCSEs) and starting another (like A-levels)." This is the correct interpretation according to gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit continuing during breaks between approved education courses.

The agent's conclusion that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
