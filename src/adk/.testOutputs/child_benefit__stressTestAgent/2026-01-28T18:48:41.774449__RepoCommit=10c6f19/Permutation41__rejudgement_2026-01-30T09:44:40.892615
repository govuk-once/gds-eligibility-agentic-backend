**Justification:**

The agent **incorrectly determined that the user (Martin) is not eligible for Child Benefit** when in fact, according to the expected outcome, Martin should be **eligible for Ben (Full Rate)** and **not eligible for Jerry** through an explicit allocation request.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Misunderstanding of Contribution-Based Eligibility**: The agent repeatedly stated that "financial contributions alone do not create eligibility" and that "there is no amount of money that you can pay that would make you eligible." However, according to gov.uk guidance on "child benefit when a child lives with someone else," a person who contributes at least the Child Benefit amount for a child CAN be eligible.

2. **Failure to Recognize the Unequal Allocation Option**: When the user specifically mentioned "hmrc unequal split allocation ben 26.05 jerry remaining ask hmrc," the agent misinterpreted this as referring to shared custody payment splitting rather than recognizing it as the mechanism by which Martin could allocate his £40 contribution unequally (£26.05 to Ben, £13.95 to Jerry).

3. **Incorrect Final Determination**: The agent concluded Martin was "not eligible for Child Benefit" entirely, when the correct outcome should have been:
   - **Eligible for Ben** (by allocating £26.05 of his £40 contribution)
   - **Not Eligible for Jerry** (remaining £13.95 is less than Jerry's £17.25 requirement)

The expected outcome explicitly states Martin is eligible for Ben at the full rate by using the explicit allocation mechanism, which the agent failed to recognize or apply.
