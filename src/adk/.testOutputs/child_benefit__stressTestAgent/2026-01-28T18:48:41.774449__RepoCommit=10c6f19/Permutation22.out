2026-01-28T19:01:50.259666 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T19:01:51.932619 [actor]: child in hosptial son arthur

2026-01-28T19:01:54.073212 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a son named Arthur who is in hospital.

To assess your eligibility for Child Benefit when a child is in hospital, I need to ask:

How long has Arthur been in hospital, or how long is he expected to stay there?

2026-01-28T19:01:55.646167 [actor]: been in 10 weeks then home 2 weeks now back in 3 weeks

2026-01-28T19:01:57.900008 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Arthur has had periods in and out of hospital - 10 weeks initially, then home for 2 weeks, and now back in hospital for 3 weeks.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

How old is Arthur?

2026-01-28T19:01:59.513666 [actor]: 7 years old arthur

2026-01-28T19:02:01.942722 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Arthur is 7 years old and has been having stays in hospital.

Let me ask you another important question:

Are you responsible for Arthur? In other words, do you normally live with him and are you the person who looks after him when he's not in hospital?

2026-01-28T19:02:03.518528 [actor]: yes i look after him jenny mum

2026-01-28T19:02:06.063117 [root_agent]: Thank you, Jenny. So you're Arthur's mum and you look after him when he's at home.

Let me ask you:

When Arthur is in hospital, does he come home to you at weekends or for regular visits, or does he stay in hospital continuously during these periods?

2026-01-28T19:02:07.652145 [actor]: stays in hospital all the time when hes there

2026-01-28T19:02:09.782173 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Jenny. So when Arthur is in hospital, he stays there continuously without coming home for visits.

Now I need to ask:

Are you or your partner (if you have one) currently receiving Child Benefit for Arthur?

2026-01-28T19:02:11.393170 [actor]: i get child benefit now but worried if stop

2026-01-28T19:02:13.605456 [root_agent]: I understand your concern, Jenny. Let me ask an important question to assess your situation:

When Arthur is in hospital, does the hospital or local authority cover the full cost of providing for him (such as accommodation and meals), or do you still need to pay for some of his care or expenses?

2026-01-28T19:02:15.218136 [actor]: hospital pays everything when hes in there

2026-01-28T19:02:18.003448 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Jenny. That's helpful to know.

Let me ask you one more important question:

During the current 3-week hospital stay (and the previous 10-week stay), are you still regularly involved in Arthur's care - such as visiting him, being involved in decisions about his treatment, or maintaining your responsibility for him?

2026-01-28T19:02:19.843467 [actor]: yes i visit lots and talk to doctors about him

2026-01-28T19:02:26.254058 [root_agent]: Thank you, Jenny. That's really helpful information.

Based on what you've told me, let me explain your situation regarding Child Benefit:

**You should still be eligible for Child Benefit for Arthur**, even while he's in hospital. Here's why:

- You remain responsible for Arthur - you're his mum and he lives with you when he's not in hospital
- You stay actively involved in his care by visiting regularly and being involved in medical decisions
- You maintain your parental responsibility throughout his hospital stays

**Important point about hospital stays:** Child Benefit can continue for up to **12 weeks** when a child is in hospital and the hospital covers their accommodation and living costs. After 12 weeks of continuous hospital stay, the benefit would normally stop.

However, in Arthur's case, because he's been coming home between hospital stays (he was home for 2 weeks between admissions), each hospital stay would likely be counted separately rather than as one continuous period.

**My assessment:** You should continue to receive Child Benefit for Arthur. The hospital stays you've described shouldn't affect your eligibility as long as you remain responsible for him and he continues to live with you when not in hospital.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement?

2026-01-28T19:02:27.904308 [actor]: ok so i still get it then

2026-01-28T19:02:31.698674 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct, Jenny. Based on what you've told me, you should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Arthur.

The key reasons are:
- You're responsible for Arthur and he lives with you when he's not in hospital
- You remain actively involved in his care even when he's in hospital
- His hospital stays have been interrupted by time at home, so they're not one continuous long stay

You should continue receiving your Child Benefit as normal. If you have any concerns or if your circumstances change significantly, you can always contact the Child Benefit Office to discuss your specific situation.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-28T19:02:33.248921 [actor]: no thats all thanks

2026-01-28T19:02:38.128503 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent failed to properly calculate the cumulative hospital time - Arthur was in hospital for 10 weeks, then home for 2 weeks, then back in hospital for 3 weeks, totaling 13 weeks of hospital time cumulatively. Since the expected outcome states "Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)" and Arthur has exceeded 12 cumulative weeks in hospital where the hospital pays for everything, the agent should have determined ineligibility after the 12th week, but instead told the parent they remain eligible.
