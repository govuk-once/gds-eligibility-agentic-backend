**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. The agent properly identified that the 17-year-old son is doing a modern apprenticeship in Scotland while working full-time and receiving payment

2. The agent correctly applied the rule that young people aged 16-19 working 24+ hours per week for pay do not qualify their parents for Child Benefit, even when the work includes training elements

3. According to UK government guidance (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds requires them to be in approved education or training, but paid employment of 24+ hours per week specifically excludes them from eligibility

4. The agent specifically noted that modern apprenticeships involving full-time paid work don't count as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes

5. The scenario confirms this is a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, and the guidance notes that apprenticeships in Scotland (unlike a specific Welsh exception) generally do not qualify for Child Benefit

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and reached the correct eligibility determination that matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
