2026-01-28T18:54:36.422310 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T18:54:38.161361 [actor]: fostering liam council pays me

2026-01-28T18:54:40.210409 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you're fostering Liam and the council pays you for this.

**Do you have any other children who live with you that you are the parent or main carer for (not including Liam)?**

2026-01-28T18:54:41.913610 [actor]: no just liam hes 12 lives with me

2026-01-28T18:54:43.975639 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Liam is 12 years old, lives with you, and you're fostering him with the council paying you.

**Is Liam your own child, or are you fostering him through the local authority?**

2026-01-28T18:54:45.359134 [actor]: fostering local authority placement

2026-01-28T18:54:48.520775 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Since Liam is in local authority foster care and you're being paid by the council as a foster carer, I need to clarify one more thing:

**Is Liam living with you as part of a formal local authority fostering arrangement, or have you been appointed as his kinship carer or special guardian?**

2026-01-28T18:54:50.225214 [actor]: formal fostering arrangment council pays for his upkeep

2026-01-28T18:54:54.286923 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam**.

This is because when a child is in local authority care under a formal fostering arrangement where the council pays for the child's upkeep, the foster carer cannot claim Child Benefit. The local authority is considered responsible for the child in these circumstances.

However, if your situation changes - for example, if you were to adopt Liam, become his special guardian, or take on a kinship care arrangement where the local authority is no longer formally responsible - then you would become eligible to claim Child Benefit at that point.

**Do you have any questions about this, or is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?**

2026-01-28T18:54:59.617684 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that foster carers in formal local authority fostering arrangements where the council pays for the child's upkeep cannot claim Child Benefit, as the local authority is considered responsible for the child in these circumstances.
