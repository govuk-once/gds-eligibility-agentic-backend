**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the applicant is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of Crown servant status**: The agent properly recognized that as a member of the British Armed Forces posted to Germany, the applicant qualifies as a Crown servant, which is an exception to the standard UK residency requirement.

2. **Verification of all eligibility criteria**:
   - Children under 16: Yes (ages 8 and 10)
   - Responsible for the children: Yes (confirmed by applicant)
   - Children living with applicant: Yes (on the base in Germany)
   - No one else claiming: Confirmed

3. **Accurate application of the exception**: The agent explicitly stated: "as a member of the British armed forces posted abroad, you can still claim UK Child Benefit even though you're living in Germany."

4. **Clear communication**: The agent provided a clear "Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit!" message with supporting reasoning.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome (Eligible) and correctly applied the Crown servant exception for UK armed forces personnel posted overseas, as outlined in the scenario and confirmed by UK government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility.
