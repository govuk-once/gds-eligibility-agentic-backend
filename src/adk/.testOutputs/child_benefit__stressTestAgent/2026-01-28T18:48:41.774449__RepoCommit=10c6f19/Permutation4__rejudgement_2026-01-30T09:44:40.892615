**Justification:** The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

The agent's reasoning was sound:
- Identified that the daughter is 18 years old and left school 2 years ago
- Confirmed she is working 30 hours per week and not in approved education or training
- Correctly applied the rule that Child Benefit stops at age 16 unless the child continues in approved education or training (up to age 20)
- Appropriately concluded that since the daughter is neither under 16 nor in approved education/training, the user is not eligible

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and reached the correct eligibility determination matching the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
