2026-01-28T19:08:37.233299 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To get started, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:08:42.035120 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have an 18-year-old daughter at university.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is your daughter in approved full-time education or training that is not at an advanced level (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or equivalent)?**

Please note that university courses are generally considered advanced education, but I need to confirm what type of course she's studying to give you an accurate answer.

2026-01-28T19:08:48.284033 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Your daughter is studying for a degree and lives at home with you.

Unfortunately, I need to let you know that **degree courses are considered advanced education**. Based on the eligibility rules, Child Benefit generally stops when a young person turns 16, or can continue until they're 20 if they're in approved education or training - but this must be **non-advanced** education (like A-levels or equivalent).

Since your daughter is studying for a degree, which is advanced education, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** for her, even though she's only 18 and still living at home.

Child Benefit would have stopped either:
- When she turned 16, or
- At the end of the last non-advanced course she completed (such as A-levels), even if she was still under 20

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T19:08:53.776576 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops when a child begins advanced education such as a university degree, even if the child is under 20 and living at home, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
