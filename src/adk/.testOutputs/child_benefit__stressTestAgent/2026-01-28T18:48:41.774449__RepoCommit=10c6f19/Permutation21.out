2026-01-28T19:01:15.140076 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:01:17.158049 [actor]: can i get child benefit for my kid divorced split up sam lives with me

2026-01-28T19:01:20.062862 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your child Sam lives with you following your divorce.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Are you responsible for Sam? This means do you provide for Sam's day-to-day care and needs, such as food, clothing, and housing?**

2026-01-28T19:01:22.483510 [actor]: yes sam is with me i take care feed him clothe him everythin hes 10

2026-01-28T19:01:24.401072 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. So Sam is 10 years old and lives with you, and you're responsible for his day-to-day care.

Now I need to ask: **Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:01:25.944209 [actor]: yes live in uk sam is here with me

2026-01-28T19:01:28.582666 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that you and Sam live in the UK.

Now I need to ask: **Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Sam?** This could be your ex-partner or another person.

2026-01-28T19:01:30.305073 [actor]: no just me sam lives with me not with tina she has ella

2026-01-28T19:01:32.959402 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Sam lives with you, and your ex-partner Tina has your other child Ella living with her.

Let me ask: **Does Sam spend any time living with Tina, or does he live with you full-time?** (For example, does he stay with her on certain days of the week or alternate weeks?)

2026-01-28T19:01:34.719085 [actor]: no sam is with me fulltime ella is with tina fulltime

2026-01-28T19:01:36.756675 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So Sam lives with you full-time, and Ella lives with Tina full-time.

Now I need to ask: **Are you or Sam subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on your right to remain in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:01:38.587652 [actor]: no we are uk citizens born here

2026-01-28T19:01:42.434561 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Sam** because:

- Sam is under 16 years old (he's 10)
- Sam lives with you full-time
- You are responsible for Sam's day-to-day care (feeding, clothing, housing him)
- You live in the UK and are a UK citizen
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Sam

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for Sam. 

Just to be clear: Tina would separately be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ella, since Ella lives with her full-time.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:01:47.671648 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am eligible for Child Benefit for Sam based on the correct criteria: Sam is under 16, lives with me full-time, I'm responsible for his care, we're UK residents, and no one else is claiming for him.
