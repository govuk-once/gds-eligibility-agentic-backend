**Justification:**

The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of advanced education:** The agent properly recognized that a university degree is considered "advanced education" rather than "approved education."

2. **Accurate application of rules:** The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit can continue until age 20 only for children in **non-advanced** education (like A-levels), but not for those pursuing advanced education such as university degrees.

3. **Clear outcome communication:** The agent explicitly stated "you would not be eligible for Child Benefit" and explained that it would have stopped either at age 16 or at the end of the last non-advanced course.

4. **Alignment with expected outcome:** The expected outcome specifies "Not Eligible" because Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education such as a university degree. The agent's determination matches this precisely.

The evaluation judge's assessment (✓) also confirms the agent handled the case correctly, and my independent review agrees with this conclusion.
