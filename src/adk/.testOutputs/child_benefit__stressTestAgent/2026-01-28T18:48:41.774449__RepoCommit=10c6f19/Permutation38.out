2026-01-28T19:13:24.605007 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or young person under the age of 20 who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:13:26.321082 [actor]: bby born 4 mnths ago forgot to cliam

2026-01-28T19:13:28.682753 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know - congratulations on your baby!

So you have a 4-month-old baby, which is great. Now I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for this child? In other words, does the child live with you?**

2026-01-28T19:13:30.345372 [actor]: yes live with us both parents here

2026-01-28T19:13:33.339139 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your circumstances:

**Are you or your partner currently in the UK, or are either of you covered by certain immigration or residency rules? Specifically, do you or your partner have the right to live in the UK (for example, you're a British citizen, have settled status, or have another form of leave to remain)?**

2026-01-28T19:13:35.147718 [actor]: uk citizens born here

2026-01-28T19:13:38.036973 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask an important question about your household income:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income of £60,000 or more per year?**

(This is important because if either of you earns £60,000 or more, it may affect your Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge, though you can still claim it.)

2026-01-28T19:13:39.661554 [actor]: no under that amount both of us

2026-01-28T19:13:43.661789 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

✓ You have a child under 20 (your 4-month-old baby)
✓ The child lives with you
✓ You're responsible for the child
✓ You and your partner are UK citizens
✓ Neither of you earns £60,000 or more per year

**You should definitely make a claim as soon as possible.** Child Benefit can be backdated for up to 3 months from the date you claim, so you won't lose out on the payments for your 4-month-old.

**Do you need any guidance on how to make the claim, or do you have any other questions about Child Benefit?**

2026-01-28T19:13:45.716068 [actor]: wait so lost 1 month payment then?? can only get 3 months back but baby 4 months old

2026-01-28T19:13:50.030499 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right to question that - I can see why that's frustrating.

Yes, unfortunately that's correct. Child Benefit can only be backdated for up to 3 months from the date you make your claim. Since your baby is 4 months old, you would lose 1 month of payments.

**This is why it's really important to claim as soon as possible now** - so you don't lose any more months of payment.

The good news is that you'll still be able to claim for the last 3 months, and then going forward you'll receive Child Benefit regularly (it's usually paid every 4 weeks).

**Would you like to proceed with making a claim now, or do you have any other questions?**

2026-01-28T19:13:51.855250 [actor]: ok understand will claim now thx

2026-01-28T19:13:54.635012 [root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify your eligibility.

Just to recap:
- You are eligible for Child Benefit
- Claim as soon as possible to get the maximum 3 months backdated
- You'll then receive ongoing payments every 4 weeks

Good luck with your claim, and congratulations again on your baby! If you have any other questions in the future, feel free to ask.

Take care!

2026-01-28T19:14:00.234826 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user is eligible for Child Benefit and correctly explained that while the baby is 4 months old, Child Benefit can only be backdated for 3 months, meaning the user would lose the first month's payment but receive the last 3 months.
