**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated the eligibility outcome that aligns with the expected outcome for this scenario.

**Expected Outcome Analysis:**
- **Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible** - In this permutation, Sue has Holly for 4 days per week while Pete has her for 3 days per week. When both parents submit disputed claims, HMRC decides based on who has the child more often, which would be Sue.

**Agent's Communication:**
The agent was speaking with the parent who has the child for **3 days per week** (Pete's perspective). The agent correctly communicated that:

1. The claimant (Pete) meets the basic eligibility criteria
2. However, only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child
3. Since both parents submitted claims and cannot agree, HMRC will decide
4. **HMRC will likely award it to the ex-partner** (Sue) because the child spends 4 days there versus 3 days with the claimant (Pete)

This outcome matches the expected result: Sue (4 days) is eligible to receive the benefit, while Pete (3 days) is not eligible because HMRC's priority rule will award it to Sue based on the greater number of days. The agent correctly applied the decision mechanism for disputed claims where care is shared but unequal.
