**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Criteria Assessment**: The agent systematically verified all relevant eligibility criteria:
   - Child's age: 8 years old (under 16) ✓
   - Responsibility: User cares for the child (food, clothes, school, everything) ✓
   - Living arrangements: Child lives with them full-time ✓
   - Residency/Immigration: Both parents are UK nationals ✓
   - No disqualifying factors mentioned (hospital/care) ✓

2. **Correct Conclusion**: The agent explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and "You should be able to claim Child Benefit for your son."

3. **Additional Guidance**: The agent appropriately mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold (£60,000), though this doesn't affect basic eligibility—only potential tax implications.

4. **Agreement with Expected Outcome**: The expected outcome was "Eligible" and the agent communicated exactly this outcome to the user.

The agent's determination aligns perfectly with the expected eligibility outcome.
