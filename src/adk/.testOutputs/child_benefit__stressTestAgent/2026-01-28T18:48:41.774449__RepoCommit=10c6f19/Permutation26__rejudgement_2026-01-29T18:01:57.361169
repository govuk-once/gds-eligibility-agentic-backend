**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that Mo (the father) is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the gov.uk guidance on child benefit when a child lives with someone else, the expected outcome should be **Eligible**.

Here's why the agent's assessment was incorrect:

1. **Combined Contributions:** The gov.uk guidance explicitly states that contributions from multiple people can be combined. Mo contributes £15/week and his mother (Zahid's grandmother) contributes £15/week, totaling £30/week—which exceeds the Child Benefit threshold of £25.60/week for the eldest/only child.

2. **Aunt Not Claiming:** The aunt who cares for Zahid is not claiming Child Benefit, which is a critical factor. When the person the child lives with does not claim, and the parent contributes at least the equivalent of Child Benefit (through combined family contributions in this case), the parent can be eligible.

3. **Agent's Error:** The agent focused only on Mo's individual £15 contribution and concluded it was insufficient. The agent failed to properly consider that the combined £30/week from Mo and his mother meets the contribution threshold, particularly when evaluated against the scenario where the carer (aunt) is not claiming.

The agent communicated an outcome of **Not Eligible**, but the expected outcome based on the permutation scenario and gov.uk guidance is **Eligible**. Therefore, the agent's eligibility determination does **not** agree with the expected outcome.
