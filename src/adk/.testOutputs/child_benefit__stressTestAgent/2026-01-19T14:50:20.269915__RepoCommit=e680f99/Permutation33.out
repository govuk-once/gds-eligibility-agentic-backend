2026-01-19T15:05:45.333116 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To make this assessment, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T15:05:46.387083 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility.

My daughter training travel course

2026-01-19T15:05:47.686214 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. To better understand your situation, I need to know more about your daughter. 

How old is your daughter who is on the training travel course?

2026-01-19T15:05:48.571264 [actor]: Bella 16 travel agent course

2026-01-19T15:05:50.672558 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Bella is 16 and on a travel agent course, I need to determine if this course qualifies as approved education or training.

Is Bella's travel agent course considered approved education or training? This would typically be something like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved courses that involve at least 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience.

2026-01-19T15:05:51.789958 [actor]: Not apprenticeship travel agency pays all costs employment started

2026-01-19T15:05:54.883837 [root_agent]: I understand that this is not an apprenticeship and that Bella is employed by a travel agency that pays all costs.

Based on what you've described, it appears that Bella is in paid employment rather than in approved education or training. For Child Benefit purposes, approved education or training typically refers to unpaid courses like A-levels or other qualifications, not paid employment.

Since Bella is 16 and in paid employment (rather than approved education or training), you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for her. Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training.

Do you have any other children you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T15:05:56.926590 [actor]: No other children

2026-01-19T15:05:58.148713 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit isn't available for a 16-year-old in paid employment, as this doesn't qualify as approved education or training.
