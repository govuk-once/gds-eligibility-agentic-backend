2026-01-28T12:53:13.875313 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the parent would be eligible for Child Benefit. According to UK government guidance, parents generally cannot get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship in Scotland, unlike specific Welsh exceptions. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible."
