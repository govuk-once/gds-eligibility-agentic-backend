2026-01-19T15:09:42.876015 [root_agent]: I notice you've mentioned someone named Callum who is 17, and you've referenced benefit money and Glasgow.

To help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit, I need to understand your situation better. Are you responsible for looking after Callum? By this I mean, are you their parent, guardian, or someone who takes care of them?

2026-01-19T15:09:45.975139 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that you're Callum's father, he lives with you in Glasgow, Scotland, and there's something about an apprenticeship.

To clarify regarding Child Benefit eligibility, is Callum currently in approved education or training? Child Benefit can continue for children up to 20 years old if they're in approved education or training.

2026-01-19T15:09:49.328825 [root_agent]: I understand that Callum is on a modern apprenticeship that involves training and a job with payment.

For Child Benefit eligibility purposes, I need to know if this modern apprenticeship is considered "approved education or training" by UK standards. Does Callum's apprenticeship provider consider it to be non-advanced education or approved training? (Non-advanced education typically means courses up to A level or equivalent)

2026-01-19T15:09:53.310406 [root_agent]: I understand you're providing information about Callum's apprenticeship in Glasgow that involves training and a job with payment.

To determine Child Benefit eligibility more specifically, I need to understand the nature of this apprenticeship. 

Is Callum's apprenticeship one where he receives payment that exceeds £280 per week? This is important because Child Benefit typically stops if a young person aged 16-19 starts paid work that is not part of an approved education or training course and earns more than this amount.

2026-01-19T15:09:56.647505 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Callum is on a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland that involves training and payment.

Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland are typically considered approved training programs for Child Benefit purposes. 

To confirm your eligibility, does Callum live with you full-time? This helps establish that you're the person responsible for him.

2026-01-19T15:10:00.962102 [root_agent]: I understand that Callum is your son and is living with you at your home in Glasgow.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You're Callum's father and he lives with you (making you responsible for him)
2. Callum is 17 years old
3. He is on a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, which is typically considered approved training

However, there is one more important factor to confirm. Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £50,000 per year? This affects whether you'll receive the full amount or if the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply.

2026-01-19T15:10:04.599608 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that a 17-year-old on a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland would qualify for Child Benefit, as Modern Apprenticeships are considered approved training programs.
