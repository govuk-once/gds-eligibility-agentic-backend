2026-01-19T14:58:18.841169 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time, to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T14:58:20.327359 [actor]: I'm going to assume the role of Maria, an informal guardian of her granddaughter, and engage with the benefits eligibility agent as requested.

granddaughter lives with me looking after her

2026-01-19T14:58:22.300335 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Maria. I understand that your granddaughter lives with you and you're looking after her. 

To clarify your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask if you are the person who has the main responsibility for caring for your granddaughter? By this I mean providing for her day-to-day needs like food, clothes, and a place to live.

2026-01-19T14:58:23.433269 [actor]: yes I pay for everything she lives with me her parents not around

2026-01-19T14:58:24.950534 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that you're fully responsible for your granddaughter, providing for all her needs, and her parents are not around.

May I ask how old your granddaughter is?

2026-01-19T14:58:25.900475 [actor]: she's 14

2026-01-19T14:58:27.895788 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that your granddaughter is 14 years old.

Since you're caring for a child under 16 and have main responsibility for her, this is good initial information for potential eligibility. 

To continue assessing your eligibility, do you live in the UK?

2026-01-19T14:58:28.797086 [actor]: yes UK resident

2026-01-19T14:58:30.250794 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK resident.

Do you have any legal arrangement in place regarding your care for your granddaughter, such as a child arrangements order, a residence order, or any other formal arrangement?

2026-01-19T14:58:31.033498 [actor]: no just family arrangement

2026-01-19T14:58:33.546168 [root_agent]: I understand it's an informal family arrangement for caring for your granddaughter.

Since you have a family arrangement without formal legal documentation, this affects how Child Benefit might be claimed. Typically, Child Benefit is paid to the person who has main responsibility for the child, but there are some considerations for informal care arrangements.

Are you currently receiving any financial support specifically for your granddaughter from her parents or from the local authority?

2026-01-19T14:58:34.406070 [actor]: no they don't pay anything I pay everything

2026-01-19T14:58:36.758237 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you receive no financial support from your granddaughter's parents or from any authority - you're covering all expenses yourself.

Since you're the person with main responsibility for your granddaughter, you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit, even without formal legal documentation. The fact that you provide for her daily needs and she lives with you is important.

Is your individual income over £60,000 per year? (This is relevant for the High Income Child Benefit Charge.)

2026-01-19T14:58:37.683489 [actor]: no pension only

2026-01-19T14:58:41.203467 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since you're only receiving a pension and your income is below £60,000, you would not be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on the information you've provided:
- Your granddaughter is 14 and lives with you
- You have main responsibility for her care and financial support
- You're a UK resident
- It's an informal family arrangement
- Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold

It appears you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your granddaughter. Even without formal legal documentation, the fact that you have day-to-day responsibility for her care is what matters most for Child Benefit eligibility.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-19T14:58:43.193605 [actor]: Thank you for telling me I'm eligible. How do I apply?

2026-01-19T14:58:45.724335 [evaluation_judge]: The expected outcome for this scenario is that the person (Maria) should be eligible for Child Benefit as she is the main caregiver for her 14-year-old granddaughter, living in the UK, with income below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold. ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Maria is eligible for Child Benefit based on having main responsibility for a child under 16, living in the UK, and having income below £60,000.
