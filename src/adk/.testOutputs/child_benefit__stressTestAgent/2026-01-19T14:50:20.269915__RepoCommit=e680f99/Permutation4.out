2026-01-19T14:51:30.620958 [root_agent]: I'll help you assess your eligibility for Child Benefit. To determine this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T14:51:32.339549 [actor]: I need to rolplay as a person seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the instructions to be deliberately obtuse, answer indirectly, and speak like I'm using search terms.

Sofia daughter 18 years old living with me works receptionist

2026-01-19T14:51:34.161647 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your daughter Sofia is 18 years old, lives with you, and works as a receptionist.

To determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to know if Sofia is in approved education or training? Child Benefit can continue until a child turns 20 if they're in approved education or training.

2026-01-19T14:51:35.035295 [actor]: left school two years ago works 30 hours not studying

2026-01-19T14:51:37.543668 [root_agent]: I understand that Sofia left school two years ago, works 30 hours per week, and is not currently studying or in training.

Based on this information, I need to inform you that you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia. Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they remain in approved education or training.

Since Sofia is 18, not in education or training, and is working, she doesn't meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-19T14:51:38.715627 [actor]: Understand not eligible for child benefit for Sofia 18 working not studying

2026-01-19T14:51:41.023294 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit isn't available for an 18-year-old who has left education and works 30 hours per week.
