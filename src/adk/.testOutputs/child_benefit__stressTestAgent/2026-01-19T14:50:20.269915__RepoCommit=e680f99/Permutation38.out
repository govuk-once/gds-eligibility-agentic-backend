2026-01-19T15:07:32.389151 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T15:07:33.264829 [actor]: baby 4 months ago need money

2026-01-19T15:07:35.036253 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you have a 4-month-old baby and are looking for financial support.

Since you have a child under 16, that's an important first step toward Child Benefit eligibility. 

My next question is: Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-19T15:07:35.746458 [actor]: yes uk london

2026-01-19T15:07:37.519052 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in London, UK.

Next question: Are you responsible for the child? This generally means they live with you, or you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit toward their upkeep.

2026-01-19T15:07:38.299440 [actor]: yes baby my wife

2026-01-19T15:07:41.078319 [root_agent]: I'll continue helping you determine your Child Benefit eligibility.

Thank you for confirming that you're responsible for your baby along with your wife. 

My next question is: Do you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year? (If your or your partner's individual income is between £50,000 and £60,000, you can still get Child Benefit but will need to pay some of it back as tax).

2026-01-19T15:07:41.875453 [actor]: not rich normal job

2026-01-19T15:07:44.051149 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. While I don't have the exact figure of your income, if both you and your partner earn less than £50,000 individually per year, you would typically be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount without having to pay any of it back as tax.

My next question is: Do you or your wife have immigration restrictions that say "no recourse to public funds"?

2026-01-19T15:07:44.812093 [actor]: born uk citizen

2026-01-19T15:07:48.717110 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you were born in the UK and are a UK citizen. That's helpful information.

Based on what you've shared so far, it appears you are likely eligible for Child Benefit since:
- You have a 4-month-old baby
- You live in the UK
- You are responsible for the child
- You don't appear to have income restrictions that would reduce or eliminate the benefit
- As a UK citizen, you don't have immigration restrictions

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or from your local post office. The benefit can be worth £24.00 per week for your first child and £15.90 for any additional children.

Is there anything specific about Child Benefit that you'd like me to explain further?

2026-01-19T15:07:49.702773 [actor]: forgot claim baby born 4 months can get money back

2026-01-19T15:07:52.845742 [root_agent]: Yes, you can claim Child Benefit backdated for up to 3 months from when the HMRC receives your claim. Since your baby is 4 months old, you should be able to receive payments from shortly after their birth if you apply now.

To make your claim, you'll need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2 and include your baby's birth certificate (the original, not a photocopy). Once your claim is processed, you'll receive payments every 4 weeks, typically on a Monday or Tuesday.

I'd recommend submitting your claim as soon as possible to ensure you receive the maximum backdated amount you're entitled to.

Would you like to know anything else about the application process?

2026-01-19T15:07:56.685837 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility, explaining that the person likely qualifies since they have a 4-month-old baby, live in the UK, are responsible for the child, don't have high income restrictions, and are a UK citizen. The agent also correctly stated that Child Benefit can be backdated for up to 3 months.
