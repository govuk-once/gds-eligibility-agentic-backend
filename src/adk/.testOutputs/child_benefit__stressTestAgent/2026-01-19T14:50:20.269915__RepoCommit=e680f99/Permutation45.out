2026-01-19T15:10:26.503746 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have any children living with you who you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T15:10:27.788269 [actor]: I'll roleplay as someone inquiring about child benefit eligibility.

daughter hospital 8 years long time

2026-01-19T15:10:29.118860 [root_agent]: I understand you have an 8-year-old daughter who has been in the hospital for a long time. Thank you for sharing this information.

May I ask if you're legally responsible for your daughter (as a parent, step-parent, or legal guardian)?

2026-01-19T15:10:30.057933 [actor]: yes my child hospital 14 weeks visit everyday

2026-01-19T15:10:31.486692 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your child has been in the hospital for 14 weeks and you visit them every day.

Are you receiving any payments from your local council or local authority for your child's care while they are in the hospital?

2026-01-19T15:10:32.479571 [actor]: no money from council hospital provides everything

2026-01-19T15:10:34.749030 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since your child is in hospital but you're not receiving payments from the local council, and you're maintaining regular contact through daily visits, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit.

When a child is in hospital, you can typically continue to receive Child Benefit as long as you regularly visit them or otherwise maintain contact, which you are doing with your daily visits.

May I ask if you're currently living in the UK?

2026-01-19T15:10:35.569136 [actor]: yes UK resident london area

2026-01-19T15:10:37.419772 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK resident living in the London area.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year? This is important because of the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-19T15:10:38.684245 [actor]: nurse salary not high income below threshold

2026-01-19T15:10:42.123825 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your situation as a nurse with income below the threshold.

Based on the information you've provided:

1. You are responsible for your child who is 8 years old
2. Your child is currently in hospital for an extended period (14 weeks)
3. You maintain regular contact through daily visits
4. You live in the UK (London area)
5. Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold

You should be eligible for Child Benefit. Since your child is temporarily in hospital but you maintain regular contact with them, your Child Benefit can continue. The hospital providing care doesn't affect your eligibility as long as the local authority isn't making payments to you for the child's care.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about claiming or managing your Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T15:10:43.327114 [actor]: hospital 14 weeks no buying anything for her they provide food clothes

2026-01-19T15:10:47.065715 [root_agent]: I understand your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks, and the hospital is providing everything she needs including food and clothing, so you haven't needed to purchase these items for her.

This doesn't affect your eligibility for Child Benefit. Even though the hospital is providing these necessities during your daughter's stay, you're maintaining your parental responsibility by visiting her daily and remaining involved in her care.

Child Benefit eligibility continues while a child is in hospital as long as you maintain contact with them, which you clearly are doing. The fact that you're not currently needing to provide material items like food and clothing doesn't impact your eligibility since this is a temporary situation while she receives medical care.

You should still be eligible for Child Benefit during this period.

2026-01-19T15:10:50.708706 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit can continue when a child is temporarily in hospital, as long as the parent maintains regular contact (which the user does through daily visits), and the local authority isn't making payments for the child's care.
