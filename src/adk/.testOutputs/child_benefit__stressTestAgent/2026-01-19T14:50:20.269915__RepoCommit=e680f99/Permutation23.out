2026-01-19T15:00:11.768218 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T15:00:12.933985 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility.

my daughter sarah 12

2026-01-19T15:00:14.723293 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your daughter Sarah, who is 12. 

Does Sarah live with you? Or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent in kind) towards looking after her?

2026-01-19T15:00:15.667907 [actor]: don't live with her buy groceries clothes every month

2026-01-19T15:00:19.048266 [root_agent]: I understand that Sarah doesn't live with you, but you contribute to her care by buying groceries and clothes every month.

To be eligible for Child Benefit, you need to determine if your contributions are at least equal to the weekly Child Benefit rate. The current weekly rate is £24.00 for the eldest or only child and £15.90 for additional children.

Would you say that the value of the groceries and clothes you provide each month equals or exceeds about £104 per month (which is roughly the Child Benefit amount for one child)?

2026-01-19T15:00:20.042811 [actor]: every 4 weeks £120 groceries and clothes for sarah

2026-01-19T15:00:22.217781 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're contributing £120 every 4 weeks for Sarah's groceries and clothes, which exceeds the current Child Benefit rate of about £104 per month for one child, this meets that particular requirement.

Is someone else (like Sarah's other parent or guardian) already claiming Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-19T15:00:23.015719 [actor]: ex wife probably claims it

2026-01-19T15:00:25.846541 [root_agent]: I understand your ex-wife is probably claiming Child Benefit for Sarah already.

This is important because generally, only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. If your ex-wife is already claiming Child Benefit for Sarah, you wouldn't typically be able to claim it as well, even if you're contributing financially to Sarah's upbringing.

However, if you believe your contributions are greater than your ex-wife's, and Sarah spends equal or more time with you, you could potentially discuss this with the Child Benefit Office.

May I ask if Sarah stays with you regularly, or does she primarily live with your ex-wife?

2026-01-19T15:00:26.785467 [actor]: only sees me when i drop off groceries

2026-01-19T15:00:30.449339 [root_agent]: I understand that Sarah primarily lives with your ex-wife, and you only see her when dropping off groceries.

Based on the information you've provided, you wouldn't be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah because:

1. Sarah doesn't live with you
2. Although you make financial contributions, the Child Benefit is already likely being claimed by your ex-wife who has main responsibility for Sarah
3. For Child Benefit purposes, the person who the child lives with most of the time is typically considered the main caregiver

Since Sarah primarily lives with your ex-wife and you only see her occasionally when dropping off supplies, your ex-wife would be considered to have main responsibility for Sarah and would be the appropriate person to receive Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other potential support available to you as a non-resident parent?

2026-01-19T15:00:34.527872 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since my child lives with my ex-wife who likely claims it already, and occasional financial contributions don't qualify me when I'm not the main caregiver.
