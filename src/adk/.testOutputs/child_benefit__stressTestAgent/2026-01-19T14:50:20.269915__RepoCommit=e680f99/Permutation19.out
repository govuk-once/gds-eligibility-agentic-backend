2026-01-19T14:57:51.643405 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To do this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

To start with, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T14:57:53.415224 [actor]: I'll help you by role-playing as a user who is seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the rules to be obtuse, speak like I'm entering search terms, and not directly answer questions.

holly benefit money pete

2026-01-19T14:57:54.686404 [root_agent]: I need to better understand your situation to help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit. 

Could you please clarify if you're responsible for taking care of any children?

2026-01-19T14:57:55.784303 [actor]: child money holly 9 years old need money pete and sue separated

2026-01-19T14:57:57.457040 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing some information. I understand you've mentioned Holly who is 9 years old, and that Pete and Sue are separated.

Could you please clarify your relationship to Holly? Are you the parent or guardian responsible for her care?

2026-01-19T14:57:58.637423 [actor]: pete me 3 days holly stay sue 4 days both buy clothes food

2026-01-19T14:58:00.341618 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that you are Pete, and Holly stays with you for 3 days and with Sue for 4 days, and you both contribute to buying clothes and food for Holly.

Do you or Sue currently receive Child Benefit payments for Holly?

2026-01-19T14:58:01.641739 [actor]: both claim hmrc sent forms no agreement who gets it

2026-01-19T14:58:04.950725 [root_agent]: I understand that both you and Sue are trying to claim Child Benefit for Holly, and HMRC has sent forms, but there's no agreement between you about who should receive it.

In cases where separated parents both claim Child Benefit for the same child, HMRC typically makes a decision based on who the child lives with for the majority of the time. Since Holly stays with Sue for 4 days and with you for 3 days, Sue would generally be considered the main carer.

However, have you and Sue considered making a family-based arrangement about who should claim Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T14:58:06.245532 [actor]: no agreement sue says she deserves holly stays more days with her want to know my rights

2026-01-19T14:58:10.002905 [root_agent]: I understand you want to know your rights regarding Child Benefit when you and Sue don't have an agreement, and she believes she should receive it because Holly stays with her more days.

Based on UK government guidelines, when parents are separated and both claim Child Benefit for the same child, HMRC will usually pay the benefit to the person who the child lives with for the majority of time. Since Holly stays with Sue for 4 days and with you for 3 days, Sue would typically be considered the main carer for Child Benefit purposes.

However, if you believe there are special circumstances in your case, you can explain these to HMRC when applying. They will make a decision based on all the information provided.

Would you like to know about any other factors HMRC might consider in your situation?

2026-01-19T14:58:11.497046 [actor]: so sue gets it because holly stays 4 days with her? not fair both parents

2026-01-19T14:58:14.831000 [actor]: I understand your frustration. According to HMRC rules, when two people can't agree on who should claim Child Benefit for the same child, they will typically award it to the person the child lives with most of the time. Since Holly stays with Sue for 4 days compared to your 3 days, Sue would likely be considered the main carer for benefit purposes.

It may seem unfair when both parents are actively involved in raising the child and contributing financially, but the benefit system currently only allows one person to receive Child Benefit for each child. 

If your circumstances change in the future or if you have additional information that might affect this determination, you could contact HMRC directly to discuss your specific situation.

2026-01-19T14:58:16.715426 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that when separated parents both claim Child Benefit for the same child, HMRC typically awards it to the parent the child lives with most of the time (Sue in this case, as Holly stays with her 4 days versus 3 days with Pete).
