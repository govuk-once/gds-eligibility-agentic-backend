2026-01-19T14:51:08.445904 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T14:51:09.590665 [actor]: child benefit son ben left school looking job

2026-01-19T14:51:10.848661 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand your son Ben has left school and is looking for a job.

How old is Ben?

2026-01-19T14:51:11.867447 [actor]: 17 left school June

2026-01-19T14:51:13.263885 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Ben is 17 and left school in June, I need to understand his current situation a bit better.

Is Ben currently in any form of education or training?

2026-01-19T14:51:14.152076 [actor]: looking apprenticeship registered careers service

2026-01-19T14:51:15.587798 [root_agent]: I understand that Ben is 17, left school in June, and is currently looking for an apprenticeship and is registered with the careers service.

Is Ben currently registered with a careers service, Connexions, or local authority support service?

2026-01-19T14:51:16.396445 [actor]: yes careers service registered august

2026-01-19T14:51:20.590336 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit for Ben because:

1. Ben is 17 (under 20), which is within the age limit for Child Benefit
2. He has left school but is registered with a careers service
3. He is looking for work/apprenticeship

Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after a child leaves approved education or training if they're:
- Under 18
- Registered with a careers service, Connexions, or local authority support service
- Not in full-time work (24+ hours per week)

Since Ben registered with the careers service in August after leaving school in June, and he's looking for an apprenticeship rather than working full-time, you should remain eligible during this transition period.

Is there anything else about Ben's situation that might be relevant? For example, is he working any hours currently while looking for an apprenticeship?

2026-01-19T14:51:21.428158 [actor]: no not working searching full time

2026-01-19T14:51:25.414971 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Ben is not working and is searching for an apprenticeship full-time.

Based on all the information you've provided, you are eligible for Child Benefit for Ben because:

1. Ben is 17 years old (under 20)
2. He left school in June
3. He is registered with a careers service (since August)
4. He is not working and is searching full-time for an apprenticeship
5. He is within the 20-week period after leaving education during which Child Benefit can continue (assuming he registered promptly after leaving school)

You should continue receiving Child Benefit while Ben is registered with the careers service and looking for an apprenticeship, for up to 20 weeks from when he left approved education. If Ben starts an apprenticeship, depending on the type of apprenticeship and the pay, you may continue to be eligible, so it would be worth checking again when that happens.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-19T14:51:28.953024 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after a child leaves education if they're under 18 and registered with a careers service, which applies to the 17-year-old son who left school in June and registered with careers services in August.
