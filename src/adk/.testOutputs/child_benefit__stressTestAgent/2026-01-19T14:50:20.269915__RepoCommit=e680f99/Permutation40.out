2026-01-19T15:08:14.805121 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T15:08:17.345030 [root_agent]: I notice there's some mention of someone named Simon with mental health detention. To properly assess Child Benefit eligibility, I should clarify your specific situation.

Could you please confirm if you are responsible for a child, and whether this child is currently living with you?

2026-01-19T15:08:20.388520 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that you have a 15-year-old son who has been in a psychiatric unit for 10 weeks under the Mental Health Act.

In this situation, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit even while your child is temporarily in hospital. 

Could you confirm if you were receiving Child Benefit for your son before he was admitted to the psychiatric unit?

2026-01-19T15:08:21.172181 [actor]: yes was getting money before hospital

2026-01-19T15:08:24.759763 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you were receiving Child Benefit before your son was admitted to the hospital.

Based on UK government guidelines, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for a child who is temporarily in hospital or receiving care. Since your son is in a psychiatric unit temporarily (10 weeks so far), you should remain eligible for Child Benefit during this period.

If your son remains in the hospital for an extended period (12 weeks or more), you may need to inform the Child Benefit Office about his situation, but your payments should continue as long as you maintain regular contact with him and he's expected to return to your care.

Is there anything specific about your Child Benefit payments that concerns you, or would you like to know anything else about maintaining your eligibility while your son is receiving treatment?

2026-01-19T15:08:25.541101 [actor]: So I still get money?

2026-01-19T15:08:28.204406 [root_agent]: Yes, you should still continue to receive your Child Benefit payments while your son is temporarily in the psychiatric unit. 

Since you were already receiving Child Benefit before your son was admitted, and this is considered a temporary hospital stay, your eligibility continues during this period.

You don't need to take any special action regarding your Child Benefit at this point, but if your son's stay extends beyond 12 weeks, it would be a good idea to keep the Child Benefit Office informed of your circumstances.

The payments should continue as normal to your usual payment method.

2026-01-19T15:08:31.547459 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit continues during a child's temporary stay in hospital, including psychiatric units, which aligns with the UK government guidelines.
