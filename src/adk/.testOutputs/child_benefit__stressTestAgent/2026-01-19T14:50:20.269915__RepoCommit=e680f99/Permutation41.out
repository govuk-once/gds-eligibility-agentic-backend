2026-01-19T15:08:33.054723 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T15:08:34.004531 [actor]: child benefit ex husband paying money 2 children

2026-01-19T15:08:35.339130 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about Child Benefit for 2 children, with your ex-husband involved in some way.

To clarify your situation, may I ask: Are the 2 children living with you most of the time?

2026-01-19T15:08:36.213991 [actor]: children with ex wife me pay £40 weekly

2026-01-19T15:08:39.094775 [root_agent]: I understand now - it seems you're the ex-husband who pays £40 weekly for your children who live with your ex-wife.

Based on this information, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit because the children don't normally live with you. Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who the child lives with.

Your ex-wife would likely be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit for the children since they live with her. The £40 you pay weekly appears to be child maintenance, which is separate from Child Benefit.

Is there anything specific about this arrangement you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-19T15:08:40.039286 [actor]: ben and jerry 10 and 8 i'm 45 years old martin

2026-01-19T15:08:43.129499 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that additional information, Martin. I understand you're 45 years old and have two children, Ben (10) and Jerry (8).

However, based on what you've mentioned previously about the children living with your ex-wife while you pay £40 weekly (which appears to be child maintenance), you would not be eligible for Child Benefit.

Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who the child primarily lives with, which in this case would be your ex-wife. The payments you make are separate from Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation or any other support you might be eligible for?

2026-01-19T15:08:44.033602 [actor]: can i claim part child benefit for money i pay them

2026-01-19T15:08:47.564043 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking if you can claim part of the Child Benefit based on the money you pay for your children, Martin.

Unfortunately, Child Benefit cannot be split or partially claimed based on maintenance payments. According to UK government rules, Child Benefit is typically paid to only one person - the person who has main responsibility for the children's care. Since Ben and Jerry live with your ex-wife, she would be the person eligible to claim the full Child Benefit.

The £40 weekly that you pay is child maintenance, which is completely separate from Child Benefit. These maintenance payments do not entitle you to a portion of the Child Benefit.

If your circumstances were to change, such as if the children were to stay with you for equal amounts of time (shared care), there might be different considerations, but even then only one parent can receive Child Benefit for a child.

2026-01-19T15:08:48.664499 [actor]: equal money for both children

2026-01-19T15:08:52.818237 [root_agent]: I understand you're mentioning "equal money for both children," Martin.

To clarify, if you're asking whether the Child Benefit would provide equal money for both of your children (Ben, 10 and Jerry, 8) - yes, the standard Child Benefit rate is the same for both children, though the rate is higher for the eldest or only child.

However, if you're asking whether you and your ex-wife can each claim Child Benefit for one child each (splitting them equally), that's not possible under the UK system. Child Benefit can only be claimed by the person who has main responsibility for the children.

Since you've mentioned that both children live with your ex-wife, she would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for both children, even though you contribute £40 weekly in maintenance.

Is there something specific about the financial arrangements for your children that you're trying to address?

2026-01-19T15:08:53.952809 [actor]: hmrc split money differently

2026-01-19T15:08:57.790991 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Martin.

If you're referring to how HMRC handles Child Benefit payments differently from your maintenance payments, you're correct that these are entirely separate systems.

To clarify:
- Child Benefit is administered by HMRC and paid to the person who has main responsibility for the children (typically where the children live most of the time)
- Child maintenance payments (like your £40 weekly) are separate arrangements, either agreed privately between parents or through the Child Maintenance Service

HMRC doesn't split Child Benefit between parents - it's paid in full to one eligible person. Your ex-wife would receive the full Child Benefit payment for both children if she's claimed it, with a higher rate for the eldest child (Ben) and the standard rate for the younger child (Jerry).

Your maintenance payments are completely separate from this benefit system.

Is there a specific aspect of how HMRC handles these payments that you'd like me to explain further?

2026-01-19T15:08:58.894639 [actor]: can ask hmrc split money different ben and jerry

2026-01-19T15:09:03.325227 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking if you can request HMRC to split the Child Benefit differently between Ben and Jerry, or perhaps between you and your ex-wife.

Unfortunately, HMRC doesn't allow for Child Benefit to be split between parents or arranged differently for each child in your situation. Child Benefit is designed to be paid in full to the person who has main responsibility for the children.

Since both Ben and Jerry live with your ex-wife, she would be eligible to receive the Child Benefit for both children. HMRC would pay her:
- A higher rate for Ben (as the eldest child)
- The standard rate for Jerry

You cannot ask HMRC to split this payment or to redirect part of it to you based on the maintenance you pay. These are separate systems, and your maintenance payments don't affect how Child Benefit is allocated.

If your circumstances were to change significantly, such as if the children came to live with you, then you could apply for Child Benefit at that point.

2026-01-19T15:09:04.293455 [actor]: unequal contribution children benefit allowed hmrc

2026-01-19T15:09:10.114277 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about unequal contributions and if HMRC allows for different arrangements for Child Benefit.

To clarify the HMRC position: Child Benefit is not designed to reflect or be adjusted based on the financial contributions each parent makes toward their children's upkeep. The benefit is simply paid to the person who has main responsibility for caring for the children (usually the parent they live with most of the time).

HMRC does not have provisions to adjust Child Benefit based on:
- How much each parent contributes financially
- Unequal maintenance payments
- Special financial arrangements between parents

The only situation where HMRC might consider a different arrangement is if the care arrangements change significantly - for example, if one child were to live primarily with you while the other lived with your ex-wife. Even then, each parent would claim for the child in their care, rather than "splitting" a single benefit.

If you feel the current financial arrangements for supporting Ben and Jerry aren't fair, this would need to be addressed through:
1. Direct discussion with your ex-wife
2. Mediation services
3. The Child Maintenance Service
4. Family courts

But these would affect your maintenance payments, not how Child Benefit is allocated by HMRC.

2026-01-19T15:09:14.163391 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the user (as the non-resident parent who pays maintenance) is not eligible for Child Benefit since the children live with the ex-wife, and Child Benefit is paid to the person with main responsibility for the children.
