2026-01-19T14:56:01.123147 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one by one.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T14:56:02.113921 [actor]: child yes not live with me daughter

2026-01-19T14:56:04.104334 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you have a child, specifically a daughter, who doesn't live with you.

To better assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask who your daughter currently lives with? This is important as Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with.

2026-01-19T14:56:04.909711 [actor]: lives with mother

2026-01-19T14:56:07.249311 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your daughter lives with her mother.

In this situation, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who the child lives with - in this case, your daughter's mother would normally be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.

However, I'd like to check further details. Do you contribute financially to your daughter's upkeep with an amount at least equal to the weekly rate of Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T14:56:08.452296 [actor]: give her money ten pounds weekly

2026-01-19T14:56:11.881702 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You mentioned you give your daughter £10 weekly.

The current weekly Child Benefit rates (as of 2023) are £24.00 for the eldest or only child and £15.90 for each additional child. Since you contribute £10 weekly, which is less than the Child Benefit weekly rate, this would not generally qualify you to claim Child Benefit instead of your daughter's mother.

To claim Child Benefit when you don't live with the child, your financial contribution typically needs to be at least equal to the Child Benefit amount, and there would need to be agreement with the current recipient.

Is there any specific arrangement or agreement you have with your daughter's mother regarding Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T14:56:12.613726 [actor]: mother not claim

2026-01-19T14:56:15.101954 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. If your daughter's mother is not claiming Child Benefit, this creates a different situation.

Since your daughter doesn't live with you and you contribute £10 weekly (which is less than the Child Benefit weekly rate), you would typically not be the primary eligible person to claim Child Benefit. However, if the mother is not claiming it, you may potentially be eligible under certain circumstances.

May I ask how old your daughter is? This will help me determine if she falls within the eligible age range for Child Benefit.

2026-01-19T14:56:15.917083 [actor]: emma 12 years

2026-01-19T14:56:19.939354 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your daughter Emma is 12 years old, which means she falls within the eligible age range for Child Benefit (under 16, or under 20 if in approved education).

Given that:
1. Your daughter lives with her mother
2. The mother is not claiming Child Benefit
3. You contribute £10 weekly to Emma's upkeep (though this is less than the weekly Child Benefit rate)

You might be able to claim Child Benefit, but there are some considerations:

Typically, the person the child lives with has priority for claiming. However, if they're not claiming and you can demonstrate you're contributing to the child's upkeep, you may be eligible.

Would you be able to increase your financial contribution to at least match the Child Benefit rate (currently £24.00 per week for an only or eldest child)?

2026-01-19T14:56:20.785704 [actor]: send her birthday present too

2026-01-19T14:56:24.315975 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that additional information. I understand you send your daughter birthday presents in addition to the £10 weekly contribution.

While birthday presents do count as contributing to your child's upkeep, the total financial contribution is still an important factor in determining Child Benefit eligibility when the child doesn't live with you.

In your situation, since:
1. Emma lives with her mother who is not claiming Child Benefit
2. You contribute financially, though less than the weekly benefit rate
3. You provide additional support like birthday presents

You may potentially claim Child Benefit, but it's important to note that the HMRC may assess whether your contributions are sufficient and regular enough to qualify.

May I ask if you have any formal arrangement regarding your daughter, such as a child arrangement order or any legal agreement with her mother?

2026-01-19T14:56:25.116232 [actor]: no formal arrangement

2026-01-19T14:56:30.110447 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you don't have any formal arrangement.

Based on all the information you've provided:

1. Your 12-year-old daughter Emma lives with her mother
2. The mother is not claiming Child Benefit
3. You contribute £10 weekly and provide birthday presents
4. You don't have any formal arrangement or legal agreement

You might be eligible to claim Child Benefit, but there are some considerations:

The UK government typically prefers that the person the child lives with claims Child Benefit. Since Emma's mother isn't claiming it, you could potentially apply, but be aware that:

- You might need to demonstrate that your contributions are regular and substantial
- HMRC may question why the mother isn't claiming when the child lives with her
- Your current financial contribution (£10/week) is less than the Child Benefit rate (£24/week)

If you decide to apply, you would need to complete a Child Benefit claim form (CH2) and explain your circumstances, including why you believe you're eligible despite not living with Emma.

Would you like to know the process for applying for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T14:56:31.282592 [actor]: not eligible? too little money?

2026-01-19T14:56:36.610376 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided and the UK government's guidelines on Child Benefit eligibility, I need to clarify your situation:

When a child doesn't live with you, you may still qualify for Child Benefit if you:
- Pay at least the same amount as the weekly rate of Child Benefit toward the child's upkeep
- Have your claim prioritized over any other potential claimant

Since you contribute £10 weekly, which is less than the current Child Benefit rate of £24.00 per week for an eldest or only child, your financial contribution would likely be considered insufficient to qualify for Child Benefit under these specific circumstances.

The birthday presents you mentioned are considered additional support, but the regular monetary contribution is the primary consideration when the child lives elsewhere.

So yes, in this specific situation, it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit primarily because your regular financial contribution is below the required threshold when the child lives with someone else.

If your circumstances change, such as if you increase your financial support to at least match the Child Benefit rate, your eligibility could be reconsidered.

2026-01-19T14:56:40.594436 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because their £10 weekly contribution is below the required threshold (at least equal to the Child Benefit rate of £24/week) when the child lives with someone else.
