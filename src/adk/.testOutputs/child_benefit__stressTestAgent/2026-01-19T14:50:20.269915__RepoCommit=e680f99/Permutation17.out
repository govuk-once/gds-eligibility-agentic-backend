2026-01-19T14:57:05.330114 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T14:57:08.894313 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about Child Benefit for military families with children in Germany who have connections to the UK.

To determine if you might be eligible for UK Child Benefit while stationed in Germany with the military, I need to ask: Are you or your partner a UK national who is working for the UK armed forces or as a civil servant abroad?

2026-01-19T14:57:11.140750 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're a UK army major stationed in Germany with your family, including two children.

How old are your two children?

2026-01-19T14:57:14.163033 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know your children are 8 and 10 years old and living on base with you in Germany.

As you're a UK army major stationed abroad with your family, this is important information for your Child Benefit eligibility. 

Are you or your partner receiving any similar family benefits from Germany for these children?

2026-01-19T14:57:15.244596 [actor]: no german benefits military base uk territory

2026-01-19T14:57:18.382844 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're not receiving any German benefits and that you're on a military base considered UK territory.

Given that you're a UK army major stationed in Germany with your family on a UK military base, and you have two children aged 8 and 10 who live with you, and you're not claiming any similar benefits from Germany, you would likely be eligible for UK Child Benefit.

UK Crown servants (including military personnel) posted overseas generally maintain their eligibility for Child Benefit as if they were still in the UK.

Would you like me to explain how much Child Benefit you might receive or how to make a claim?

This aligns with the rules that UK Crown servants posted overseas maintain their eligibility.
