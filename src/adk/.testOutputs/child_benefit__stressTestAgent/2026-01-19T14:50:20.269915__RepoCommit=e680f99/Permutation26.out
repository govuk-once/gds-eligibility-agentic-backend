2026-01-19T15:01:20.620182 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit, but I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T15:01:21.980618 [actor]: I'll help you by playing the role of a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

child son Zahid 15 lives with aunt

2026-01-19T15:01:23.589898 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand that your son Zahid, who is 15, lives with his aunt rather than with you.

To better assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you clarify whether you provide any financial support for Zahid's upbringing?

2026-01-19T15:01:24.424200 [actor]: send money weekly 15 pounds

2026-01-19T15:01:26.359345 [root_agent]: I understand that you send £15 weekly to support Zahid. 

When it comes to Child Benefit for a child living with someone else, the eligibility depends on who has the main responsibility for the child.

Could you tell me if Zahid's aunt is currently claiming Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-19T15:01:27.113971 [actor]: aunt not claim no

2026-01-19T15:01:28.924361 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Zahid's aunt is not claiming Child Benefit for him.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to understand more about your relationship with Zahid. Do you still have parental responsibility for him, even though he lives with his aunt?

2026-01-19T15:01:29.678531 [actor]: yes my son

2026-01-19T15:01:32.147561 [root_agent]: I understand that Zahid is your son and you maintain parental responsibility for him.

Since your son lives with his aunt but you contribute financially to his upbringing and maintain parental responsibility, you may be eligible for Child Benefit if you're contributing at least the same amount as the weekly rate of Child Benefit toward his upkeep (which is more than the £15 you currently send).

Could you please tell me if anyone else is claiming Child Benefit for Zahid currently?

2026-01-19T15:01:33.091638 [actor]: no one claiming grandmother sends money too 15 pounds weekly

2026-01-19T15:01:35.115398 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. I understand that no one is currently claiming Child Benefit for Zahid, and both you and the grandmother each send £15 weekly to support him.

In cases where a child lives with someone else, the eligibility for Child Benefit typically goes to the person who has main responsibility for the child. 

Could you clarify why Zahid lives with his aunt rather than with you? Is this a temporary or permanent arrangement?

2026-01-19T15:01:35.958871 [actor]: school near aunt house permanent arrangement

2026-01-19T15:01:38.320580 [root_agent]: I understand this is a permanent arrangement so Zahid can attend school near his aunt's house.

For Child Benefit eligibility when a child lives with someone else, the key factor is who has main responsibility for the child's care. Since Zahid permanently lives with his aunt and she provides his day-to-day care, she would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit, even though you contribute financially.

Do you have any formal agreement or court order regarding Zahid's living arrangements or financial support?

2026-01-19T15:01:39.204186 [actor]: no agreement informal family arrangement

2026-01-19T15:01:43.590629 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that this is an informal family arrangement without any formal agreement.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears that your aunt has the main day-to-day responsibility for caring for Zahid, which is an important factor in Child Benefit eligibility.

Given that:
1. Zahid permanently lives with his aunt
2. The aunt provides day-to-day care
3. You contribute £15 weekly
4. No one is currently claiming Child Benefit for him

It seems the aunt would be the person most likely eligible to claim Child Benefit as the person with main responsibility for Zahid. However, if you believe you still have main responsibility despite the living arrangement, you could make a claim, but you would need to demonstrate this.

Would you like information about how your aunt could apply for Child Benefit, or would you like to discuss how you might demonstrate that you have main responsibility?

2026-01-19T15:01:44.735299 [actor]: combined money grandmother me 30 pounds enough for claim?

2026-01-19T15:01:49.292615 [root_agent]: The amount of money you contribute is one factor in determining who has main responsibility for Zahid, but it's not just about meeting a specific financial threshold.

To claim Child Benefit, the key consideration is who has the main responsibility for the child. While you and the grandmother together contribute £30 weekly, the fact that Zahid lives permanently with his aunt and she provides daily care is significant.

The Child Benefit weekly rates are currently £24.00 for the eldest or only child and £15.90 for each additional child. So the combined £30 you and the grandmother contribute does exceed the basic rate, which is a positive factor.

However, eligibility also considers who:
- Provides day-to-day care
- Buys clothing, food, and other necessities
- Makes decisions about education and medical treatment

Have you discussed with the aunt who should claim the Child Benefit since no one is currently claiming it?

2026-01-19T15:01:50.547437 [actor]: aunt says don't want claim me want claim for son money enough?

2026-01-19T15:01:55.306029 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand the aunt doesn't want to claim Child Benefit herself and is supportive of you making the claim for your son.

Given this situation, you may have grounds to claim Child Benefit if:

1. You maintain parental responsibility for Zahid
2. You contribute financially to his upkeep (the combined £30 per week exceeds the standard Child Benefit rate)
3. You remain involved in major decisions about his welfare
4. The aunt who has day-to-day care doesn't wish to claim

The fact that the person providing day-to-day care (the aunt) has explicitly stated she doesn't want to claim and supports your application is an important factor. In such cases, HMRC would consider the specific circumstances of your arrangement.

To proceed with a claim, you would need to explain the living arrangement on your Child Benefit application and may need to provide additional information about your ongoing parental responsibility and financial contributions.

Would you like information about how to make a Child Benefit claim in these circumstances?

2026-01-19T15:01:56.178595 [actor]: so eligible or not eligible?

2026-01-19T15:02:00.149189 [root_agent]: Based on all the information you've provided, I can give you an assessment of your eligibility for Child Benefit:

You may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your son Zahid, even though he lives with his aunt, because:

1. You maintain parental responsibility for him
2. You contribute financially to his upkeep (combined with the grandmother, this exceeds the standard Child Benefit rate)
3. The aunt who provides day-to-day care does not wish to claim the benefit and is supportive of you claiming it
4. No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for Zahid

However, your eligibility isn't completely straightforward due to the living arrangement. When you apply, you would need to explain these circumstances to HMRC, who would make the final determination based on all factors of your specific situation.

If you decide to apply, be prepared to provide details about your arrangement and ongoing parental involvement with Zahid.

2026-01-19T15:02:01.894247 [actor]: I understand I may be eligible for Child Benefit for Zahid. Thank you for the information.

2026-01-19T15:02:04.786901 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent appropriately explained that the user may be eligible for Child Benefit given they maintain parental responsibility, provide financial support, and the aunt (who provides day-to-day care) doesn't want to claim.
