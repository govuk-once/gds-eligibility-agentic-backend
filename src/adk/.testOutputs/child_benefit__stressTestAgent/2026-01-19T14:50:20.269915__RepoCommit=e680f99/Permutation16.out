2026-01-19T14:56:42.324726 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First question: Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T14:56:43.212144 [actor]: child yes he's 14 in hospital

2026-01-19T14:56:45.351477 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. I understand your child is 14 years old and currently in hospital.

How long has your child been in hospital, and are you still regularly in contact with them or visiting them?

2026-01-19T14:56:46.224940 [actor]: oliver hospital america 15 weeks special treatment

2026-01-19T14:56:48.388406 [root_agent]: I understand that your child, Oliver, has been in hospital in America for 15 weeks receiving special treatment.

Thank you for this information. For Child Benefit eligibility while your child is in hospital, I need to understand whether you're still responsible for your child during this hospital stay.

Are you still supporting your child financially and making decisions about their care while they're receiving treatment in America?

2026-01-19T14:56:49.294494 [actor]: still pay his costs visit when i can

2026-01-19T14:56:51.077553 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're still paying for Oliver's costs and visiting when possible while he's receiving treatment in America.

Do you normally live in the UK? I'm asking because this is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-19T14:56:52.057526 [actor]: yes uk resident

2026-01-19T14:56:53.249560 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are a UK resident. 

Next question: Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Oliver?

2026-01-19T14:56:54.003611 [actor]: no only me claim

2026-01-19T14:56:55.420075 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that only you are claiming Child Benefit for Oliver.

Is your individual income (or your partner's if you have one) over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T14:56:56.272779 [actor]: no not earn that much

2026-01-19T14:57:00.368034 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your income level.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you are likely eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You're responsible for a child under 16 (Oliver, who is 14)
2. You're a UK resident
3. You continue to financially support your child and maintain responsibility for them while they're receiving hospital treatment abroad
4. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Oliver
5. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would fully reduce your benefit

The fact that your child is temporarily in hospital abroad for treatment doesn't disqualify you from receiving Child Benefit, as you're still maintaining responsibility for them and supporting them financially.

If you're already receiving Child Benefit, it should continue. If you haven't applied yet, you may want to apply through the official government website.

Is there anything specific about Child Benefit you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-19T14:57:03.699905 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that the person is eligible for Child Benefit as they are a UK resident, responsible for a child under 16, still financially supporting the child during hospital treatment abroad, no one else is claiming, and their income is below the threshold.
