2026-01-19T15:06:44.821199 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions.

First, do you have any children living with you who you're responsible for?

daughter Kelly sixteen doing A-levels soon

2026-01-19T15:06:47.988999 [root_agent]: I'll help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit for your daughter Kelly.

Since Kelly is 16 and doing A-levels soon, I need to ask: Is Kelly currently in approved education (like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3) or approved training?

2026-01-19T15:06:48.793792 [actor]: finished GCSEs June college September worried about now

2026-01-19T15:06:51.527097 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Kelly finished her GCSEs in June, will be starting college in September, and you're concerned about the current gap period.

Child Benefit can continue during the period between leaving school and starting further education or training. Since Kelly has finished her GCSEs and is planning to start A-levels at college in September, you should remain eligible during this gap period, as long as she's registered or accepted for the approved education that will start in September.

May I ask if Kelly has been accepted or registered for her A-level courses starting in September?

2026-01-19T15:06:52.480645 [actor]: yes accepted already college sent letter

2026-01-19T15:06:54.306581 [root_agent]: That's good news. Since Kelly has been accepted for her A-level courses and you have confirmation from the college, you should remain eligible for Child Benefit during this gap period between her GCSEs ending and A-levels beginning in September.

Do you currently receive Child Benefit for Kelly, or are you looking to make a new claim?

2026-01-19T15:06:55.185652 [actor]: receiving it now worried stop august

2026-01-19T15:06:58.820343 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand you're currently receiving Child Benefit for Kelly and you're worried it might stop in August.

I can assure you that your Child Benefit should continue without interruption during this period between Kelly finishing her GCSEs in June and starting A-levels in September. Since she's been accepted at college and you have confirmation of this (the letter from the college), the benefit should continue.

There's no need to report this temporary gap to the Child Benefit Office, as it's considered a normal transition period. Your payments should continue as normal as long as Kelly starts her approved education (A-levels) in September as planned.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement for Kelly?

2026-01-19T15:07:02.497542 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit continues during the gap period between completing GCSEs and starting A-levels when the child has been accepted for the further education.
