2026-01-19T15:01:01.499570 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a series of questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you who you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T15:01:02.851022 [actor]: I'll help by roleplaying as a person inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

child care benefits son Leo in care

2026-01-19T15:01:04.277506 [root_agent]: I'll help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit regarding your son Leo who is in care.

To understand your situation better, is Leo temporarily in care, or is this a permanent arrangement?

2026-01-19T15:01:05.258012 [actor]: temporary care 10 weeks local authority

2026-01-19T15:01:06.907179 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Leo is temporarily in local authority care for 10 weeks, I need to understand a bit more about the situation.

Were you receiving Child Benefit for Leo before he went into care?

2026-01-19T15:01:07.756836 [actor]: yes before care

2026-01-19T15:01:10.445447 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Since you were receiving Child Benefit for Leo before he went into care, and he's only temporarily in local authority care for 10 weeks, you can continue to receive Child Benefit during this period.

The UK government allows Child Benefit to continue for limited periods when a child is temporarily being looked after by a local authority. Since this is a temporary arrangement of 10 weeks, you remain eligible.

Is there anything specific about your Child Benefit payments that you'd like to know more about while Leo is temporarily in care?

2026-01-19T15:01:11.453342 [actor]: husband pays £30 weekly to carer no income myself

2026-01-19T15:01:15.239758 [root_agent]: I understand that your husband is paying £30 weekly to the carer and you personally have no income.

The fact that your husband is making payments to the carer doesn't affect your Child Benefit eligibility. Child Benefit is generally paid regardless of income levels, though there is a High Income Child Benefit Charge that applies if an individual in the household has income over £50,000 per year.

Since you mentioned you have no income yourself, you should continue to receive Child Benefit while Leo is temporarily in care. If you are the person named on the Child Benefit claim (rather than your husband), the payments would continue to be made to you.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit while your child is temporarily in care?

2026-01-19T15:01:19.016542 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that Child Benefit can continue during a temporary care arrangement of 10 weeks with a local authority.
