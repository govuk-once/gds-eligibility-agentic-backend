The agent failed to recognize that there is indeed an exception to the 8-week rule when a child spends at least 2 nights in a row at home regularly, which is exactly the user's situation. The official guidance states that Child Benefit can continue if the child regularly spends at least 2 consecutive nights at home, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (via Exception)."
