2026-01-19T15:07:58.225248 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your situation accurately, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T15:08:00.691771 [root_agent]: I understand you've adopted 6 and 8-year-old siblings with special needs. Thank you for sharing that information.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, are you living in the UK?

2026-01-19T15:08:01.649652 [actor]: UK resident adoption allowance from local council

2026-01-19T15:08:03.122411 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you're a UK resident and receiving an adoption allowance from your local council.

Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year before tax?

2026-01-19T15:08:04.215704 [actor]: two parents 50k 30k jobs work full time

2026-01-19T15:08:09.018326 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're in a two-parent household with incomes of £50,000 and £30,000, and you both work full-time.

Based on the information you've provided so far:

1. You're responsible for two adopted children aged 6 and 8 who have special needs
2. You're a UK resident
3. Your household income includes two salaries (£50,000 and £30,000)

Since both of your individual incomes are below £60,000, you would be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount. If either of you had an income between £50,000 and £60,000, there would be a partial reduction through the High Income Child Benefit Charge, but this doesn't apply to your situation.

As you've adopted the children and they're living with you, you should be eligible for Child Benefit. The current rates are £25.60 per week for your eldest child and £16.95 per week for your second child.

Would you like information on how to claim Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T15:08:10.988406 [actor]: Yes, I'm eligible for child benefit since we've adopted these children, have incomes under £60,000, and are UK residents. The adoption allowance we receive for their special needs doesn't disqualify us from receiving child benefit.

2026-01-19T15:08:13.100876 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the family is eligible for Child Benefit based on having adopted children under 16, being UK residents, and having individual incomes below £60,000.
