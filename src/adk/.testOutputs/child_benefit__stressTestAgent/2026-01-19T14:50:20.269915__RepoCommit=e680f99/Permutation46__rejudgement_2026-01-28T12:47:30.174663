2026-01-28T12:52:53.713231 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that Hans is likely eligible for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome was "Not Eligible (Expired)". The agent failed to identify that as a jobseeker, Hans can only claim for 91 days, and he has already been claiming for 95 days without a genuine prospect of work, meaning his right to reside for benefit purposes has expired.
