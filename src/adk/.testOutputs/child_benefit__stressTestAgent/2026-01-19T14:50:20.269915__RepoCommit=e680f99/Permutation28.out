2026-01-19T15:03:32.786464 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T15:03:33.788334 [actor]: I have kid 5 years old with me in UK

2026-01-19T15:03:35.809515 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. You have a 5-year-old child with you in the UK, which is helpful to know.

Could you please tell me if you're responsible for raising this child? This would mean the child lives with you or you're paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit toward their upkeep.

2026-01-19T15:03:36.783124 [actor]: son stays with me yes tourist visa

2026-01-19T15:03:38.571599 [root_agent]: I see that your son stays with you, and you mentioned a tourist visa.

Could you clarify if you and your child are normally living in the UK, or are you visiting as tourists? Child Benefit eligibility typically requires that you're living in the UK.

2026-01-19T15:03:43.072882 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're visiting the UK for 6 months and are a USA citizen.

Based on this information, I need to inform you that you would not be eligible for UK Child Benefit. Child Benefit is generally available to people who:

1. Are "normally living in the UK" (not visiting as tourists)
2. Have immigration status that allows them to claim public funds in the UK

As you're visiting on a tourist visa for 6 months, you wouldn't meet the residence requirement for Child Benefit. Tourist visas also typically have a "no recourse to public funds" condition, which means you cannot access most UK benefits, including Child Benefit.

Is there anything else about UK support systems you'd like to know about during your stay?

2026-01-19T15:03:44.504420 [actor]: not eligible ok

2026-01-19T15:03:46.719367 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent was correct to inform the user that they are not eligible for Child Benefit as tourists on a 6-month visa from the USA do not meet the UK residence requirements for Child Benefit.
