2026-01-19T15:12:09.969184 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T15:12:11.605462 [actor]: I'll help by role-playing as a user in this conversation about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the guidelines to be obtuse, speak like I'm using search terms, and not directly answer questions.

son seventeen computer course

2026-01-19T15:12:13.515087 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a son who is 17 and is doing some kind of computer course.

To determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, I need to clarify whether this computer course is considered approved education or training by the UK government.

Is your son in approved education, such as A-levels, NVQs, or other further education courses that are approved by the UK government?

2026-01-19T15:12:14.474361 [actor]: computer coding training employer paid future job agreement

2026-01-19T15:12:16.676713 [root_agent]: I understand your 17-year-old son is doing computer coding training that's paid for by an employer with some kind of future job agreement.

To clarify for Child Benefit purposes, is this training part of an approved apprenticeship scheme or a government-recognized training program? The type of education or training your son is in matters for Child Benefit eligibility for children over 16.

2026-01-19T15:12:17.687562 [actor]: not apprenticeship company pays course fees join after complete no salary during training

2026-01-19T15:12:20.611199 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

For Child Benefit eligibility for a 17-year-old, the training needs to be what's considered "approved education or training" by the UK government. Based on what you've shared, if this is a private arrangement with a company where they pay for training with a job offer afterward, but it's not a recognized apprenticeship or government-approved training program, it may not qualify for Child Benefit purposes.

Do you know if your son's training course is recognized by the UK government as approved education or training? Examples would include courses that lead to qualifications like BTECs, NVQs, or other recognized qualifications.

2026-01-19T15:12:21.668919 [actor]: coding course employer agreement not government program

2026-01-19T15:12:25.165917 [root_agent]: I understand that your son is on a coding course with an employer agreement, but it's not a government program.

Based on this information, it appears your son's training may not meet the criteria for "approved education or training" as defined by the UK government for Child Benefit purposes. Child Benefit typically continues for children aged 16-19 only if they're in approved education such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or government-recognized apprenticeships.

Now I need to ask: do you have any other children under 16, or other children under 20 who are in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T15:12:26.219319 [actor]: no other children just tom employer course

2026-01-19T15:12:29.892690 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Tom is your only child and he's on this employer-provided course.

Based on the information you've shared, it appears you may not be eligible for Child Benefit. This is because:

1. Child Benefit is paid for children under 16, or under 20 if they are in approved education or training
2. Your son Tom is 17 and appears to be in training that is not recognized as "approved education or training" by the UK government standards

If you believe his coding course might actually be part of an approved program or qualification, it would be worth checking directly with the Child Benefit Office to confirm. They can provide definitive guidance on whether his specific training program qualifies.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-19T15:12:31.772185 [actor]: I understand that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit for Tom since he's 17 and his employer-agreed coding course doesn't count as approved education for benefit purposes.

2026-01-19T15:12:34.068922 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the child benefit is not available since the 17-year-old son is not in government-approved education or training.
