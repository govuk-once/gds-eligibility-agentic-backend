2026-01-19T14:50:42.504226 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a series of questions.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T14:50:43.960094 [actor]: I'll role-play as the person described in the situation you provided.

Priya school money help

2026-01-19T14:50:45.749985 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about Child Benefit as Priya, and you're interested in help with school money. I'll need to ask you some questions to determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T14:50:46.881404 [actor]: Daughter studying A levels

2026-01-19T14:50:48.987210 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your daughter is studying A levels.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask if you are responsible for this child? By responsible, I mean that the child lives with you or you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit toward their upkeep.

2026-01-19T14:50:49.780190 [actor]: Single father London

2026-01-19T14:50:51.367925 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you're a single father in London.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I'd like to confirm - does your daughter live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit toward her upkeep?

2026-01-19T14:50:52.482071 [actor]: She lives with me 17 years old

2026-01-19T14:50:54.404025 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your 17-year-old daughter lives with you. That's helpful information.

Since your daughter is 17 and studying A levels (which counts as approved education), you meet one of the main criteria for Child Benefit.

My next question is: Are you a UK resident?

2026-01-19T14:50:55.440291 [actor]: Born in UK

2026-01-19T14:50:57.004939 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you were born in the UK.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income of over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T14:50:57.973796 [actor]: Salary 40k

2026-01-19T14:50:59.630948 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that your salary is £40,000.

Since your income is below £50,000, you would be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit amount without the High Income Child Benefit Charge applying.

Is your daughter a UK resident and normally living in the UK?

2026-01-19T14:51:00.425615 [actor]: Living in London since birth

2026-01-19T14:51:03.616122 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your daughter has been living in London since birth.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You're responsible for a 17-year-old daughter who lives with you
- She's studying A levels (approved education)
- You were born in the UK and your daughter has lived in London since birth
- Your income is £40,000, which is below the threshold where Child Benefit starts to be reduced

You appear to be eligible for the full Child Benefit payment. As a single father with one child studying A levels, you should qualify to receive Child Benefit until your daughter completes her A levels or turns 20, whichever comes first.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit or details about the current payment rates?

2026-01-19T14:51:07.123677 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a single father with a 17-year-old A-level student living with him, with a £40,000 income, is eligible for the full Child Benefit payment.
