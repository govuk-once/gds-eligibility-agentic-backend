According to official guidance, Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks in hospital unless the parent "regularly spends money" on the child's care, food, clothes, or other items. The transcript clearly states the parent visits daily but does not purchase anything for the child as the hospital provides everything. This means they are not eligible after 14 weeks.
