2026-01-27T22:07:05.002973 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ The agent gave incorrect information. In England, starting an apprenticeship is a disqualifying event for Child Benefit. The correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible" (Karen must stop her claim), but the agent incorrectly stated the user was eligible.
