2026-01-26T16:19:06.289957 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First question: Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T16:19:07.266760 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Jack. He's 14 years old.

2026-01-26T16:19:08.166730 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. 

Does Jack live with you?

2026-01-26T16:19:09.747656 [actor]: Well, my situation is a bit complicated. Jack was placed in local authority care about 3 months ago, but he comes home to stay with me every weekend. He arrives on Friday evening and leaves on Sunday evening.

2026-01-26T16:19:11.394908 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation. I understand Jack is currently in local authority care but stays with you on weekends.

For how long is Jack expected to be in local authority care? Is this a temporary or permanent arrangement?

2026-01-26T16:19:13.177180 [actor]: It's a longer-term arrangement, but I'm hoping he might be able to come back home full-time eventually. For now though, he's been in care for about 3 months already and this arrangement with weekend visits is what we have in place.

2026-01-26T16:19:16.027055 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, your situation is covered by specific Child Benefit rules for children in care. Since Jack has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks (3 months in your case), you would not normally be eligible for Child Benefit for him.

However, since Jack regularly comes to stay with you on weekends, you may be eligible for what's called a "weekly rate" of Child Benefit for the days he stays with you.

Were you receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into care?

2026-01-26T16:19:17.541722 [actor]: Yes, I was receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into care. So does that mean I can continue getting some support even though he's in care most of the time?

2026-01-26T16:19:21.691532 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Since you were receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into care, and he now regularly stays with you on weekends, you may be eligible for Child Benefit at a weekly rate for each full day that he stays with you (typically Saturday and Sunday in your case).

You should contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them about your current situation. They will likely adjust your payments to reflect the days Jack spends with you rather than stopping the benefit entirely.

To make this adjustment, you'll need to tell them:
- The date Jack went into care
- The details of how often he stays with you (your weekend arrangement)
- Any changes to this arrangement if they occur in the future

Would you like me to explain how you can contact the Child Benefit Office about this?

2026-01-26T16:19:23.173388 [actor]: Yes, that would be helpful. I'd like to know how to contact them about my situation. It's good to hear I might still get some benefit for the days Jack stays with me.

2026-01-26T16:19:27.581678 [root_agent]: I'm glad I could help clarify your situation. Here's how you can contact the Child Benefit Office to update them about Jack's circumstances:

By phone:
Call the Child Benefit Helpline at 0300 200 3100
Opening hours are Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
You'll need your National Insurance number and Child Benefit number when you call

By post:
Write to:
Child Benefit Office
PO Box 1
Newcastle Upon Tyne
NE88 1AA

When contacting them, explain Jack's current care situation, including:
- The exact date he went into local authority care
- Your regular weekend arrangement (Friday evening to Sunday evening)
- Any supporting documentation you might have about this arrangement

The Child Benefit Office will then recalculate your entitlement based on the days Jack stays with you. They should provide you with information about how much you'll receive and when payments will be made.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-26T16:19:29.989032 [actor]: No, that's all the information I need for now. I'll call the Child Benefit Helpline and explain Jack's situation to them. Thanks for letting me know I might still get some benefit for the weekends when he stays with me. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-26T16:19:32.616908 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that for a child in care for more than 8 weeks, the parent would not normally receive full Child Benefit but may be eligible for a weekly rate for the days the child stays with them (weekends in this case).
