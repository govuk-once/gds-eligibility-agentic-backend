The agent correctly determined that Amit is eligible for Child Benefit because his daughter Priya meets all the criteria: she's under 20 and in approved education, she lives with him, he's responsible for her, he meets UK residency requirements, and his income is below the threshold that would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
