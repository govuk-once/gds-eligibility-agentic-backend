2026-01-27T18:44:56.396058 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that there is no time limit for Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in hospital. According to UK government rules, after a cumulative 12-week hospital stay with breaks less than 28 days (Arthur had 15 days), the parent becomes ineligible unless they're still contributing to the child's upkeep. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" but the agent said the parent remains eligible.
