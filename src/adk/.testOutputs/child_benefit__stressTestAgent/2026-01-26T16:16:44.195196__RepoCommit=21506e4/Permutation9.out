2026-01-26T16:19:53.886927 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions.

First, do you have any children living with you who you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T16:19:55.106148 [actor]: I'll respond as if I'm a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Yes, I have my son Hans who is 5 years old living with me.

2026-01-26T16:19:56.239455 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To continue assessing your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to know if you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:19:57.138136 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I moved here recently from Germany.

2026-01-26T16:19:58.971460 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To further assess your eligibility, may I ask about your immigration status? Do you have the right to reside in the UK, such as being a British citizen, having settled status, or another immigration status that allows you to live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:20:00.084854 [actor]: I'm a German citizen and I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme. I moved to the UK recently.

2026-01-26T16:20:01.795213 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. With Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you may be eligible for Child Benefit.

Now, regarding your son Hans, is he living with you in the UK as well?

2026-01-26T16:20:03.010247 [actor]: Yes, Hans lives with me here in the UK.

2026-01-26T16:20:04.272235 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Hans lives with you in the UK. 

May I ask if anyone else (such as another parent or guardian) is already claiming Child Benefit for Hans?

2026-01-26T16:20:05.414467 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Hans. It's just me and him living here.

2026-01-26T16:20:06.976599 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is Hans in full-time education or approved training? For a 5-year-old, this would typically mean attending primary school.

2026-01-26T16:20:07.862499 [actor]: Yes, Hans is in primary school.

2026-01-26T16:20:11.041245 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Hans is in primary school.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have a 5-year-old son, Hans, who lives with you
- You live in the UK with Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Hans
- Hans is attending primary school

It appears you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your son Hans. Child Benefit is typically available to those responsible for bringing up a child under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training) who live in the UK and have the right to reside here.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?
