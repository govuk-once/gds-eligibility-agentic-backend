2026-01-26T16:33:33.568655 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T16:33:35.318257 [actor]: I'm a parent concerned about my child benefit situation. My son Simon, who's 15, has been detained under the Mental Health Act and placed in a secure psychiatric unit. He's been there for 10 weeks now. I'm wondering if I'm still eligible to receive child benefit while he's in the unit?

2026-01-26T16:33:39.149333 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand your concern about your Child Benefit eligibility while your son Simon is receiving treatment in a psychiatric unit.

Based on the rules for Child Benefit, you can typically continue to receive Child Benefit when your child is in hospital or receiving care like this. Since Simon has been in the psychiatric unit for 10 weeks, you should still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit.

The UK government allows Child Benefit to continue when a child is temporarily away from home receiving medical treatment or care. This situation would not normally affect your entitlement as you're still considered responsible for Simon.

May I ask, are you still maintaining regular contact with Simon during his stay at the psychiatric unit?

2026-01-26T16:33:41.472645 [actor]: Yes, I visit Simon as often as I can. Usually about twice a week. The unit is about an hour's drive from our home, but I make sure I'm there regularly to support him. I also call him almost every evening when he's feeling up to talking.

2026-01-26T16:33:45.283780 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. The fact that you're maintaining regular contact with Simon through your twice-weekly visits and almost daily phone calls is important.

Based on this, you would still be considered responsible for Simon despite his temporary placement in the psychiatric unit. The UK government's Child Benefit rules recognize that children may need to be away from home for medical care, and your continued involvement in Simon's life demonstrates ongoing parental responsibility.

Given what you've shared, you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit while Simon is receiving treatment. The temporary nature of his stay in the psychiatric unit and your regular contact with him support your ongoing eligibility.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement in this situation?

2026-01-26T16:33:47.727509 [actor]: That's a relief to hear. I was worried that I might lose the child benefit while Simon is getting the treatment he needs. So I don't need to report anything to the Child Benefit office about this temporary situation? And if his treatment needs to continue for longer, is there a point when I would need to notify them?

2026-01-26T16:33:52.933442 [root_agent]: I understand your relief about the Child Benefit situation while Simon receives his needed treatment.

Regarding reporting requirements, while temporary hospital stays generally don't affect your Child Benefit, it's actually good practice to inform the Child Benefit office about significant changes in your child's circumstances, including extended hospital stays. This keeps your claim up to date and ensures you receive the correct entitlements.

If Simon's treatment needs to extend for a very long period (typically beyond 12 weeks/3 months), it would be advisable to notify the Child Benefit office. While there's no specific time limit stated in the guidance for psychiatric treatment specifically, keeping them informed of extended medical care situations is recommended.

You can report changes by:
- Calling the Child Benefit Helpline on 0300 200 3100
- Writing to the Child Benefit Office address on your award notice

When you contact them, explain Simon's situation, your continued involvement in his care, and the expected duration of treatment if known. This proactive communication helps ensure your benefits continue appropriately.

2026-01-26T16:33:56.201103 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that. It's good to know that I should notify them if his stay extends beyond 12 weeks. His doctors are hoping he can come home soon, but I'll make sure to contact the Child Benefit office if his treatment needs to be extended beyond that timeframe. I appreciate your help in clarifying my eligibility situation.

2026-01-26T16:33:58.795022 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit while their 15-year-old son is temporarily in a psychiatric unit, and properly recommended notifying the Child Benefit office if the stay extends beyond 12 weeks.
