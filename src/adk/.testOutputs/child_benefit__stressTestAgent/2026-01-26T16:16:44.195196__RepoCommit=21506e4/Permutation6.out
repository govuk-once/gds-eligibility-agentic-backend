2026-01-26T16:18:44.322392 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:18:45.212718 [actor]: Yes, I have my daughter Chloe who's 6 years old.

2026-01-26T16:18:46.623979 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you have a 6-year-old daughter, that's an important first criteria for Child Benefit.

Next question: Does your daughter Chloe normally live with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:18:47.855409 [actor]: Yes, Chloe normally lives with me in the UK. However, she's been in the hospital for the last 14 weeks due to a serious condition. I visit her every day.

2026-01-26T16:18:50.186509 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about Chloe. I'm sorry to hear she's been in the hospital, and I hope she's recovering well.

The fact that Chloe is in the hospital doesn't affect your eligibility for Child Benefit. You can continue to receive Child Benefit while your child is in hospital, regardless of the length of stay, as you're maintaining regular contact with her through your daily visits.

My next question: Are you subject to immigration control or do you have any immigration restrictions on your stay in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:18:51.339450 [actor]: No, I don't have any immigration restrictions. I'm a UK resident with no immigration control issues.

2026-01-26T16:18:52.740838 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Next question: Is there anyone else who might be claiming Child Benefit for Chloe? For example, another parent or guardian?

2026-01-26T16:18:53.819790 [actor]: No, there's no one else claiming Child Benefit for Chloe. I'm a single mother and the only one responsible for her.

2026-01-26T16:18:55.332351 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. 

My next question: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T16:18:56.393158 [actor]: No, my income is about £28,000 per year. I don't have a partner.

2026-01-26T16:18:59.625899 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your income information. Since your income is £28,000 per year, which is below the £60,000 threshold, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on all the information you've provided:
- You have responsibility for your 6-year-old daughter Chloe
- She normally lives with you in the UK (her hospital stay doesn't affect this)
- You're not subject to immigration control
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
- Your income is below the threshold that would reduce Child Benefit payments

It appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit. You can claim the full amount without having to pay any of it back through tax.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit or do you have any other questions about it?

2026-01-26T16:19:02.630471 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for Child Benefit. I was worried that Chloe being in the hospital for over 12 weeks might affect my eligibility, so I'm relieved to hear that I can still receive it. I spend about £30 a week on books, pajamas, and special food for her while she's in the hospital.

I'd like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, please.

2026-01-26T16:19:05.043849 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the child's hospital stay doesn't affect Child Benefit eligibility, as the parent maintains regular contact through daily visits and continues to provide for the child's needs.
