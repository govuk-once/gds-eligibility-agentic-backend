2026-01-26T16:20:16.801591 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:20:18.454347 [actor]: I'll now take on the role of Brenda, a foster parent, to engage with this agent.

Yes, I'm responsible for a 12-year-old boy named Liam who lives with me.

2026-01-26T16:20:20.190872 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Brenda. I understand you're responsible for a 12-year-old boy named Liam who lives with you.

Could you please clarify if you are Liam's foster parent?

2026-01-26T16:20:21.088392 [actor]: Yes, I am Liam's foster parent. The local council placed him with me.

2026-01-26T16:20:23.027423 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Brenda. Since you're a foster parent for Liam who was placed with you by the local council, I need to understand more about your situation.

Do you receive payments from the local authority for fostering Liam?

2026-01-26T16:20:24.153929 [actor]: Yes, I do receive a fostering allowance from the local council that covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance.

2026-01-26T16:20:27.213586 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Brenda. Based on what you've shared, I need to inform you that you're likely not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam.

The reason is that foster parents who receive payments from a local authority for looking after a fostered child generally cannot claim Child Benefit for that child. Since you receive a fostering allowance from the local council that covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance, this would make you ineligible.

The local authority payments you receive are designed to cover the costs of caring for Liam, which is what Child Benefit would otherwise help with.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation or any other children you might be responsible for?

2026-01-26T16:20:29.373343 [actor]: Oh, I see. I didn't realize I couldn't claim Child Benefit while receiving the fostering allowance. That makes sense though, since the council is already helping with Liam's expenses. No, I don't have any other children I'm responsible for. Thank you for explaining this to me.

2026-01-26T16:20:32.169880 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that foster parents who receive payments from a local authority for a fostered child are not eligible for Child Benefit for that child.
