2026-01-26T16:18:13.448063 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First question: Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:18:14.743416 [actor]: I need to respond as a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. Let me engage with the agent.

Yes, I'm responsible for my son Lucas. He's 10 years old.

2026-01-26T16:18:15.707248 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Does your son Lucas normally live with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:18:17.085163 [actor]: Actually, no. Lucas lives with his ex-wife Jenny. We're divorced. Lucas lives with her most of the time, but I contribute £150 per month to Jenny specifically for Lucas's food and clothes.

2026-01-26T16:18:19.434781 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that information about your situation.

Since Lucas lives with his ex-wife Jenny most of the time, she would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, as Child Benefit is usually paid to the person the child lives with.

However, I should ask: Do you and Jenny have any formal arrangement regarding who claims Child Benefit for Lucas?

2026-01-26T16:18:21.083777 [actor]: No, we don't have any formal arrangement about Child Benefit. As far as I know, Jenny isn't claiming Child Benefit for Lucas at all. That's why I was wondering if I could claim it since I do contribute financially to his upkeep with that monthly payment.

2026-01-26T16:18:24.095222 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information.

In this situation, since Lucas lives with Jenny most of the time, she would be considered the main person responsible for him under Child Benefit rules, even if she isn't currently claiming it. Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with.

Since you don't have the main day-to-day care responsibility for Lucas, you wouldn't typically be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, even though you contribute financially to his upkeep.

Would you like me to explain what options might be available in your situation, or do you have any other questions about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T16:18:26.455331 [actor]: I'm a bit confused. I thought that since I'm contributing more than the Child Benefit amount each month (I send £150 and I believe Child Benefit is about £113 per month), and Jenny isn't claiming it, I might be eligible. Is there any way I can claim it given that I'm financially contributing to his upkeep and his mother isn't claiming the benefit?

2026-01-26T16:18:31.251465 [root_agent]: I understand your confusion, and I appreciate you providing those details about your financial contribution.

To clarify, eligibility for Child Benefit isn't determined by the amount of financial support provided, but rather by who has the main day-to-day caring responsibility for the child. Since Lucas lives with Jenny most of the time, she would be considered the person with main responsibility, even if she's not currently claiming Child Benefit.

The rules state that Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for a child, which typically means the person the child lives with. Financial contributions, while important for the child's upkeep, don't override this residential criterion for Child Benefit purposes.

If Jenny isn't claiming Child Benefit, you might want to:
- Discuss with Jenny about her claiming the benefit, as your son may be missing out on support he's entitled to
- Be aware that even if you applied, the claim would likely be directed to Jenny as the person Lucas lives with

Would you like to know more about what options might be available in your specific situation?

2026-01-26T16:18:32.665284 [actor]: Yes, please tell me more about my options. Is there any way I could claim it given the circumstances? Or is it strictly based on who the child lives with regardless of financial contributions?

2026-01-26T16:18:38.194180 [root_agent]: I understand you want to explore all possible options. Let me explain your situation more clearly:

Child Benefit eligibility is indeed primarily determined by who the child lives with most of the time, regardless of financial contributions. This is because the benefit is designed to support the person who has the day-to-day responsibility of caring for the child.

Your options in this situation are:

1. **Encourage Jenny to claim**: Since Lucas lives with her, she is eligible to claim Child Benefit. This would ensure Lucas doesn't miss out on this entitlement. Child Benefit also provides National Insurance credits which can protect the claimant's State Pension.

2. **Family-based arrangement**: While you cannot claim the Child Benefit directly in your current situation, you and Jenny could come to a private arrangement where she claims the benefit and you adjust your monthly contribution accordingly, if both parties agree.

3. **Change in circumstances**: If the living arrangements were to change significantly in the future (for example, if Lucas came to live with you for an equal amount of time or more), then the eligibility situation could change.

The rules don't provide a way for you to claim Child Benefit based solely on financial contributions while Lucas lives primarily with Jenny. The residential criterion is the determining factor in these cases.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-26T16:18:40.375338 [actor]: I understand now. So even though I'm contributing financially, since Lucas lives with Jenny, she's the only one who can claim the benefit. I'll talk to Jenny about claiming it since it sounds like Lucas is missing out on support he's entitled to. Thanks for clarifying this for me.

2026-01-26T16:18:42.941031 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit eligibility is primarily determined by who the child lives with (Jenny), not by financial contributions, and correctly advised that the non-resident parent cannot claim based solely on financial support.
