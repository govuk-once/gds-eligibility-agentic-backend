2026-01-26T16:32:15.727978 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:32:17.166292 [actor]: Yes, I'm looking after a 10-year-old girl named Nina. She's the daughter of my best friend who's been quite ill, so Nina has come to live with me for the foreseeable future.

2026-01-26T16:32:18.220393 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To understand your situation better regarding Child Benefit eligibility:

Is Nina living with you full-time in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:32:19.779217 [actor]: Yes, Nina is living with me full-time here in the UK. My friend (her mother) and I arranged for her to stay with me while her mother recovers from her illness. It's been about a month now, and it looks like this arrangement will continue for quite some time.

2026-01-26T16:32:21.122514 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit:

Do you have a formal arrangement for caring for Nina, such as a legal order, or is this an informal arrangement between you and her mother?

2026-01-26T16:32:23.408160 [actor]: It's an informal arrangement between me and her mother. We've known each other for years, and when she got ill, we agreed that Nina would be better off staying with me until her mother recovers. There's no legal order in place, but we did notify the local council about the arrangement since Nina is under 16 and staying with me, who isn't a close relative. They told us this is considered "private fostering."

2026-01-26T16:32:25.594373 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Understanding that this is a private fostering arrangement is helpful.

Since Nina is living with you full-time and you're responsible for her care, you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for her. However, since her mother may already be claiming Child Benefit, this needs to be addressed.

Have you discussed with Nina's mother about transferring the Child Benefit claim to you while Nina is living with you?

2026-01-26T16:32:27.892630 [actor]: I have briefly discussed it with Nina's mother. She mentioned that she thinks I should claim it since Nina is living with me now and I'm covering all her expenses. She said she would stop her claim if I'm eligible to receive it instead. We weren't sure how the process works though, so I wanted to check my eligibility first before we take any next steps.

2026-01-26T16:32:31.157848 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. It's good that you've already discussed this with Nina's mother.

Since Nina is living with you full-time and you're responsible for her day-to-day care, you can claim Child Benefit for her. As this is a private fostering arrangement, you are eligible to claim.

The current process would be:

1. You should apply for Child Benefit using form CH2.
2. Nina's mother should contact the Child Benefit Office to stop her claim.

Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child, so it's important that Nina's mother stops her claim when you start yours to avoid any overpayments that would need to be repaid.

Is there anything specific about the application process that you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-26T16:32:33.643427 [actor]: Thank you so much for confirming that I'm eligible. That's really helpful to know. I'll get the CH2 form and start the application process. I'll also make sure Nina's mother contacts the Child Benefit Office to stop her claim before mine starts.

Just to be clear - the fact that the local council knows about our arrangement but isn't paying me any fostering allowance doesn't affect my eligibility, right? I'm covering all of Nina's expenses myself.

2026-01-26T16:32:43.598820 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that in a private fostering arrangement where the child lives with them full-time, they are eligible for Child Benefit, provided the mother stops her claim.
