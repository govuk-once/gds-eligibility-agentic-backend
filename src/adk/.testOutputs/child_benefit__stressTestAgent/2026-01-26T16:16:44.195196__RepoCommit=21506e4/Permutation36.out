2026-01-26T16:31:45.379171 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:31:47.086225 [actor]: I'm not sure about this actually. My daughter Kelly is 16. She finished her GCSEs in June and has been accepted to start her A-levels at college in September. It's August now so she's not technically in school at the moment. I'm a bit worried that might affect things.

2026-01-26T16:31:51.064989 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation. This is helpful information about your daughter Kelly.

Since Kelly is 16 and has completed her GCSEs, and is planning to start A-levels at college in September, I need to understand her current education status better.

For Child Benefit purposes, the summer break between GCSEs and starting A-levels is considered a continuation of education, as long as she has been accepted onto an approved course that she will be starting in September.

May I ask, has Kelly been officially accepted onto her A-level course, and is this at a recognized college or sixth form?

2026-01-26T16:31:52.831971 [actor]: Yes, she's been officially accepted at the local college. She got her confirmation letter back in April and we've already purchased some of the books she'll need. It's definitely a recognized college - it's the main one in our area where most students go for their A-levels.

2026-01-26T16:31:54.896081 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Kelly has been officially accepted at a recognized local college for her A-level studies.

This is good news for your Child Benefit eligibility. During the summer break between GCSEs and A-levels, you remain eligible for Child Benefit as long as your child has been accepted onto an approved education course, which A-levels at a recognized college certainly are.

Now I'd like to ask about your residency status. Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:31:56.088066 [actor]: Yes, we've always lived in the UK. We're in Manchester and have been here for the last 12 years.

2026-01-26T16:31:58.094890 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK. Living in Manchester for the past 12 years satisfies the UK residency requirement for Child Benefit.

My next question is about your immigration status. Do you have the right to live or work in the UK, or do you have British citizenship?

2026-01-26T16:31:59.066349 [actor]: Yes, I'm a British citizen. Born and raised here.

2026-01-26T16:32:00.779723 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a British citizen. That satisfies the immigration status requirement for Child Benefit.

Now, I need to ask about your relationship with Kelly. Are you her parent, or do you have primary responsibility for caring for her?

2026-01-26T16:32:01.578393 [actor]: Yes, I'm Kelly's mother. She lives with me full-time.

2026-01-26T16:32:03.628213 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're Kelly's mother and she lives with you full-time. This clearly establishes that you have primary caring responsibility for her.

Now I need to ask about your income. Child Benefit has a High Income Child Benefit Charge that may apply if you or a partner living with you has an individual income over £50,000 per year. May I ask if either you or a partner (if applicable) has an annual income over £50,000?

2026-01-26T16:32:05.891007 [actor]: No, I'm a single parent and I make about £32,000 per year working at the local hospital. Nowhere near £50,000.

2026-01-26T16:32:09.694606 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since your income is approximately £32,000 per year and you don't have a partner with a higher income, you wouldn't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which only applies to individuals earning over £50,000 per year.

Based on all the information you've provided:
- You're responsible for Kelly, who is 16
- Kelly has completed her GCSEs and is officially accepted to start A-levels at a recognized college in September
- You're a UK resident and British citizen
- Kelly lives with you full-time
- Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold

I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit for Kelly. Child Benefit continues during the gap between GCSEs and further education, as long as your child has been accepted onto an approved course, which A-levels are.

Would you like information about how to claim Child Benefit if you haven't already, or is there anything else you'd like to know about your eligibility?

2026-01-26T16:32:11.738872 [actor]: That's a relief to hear! I was worried that because she's not currently in school during this summer break, I might lose the benefit. I already receive Child Benefit for her, so I don't need to make a new claim. Thank you for confirming I'm still eligible.

2026-01-26T16:32:14.086275 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit continues during the summer break between GCSEs and A-levels when a 16-year-old has been accepted onto an approved course.
