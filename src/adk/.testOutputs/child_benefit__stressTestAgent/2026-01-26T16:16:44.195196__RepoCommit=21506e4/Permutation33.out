2026-01-26T16:30:13.843292 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To determine this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:30:15.505644 [actor]: I need to understand your situation better to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll respond as a person inquiring about this benefit.

Yes, I have responsibility for my daughter Bella. She's 16 years old and lives with me.

2026-01-26T16:30:16.735144 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your daughter Bella. Since she's 16, is she currently in approved education or training? This could include A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved courses.

2026-01-26T16:30:18.201596 [actor]: Yes, Bella has started a training course to become a travel agent. She's recently been taken on by a local travel agency that's paying for her training. It's not a standard government apprenticeship, but they're fully funding her course as part of her employment with them.

2026-01-26T16:30:21.310155 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. For Child Benefit purposes, I need to understand a bit more about Bella's training situation.

Is Bella's training program considered "approved" education or training? Generally, approved training includes courses that are non-advanced education (like A-levels or equivalent qualifications) or certain approved training programs. 

Does her travel agent training program lead to a recognized qualification (such as an NVQ up to level 3), and does she spend at least 12 hours a week doing courses, practical work or supervised study?

2026-01-26T16:30:23.499738 [actor]: Her training does lead to a qualification in travel and tourism - I believe it's an NVQ level 2 or 3. She spends about 20 hours a week on the program between classroom learning and supervised practical work at the agency. The travel agency is covering all the costs of the training program as part of her employment package with them.

2026-01-26T16:30:25.951159 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared, it sounds promising for Child Benefit eligibility since:

1. Bella is 16 years old
2. She's undertaking what appears to be approved training (NVQ level 2 or 3)
3. She's spending more than 12 hours per week on the program (20 hours)

This generally meets the criteria for Child Benefit for a child over 16 in approved education or training.

May I ask, is Bella living with you full-time?

2026-01-26T16:30:27.074902 [actor]: Yes, Bella lives with me full-time. It's just me and her at home - I'm a single mother.

2026-01-26T16:30:30.184995 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since Bella lives with you full-time and you're responsible for her care, that's another important eligibility criterion for Child Benefit.

Now, I need to ask about your income situation. If you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year, the Child Benefit may be affected by what's called the "High Income Child Benefit Charge." If the income is between £50,000 and £60,000, you may need to pay back a portion of the benefit through tax. 

Could you tell me if you or any partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-26T16:30:31.553238 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near £50,000. I work part-time at a local shop, and my annual income is around £18,000. I don't have a partner, so it's just my income in the household.

2026-01-26T16:30:34.889581 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Based on everything you've told me:

1. You have responsibility for your daughter Bella who is 16 years old
2. Bella is in approved training (NVQ level 2 or 3) and spends about 20 hours per week on her program
3. Bella lives with you full-time
4. Your income is approximately £18,000 per year, well below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold
5. You don't have a partner with additional income to consider

Given these circumstances, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Since your income is below £50,000, you would receive the full amount without having to pay any of it back through tax.

Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Bella, or would you be applying for the first time?

2026-01-26T16:30:36.785812 [actor]: I've been receiving Child Benefit for her since she was born, but I wasn't sure if I could still get it now that she's 16 and starting this training program with the travel agency. I was worried that because her employer is paying for the training, it might affect whether I can still claim the benefit.

2026-01-26T16:30:41.919691 [root_agent]: I understand your concern. The good news is that you can continue to receive Child Benefit for Bella even though she's 16, as long as she remains in approved education or training, which her NVQ program appears to be.

The fact that her employer is paying for the training doesn't affect your Child Benefit eligibility. What matters is that Bella is under 20, living with you, and participating in qualifying education or training (which includes NVQs up to level 3).

You should continue to receive Child Benefit automatically until Bella turns 20 or leaves her approved education or training. However, when a child turns 16, the Child Benefit Office may contact you to confirm they're still in eligible education or training.

If you haven't already been contacted, it might be a good idea to inform the Child Benefit Office about Bella's current education/training situation to ensure your payments continue without interruption. You can do this by calling the Child Benefit Helpline or updating your details online through your Government Gateway account.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement?

2026-01-26T16:30:44.349582 [actor]: Thank you for clarifying that. I'm relieved to know I can continue receiving Child Benefit while Bella completes her training. I was worried because someone told me that employer-funded training might not count, but I'm glad to hear that's not the case. I'll make sure to let the Child Benefit Office know about her current situation just to be safe. I think that answers all my questions for now.

2026-01-26T16:30:47.160806 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit since their 16-year-old daughter is in approved training (NVQ level 2 or 3), lives with them full-time, and the parent's income is well below the threshold.
