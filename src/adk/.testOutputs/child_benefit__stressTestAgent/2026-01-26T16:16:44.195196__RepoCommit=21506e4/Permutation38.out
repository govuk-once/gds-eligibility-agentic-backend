2026-01-26T16:32:44.897211 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you several questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T16:32:47.923018 [actor]: Hello there! I'm Tom, and my wife Jerry and I just had a baby about 4 months ago. We're wondering about the Child Benefit - we completely forgot to apply with all the chaos of becoming new parents. We only just remembered about it today. Can you tell me if we're eligible and if we've lost out on the money for those first 4 months?

2026-01-26T16:32:49.712226 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context, Tom. Congratulations to you and Jerry on your new baby!

To determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, I'll need to ask you some questions. 

Are you and your wife responsible for raising this child who lives with you? By responsible, I mean providing a home for them and arranging for their care.

2026-01-26T16:32:51.376467 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Our baby lives with us at home and we're the ones taking care of them day and night. It's been quite the adventure these past four months! We're definitely responsible for raising our child.

2026-01-26T16:32:52.584369 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's an important eligibility factor. 

Is either you or your wife a UK national or do you have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:32:53.681009 [actor]: Yes, both my wife and I are UK nationals. We've lived here our whole lives.

2026-01-26T16:32:55.111303 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Is your baby under 16 years old? (I know this is obvious given what you've shared, but I need to confirm for eligibility purposes.)

2026-01-26T16:32:55.853586 [actor]: Yes, our baby is only 4 months old, so definitely under 16!

2026-01-26T16:32:57.406727 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now, regarding your household income - does either you or your wife individually earn more than £50,000 per year?

2026-01-26T16:32:58.606902 [actor]: No, neither of us earns more than £50,000 per year. We both work but our salaries are below that threshold.

2026-01-26T16:33:02.802432 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, it appears that you and Jerry are eligible for Child Benefit as:

1. You're responsible for raising a child who lives with you
2. You're both UK nationals
3. Your child is under 16 years old
4. Neither of you earns over £50,000 per year

Regarding your question about the first 4 months: Child Benefit can be backdated for up to 3 months from the date of your application. This means you may not be able to claim for the very first month, but you could potentially receive it for 3 out of the 4 months that have passed since your baby was born.

I would recommend applying as soon as possible to minimize any further loss. You can apply online or by post using the Child Benefit claim form CH2.

Would you like me to provide more information about how to apply?

2026-01-26T16:33:04.857931 [actor]: That's great news that we're eligible! It's a bit disappointing that we can't get the full 4 months backdated, but at least we can recover 3 months of it. Yes, I would appreciate information on how to apply. Should we apply online or is the paper form better for our situation?

2026-01-26T16:33:07.101778 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately advised that the family is eligible for Child Benefit and correctly stated that payments can only be backdated for up to 3 months, not the full 4 months since the child's birth.
