2026-01-26T16:36:28.941149 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To do this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T16:36:29.823349 [actor]: I do have a child that I'm responsible for.

2026-01-26T16:36:31.017495 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you have a child you're responsible for.

Is your child under 16 years old, or under 20 and in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:36:31.826674 [actor]: Yes, my child is 5 years old.

2026-01-26T16:36:32.975386 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your child is 5 years old, they meet the age requirement.

Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:36:34.116393 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-26T16:36:35.240490 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for this child?

2026-01-26T16:36:36.037168 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for my child.

2026-01-26T16:36:37.302198 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information.

Are you subject to immigration control or do you have any restrictions on your leave to remain in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:36:38.307190 [actor]: I have Pre-Settled Status in the UK.

2026-01-26T16:36:39.409326 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that you have Pre-Settled Status.

Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T16:36:40.594558 [actor]: No, I'm currently unemployed. I've been looking for work for about 95 days now.

2026-01-26T16:36:44.556621 [root_agent]: I understand you're currently unemployed and looking for work. Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on what you've told me:

1. You have a child who is 5 years old
2. You live in the UK
3. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for your child
4. You have Pre-Settled Status in the UK
5. Your income is below the high income threshold

From this information, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. 

With Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you generally have the right to claim benefits such as Child Benefit, provided you meet the other eligibility criteria, which you do.

You can apply for Child Benefit online or by post using form CH2, which you can get from the GOV.UK website or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

Would you like to know more about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T16:36:47.161126 [actor]: Thank you for this information. Actually, I should mention that I've been claiming Child Benefit as a "jobseeker" with my Pre-Settled Status. Since I've been unemployed and looking for work for about 95 days now, and I don't have any job offers lined up yet, will this affect my eligibility to continue receiving Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T16:36:51.759480 [root_agent]: That's an important question regarding your continued eligibility with Pre-Settled Status.

Under the EU Settlement Scheme with Pre-Settled Status, there is a rule that allows you to maintain your right to claim benefits as a jobseeker, but this typically has a time limit. Generally, you can retain your "right to reside" as a jobseeker for up to 6 months (approximately 182 days).

Since you've been looking for work for about 95 days, you're currently still within this period, so you should remain eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit at this time.

However, if your job search extends beyond 6 months, your eligibility might be affected. The authorities may review whether you have genuine chances of finding employment, and might request evidence of your job search activities.

I would recommend that you:
1. Keep detailed records of your job search activities
2. Register with job search agencies if you haven't already
3. Consider contacting the Child Benefit Office directly to discuss your specific situation if your period of unemployment approaches the 6-month mark

Are you receiving any other benefits or support while you're looking for work?

2026-01-26T16:36:54.955283 [actor]: I appreciate your advice, but I think there's a specific rule about jobseekers with Pre-Settled Status that I read about. I thought there was a 91-day limit specifically for claiming benefits as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status, not 6 months. Since I've been unemployed for 95 days now, I'm concerned my eligibility might have already expired. Do you know if there's a specific 91-day rule that would affect my Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T16:37:01.188303 [root_agent]: I need to clarify this important point about Pre-Settled Status and jobseeker rights.

You're absolutely right to raise this concern. There is indeed a specific provision regarding jobseekers with Pre-Settled Status, and there is a significant change that occurs at the 91-day mark.

Under the current rules for EU citizens with Pre-Settled Status, you can retain your right to reside as a jobseeker for an initial period of 91 days. After this initial 91-day period, you need to provide "compelling evidence" that you have a genuine chance of being engaged in work to continue maintaining your status as a jobseeker.

Since you've been unemployed for 95 days, you have passed this initial period. This means that for your continued eligibility for benefits including Child Benefit, you would need to demonstrate to the relevant authorities that you have a genuine prospect of finding work.

This could include evidence of:
- Job applications you've submitted
- Interviews you've attended
- Any job training or skills development you're undertaking
- Any offers or prospects you may have

I apologize for my earlier confusion on this timeline. Thank you for bringing this important distinction to my attention. Given that you're beyond the 91-day period, I would strongly recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office to discuss your specific situation and what evidence you might need to provide to maintain your eligibility.

2026-01-26T16:37:03.798142 [actor]: Thank you for clarifying. Since I've been unemployed for 95 days and don't have any imminent job offers, I'm concerned about my Child Benefit. I have been applying for jobs regularly but haven't secured anything yet. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office to discuss my situation and what evidence I need to provide. Is there anything specific I should mention when I call them?

2026-01-26T16:37:06.561380 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that with Pre-Settled Status, after the initial 91-day jobseeker period, the user needs to provide compelling evidence of job seeking to maintain Child Benefit eligibility.
