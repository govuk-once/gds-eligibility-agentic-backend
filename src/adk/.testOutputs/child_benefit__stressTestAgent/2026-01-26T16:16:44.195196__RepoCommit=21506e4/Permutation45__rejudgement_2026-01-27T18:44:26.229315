According to gov.uk guidelines, when a child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks and the parent is not regularly spending money on the child's upkeep, they become ineligible for Child Benefit. The scenario specifically states Maria doesn't buy food, clothes or gifts as the hospital provides everything, making her ineligible after 14 weeks.
