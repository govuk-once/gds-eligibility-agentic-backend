2026-01-26T16:17:13.467445 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T16:17:14.744296 [actor]: I'll assume the role of Amit, a single father, and interact with the agent about Child Benefit eligibility.

Yes, my daughter Priya lives with me. She's 17 years old.

2026-01-26T16:17:16.164024 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Amit. I understand that your 17-year-old daughter Priya lives with you.

Is Priya in approved education or training? This would include things like school, college, or certain training programs.

2026-01-26T16:17:17.216993 [actor]: Yes, Priya is studying full-time for her A-levels at a local sixth-form college.

2026-01-26T16:17:18.542976 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Amit. Priya being in full-time A-level studies at sixth-form college is considered approved education.

Are you responsible for Priya? By this I mean, are you the person who primarily looks after her?

2026-01-26T16:17:21.398453 [actor]: Yes, I'm her single father and I'm solely responsible for looking after her.

2026-01-26T16:17:22.379929 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Amit. 

Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:17:23.263272 [actor]: Yes, we live in London.

2026-01-26T16:17:24.528904 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in London.

Are you a UK national or do you have the right to reside in the UK? This relates to your immigration status.

2026-01-26T16:17:25.477992 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK resident with the right to reside here.

2026-01-26T16:17:27.005585 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your residence status, Amit.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) earn over £60,000 per year? This is relevant for the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-26T16:17:27.981880 [actor]: I'm a single father and I earn £40,000 per year.

2026-01-26T16:17:31.723000 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Amit.

Based on what you've told me, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. Your daughter Priya is under 20 years old (she's 17)
2. She's in approved education (studying A-levels at sixth-form college)
3. You are responsible for her as her single father
4. You live in the UK (London) and have the right to reside
5. Your income (£40,000) is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold of £60,000

You should be able to claim the full Child Benefit amount without having to pay any of it back through tax.

If you haven't already applied, you can claim Child Benefit by filling out the CH2 form, which you can get from the GOV.UK website or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T16:17:33.534992 [actor]: Thank you for confirming my eligibility for Child Benefit. This is really helpful information. I'll look into getting the CH2 form from the GOV.UK website to apply. I appreciate your help in clarifying this for me.

2026-01-26T16:17:36.140835 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly assessed that Amit is eligible for Child Benefit as he has a 17-year-old daughter in full-time education, he's responsible for her care, lives in the UK with right to reside, and his income is below the threshold.
