2026-01-26T16:35:25.780090 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T16:35:27.469741 [actor]: I'm a single mother with one son, Leo. He's 12 years old, but he's currently in local authority care. He comes home to visit me every Saturday at 10:00 AM and returns to the care home on Sunday at 11:00 AM.

2026-01-26T16:35:31.207666 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that your son Leo is 12 years old and currently in local authority care, with weekend visits to you.

Since Leo is in local authority care, this affects your Child Benefit eligibility. Based on UK government guidelines, when a child goes into care, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks.

However, if your child regularly comes home to visit you, as Leo does every weekend, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit for those weeks when he spends at least one night with you.

May I ask, how long has Leo been in local authority care?

2026-01-26T16:35:36.820414 [actor]: Leo has been in local authority care for about 9 months now. The arrangement with the weekend visits has been consistent throughout that time - he comes to me every Saturday morning and goes back on Sunday.

2026-01-26T16:35:43.520039 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Leo has been in local authority care for about 9 months, which is longer than 8 weeks, the standard Child Benefit would normally stop.

However, given that Leo regularly comes home to you every weekend (staying overnight from Saturday to Sunday), you may be eligible for weekly Child Benefit payments for those weeks when he stays with you.

According to UK government guidelines, if your child regularly comes to stay with you, you can claim Child Benefit for the weeks they stay at least one night with you.

To claim Child Benefit in this situation, you would need to:
1. Fill in a Child Benefit claim form if you haven't claimed before
2. Contact the Child Benefit Office to explain Leo's living arrangements
3. They may ask for confirmation from the local authority about these arrangements

Would you like me to ask any more specific questions about your situation to provide more tailored guidance?

2026-01-26T16:35:46.081406 [actor]: I'm a bit confused. So am I eligible for Child Benefit for every week since Leo visits me every weekend? Or do I only get it for the actual days he's with me? He's with me from Saturday morning at 10:00 AM until Sunday at 11:00 AM every week - that's about 25 hours each week. Does that make a difference?

2026-01-26T16:35:50.406379 [root_agent]: I understand your confusion. Let me clarify how Child Benefit works in your situation.

Since Leo stays with you overnight (from Saturday to Sunday) every week, you would be eligible for Child Benefit for each week where this overnight stay occurs. The key factor is the overnight stay, not the total number of hours.

So, you would potentially be eligible for Child Benefit for every week that Leo stays with you overnight, which sounds like it would be every week based on your consistent weekend arrangement.

It's not calculated based on the specific days or hours he's with you, but rather on a weekly basis where there is at least one overnight stay during that week.

To confirm this arrangement, the Child Benefit Office would likely ask for details about Leo's care arrangement and may seek verification from the local authority about the regular overnight visits.

Does that help clarify your eligibility?

2026-01-26T16:35:52.638166 [actor]: Yes, that makes sense now. So I would be eligible for Child Benefit for every week since Leo stays with me overnight each weekend. That's really helpful to know. I'll make sure to explain our arrangement when I contact the Child Benefit Office. Thank you for clarifying this for me.

2026-01-26T16:35:55.204883 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for every week that their child Leo stays with them overnight, which aligns with the government guidance for children in care who regularly stay with parents.
