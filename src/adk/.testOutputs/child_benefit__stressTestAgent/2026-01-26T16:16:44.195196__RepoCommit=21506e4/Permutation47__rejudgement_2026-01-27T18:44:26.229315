2026-01-27T18:45:15.123629 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment. The agent correctly explained that James is not eligible for Child Benefit since his child lives full-time with the mother who already claims the benefit, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible." Wait - there's an inconsistency. The expected outcome states "Eligible" but the agent determined James is NOT eligible, which is correct. Since the agent's determination contradicts the expected outcome, I must assess as failed.
