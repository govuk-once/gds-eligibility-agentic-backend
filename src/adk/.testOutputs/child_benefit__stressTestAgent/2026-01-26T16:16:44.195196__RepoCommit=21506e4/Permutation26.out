2026-01-26T16:27:16.718949 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:27:17.739971 [actor]: Hi there! Yes, I do have responsibility for my son, Zahid. He's 15 years old.

2026-01-26T16:27:18.838402 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that you have responsibility for your 15-year-old son, Zahid.

Is Zahid living with you?

2026-01-26T16:27:19.958623 [actor]: Actually, Zahid doesn't live with me. He lives with his aunt, but I still support him financially.

2026-01-26T16:27:21.478660 [root_agent]: I understand. Thank you for that clarification.

Since Zahid lives with his aunt but you support him financially, I need to understand this arrangement better. 

Does your son's aunt receive any benefits for looking after Zahid?

2026-01-26T16:27:22.384440 [actor]: No, my son's aunt doesn't claim any benefits for looking after Zahid.

2026-01-26T16:27:23.344868 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Do you and Zahid's aunt have an agreement about who should claim Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-26T16:27:25.079964 [actor]: There's no formal agreement really. His aunt takes care of him day-to-day, but she doesn't claim any benefits. I still consider myself responsible for supporting him financially, which is why I'm asking about the Child Benefit.

2026-01-26T16:27:27.612917 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation.

Child Benefit can usually be claimed by the person who has main responsibility for the child. Since Zahid lives with his aunt but you provide financial support, this creates a situation where either of you could potentially claim, but only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child.

To help determine your eligibility, can you tell me if you regularly pay towards Zahid's upkeep at an equal or higher amount than the weekly Child Benefit rate?

2026-01-26T16:27:29.267232 [actor]: I send £15 per week to Zahid's aunt to help with his upkeep. Also, my mother (Zahid's grandmother) sends another £15 per week to help support him. So together, the family is sending £30 per week for his care.

2026-01-26T16:27:33.333654 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about the financial support you provide.

Currently, the Child Benefit weekly rate for an eldest or only child is £25.60, and for additional children, it's £16.95 per child (as of April 2024).

Based on what you've shared, you personally contribute £15 per week, which is less than the Child Benefit rate. While your mother also contributes £15, making the total family contribution £30, Child Benefit eligibility is assessed on an individual basis rather than combined family contributions.

In situations where a child lives with someone else, to qualify for Child Benefit, you would typically need to contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate toward the child's upkeep.

Is there any other type of support you provide for Zahid beyond the £15 weekly payment?

2026-01-26T16:27:35.498279 [actor]: No, that's the main financial support I provide - the £15 weekly payment. I thought that since the total amount being sent for Zahid's care between me and my mother adds up to £30, which is more than the Child Benefit rate, that might make me eligible. I don't provide other regular financial support beyond that weekly payment.

2026-01-26T16:27:39.414200 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you wouldn't be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid in this situation. For Child Benefit eligibility when a child lives with someone else, you personally would need to contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate (£25.60 per week for an eldest/only child) toward your child's upkeep.

The £15 per week you contribute individually falls below this threshold. Unfortunately, your mother's additional contribution cannot be combined with yours for eligibility purposes, as Child Benefit can only be claimed by one person who has responsibility for a child.

In your situation, Zahid's aunt would likely be considered the person with main responsibility for him since he lives with her, and she could potentially claim Child Benefit if she chose to do so, even though she currently doesn't.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or any other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T16:27:41.945468 [actor]: I see, thank you for explaining that. I didn't realize that my mother's contribution couldn't be combined with mine for eligibility purposes. That's disappointing to hear, but I appreciate you clarifying the rules for me. I'll let Zahid's aunt know she might be eligible to claim instead.

2026-01-26T16:27:44.631519 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that since the user personally contributes only £15 weekly (below the £25.60 threshold) and the grandmother's contribution cannot be combined for eligibility purposes, they would not qualify for Child Benefit.
