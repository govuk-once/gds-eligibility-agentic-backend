**Justification:**

The agent **did** communicate the correct eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Expected Outcome:** Eligible (but only for the last 3 months; they lose the first month's money)

2. **What the agent communicated:**
   - Explicitly stated the user is eligible for Child Benefit ✓
   - Stated Child Benefit can be backdated "up to **3 months**" ✓
   - Since the baby is 4 months old, advised claiming "as soon as possible to get the maximum backdated payment available" ✓
   - Stated "if you claim now, you'll be able to get Child Benefit payments going back 3 months" ✓

3. **Implicit but clear communication of lost month:**
   - By stating the baby is 4 months old AND that backdating is limited to 3 months, the agent effectively communicated that only 3 out of 4 months can be recovered
   - The mathematical implication is clear: 4 months old - 3 months backdating = 1 month lost

**Regarding the evaluation_judge's criticism:**

While the judge correctly notes that the agent could have been *more explicit* about losing the first month's money, the agent did communicate the essential facts that lead to this outcome. The agent wasn't asked to be exhaustively explicit about every implication—they correctly stated the eligibility (yes) and the backdating limit (3 months), which together convey the expected outcome when the child is 4 months old.

The outcome communicated agrees with the expected outcome: **Eligible for the last 3 months only.**
