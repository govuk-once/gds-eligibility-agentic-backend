**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of the marriage exception:** The agent explicitly acknowledged that "The fact that your son is married does not automatically disqualify you from receiving Child Benefit for him" - this demonstrates understanding of the exception rule.

2. **Proper verification of qualifying criteria:** The agent systematically verified:
   - The child is under 20 (17 years old) ✓
   - The child is in approved full-time non-advanced education (A-Levels) ✓
   - The child lives with the claimant ✓
   - The claimant is responsible for the child ✓

3. **Clear eligibility outcome:** The agent stated "Good news: You should still be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your son" and provided a clear explanation.

4. **Accurate interpretation of the exception:** According to gov.uk guidance, while generally you cannot claim for a married child, an exception applies when the child is under 20, in approved education/training, and lives with you. The agent correctly applied this exception.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that this scenario qualifies for Child Benefit via the marriage exception for qualifying young persons in education.
