2026-01-28T17:15:53.849300 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T17:15:55.652813 [actor]: son 14 weekends home care placed

2026-01-28T17:15:58.134471 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a son who is 14 years old, and it sounds like he lives in care but comes home on weekends. Let me ask a clarifying question:

Is your son in local authority care (for example, in a children's home or with foster carers), or is he in some other type of care arrangement?

2026-01-28T17:15:59.554687 [actor]: local authority yes 3 months now

2026-01-28T17:16:01.644404 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Your son is 14 and has been in local authority care for 3 months, but comes home on weekends.

Let me ask: Before your son went into local authority care 3 months ago, were you receiving Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-28T17:16:03.051954 [actor]: yes was getting it before

2026-01-28T17:16:05.571550 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you were receiving Child Benefit before your son went into local authority care 3 months ago.

Now, an important question: Does the local authority pay you any money towards your son's care or maintenance while he is in their care during the week?

2026-01-28T17:16:07.138864 [actor]: no they dont pay me nothing

2026-01-28T17:16:09.104205 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask one more important question:

When your son comes home at weekends, is this a regular arrangement - meaning does he come home every weekend or most weekends as part of an ongoing plan?

2026-01-28T17:16:10.479894 [actor]: every weekend friday to sunday

2026-01-28T17:16:14.872537 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, **you should still be eligible for Child Benefit** for your son.

Here's why:

- Your son is 14, which is under 16
- He's in local authority care during the week, but comes home every weekend (Friday to Sunday)
- The local authority doesn't pay you towards his maintenance
- This is a regular arrangement

According to the rules, when a child is in local authority care but comes home regularly (such as every weekend), and the local authority doesn't pay you towards the child's maintenance, you can continue to claim Child Benefit.

However, it's important to note that if you were already receiving Child Benefit before he went into care and the situation has changed, you should inform the Child Benefit Office about his care arrangement. They need to know about changes in circumstances.

Would you like guidance on how to contact the Child Benefit Office to confirm your continued eligibility and update them about your son's current living arrangements?

2026-01-28T17:16:16.525142 [actor]: ok thanks got answer needed

2026-01-28T17:16:20.144638 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the exception rule that allows parents to continue claiming Child Benefit when their child is in local authority care but comes home regularly (every weekend), and the local authority doesn't pay maintenance to the parent.
