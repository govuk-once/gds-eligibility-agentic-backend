**Justification:**

The agent correctly identified and applied the hospital stay exception rule. Specifically:

1. **Recognized the 12-week threshold**: The agent identified that the child had been in hospital for 14 weeks, exceeding the normal 12-week limit after which Child Benefit would typically stop.

2. **Applied the exception correctly**: The agent properly assessed that the parent (Mary) continues to spend £30 per week on the child's upkeep (books, pyjamas, and food), which exceeds the minimum Child Benefit amount of £25.60 per week.

3. **Reached the correct conclusion**: The agent concluded that Mary "should be eligible for Child Benefit" and explicitly explained that "you can continue to claim Child Benefit as long as you keep contributing towards her upkeep while she remains in hospital."

4. **Proper reasoning**: The agent's explanation clearly articulated why the exception applies: "When a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks, you can normally only continue to get Child Benefit if you're still contributing at least the weekly Child Benefit amount towards their upkeep."

This matches the expected outcome of eligibility via the hospital stay exception as outlined in the scenario and confirmed by the evaluation judge.
