2026-01-28T17:17:43.073281 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:17:44.797892 [actor]: fostering child 12 years old councl pays allowance

2026-01-28T17:17:47.301011 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you're fostering a 12-year-old child and the council pays you a fostering allowance.

Let me ask you this important question:

**Are you fostering this child under a formal arrangement with the local council (local authority foster care), or is this an informal private fostering arrangement?**

2026-01-28T17:17:48.799087 [actor]: local authority placement liam lives with me

2026-01-28T17:17:50.940399 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Liam is placed with you through a local authority foster care placement and lives with you.

This is important information. Let me ask you the next question:

**Does Liam's parent or anyone else currently claim Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T17:17:53.023309 [actor]: no one else claiming just me want to know if can claim

2026-01-28T17:17:55.315650 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Liam.

I need to ask one more important question to assess your eligibility:

**Is Liam placed with you as a local authority foster carer, or have you formally adopted him or been granted a special guardianship order for him?**

(This distinction is important because the rules differ depending on the type of care arrangement.)

2026-01-28T17:17:57.043482 [actor]: foster carer council pays for accomodation and maintennance

2026-01-28T17:18:01.138490 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So you are a foster carer and the council pays you fostering allowances for Liam's accommodation and maintenance.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to inform you about your eligibility:

**You are not eligible to claim Child Benefit for Liam.**

The reason is that when a child is placed with you as a local authority foster carer and you receive fostering allowances from the council, you cannot claim Child Benefit for that child. This is because the local authority is considered to be contributing to the child's upbringing through the fostering payments they make to you.

Child Benefit is designed for parents or people responsible for a child where they are meeting the costs of raising that child themselves, which isn't the case when fostering allowances are being paid by the local authority.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this decision?

2026-01-28T17:18:04.469723 [actor]: ok understand not eligble thank you

2026-01-28T17:18:06.612218 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that foster carers receiving local authority fostering allowances are not eligible for Child Benefit, as the local authority is already contributing to the child's upbringing through those payments, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
