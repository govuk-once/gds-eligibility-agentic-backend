**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** under the exception to the care rules, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Child's age verified:** The agent confirmed the son is 14 (under 16), meeting the age criterion.

2. **Care situation established:** The agent identified that the child has been in local authority care for 3 months (exceeding the 8-week threshold that would normally end entitlement).

3. **Exception properly applied:** The agent correctly identified that the exception applies because:
   - The child comes home every weekend (Friday to Sunday) - this represents 2 consecutive nights at home
   - This is a regular, ongoing arrangement
   - The local authority does not pay the parent for maintenance

4. **Correct conclusion:** The agent clearly stated "you should still be eligible for Child Benefit" and explained the reasoning based on the exception rule.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that David qualifies for Child Benefit via the exception for children in care who spend at least 2 nights in a row at home regularly. The evaluation judge also confirmed this was correct with a ✓.
