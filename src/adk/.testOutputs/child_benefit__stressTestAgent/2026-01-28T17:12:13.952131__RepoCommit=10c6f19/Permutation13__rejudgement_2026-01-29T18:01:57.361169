**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit**, which agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

The agent's assessment was thorough and accurate:

1. **Responsibility criterion**: The agent confirmed the child lives with the user and they provide day-to-day care
2. **Adoption status criterion**: The agent correctly applied the rule that Child Benefit can be claimed when a child placed for adoption comes to live with the applicant, without waiting for the final adoption order
3. **UK residency**: Confirmed
4. **No duplicate claims**: Verified no one else is claiming

The agent explicitly stated: "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and correctly noted that "you can claim Child Benefit even though the adoption hasn't been finalized yet, as long as the child has been placed with you."

This aligns with the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility which states you can claim as soon as a child you're adopting comes to live with you, without waiting for the final order.
