**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** to continue receiving Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons:**

1. **12-week limit identified**: The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit can continue for up to 12 weeks when a child is in NHS hospital care.

2. **Expenditure exception not met**: When the user asked "but i visit every day spending hours with her doesnt that count," the agent correctly clarified that visiting alone does not satisfy the continuation requirements. The agent stated: "you visiting your daughter in hospital doesn't count for Child Benefit purposes."

3. **No regular spending confirmed**: The scenario specifies the user does not buy food, clothes, or gifts (hospital provides everything). While the user mentions "visiting," there's no indication of financial expenditure on the child's upkeep, which would be required for the expenditure exception after 12 weeks.

4. **Clear outcome communicated**: The agent explicitly stated "you will not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit" and the user confirmed understanding with "ok so not eligble got it."

5. **Correct application of rules**: The agent properly applied the rule that after 12 weeks of continuous hospital stay without the child coming home regularly, Child Benefit stops.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
