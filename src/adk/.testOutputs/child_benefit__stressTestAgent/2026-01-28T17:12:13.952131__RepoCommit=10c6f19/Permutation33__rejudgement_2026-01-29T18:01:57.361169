**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of the critical issue:** The agent properly identified that Bella (16) is participating in employer-funded training as part of her employment with a travel agency, rather than being enrolled in approved education or training.

2. **Accurate application of eligibility criteria:** The agent correctly explained that "work-based training paid for by an employer typically does not count as 'approved education or training' for Child Benefit purposes." This directly addresses Criteria 2 (Funding Source) from the scenario, which states that education counts as "approved" only if it is **not paid for by an employer**.

3. **Thorough fact-gathering:** The agent systematically gathered all relevant information:
   - Bella's age (16)
   - Nature of the course (employer-paid training)
   - Working hours (less than 24 hours/week)
   - Living arrangements (lives with mother)
   - Responsibility (mother is responsible)
   - UK residency
   - No duplicate claims
   - Income level

4. **Clear communication of outcome:** The agent explicitly stated the user would "likely **not be eligible**" and provided a clear rationale.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome: **Not Eligible**.
