2026-01-29T18:05:38.026798 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome.

**Justification:**

The expected outcome is that George and Helen are **Eligible** for Child Benefit. The agent correctly concluded that the user "appear[s] to be eligible for Child Benefit" for both children.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Responsibility criterion met:** The agent correctly verified that the children (aged 6 and 8) live with the adoptive parents full-time and are under 16.

2. **Adoption Allowance correctly handled:** Most importantly, the agent accurately stated that "The adoption allowance you receive from the local authority does not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit - these are separate benefits." This is the critical distinction in this scenario - unlike fostering allowances (which can disqualify applicants), adoption allowances do not prevent Child Benefit eligibility.

3. **All other criteria verified:** The agent properly checked immigration status, income levels, whether anyone else is claiming, and whether children are in care.

4. **Accurate conclusion:** The agent's final determination that the user is eligible, with clear reasoning, matches the expected outcome that adoption allowance recipients can receive Child Benefit alongside their allowance.

The agent demonstrated correct understanding of the rules distinguishing adoption allowances from fostering allowances and communicated an eligibility decision that aligns with the expected outcome.
