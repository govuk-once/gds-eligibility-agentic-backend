**Justification:**

The agent **failed to communicate any eligibility outcome** to the user, despite being repeatedly prompted. Looking at the transcript:

1. The user provided all necessary information early on:
   - 14-year-old son in hospital in USA for 15 weeks
   - UK residents
   - User pays for the child's costs
   - Child went abroad specifically for hospital treatment

2. According to the GOV.UK guidance on children in hospital or care, when a child goes abroad **specifically for hospital treatment**, Child Benefit can continue if the parent is still spending money on the child.

3. **The expected outcome is: Eligible** - Hannah should remain eligible because:
   - Oliver went abroad specifically for hospital treatment
   - Hannah continues to pay for his incidental costs
   - The special rule for children hospitalized abroad applies

4. **The agent never communicated this outcome.** Instead, the agent got stuck in a loop asking about NHS involvement and arrangements, which is not the determining factor according to the eligibility rules. The agent asked 9 questions but never provided an eligibility determination.

5. When the user explicitly asked "need to know still eligble," the agent still failed to provide an answer.

The agent did not communicate that the user was eligible, therefore the agent's communicated outcome does NOT agree with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
