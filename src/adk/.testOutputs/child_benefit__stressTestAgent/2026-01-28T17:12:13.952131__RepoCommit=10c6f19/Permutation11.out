2026-01-28T17:18:08.636102 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:18:10.190247 [actor]: ryans 17 aprentice lives with me

2026-01-28T17:18:12.660904 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Ryan is 17, an apprentice, and lives with you.

**Is Ryan's apprenticeship an approved education or training program?** 

(Approved training includes things like A levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, and certain apprenticeships registered with the government)

2026-01-28T17:18:14.039087 [actor]: aprentice goverment funded england

2026-01-28T17:18:16.205347 [root_agent]: That's helpful - a government-funded apprenticeship in England would typically be considered approved training.

**Are you responsible for Ryan? By this I mean, do you have parental responsibility for him, or is he living with you and you're supporting him financially?**

2026-01-28T17:18:17.745860 [actor]: yes hes my son i look after him

2026-01-28T17:18:20.521535 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. So Ryan is your 17-year-old son, he's on a government-funded apprenticeship in England, and he lives with you.

**Do you normally live in the UK?** (This means the UK is your main home and you're not subject to immigration control that prevents you from claiming public funds)

2026-01-28T17:18:21.829369 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T17:18:25.951312 [root_agent]: Excellent. Based on the information you've provided:

- Ryan is your 17-year-old son
- He's on a government-funded apprenticeship (which is approved training)
- He lives with you
- You're responsible for him
- You live in the UK

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Ryan, as he's under 20 and in approved education or training.

Just one final question to complete the assessment: **Do you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year?** 

(You can still claim Child Benefit if either of you earns over this amount, but you may need to pay some or all of it back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge when you do your tax return)

2026-01-28T17:18:27.361636 [actor]: dont understand high income charge what does that mean

2026-01-28T17:18:32.265278 [root_agent]: Good question - let me explain the High Income Child Benefit Charge:

**If you or your partner earns over £50,000 a year individually, you'll need to pay back some or all of your Child Benefit through your tax return.** Here's how it works:

- If one of you earns between £50,000 and £60,000, you pay back a percentage of the Child Benefit (1% for every £100 over £50,000)
- If one of you earns £60,000 or more, you pay back all of the Child Benefit

**However, you can still claim Child Benefit even if this applies to you.** You have two choices:

1. **Claim the Child Benefit payments** and then pay back what's owed through your tax return, OR
2. **Claim Child Benefit but choose not to receive the payments** - this way you don't have to pay anything back, but you still get National Insurance credits (which protect your State Pension)

Many people choose option 2 if they earn over £60,000, as they'd have to pay it all back anyway.

**So, does either you or your partner earn over £50,000 a year?**

2026-01-28T17:18:33.767821 [actor]: no under 50000

2026-01-28T17:18:37.172672 [root_agent]: Perfect! Based on all the information you've provided:

✓ Ryan is your 17-year-old son
✓ He's on a government-funded apprenticeship (approved training)
✓ He lives with you
✓ You're responsible for him
✓ You live in the UK
✓ Neither you nor your partner earns over £50,000

**You are eligible for Child Benefit for Ryan!**

You can claim Child Benefit and receive the full payment without needing to pay any of it back. Since Ryan is under 20 and in approved training, you can continue claiming until he turns 20 or stops his apprenticeship, whichever comes first.

You can make your claim online or by post. Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T17:18:42.118319 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the claimant is eligible for Child Benefit since Ryan is 17, in a government-funded apprenticeship (approved training), lives with the claimant who is responsible for him, they live in the UK, and their income is under £50,000.
