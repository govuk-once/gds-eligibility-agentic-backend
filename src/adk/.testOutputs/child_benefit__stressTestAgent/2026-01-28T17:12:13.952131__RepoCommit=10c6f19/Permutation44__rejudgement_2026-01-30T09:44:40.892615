**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user "may be eligible for Child Benefit" and recommended contacting HMRC to confirm the exact entitlement. This aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Care duration**: Leo (12) is in local authority care, which typically would make the parent ineligible for Child Benefit.

2. **Time at home**: Leo comes home Saturday morning and returns Sunday morning - this represents approximately 24-25 hours at home per week.

3. **The critical rule**: According to gov.uk guidance, if a child in care spends "at least 2 nights a week" OR "at least 24 hours a week" with the parent, the parent may still claim Child Benefit.

4. **Agent's assessment**: The agent correctly identified that Leo only spends 1 night at home (Saturday night), but appropriately noted that the regular overnight weekend stays may still qualify the parent for Child Benefit. The agent prudently recommended contacting HMRC for confirmation.

5. **Expected outcome alignment**: Since Leo spends at least 24 hours per week at home (Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am = 25 hours), the expected outcome is "Eligible." The agent's communication of "may be eligible" with appropriate caveats is consistent with this determination.

The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome.
