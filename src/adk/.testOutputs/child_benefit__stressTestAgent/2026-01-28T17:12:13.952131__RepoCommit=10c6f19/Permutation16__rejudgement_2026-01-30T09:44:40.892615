**Justification:**

The agent failed to communicate ANY eligibility outcome to the user, let alone the correct one. Throughout the entire transcript, the agent only asked clarifying questions but never provided a determination about whether the user was eligible or not eligible for Child Benefit.

The expected outcome is: **Eligible** (because the child went abroad specifically for hospital treatment, and the parent continues to pay for their costs, which means Child Benefit eligibility continues under the international hospitalization exception).

However, the agent never communicated this - or any - outcome to the user. When the user explicitly stated "currently receiving need to know still eligible," the agent still did not provide an answer. The conversation simply ended without the agent ever informing the user of their eligibility status.

Since the agent did not communicate that the user was eligible (or communicate any outcome at all), the agent's communicated outcome does not agree with the expected outcome of "Eligible."
