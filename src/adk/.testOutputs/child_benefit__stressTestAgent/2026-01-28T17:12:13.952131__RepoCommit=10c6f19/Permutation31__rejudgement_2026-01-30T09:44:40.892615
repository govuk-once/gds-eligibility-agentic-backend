2026-01-30T09:44:45.563970 [confirmation_judge]: **Judgement:** 👍

**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit for their daughter Emma, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of advanced education:** The agent accurately identified that "university degree courses are considered 'advanced education' and are not counted as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes."

2. **Clear eligibility determination:** The agent explicitly stated: "you would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit for her, even though she's under 20 and living at home."

3. **Proper application of criteria:** The agent correctly distinguished between:
   - Approved education (A-levels, T-levels, NVQs) - which would qualify until age 20
   - Advanced education (university degrees) - which does not qualify

4. **Accurate reasoning:** The explanation properly reflects the government guidance that Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education such as a university degree, regardless of the child being under 20 or living at home.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome: **Not Eligible** (Child Benefit stops when a child starts "advanced" education, such as a university degree).
