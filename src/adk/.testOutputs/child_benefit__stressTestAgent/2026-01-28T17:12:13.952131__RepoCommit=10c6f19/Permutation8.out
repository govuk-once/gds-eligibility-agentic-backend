2026-01-28T17:16:22.233747 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:16:23.940894 [actor]: child benefit eligibilty 4 year old ruby earnings 75000

2026-01-28T17:16:26.168380 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. I can see you have a 4-year-old child named Ruby and earnings of £75,000.

Let me ask you the next question to assess your eligibility:

**Are you responsible for Ruby - meaning do you live with her and are you the main person looking after her day-to-day?**

2026-01-28T17:16:27.785192 [actor]: yes live with ruby she is my doughter

2026-01-28T17:16:32.591192 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Ruby is your daughter and lives with you.

Based on the information you've provided:

- You have a child under 16 (Ruby, age 4) ✓
- You live with her and are responsible for her ✓

**You are eligible to claim Child Benefit.**

However, there's an important point about your income level of £75,000:

If you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000, you'll need to pay the **High Income Child Benefit Charge** through a tax return. This charge gradually reduces the benefit:
- Between £50,000-£60,000, you pay back an increasing percentage
- At £60,000 or above, you pay back 100% of the Child Benefit received

**My next question is: Do you have a partner, and if so, what is their individual income?**

(This will help determine if the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies and who it would apply to)

2026-01-28T17:16:34.085055 [actor]: partner earns 20000 yearly

2026-01-28T17:16:38.433676 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

So to summarize your situation:
- You have Ruby (age 4) living with you ✓
- You're responsible for her ✓
- Your income: £75,000
- Your partner's income: £20,000

**You are eligible for Child Benefit.** However, since your individual income is £75,000 (which is over £60,000), you will have to pay back 100% of the Child Benefit you receive through the High Income Child Benefit Charge via Self Assessment tax return.

Even though you'd have to pay it all back, some people still choose to claim Child Benefit because:
- It protects your National Insurance record (important for State Pension)
- It protects your child's National Insurance record

**Would you like to know anything else about your Child Benefit eligibility or how the High Income Child Benefit Charge works?**

2026-01-28T17:16:40.113510 [actor]: ok so I get the benfit or not confused

2026-01-28T17:16:44.911056 [root_agent]: I understand the confusion - let me clarify:

**YES, you are eligible for Child Benefit and can claim it.**

However, because your income is £75,000 (over £60,000), here's what happens:

1. **The government will pay you the Child Benefit** (currently around £25 per week for your first child)

2. **But you'll have to pay it all back** through a tax charge called the High Income Child Benefit Charge when you complete your tax return

So in practice, you receive the money, but then pay the same amount back in tax - meaning you end up with £0 net benefit.

**You have two choices:**

1. **Claim it** - receive the payments but pay them back in tax (benefit: protects National Insurance credits for your pension)

2. **Opt out** - tell HMRC you don't want to receive the payments, so you don't have to pay them back later

Does that make sense now?

2026-01-28T17:16:46.815669 [actor]: so I can claim it then yes eligible thanks

2026-01-28T17:16:49.916870 [root_agent]: **Yes, that's correct - you are eligible to claim Child Benefit!**

You're welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify your eligibility.

Just remember that with your income level of £75,000, you'll need to complete a Self Assessment tax return to pay back the amount through the High Income Child Benefit Charge, but you are definitely eligible to claim.

If you need any help with actually making the claim or have any other questions in the future, feel free to ask.

Good luck with your Child Benefit claim for Ruby!

2026-01-28T17:16:55.594128 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for their 4-year-old daughter Ruby, and correctly explained that due to the user's income of £75,000 (exceeding £60,000), they would be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge requiring them to pay back 100% of the benefit received through Self Assessment.
