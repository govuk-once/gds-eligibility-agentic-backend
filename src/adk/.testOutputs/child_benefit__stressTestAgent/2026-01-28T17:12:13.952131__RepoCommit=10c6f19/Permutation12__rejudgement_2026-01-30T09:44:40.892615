**Justification:**

The agent communicated that Jessica **is eligible** for Child Benefit for Liam. However, the expected outcome is that she should be **Not Eligible**.

The critical missing factor is that Liam has claimed Universal Credit in his own right. According to gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, you stop getting Child Benefit if the child starts getting Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance in their own right.

The agent failed to ask whether Liam receives any benefits in his own right, which is a crucial eligibility criterion. While the agent thoroughly checked:
- Age and education status
- Responsibility for the child
- UK residency
- Whether anyone else claims for the child
- High Income Child Benefit Charge considerations

They completely missed asking about whether Liam receives benefits in his own right (particularly Universal Credit), which is the disqualifying factor in this scenario.

The agent's eligibility outcome (Eligible) does **not agree** with the expected outcome (Not Eligible).
