**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct threshold application:** The agent properly identified that when a child doesn't live with the claimant, contributions must equal at least the Child Benefit rate (£25.60/week as stated by the agent, which aligns with the scenario's £26.05/week figure).

2. **Accurate comparison:** The agent correctly noted that the user's £10/week contribution falls below this threshold, making them ineligible under the responsibility criteria.

3. **Clear communication:** The agent explicitly stated "you would not be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided a clear explanation of why this is the case.

4. **Proper guidance:** The agent also appropriately mentioned that the mother (who the child lives with) would be eligible to claim, which is accurate additional information.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that Mike is not eligible because his £10/week contribution is insufficient to meet the responsibility test when the child doesn't live with him.
