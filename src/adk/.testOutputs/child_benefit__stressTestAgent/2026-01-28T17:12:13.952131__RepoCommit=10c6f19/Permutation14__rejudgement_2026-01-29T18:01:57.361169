**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Temporary absence rule applied correctly**: The agent recognized that the 6-week temporary stay with grandmother for surgery recovery is well within the 8-week rule where Child Benefit continues to be payable.

2. **All eligibility criteria verified**: The agent systematically confirmed:
   - Child is 6 years old (under 16) ✓
   - User is the mother and responsible for the child ✓
   - Child normally lives in the UK ✓
   - User lives in the UK ✓
   - No one else is claiming Child Benefit ✓
   - No immigration restrictions ✓

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided a clear rationale, specifically noting that "the temporary 6-week stay with grandmother for surgery recovery doesn't affect your eligibility."

According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, you can claim Child Benefit if you're responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 in approved education/training) who normally lives with you. The temporary absence of 6 weeks falls within the acceptable parameters where eligibility is maintained.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
