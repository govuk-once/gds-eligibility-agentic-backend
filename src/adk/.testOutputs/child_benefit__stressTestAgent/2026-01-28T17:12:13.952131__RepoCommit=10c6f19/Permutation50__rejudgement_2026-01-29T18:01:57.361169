**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."

The agent systematically verified all relevant eligibility criteria:

1. **Age and education/training requirement**: The child is 16 and enrolled in the "No One Left Behind" programme, which the agent correctly identified as approved training for Child Benefit purposes in Scotland.

2. **Responsibility**: The child lives with the user, establishing clear responsibility.

3. **Residency**: The user lives in Edinburgh, Scotland (UK), meeting residency requirements.

4. **No duplicate claims**: No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child.

5. **Income threshold**: The user's income is under £60,000, so no High Income Child Benefit Charge applies.

The agent's conclusion that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" directly aligns with the expected outcome. The agent also correctly noted that the benefit can continue until the child turns 20 if they remain in approved education or training.

The communication was clear, thorough, and reached the correct eligibility determination.
