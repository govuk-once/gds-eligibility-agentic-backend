2026-01-28T17:16:58.109354 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T17:16:59.768433 [actor]: child benefit my son 5 years old can i get

2026-01-28T17:17:01.657586 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 5-year-old son, which meets the age requirement.

Now I need to ask:

**Does your son normally live with you?**

2026-01-28T17:17:03.296709 [actor]: yes son lives with me need money for him

2026-01-28T17:17:05.572648 [root_agent]: That's good - your son lives with you, which is an important requirement.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for your son? This means you're the one who looks after him and pays for things like food, clothes, and other costs for raising him.**

2026-01-28T17:17:07.159151 [actor]: yes i pay for everything food clothes toys school things

2026-01-28T17:17:09.107736 [root_agent]: Excellent, that shows you're responsible for your son.

Now I need to ask an important question about your living situation:

**Do you normally live in the UK? This means the UK is your main home where you usually live.**

2026-01-28T17:17:10.735465 [actor]: yes live in uk now looking for job registered jobseeker

2026-01-28T17:17:13.450628 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You're living in the UK and registered as a jobseeker, which is helpful to know.

Now I need to ask:

**What is your immigration status? Are you a UK citizen, or do you have the right to live in the UK through settled status, pre-settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another type of permission to be in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:17:15.033225 [actor]: pre settled status from germany came to uk recently

2026-01-28T17:17:18.262588 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you have pre-settled status from Germany.

This is an important detail. Let me ask:

**Are you currently working in the UK, or have you worked in the UK since you arrived? If you're not working now, are you actively looking for work (which you mentioned you are) and available to work?**

I ask because with pre-settled status, your eligibility for Child Benefit can depend on whether you have a "right to reside" in the UK, which is often established through working or being a jobseeker.

2026-01-28T17:17:19.823881 [actor]: yes registered jobseeker actively looking work available to start immediately

2026-01-28T17:17:23.001680 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. You're registered as a jobseeker and actively looking for work.

One more important question about this:

**How long have you been in the UK, and when did you register as a jobseeker? Also, have you worked in the UK at all since arriving, even for a short period?**

This is important because there can be time limits on how long you can be considered a jobseeker for the purpose of having a right to reside in the UK.

2026-01-28T17:17:24.881399 [actor]: been in uk few months registered jobseeker straight away no work yet but genuine looking

2026-01-28T17:17:26.919025 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me ask one more question to complete the picture:

**Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for your son, such as his other parent or anyone else?**

This is important because only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child at any given time.

2026-01-28T17:17:28.549238 [actor]: no one else claiming just me his mother not claiming

2026-01-28T17:17:33.864130 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me assess your situation:

**Based on what you've told me, you may face some challenges with Child Benefit eligibility due to your immigration status.**

Here's what I understand:
- ✓ Your son is 5 years old (under 16)
- ✓ He lives with you
- ✓ You're responsible for him
- ✓ You live in the UK
- ✓ No one else is claiming for him

**However**, with pre-settled status, you need to have a "right to reside" in the UK to claim Child Benefit. As a jobseeker, you generally have this right, BUT there are time limitations - typically you can only be considered a jobseeker for up to 91 days (approximately 3 months) for benefit purposes.

Since you mentioned you've been in the UK "a few months" and haven't worked yet, you may be approaching or have exceeded this limit.

**My assessment: You may not currently be eligible for Child Benefit** if you've been a jobseeker for more than 91 days without working. However, once you find and start work in the UK, you should become eligible.

I recommend you still apply or contact the Child Benefit Office directly, as they can assess your specific circumstances in detail. Would you like to know anything else?

2026-01-28T17:17:35.886744 [actor]: ok so not eligible now but when i get job then eligible understand thank you

2026-01-28T17:17:40.943530 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated the person "may not currently be eligible" based on the 91-day jobseeker limitation, but according to gov.uk guidance, EU citizens with pre-settled status who are registered jobseekers and genuinely seeking work generally have a right to reside and can claim Child Benefit during their jobseeking period, subject to the genuine jobseeker test rather than an automatic 91-day cutoff for all circumstances.
