**Justification:**

The agent properly identified and applied the hospital stay exception rule. Specifically:

1. **Recognized the extended hospital stay**: The agent identified that the child has been in hospital for 14 weeks (exceeding the 12-week threshold)

2. **Applied the exception correctly**: The agent understood that while Child Benefit normally stops after 12 weeks in hospital, an exception applies when the parent continues to contribute at least the weekly Child Benefit amount towards the child's upkeep

3. **Verified the spending requirement**: The agent confirmed the user spends £30 per week (exceeding the £25.60 threshold) on books, pyjamas, and food for the child

4. **Communicated the correct outcome**: The agent explicitly stated "Good news - you should be eligible for Child Benefit" and clearly explained why the exception applies

The agent's assessment aligns perfectly with the scenario's expected outcome that Mary retains eligibility beyond the 12-week limit due to her regular spending on Chloe's upkeep.
