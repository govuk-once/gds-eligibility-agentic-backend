**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Age criterion met**: The child (John, 17) is under 20 years old.

2. **Study hours criterion NOT met**: The agent correctly identified that for a 16-19 year old to qualify for Child Benefit, they must be in full-time approved education, defined as **more than 12 hours per week** of supervised study or course-related work experience.

3. **Accurate assessment**: The agent established that John's course involves only **6 hours per week** of supervised study, which falls short of the 12-hour threshold.

4. **Correct conclusion**: The agent clearly communicated that the user would "likely **not be eligible**" for Child Benefit and provided a clear explanation of why.

The agent's communication was accurate, thorough, and appropriately referenced the specific criteria from gov.uk guidance on approved education for Child Benefit purposes. The outcome communicated matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
