**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** while their son is in the secure unit, which aligns with the expected outcome of **"Eligible (until week 12)"**.

The agent accurately:
1. Identified that the 12-week rule applies (not the 8-week rule) since the child is detained under the Mental Health Act in a secure psychiatric unit, which is treated as hospital/residential accommodation
2. Confirmed that at 10 weeks, the user is still within the 12-week eligibility period
3. Explained that eligibility continues for up to 12 weeks without contribution requirements
4. Warned that after 12 weeks (approximately 2 more weeks), the benefit would normally stop unless contributions are made

The agent's conclusion that the user "should still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit" directly matches the expected outcome that the user is eligible until week 12.
