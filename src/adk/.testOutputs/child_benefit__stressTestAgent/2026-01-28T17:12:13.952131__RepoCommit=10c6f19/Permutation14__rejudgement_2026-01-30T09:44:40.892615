**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Temporary absence handled correctly**: The agent properly recognized that the 6-week temporary stay with grandmother during surgery recovery is within the 8-week rule and doesn't disqualify the applicant.

2. **All eligibility criteria verified**: The agent systematically confirmed:
   - Child is under 16 (aged 6) ✓
   - User is responsible for the child (pays for everything) ✓
   - Both live in the UK ✓
   - No immigration restrictions ✓
   - No one else claiming Child Benefit ✓

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided clear reasoning.

4. **Accurate application of rules**: Per gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit usually continues for 8 weeks after a child goes to live with someone else, provided no one else claims. At 6 weeks, this situation falls within that allowance.

The agent's determination aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible**, and the evaluation judge's assessment (✓) also confirms this was handled correctly.
