2026-01-28T17:12:16.125767 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T17:12:17.874508 [actor]: yes got son lives with us hes 8 primary school

2026-01-28T17:12:19.686498 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have an 8-year-old son who lives with you and attends primary school.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:12:21.175228 [actor]: manchester

2026-01-28T17:12:23.248759 [root_agent]: Great, so you live in Manchester, which is in the UK.

Next question: **Are you the person primarily responsible for your son? In other words, are you the main person looking after him on a day-to-day basis?**

2026-01-28T17:12:24.735438 [actor]: married both work son lives here

2026-01-28T17:12:27.270118 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you're married, you both work, and your son lives with you.

Let me clarify: **Between you and your spouse, who would you say is the main person responsible for your son on a day-to-day basis, or do you share the responsibility equally?**

(This is important because only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, even in a two-parent household.)

2026-01-28T17:12:28.758777 [actor]: we both look after him

2026-01-28T17:12:32.060257 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you both look after your son.

In households where both parents are involved, only one person can actually claim the Child Benefit. You'll need to decide between you and your spouse who will be the claimant.

Next question: **Do you or your spouse have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

(This is important because if either of you earns above this amount, it may affect how much Child Benefit you receive or whether you'll need to pay some of it back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.)

2026-01-28T17:12:33.509970 [actor]: teacher 35000 part time 15000

2026-01-28T17:12:36.193638 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So one of you earns £35,000 as a teacher and the other earns £15,000 working part-time. Since neither of you earns over £50,000, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Let me ask: **Is your son currently living with you full-time, or does he spend time living with anyone else (for example, another relative or in any form of care)?**

2026-01-28T17:12:37.556266 [actor]: lives with us full time

2026-01-28T17:12:39.311505 [root_agent]: Perfect. And one final question: **Do you have immigration status that allows you to claim benefits in the UK, or are you a British citizen?**

2026-01-28T17:12:40.776409 [actor]: uk nationals both of us

2026-01-28T17:12:44.822243 [root_agent]: Excellent! Based on the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's a summary of your situation:
- You have an 8-year-old son in primary school (under 16)
- He lives with you full-time in Manchester, UK
- You're both UK nationals
- You both look after him (you'll need to decide which one of you will be the claimant)
- Neither of you earns over £50,000, so you won't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge

**Next steps:**
- Decide between you and your spouse who will be the claimant
- You can apply for Child Benefit online or by post
- You'll need your son's birth certificate and your National Insurance number

The current Child Benefit rate is paid every 4 weeks, and you'll receive a set amount for your child.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T17:12:50.795263 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all relevant factors (child under 16, UK residency, parental responsibility, income below £50,000 threshold, full-time residence with parents, UK nationality) and correctly concluded eligibility for Child Benefit while properly noting that only one parent can claim and neither income exceeds the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
