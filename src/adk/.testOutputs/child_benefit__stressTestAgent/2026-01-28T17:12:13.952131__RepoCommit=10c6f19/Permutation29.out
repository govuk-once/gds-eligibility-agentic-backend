2026-01-28T17:29:20.880912 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T17:29:24.628404 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old child who is not in college and not working.

To clarify - has your child recently left education or training? If so, when did they leave?

(This is important because there can be a short extension period for Child Benefit in certain circumstances after a child leaves education or training.)

2026-01-28T17:29:29.462083 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your child left school last year after GCSEs and has not been in any approved education or training since then.

Based on this information, I'm afraid you would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit for this 17-year-old child. 

Child Benefit stops when a child turns 16, unless they continue in approved education or training, in which case it can continue until they turn 20. Since your child left school after GCSEs last year and is not in college or approved training, they no longer meet the eligibility criteria.

Do you have any other children under 16, or under 20 who are in approved education or training? If so, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit for them.

2026-01-28T17:29:34.847668 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available for a 17-year-old who left school after GCSEs last year and is neither in approved education/training nor working, as eligibility ends at 16 unless the child continues in approved education or training until age 20.
