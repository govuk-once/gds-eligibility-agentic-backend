**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** under the exception to the care rules. Here's why this aligns with the expected outcome:

1. **Correct Application of Care Rules Exception**: The agent identified that while the child (Jack, 14) has been in local authority care for 3 months (exceeding the standard 8-week limit), an important exception applies.

2. **Key Facts Established**:
   - Child comes home every weekend (Friday to Sunday) - this satisfies the "2 nights in a row" requirement
   - Local authority doesn't pay the parent any maintenance
   - This is a regular, ongoing arrangement

3. **Accurate Guidance**: The agent correctly explained that despite the child being in care, the parent can continue claiming Child Benefit because:
   - The child spends at least 2 consecutive nights at home weekly
   - No maintenance is paid by the local authority

4. **Alignment with Expected Outcome**: The expected outcome states "Eligible (via Exception)" specifically because Jack spends Friday and Saturday nights at home (2 nights in a row). The agent's determination matches this exactly.

The agent also appropriately advised the user to inform the Child Benefit Office about the changed circumstances, which is proper guidance. The evaluation judge's positive assessment (✓) is correct.
