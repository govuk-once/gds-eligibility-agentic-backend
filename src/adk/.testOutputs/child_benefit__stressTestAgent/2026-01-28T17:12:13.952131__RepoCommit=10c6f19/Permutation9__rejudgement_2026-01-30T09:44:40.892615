**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit in their current circumstances (as a pre-settled status holder who has been a jobseeker for "a few months" without having worked in the UK). The agent specifically stated: "My assessment: You may not currently be eligible for Child Benefit if you've been a jobseeker for more than 91 days without working."

The expected outcome is: **Eligible** - Lars, as a holder of Pre-Settled Status who is a registered jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work, should meet the "right to reside" test and be eligible for Child Benefit.

**The agent's communicated eligibility outcome (not eligible) does NOT agree with the expected outcome (eligible).**

While the evaluation_judge marked this with ✗ (indicating the agent failed), that judge was assessing whether the agent made the correct determination. For my task, I need to assess whether the agent's communicated outcome agrees with the expected outcome. Since the agent said "not eligible" and the expected outcome is "eligible," these do not agree, warranting a 👎.

**Correction: Upon re-reading the instructions, I should output 👎 when outcomes don't agree and 👍 when they do agree. Since they don't agree, the output should be:**

👎

The agent incorrectly determined ineligibility when the expected outcome was eligibility for a pre-settled status holder who is a genuine registered jobseeker.
