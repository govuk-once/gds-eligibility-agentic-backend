**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user **is eligible** for Child Benefit throughout their son's hospital stay. However, according to the expected outcome and the gov.uk guidance on children in hospital or care, there are specific time limits that apply.

**Key Issues:**

1. **The 12-week rule was not assessed**: According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, Child Benefit can continue while a child is in hospital, but only for up to 12 weeks (or longer if the parent is contributing to the cost of the child's upkeep at a rate of at least the Child Benefit amount).

2. **The linking rule applies**: The scenario states Arthur was in hospital for 10 weeks, home for 2 weeks, then readmitted after 15 days (within the 28-day window). Under the linking rule, these stays count cumulatively: 10 weeks + 3 weeks = 13 weeks total.

3. **The agent failed to inquire about**: 
   - How long the child has been in hospital
   - Whether the parent is spending money equivalent to Child Benefit on the child's upkeep
   - The cumulative duration and any previous hospital stays

**Expected Outcome**: Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week) - unless the parent is contributing costs equivalent to Child Benefit.

**Agent's Outcome**: Eligible without any time restrictions mentioned.

The agent's determination does not align with the expected outcome, as they failed to assess the critical 12-week hospital duration limit and the linking rule.
