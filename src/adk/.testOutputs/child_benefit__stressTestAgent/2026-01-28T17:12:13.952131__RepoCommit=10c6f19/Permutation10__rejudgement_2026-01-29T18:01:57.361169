**Justification:** The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

The agent properly identified the key disqualifying factor: Brenda is a local authority foster carer receiving fostering allowances from the council for Liam's accommodation and maintenance. The agent accurately explained that foster carers cannot claim Child Benefit when the local authority pays fostering allowances, as the council is already contributing to the child's upbringing. This aligns with the government guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, which states that you cannot get Child Benefit for children who are looked after by the local council (unless you're caring for them under a kinship care, adoption, or special guardianship arrangement, which was explicitly ruled out in this case).

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and reached the correct eligibility determination consistent with the expected outcome.
