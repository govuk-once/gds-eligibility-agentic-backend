**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Age criterion met**: The daughter is 16 (under 20) ✓

2. **Terminal dates properly addressed**: The agent specifically and correctly explained that "the gap between finishing school in June and starting college in September is typically covered - you should continue receiving Child Benefit during this period." This directly addresses the core concern of the "Summer Gap" scenario ✓

3. **Approved education confirmed**: The agent verified that A-levels starting in September constitute approved full-time education ✓

4. **Responsibility confirmed**: The mother lives with and is responsible for the child ✓

5. **Right to reside confirmed**: British citizen ✓

The agent's assessment is accurate according to gov.uk guidance, which states that Child Benefit continues during gaps between approved education courses when a young person has been accepted into further education. The agent correctly identified that this summer period between GCSEs ending in June and college starting in September is covered, which is precisely the scenario described in Permutation 36.

The expected outcome was "Eligible" and the agent communicated this outcome clearly and correctly.
