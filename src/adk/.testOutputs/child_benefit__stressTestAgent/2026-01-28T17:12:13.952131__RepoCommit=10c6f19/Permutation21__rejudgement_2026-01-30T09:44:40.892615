**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user (Robert) is eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam (the 10-year-old living with him). The agent properly verified all necessary eligibility criteria:

1. Child under 16 ✓
2. Child lives with the claimant ✓
3. Claimant is responsible for the child ✓
4. Both live in the UK ✓
5. UK citizen ✓
6. No one else claiming for this specific child ✓

The expected outcome states "Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)" - meaning both Robert (for Sam) and Tina (for Ella) should be eligible, with each receiving the higher "eldest child" rate of £26.05 for their respective child.

The agent correctly communicated that Robert is eligible to claim for Sam. While the agent didn't explicitly discuss the rate or mention that Tina would also be eligible for Ella (which wasn't asked about), the agent's determination aligns with the expected outcome - Robert can claim and is eligible. The scenario confirms that in split family situations where each parent has one child, each receives the higher rate for their eldest/only child in their household.

The agent's eligibility determination agrees with the expected outcome.
