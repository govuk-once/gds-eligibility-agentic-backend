**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "Unfortunately, you are not eligible to claim Child Benefit while Leo is in local authority care."

However, according to the expected outcome and the specific scenario provided, the user **should be eligible**. Here's why:

1. **The 8-week threshold matters**: According to [gov.uk guidance on children in care](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), parents can continue to claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit to the child's upkeep while in care. The child has been in care for 10 weeks, which exceeds 8 weeks, so the contribution requirement applies.

2. **Spousal contributions count**: The scenario explicitly states this is "The Spousal Contribution Exception" and notes that "a partner's money counts as the applicant's contribution, provided they are married or civil partners and living together." The user confirmed her husband (stepfather to Leo) pays £30/week to the carer.

3. **The £30/week contribution is sufficient**: Child Benefit for one child is approximately £25/week, so the £30/week payment exceeds this amount, meeting the upkeep requirement.

The agent failed to explore or acknowledge that the husband's contributions could count toward the applicant's eligibility, instead giving a blanket statement that parents cannot claim when children are in local authority care. This overlooks the important exception where parents who contribute to their child's upkeep can remain eligible.

**The agent's communicated outcome (Not Eligible) does not agree with the expected outcome (Eligible).**
