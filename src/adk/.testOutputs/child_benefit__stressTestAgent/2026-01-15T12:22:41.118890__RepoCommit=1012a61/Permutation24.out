2026-01-15T12:29:19.646310 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:29:21.190176 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you're still eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you tell me if the child you're claiming for is currently living away from you, and if so, what type of arrangement is in place – for example, are they in care, or in residential accommodation like a school?


2026-01-15T12:29:22.239074 [actor]: my son residential school 10 weeks

2026-01-15T12:29:23.183301 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know your son is in residential school and has been there for 10 weeks. 

Just to confirm, is this residential school paid for by the local council?





2026-01-15T12:29:23.857559 [actor]: local council pays yes

2026-01-15T12:29:25.846421 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that the local council pays for your son's residential school.

Children in residential accommodation, paid for by the local council, can continue to be eligible for Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks. Since your son has been there for 10 weeks, he *is* currently still eligible for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or any other questions you have about Child Benefit?





2026-01-15T12:29:28.879921 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit can continue for up to 12 weeks for a child in residential accommodation paid for by the local council, and since the child has only been there for 10 weeks, the parent remains eligible.
