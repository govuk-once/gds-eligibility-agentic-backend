2026-01-15T12:36:09.134146 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:36:10.017905 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?

2026-01-15T12:36:10.761392 [actor]: daughter 8 hospital

2026-01-15T12:36:11.620851 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know your daughter is 8 years old and in hospital.

To understand your situation a little better, how long has your daughter been in hospital?

2026-01-15T12:36:12.392342 [actor]: 14 weeks visit daily

2026-01-15T12:36:14.199817 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks and that you visit her daily. That’s good of you to be so involved in her care.

Now, thinking about the period your daughter has been in hospital, have you been regularly spending money on things for her, such as clothes, food, or treats, *in addition* to the care she's receiving at the hospital?

2026-01-15T12:36:15.032301 [actor]: hospital provides everything

2026-01-15T12:36:16.548473 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that the hospital provides everything your daughter needs – food, clothes, and other necessities. 

Just to be absolutely certain, so I can give you the most accurate information, would you say you *haven't* regularly spent any of your own money on items for your daughter during these 14 weeks in hospital?

2026-01-15T12:36:17.249900 [actor]: no spending they give everything

2026-01-15T12:36:20.000876 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you haven't been spending money on your daughter's upkeep while she's been in hospital, as the hospital is providing everything she needs.

Based on the information you've provided, and the rules around Child Benefit eligibility, unfortunately, you likely wouldn’t be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit *beyond* the 12-week point while your daughter is in hospital. This is because the rules state that to continue receiving it after 12 weeks, you generally need to be regularly spending money on your child’s upkeep.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or perhaps go over the relevant rules again?

2026-01-15T12:36:23.168439 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit typically stops after 12 weeks when a child is hospitalized unless the parent regularly spends money on the child's upkeep, which Maria does not do.
