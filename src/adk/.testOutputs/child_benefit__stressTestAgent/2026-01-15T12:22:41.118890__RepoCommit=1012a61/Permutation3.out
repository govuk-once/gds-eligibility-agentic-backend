2026-01-15T12:23:17.649106 [actor]: I'll assume the role of Gary, a 50-year-old father seeking child benefit information for his 17-year-old son Ben who recently left school and is looking for an apprenticeship.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:23:18.853076 [root_agent]: Hello Gary, thanks for reaching out. I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please confirm Ben's date of birth? This helps me to determine his age and therefore eligibility.





2026-01-15T12:23:19.659096 [actor]: ben birthday 17 march 2007

2026-01-15T12:23:21.065145 [root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. So Ben was born on 17th March 2007, meaning he is currently 17 years old.

My understanding is that Ben left school in June and is now actively looking for an apprenticeship, having registered with the local youth careers service. Is that correct?





2026-01-15T12:23:21.810681 [actor]: left school june looking for work careers service

2026-01-15T12:23:23.307325 [root_agent]: Okay, great. So Ben left school in June and is actively seeking work while registered with a careers service.

To confirm, when you say "careers service", is this a government-approved youth careers service? Knowing this is important as it affects potential eligibility under the extended rules for 17 and 18 year olds.





2026-01-15T12:23:23.978183 [actor]: registered with connexions youth careers adviser

2026-01-15T12:23:25.333033 [root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. Connexions is a recognised youth careers service, which is excellent.

Now, to clarify timescales, roughly how many weeks has it been since Ben left school in June? This will help me assess if you are still within the 20-week extension period.





2026-01-15T12:23:26.118534 [actor]: left about 8 weeks ago

2026-01-15T12:23:27.509694 [root_agent]: Thanks Gary. Eight weeks since leaving school puts you well within the 20-week extension period.

To continue assessing your eligibility, are you currently employed or self-employed? If so, roughly what is your annual income before tax? Don’t worry about being exact, an estimate is fine for now.





2026-01-15T12:23:28.357647 [actor]: work at sainsbury 24000 year before tax

2026-01-15T12:23:29.240778 [root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. An income of £24,000 before tax is helpful to know. 

Just to confirm, does Ben live with you full-time?

2026-01-15T12:23:29.958285 [actor]: ben lives with me full time yes

2026-01-15T12:23:30.806775 [root_agent]: Great, thanks Gary. And finally, is Ben currently receiving any other benefits or financial support in his own right? For example, is he receiving any unemployment benefits or other allowances?

2026-01-15T12:23:31.526459 [actor]: no benefits just looking for apprenticeship

2026-01-15T12:23:35.982336 [root_agent]: Okay Gary, thank you for providing all of that information.

Based on what you've told me:

*   Ben is 17 years old.
*   He left school approximately 8 weeks ago.
*   He is registered with Connexions, a recognised youth careers service, and actively seeking an apprenticeship.
*   Your annual income is around £24,000.
*   Ben lives with you full-time.
*   Ben is not currently receiving any benefits.

It appears you **are** likely eligible for Child Benefit. Ben meets the criteria for the extension to Child Benefit for 17-year-olds who are seeking work or an apprenticeship, as long as he remains registered with a qualifying careers service and continues to actively seek employment or an apprenticeship within the 20-week timeframe. Your income is also below the high-income threshold.

However, I recommend you double-check all the details on the government website to ensure you meet all the requirements. Would you like me to summarise the key points from the government website for you?





2026-01-15T12:23:39.861558 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Gary is eligible for Child Benefit because Ben is 17, recently left education (within the 20-week extension period), is registered with a qualifying careers service, and lives with Gary full-time.
