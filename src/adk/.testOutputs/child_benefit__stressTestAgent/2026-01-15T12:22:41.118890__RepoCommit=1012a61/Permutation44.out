2026-01-15T12:35:51.299402 [actor]: I understand you want me to roleplay as a person in the situation described, interacting with an agent that helps UK residents determine benefit eligibility.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:35:52.136382 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm here to help you understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are?





2026-01-15T12:35:52.776604 [actor]: over 16

2026-01-15T12:35:53.236720 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently in full-time education?

2026-01-15T12:35:54.037190 [actor]: not student working mother

2026-01-15T12:35:54.764354 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know.

Now, to clarify, are you the parent or legal guardian of the child this claim would be for?

2026-01-15T12:35:55.602461 [actor]: my son Leo visit on weekend

2026-01-15T12:35:56.012995 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Is Leo currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:35:56.777098 [actor]: lives in care home visits saturdays

2026-01-15T12:35:57.646751 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand Leo lives in a care home but visits you on Saturdays.

On average, how many hours a week does Leo spend with you? Please give me an approximate number.

2026-01-15T12:35:58.765828 [actor]: saturday morning to sunday morning 25 hours

2026-01-15T12:35:59.649385 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Leo spends approximately 25 hours with you each week. 

Just to be clear, is Leo in care for more than 8 weeks in a row?

2026-01-15T12:36:00.310506 [actor]: yes long time care home

2026-01-15T12:36:02.198136 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided, Leo is in care for more than 8 weeks, and spends over 24 hours a week with you. 

However, because Leo is in long-term care, eligibility for Child Benefit is quite specific. It appears you *may* be eligible, but I need to double-check a detail. Is the care arrangement arranged by a local authority?

2026-01-15T12:36:02.838989 [actor]: yes council arranged it

2026-01-15T12:36:05.130932 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that the local authority arranged the care.

Based on everything you've told me, it seems you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. Since Leo is in care arranged by the local authority for more than 8 weeks, and he spends at least 24 hours a week with you, you meet the criteria for claiming.

However, I strongly recommend you double-check this information on the official government website to ensure everything aligns with your specific situation. Would you like me to briefly summarise the key points from the guidance that support this?

2026-01-15T12:36:08.394682 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately stated that the mother is eligible for Child Benefit since Leo spends more than 24 hours a week with her (25 hours from Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am), despite being in local authority care for more than 8 weeks.
