2026-01-15T12:25:57.368919 [actor]: I'll help by roleplaying as Ali or Zara in this adoption situation. I'll follow the guidelines to be obtuse, speak like I'm using search terms, and not directly answer questions.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:25:58.194828 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you tell me how old you are?





2026-01-15T12:25:59.141211 [actor]: older than 30 need money for child

2026-01-15T12:25:59.696652 [root_agent]: Thank you. And could you please tell me if the child you are referring to lives with you?

2026-01-15T12:26:00.498715 [actor]: child home with us maya four years old

2026-01-15T12:26:01.365085 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. 

To clarify, are you the child's parent, or are you caring for the child in another way – for example, through adoption?

2026-01-15T12:26:02.343579 [actor]: adoption process maya placed with us court papers not final yet

2026-01-15T12:26:03.137950 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to be absolutely sure I have everything correct, are you responsible for Maya, and is she living with you full-time?

2026-01-15T12:26:04.101958 [actor]: maya our house now agency placed her we look after everything

2026-01-15T12:26:06.331119 [root_agent]: Okay, that's very helpful.

Based on what you've told me, and checking the guidance, it sounds like you *may* be eligible for Child Benefit. You don’t need to wait for the adoption to be legally finalised to start claiming, as long as Maya is living with you and you are responsible for her care.

However, to be certain, could you confirm your own National Insurance number? (You don't need to give me the full number, just confirm that you *have* one).

2026-01-15T12:26:07.069959 [actor]: have insurance number in folder somewhere

2026-01-15T12:26:08.581118 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Having a National Insurance number is a positive step!

Now, considering you are caring for Maya as part of the adoption process, are you employed, self-employed, or do you have another source of income? This doesn’t affect *eligibility* directly, but it can affect how much tax you pay on the benefit.

2026-01-15T12:26:09.320644 [actor]: work at company software job earn money

2026-01-15T12:26:10.024426 [root_agent]: Thank you. And roughly, would you say your annual income from your software job is over £50,000?

2026-01-15T12:26:11.121902 [actor]: salary good money yes over that amount

2026-01-15T12:26:13.508755 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for being honest about that. 

Because your income is over £50,000, Child Benefit may be reduced by the High Income Child Benefit Charge. This means you might still *receive* some Child Benefit, but you may need to report it in your Self Assessment tax return and potentially pay some of it back through your tax code.

However, this doesn’t disqualify you from *receiving* the benefit initially.

Just one final question - are you, or your partner if you have one, receiving any other benefits currently?

2026-01-15T12:26:14.400293 [actor]: partner zara works too no benefits yet new to this

2026-01-15T12:26:17.480898 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know.

Okay, based on everything you’ve told me: you are over 30, Maya (4) lives with you full-time while you go through the adoption process, you have a National Insurance number, you and your partner both work and earn over £50,000 combined, and you aren’t currently receiving any other benefits.

You *are* eligible to claim Child Benefit for Maya as soon as she comes to live with you, even before the adoption is legally finalised. However, due to your income, you will likely have to pay some of it back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Would you like me to summarise this information again, or are you happy with this explanation?





2026-01-15T12:26:18.733593 [actor]: ok understand eligible need to claim tax issues

2026-01-15T12:26:21.086157 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that the adopters are eligible for Child Benefit immediately after the child comes to live with them, even before the adoption is legally finalized.
