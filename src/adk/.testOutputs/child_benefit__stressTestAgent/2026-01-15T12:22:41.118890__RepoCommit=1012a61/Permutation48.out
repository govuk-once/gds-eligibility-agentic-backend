2026-01-15T12:37:02.489267 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:37:03.259330 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me your age?


2026-01-15T12:37:04.076319 [actor]: 43 with daughter

2026-01-15T12:37:04.425122 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is your daughter?

2026-01-15T12:37:05.022707 [actor]: emily 18

2026-01-15T12:37:05.735896 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Is Emily currently in full-time non-advanced education? (For example, A-levels or equivalent)

2026-01-15T12:37:07.604633 [actor]: college hnc course started September

2026-01-15T12:37:08.363771 [root_agent]: Thanks for that information. An HNC is a Level 4 qualification.

Just to confirm, is this HNC course a full-time course?

2026-01-15T12:37:09.122386 [actor]: yes full time 5 days college

2026-01-15T12:37:10.875901 [root_agent]: Thank you. As Emily is over 16 and undertaking full-time advanced education (the HNC course), unfortunately, you are likely **not** eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 16 and continues only if they remain in approved full-time non-advanced education.

However, there are exceptions in certain circumstances – is Emily registered with a healthcare professional as having a disability?

2026-01-15T12:37:11.569441 [actor]: no disability normal student

2026-01-15T12:37:12.673477 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. In that case, as Emily is 18 and undertaking full-time advanced education (the HNC), you are not eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T12:37:15.781460 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility because HNC is considered advanced education (Level 4), making the child ineligible for Child Benefit as it's only available for non-advanced education.
