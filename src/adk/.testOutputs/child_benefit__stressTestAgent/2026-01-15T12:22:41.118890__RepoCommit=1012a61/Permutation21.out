2026-01-15T12:28:21.616357 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:28:22.530476 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, are you responsible for the care of any children under 20?


2026-01-15T12:28:23.304376 [actor]: kids sam and ella 10 and 8

2026-01-15T12:28:24.381694 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about Sam and Ella. That's helpful.

Given that you have children aged 10 and 8, are you currently responsible for their day-to-day care?





2026-01-15T12:28:25.201121 [actor]: sam with me ella with ex

2026-01-15T12:28:26.063977 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that Sam lives with you and Ella lives with your ex-partner. 

To confirm, are you the main person responsible for Sam’s care?

2026-01-15T12:28:26.834813 [actor]: yes i am divorced from tina sam lives with me

2026-01-15T12:28:27.877585 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. It’s good to know you are divorced from Tina and Sam lives with you.

Just to be certain, is your ex-partner, Tina, also claiming Child Benefit for Ella?





2026-01-15T12:28:28.620053 [actor]: tina claim for ella yes

2026-01-15T12:28:30.759685 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Considering you are claiming for Sam and your ex-partner is claiming for Ella, and you are divorced, it sounds like you may be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit rate for Sam, which is currently £26.05 per week, as he is the eldest child in your household.

To be absolutely sure, what is your annual income? (Just a rough estimate is fine). This helps determine if your income affects your eligibility.

2026-01-15T12:28:31.517691 [actor]: job pays 25000

2026-01-15T12:28:33.774340 [root_agent]: Thank you. An income of £25,000 means your income doesn’t affect your Child Benefit eligibility. 

To summarise, based on the information you’ve provided: you are responsible for Sam’s care, you are divorced and Tina claims for Ella. Your income is below the threshold.

Therefore, you *are* eligible to receive Child Benefit for Sam at the full rate of £26.05 per week.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or anything else at all?





2026-01-15T12:28:37.133297 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user is eligible for the full "eldest child" rate for Sam (£26.05 weekly) as he is the eldest child in the user's household, which matches the expected outcome for split families where children live with different parents.
