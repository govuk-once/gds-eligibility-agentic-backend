2026-01-15T12:29:47.789704 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:29:48.665272 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?


2026-01-15T12:29:49.383565 [actor]: zahid 15 years old

2026-01-15T12:29:49.911455 [root_agent]: Thank you. And where does Zahid live primarily? With you, or someone else?

2026-01-15T12:29:50.598269 [actor]: with aunt

2026-01-15T12:29:51.061145 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Does your aunt claim any benefits for Zahid?

2026-01-15T12:29:51.809302 [actor]: no she doesn't claim

2026-01-15T12:29:52.564550 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Do you contribute financially towards Zahid’s upkeep? If so, approximately how much do you contribute each week?

2026-01-15T12:29:53.892967 [actor]: send £15 weekly

2026-01-15T12:29:54.754742 [root_agent]: Thanks. And are there any other people, perhaps family members, who also contribute financially towards Zahid’s upkeep? If so, approximately how much do they contribute each week?

2026-01-15T12:29:55.697026 [actor]: grandmother sends £15 too

2026-01-15T12:29:56.915398 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So, your mother (Zahid’s grandmother) sends £15 per week as well. 

Just to confirm, the total financial contribution towards Zahid from both you and your mother is £30 per week. Is that correct?

2026-01-15T12:29:57.522612 [actor]: yes £30 total

2026-01-15T12:29:59.776871 [root_agent]: Excellent. Based on the information you’ve provided, and checking the current rules, it appears you *may* be eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state that even if more than one person contributes to a child’s upkeep, the contributions can be combined. As the total contributions (£30) exceed the weekly threshold (£26.05 currently), this condition is met.

However, there are other eligibility requirements. Are you currently employed or self-employed, or do you have other income? Knowing this will help me assess your eligibility further.

2026-01-15T12:30:00.499462 [actor]: uber driver self employed

2026-01-15T12:30:02.223909 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you are self-employed as an Uber driver. 

To help me understand your situation fully, could you please tell me roughly what your weekly income is *after* any allowable expenses are deducted? It doesn’t need to be exact, but an estimate would be very helpful. This is because Child Benefit can be affected by your income if you earn over a certain amount.

2026-01-15T12:30:03.079803 [actor]: £320 weekly income

2026-01-15T12:30:04.100906 [root_agent]: Thank you. Just to be certain, is that £320 *after* you've taken off any allowable expenses related to your work as an Uber driver, such as fuel, insurance, and vehicle maintenance?

2026-01-15T12:30:05.019478 [actor]: yes after expenses

2026-01-15T12:30:08.642643 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided – Zahid being 15, living with his aunt who doesn't claim benefit, a total contribution of £30 per week which exceeds the threshold, and your weekly income after expenses being £320 – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit.

Currently, Child Benefit isn't reduced based on income until one parent earns over £50,000 per year. As your income is below this threshold, it shouldn’t affect your entitlement.

However, I must state that I am an AI and this is not a definitive answer. To be absolutely sure, I recommend you double-check the eligibility criteria on the official government website: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility.



Would you like me to summarise the reasons why you appear eligible?

2026-01-15T12:30:11.054724 [actor]: Thank you for the information. Yes, I understand that I'm likely eligible for Child Benefit since I contribute to Zahid's upkeep and our total family contribution exceeds the threshold.

2026-01-15T12:30:12.724412 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly identified that multiple contributions can be combined (£15 from Mo and £15 from grandmother totaling £30), which exceeds the weekly threshold of £26.05, making Mo eligible for Child Benefit.
