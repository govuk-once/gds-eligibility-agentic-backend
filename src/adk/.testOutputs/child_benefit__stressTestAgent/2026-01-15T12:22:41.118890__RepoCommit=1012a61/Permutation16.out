2026-01-15T12:26:54.812755 [actor]: I'll help you role-play as Hannah, a UK resident with a son receiving specialist treatment abroad. I'll follow the rules about being obtuse and using search-engine-like responses.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:26:55.701346 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?

2026-01-15T12:26:56.488127 [actor]: oliver 14 years old specialist hospital

2026-01-15T12:26:57.246486 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know your child is 14 years old. 

Now, is your child currently living with you in the UK?

2026-01-15T12:26:58.014288 [actor]: usa hospital treatment rare condition 15 weeks

2026-01-15T12:26:58.802524 [root_agent]: Okay, so your child is currently receiving treatment in a hospital in the USA.

To clarify, has your child been in hospital for more than 12 weeks?

2026-01-15T12:26:59.673016 [actor]: yes 15 weeks now usa specialist treatment

2026-01-15T12:27:00.849542 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your child has been in hospital for 15 weeks.

Was your child sent abroad *specifically* to receive hospital treatment? Or were you travelling for other reasons and they needed hospital care while you were already abroad?

2026-01-15T12:27:01.736596 [actor]: sent specifically usa rare condition treatment specialist hospital uk resident myself

2026-01-15T12:27:03.054553 [root_agent]: Okay, so your child was sent to the USA specifically for hospital treatment due to a rare condition. And you remain a UK resident.

Just to be absolutely certain – are you continuing to financially support your child while they are receiving treatment in the USA? Specifically, are *you* covering their incidental costs?

2026-01-15T12:27:03.801989 [actor]: pay visits costs when possible usa treatment

2026-01-15T12:27:06.532670 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. It sounds like you are covering costs related to your child's treatment and visits while they are in the USA.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you *are* likely to continue being eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state that if a child is in hospital abroad, and went abroad specifically for hospital treatment, eligibility can continue as long as the parent is still financially supporting them.

However, I am an AI and cannot give definitive financial advice. Would you like me to summarise the relevant information from the government website, or would you prefer to double-check this with a government advisor?

2026-01-15T12:27:09.546722 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Hannah remains eligible for Child Benefit because her child was sent abroad specifically for hospital treatment and she continues to financially support him.
