2026-01-15T12:23:53.398912 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:23:54.244551 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-15T12:23:54.979024 [actor]: 40 years old

2026-01-15T12:23:55.958840 [root_agent]: Thank you. And do you have a child or children under 20 years old who are in full-time education or training?





2026-01-15T12:23:56.849842 [actor]: 10 year old son

2026-01-15T12:23:57.217380 [root_agent]: Great. Does your son live with you?

2026-01-15T12:23:57.910713 [actor]: son lives with ex-wife

2026-01-15T12:23:58.444453 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Do you contribute financially to the upkeep of your son?

2026-01-15T12:23:59.285445 [actor]: pay 150 monthly for food clothes

2026-01-15T12:24:00.018671 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful. Just to confirm, is anyone *else* currently claiming Child Benefit for your son?

2026-01-15T12:24:00.848035 [actor]: ex-wife not claiming

2026-01-15T12:24:03.183062 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided, it sounds like you *may* be eligible for Child Benefit. 

As your son doesn’t live with you, but you contribute financially towards his upkeep with £150 per month, and his mother isn’t claiming, you meet the criteria to claim. 

However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that your contribution of £150 per month is specifically *for* your son's benefit – for things like food, clothes, and other essential needs?

2026-01-15T12:24:03.997068 [actor]: yes money for lucas food clothes

2026-01-15T12:24:05.757576 [root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for confirming.

Based on everything you’ve told me, you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your son. Since he lives with his mother who isn't claiming, and you contribute over the relevant amount towards his expenses, you meet the requirements.

Would you like me to summarise the key reasons why you appear eligible? Or would you prefer information on how to make a claim?

2026-01-15T12:24:09.014281 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Mark is eligible for Child Benefit because he contributes financially (more than the Child Benefit amount) to his son's upkeep, his son is of eligible age, and no one else is currently claiming.
