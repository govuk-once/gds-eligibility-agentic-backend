2026-01-15T12:25:20.671035 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:25:22.034280 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand. I'm here to help determine if you are eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, are you legally responsible for the child in question? This means, do you have parental responsibility, or are you caring for them in a way that means you are the primary caregiver?

2026-01-15T12:25:23.723168 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you foster Liam, who is 12 years old. That’s helpful.

Now, is the local council paying you a fostering allowance that covers Liam’s accommodation and maintenance?

2026-01-15T12:25:24.503126 [actor]: yes council pays fostering allowance

2026-01-15T12:25:26.070593 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that the council pays a fostering allowance covering Liam’s accommodation and maintenance.

Based on the information you’ve provided, you are not eligible to claim Child Benefit for Liam. This is because Child Benefit cannot be claimed for a fostered child if the local authority is paying for their accommodation or maintenance.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T12:25:27.748276 [actor]: No longer eligible for benefit then

2026-01-15T12:25:28.989309 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed the user that she is not eligible for Child Benefit for a fostered child when the local council is paying for the child's accommodation or maintenance.
