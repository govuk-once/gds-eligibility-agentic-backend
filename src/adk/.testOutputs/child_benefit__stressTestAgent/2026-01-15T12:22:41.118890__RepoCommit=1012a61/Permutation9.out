2026-01-15T12:25:02.520664 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:25:03.377677 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please confirm how old your child is?


2026-01-15T12:25:04.149549 [actor]: 5 years old boy

2026-01-15T12:25:04.816720 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's good to know.

Are you responsible for the day-to-day care of this child?

2026-01-15T12:25:05.713529 [actor]: yes my son hans live with me

2026-01-15T12:25:06.317626 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful. 

Are you currently employed, or are you currently looking for work?





2026-01-15T12:25:07.068922 [actor]: jobseeker now looking work

2026-01-15T12:25:08.179962 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. 

What is your nationality, and what is your current immigration status in the UK?





2026-01-15T12:25:08.971632 [actor]: german pre settled status

2026-01-15T12:25:09.860556 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Just to confirm, are you currently working, or are you actively seeking employment with a genuine prospect of finding work?





2026-01-15T12:25:10.559815 [actor]: registered jobseeker actively looking

2026-01-15T12:25:12.961293 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided – that you are a German citizen with Pre-Settled Status, you are responsible for a 5-year-old son who lives with you, and you are a registered jobseeker actively looking for work – you *appear* to be eligible for Child Benefit.

However, eligibility can depend on a few specific details. I recommend reviewing the information on the UK government website to ensure you meet all the requirements. Would you like me to summarise the key points from the website relating to your situation?

2026-01-15T12:25:13.771457 [actor]: how much do i get

2026-01-15T12:25:16.355343 [root_agent]: I understand you’d like to know how much Child Benefit you could receive.

Currently, the full weekly rate of Child Benefit is £21.80 for your first child. As you have one child, Hans, you would likely receive this full amount. 

However, your Child Benefit may be affected by your income. If you earn over £50,000, you may have to pay some of it back in tax. 

Would you like me to explain how income affects Child Benefit, or would you prefer a link to the official government information on rates and how they’re affected by income?

2026-01-15T12:25:19.903254 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Lars's eligibility for Child Benefit as a German citizen with Pre-Settled Status who is a registered jobseeker, and correctly stated the current weekly rate for his 5-year-old son.
