2026-01-15T12:30:35.442247 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:30:36.675639 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me about your immigration status in the UK? For example, do you have a visa, and if so, what type is it?





2026-01-15T12:30:37.814525 [actor]: visitor visa 6 months

2026-01-15T12:30:38.710926 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you are in the UK on a 6-month visitor visa.

Just to confirm, are you currently working in the UK while on this visa?

2026-01-15T12:30:39.608870 [actor]: not working tourist only

2026-01-15T12:30:40.767426 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming you are not working and are here as a tourist.

To assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand your son's circumstances a little better. Is your son also in the UK with you on a visitor visa?

2026-01-15T12:30:41.433436 [actor]: yes son with me 5 years old

2026-01-15T12:30:43.080157 [root_agent]: Thank you. So, both you and your 5-year-old son are in the UK on visitor visas.

Generally, Child Benefit isn’t available to people who are in the UK as visitors. However, there can be exceptions. To be certain, could you please confirm how long you and your son have been resident in the UK? (Even a rough estimate is helpful).





2026-01-15T12:30:46.260223 [actor]: 2 weeks in uk now

2026-01-15T12:30:48.630852 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you’ve been in the UK for two weeks.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that you and your son are both here on 6-month visitor visas and have only been in the UK for two weeks – it is highly unlikely you would be eligible for Child Benefit. This is because Child Benefit usually requires a ‘right to reside’ which visitors generally do not have.

However, I want to be completely sure. Are you intending to stay in the UK long-term, and are you taking any steps towards becoming a permanent resident?

2026-01-15T12:30:49.638521 [actor]: just visiting family holiday only

2026-01-15T12:30:52.138387 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you are visiting family for a holiday only.

Based on all the information you’ve shared – that you and your son are in the UK on 6-month visitor visas for a holiday, and you have no plans to stay long-term – you are unfortunately **not eligible** for Child Benefit. This is because Child Benefit requires a 'right to reside' in the UK, and visitor visas do not provide this.

I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on other support available to visitors?

2026-01-15T12:30:55.634554 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent appropriately explained that a visitor visa does not confer the right to reside required for Child Benefit eligibility.
