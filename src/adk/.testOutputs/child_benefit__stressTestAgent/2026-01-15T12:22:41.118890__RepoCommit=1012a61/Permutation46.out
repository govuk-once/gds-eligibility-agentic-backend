2026-01-15T12:36:23.804797 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:36:24.560921 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, are you currently employed?


2026-01-15T12:36:25.850648 [actor]: unemployed looking for work

2026-01-15T12:36:26.478661 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. 

To clarify, how many days have you been unemployed and actively looking for work?

2026-01-15T12:36:27.269297 [actor]: jobseeker 95 days no job yet

2026-01-15T12:36:28.534385 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. 

Just to be absolutely certain, when you say you've been a jobseeker for 95 days, does this mean you've been claiming Child Benefit *specifically* due to being a jobseeker for that length of time?

2026-01-15T12:36:29.375417 [actor]: yes pre-settled status 95 days claiming child benefit as jobseeker

2026-01-15T12:36:31.727093 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you have Pre-Settled Status and have been claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker for 95 days.

According to the rules, claiming as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status is generally allowed, but there’s a time limit of 91 days. Since you've been claiming for 95 days and don't have a job offer, your right to reside for benefit purposes may have expired.

Do you have a job offer, or are you currently receiving any other form of financial support beyond Child Benefit?





2026-01-15T12:36:32.560221 [actor]: no job offer no other money

2026-01-15T12:36:35.040797 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clear answer.

Based on the information you've provided – being unemployed for 95 days while claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status, and having no job offer or other financial support – it appears you are **no longer eligible** to claim Child Benefit. This is because the permitted period for claiming as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status is 91 days, and that has now passed.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or are you interested in understanding what your next steps should be regarding your Child Benefit claim?





2026-01-15T12:36:38.745034 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. They explained that as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status, the right to reside for benefit purposes expires after 91 days unless there's a job offer, and since Hans has been claiming for 95 days with no job offer, he is no longer eligible.
