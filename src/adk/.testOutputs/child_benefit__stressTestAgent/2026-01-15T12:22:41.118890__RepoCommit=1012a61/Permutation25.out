2026-01-15T12:29:29.543003 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:29:30.350786 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm here to help determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-15T12:29:31.557118 [actor]: 30 years

2026-01-15T12:29:31.993912 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is the child you are claiming for?

2026-01-15T12:29:32.640720 [actor]: Leo 5

2026-01-15T12:29:33.078713 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Is Leo currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:29:34.019293 [actor]: care 10 weeks

2026-01-15T12:29:35.060283 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. So, Leo has been in local authority care for 10 weeks.

Now, to clarify, are you currently receiving any income yourself? This includes things like wages, pensions, or benefits.

2026-01-15T12:29:35.890271 [actor]: no income husband pays

2026-01-15T12:29:36.984308 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to be clear, your husband, who you live with, is contributing financially towards Leo's upkeep while he is in care, is that correct? If so, approximately how much does he contribute each week?

2026-01-15T12:29:37.655583 [actor]: stepfather £30 weekly care

2026-01-15T12:29:38.779998 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that your husband (Leo’s stepfather) contributes £30 per week directly to the carer for Leo’s upkeep.

Just one final question for now. Are you and your husband married or in a civil partnership?

2026-01-15T12:29:39.543128 [actor]: married living together

2026-01-15T12:29:43.036881 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are married and living together. 

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. Here's why:

*   You are over 16 and under 20 (you are 30)
*   Leo is under 16 (Leo is 5)
*   Leo has been in care for more than 8 weeks.
*   Although you have no income, your husband’s contribution of £30 per week meets the financial requirement for upkeep, and as you are married and living together, his contribution counts towards your eligibility.

However, please remember I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. It’s always best to double-check with the official government information. Would you like me to summarise why I believe you are likely eligible?





2026-01-15T12:29:44.395440 [actor]: okay thank you

2026-01-15T12:29:47.092364 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility because Beatrice qualifies for Child Benefit as her husband (a spouse she lives with) contributes £30/week toward Leo's upkeep, which satisfies the eligibility requirements even though Leo has been in care for more than 8 weeks.
