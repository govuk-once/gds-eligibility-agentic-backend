2026-01-19T17:06:12.890541 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your situation.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:06:15.162821 [root_agent]: I understand you have a 6-year-old daughter who is in the hospital. I'll help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.

Is your daughter normally living with you when she's not in the hospital?

2026-01-19T17:06:16.131474 [actor]: daughter in hospital chloe visits every day 14 weeks

2026-01-19T17:06:19.475127 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing more information. I understand that your daughter Chloe has been in the hospital for 14 weeks and you visit her every day.

For Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in the hospital, you can typically continue to receive Child Benefit while your child is in the hospital if:

1. You were eligible for Child Benefit before your daughter went into the hospital
2. You maintain regular contact with her (which you are doing through your daily visits)

The important thing is that you're still responsible for your child even while she's temporarily in the hospital.

May I ask if you were already receiving Child Benefit for your daughter before she went into the hospital?

2026-01-19T17:06:24.223150 [root_agent]: I understand this situation is difficult and there are ongoing expenses for your daughter's care such as books, clothes, pajamas, and special food.

Based on the UK government's rules, if your daughter is temporarily in hospital, you can continue to receive Child Benefit as long as you:
- Maintain regular contact with her (which you are doing through daily visits)
- Continue to be responsible for her care-related expenses (which you are, by providing items she needs)

Your daily visits and continued financial support for her needs demonstrate that you're maintaining your parental responsibility while she's in the hospital.

May I ask if you were already receiving Child Benefit before your daughter went into the hospital? This will help me provide more specific guidance about your situation.

2026-01-19T17:06:25.226061 [actor]: money for hospital stay £30 each week for daughter

2026-01-19T17:06:28.401303 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're spending about £30 each week for your daughter's needs while she's in the hospital.

Based on UK government guidelines, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit while your daughter is in the hospital, especially since you're:
1. Maintaining regular contact through daily visits
2. Contributing financially to her care and needs (£30 weekly)

If you were already receiving Child Benefit, this should continue during her hospital stay regardless of how long she remains there. If you haven't applied for Child Benefit yet, you may still be eligible to apply now.

Have you previously applied for or received Child Benefit for your daughter?

2026-01-19T17:06:29.309520 [actor]: mary 29 chloe 6

2026-01-19T17:06:32.349969 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Mary. I understand you're 29 years old and your daughter Chloe is 6 years old.

Based on what you've shared about your situation - visiting your daughter daily in the hospital and covering expenses for her needs like books, clothes, pajamas, and special food - it appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit.

The UK government allows Child Benefit to continue while a child is temporarily in hospital, as long as you maintain regular contact and continue to have responsibility for the child, which you clearly do.

May I ask if you've applied for Child Benefit before, or if you're currently receiving it for Chloe?

2026-01-19T17:06:33.379828 [actor]: hospital 14 weeks long time

2026-01-19T17:06:36.147936 [root_agent]: I understand, Mary. 14 weeks is indeed a long time for your daughter to be in the hospital, and this must be a challenging situation for both of you.

Regarding Child Benefit eligibility: When a child is in hospital, even for extended periods like 14 weeks, you can still receive Child Benefit as long as you maintain regular contact with your child and continue to have parental responsibility. Your daily visits and financial contributions for Chloe's needs (like the £30 weekly for clothes, books, pajamas, and special food) show that you're maintaining this responsibility.

Have you already applied for Child Benefit before Chloe went into the hospital, or would this be a new application?

2026-01-19T17:06:36.985445 [actor]: eligible for benefit?

2026-01-19T17:06:40.202399 [root_agent]: Yes, based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for your 6-year-old daughter Chloe.

Even though Chloe has been in the hospital for 14 weeks, you are maintaining your parental responsibility by:
- Visiting her every day
- Providing items she needs (books, clothes, pajamas, special food)
- Spending approximately £30 each week on her care

According to UK government rules, Child Benefit can continue when a child is in hospital, regardless of how long they stay there, as long as you maintain contact and responsibility for the child - which you clearly are doing.

If you haven't applied yet, you would be eligible to apply for Child Benefit. If you're already receiving it, you should continue to be eligible while Chloe is in the hospital.

2026-01-19T17:06:44.006944 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit can continue while a child is temporarily in hospital as long as the parent maintains regular contact and responsibility, which the parent demonstrated through daily visits and financial support.
