2026-01-19T17:08:04.421228 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to determine your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T17:08:05.284537 [actor]: child benefit help

2026-01-19T17:08:06.714187 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand more about Child Benefit in the UK. 

Do you currently have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T17:08:07.515229 [actor]: Ryan son 17

2026-01-19T17:08:09.230061 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. So you have a 17-year-old son named Ryan. 

Is Ryan currently in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, T levels, or other approved education courses.

2026-01-19T17:08:10.011606 [actor]: apprenticeship started

2026-01-19T17:08:11.626466 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is Ryan's apprenticeship considered an "approved" training program? Generally, most apprenticeships in the UK that are government-recognized would qualify, especially if they are up to Level 3 or equivalent.

2026-01-19T17:08:12.352503 [actor]: intermediate apprenticeship england

2026-01-19T17:08:13.952075 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. An intermediate apprenticeship in England (Level 2, equivalent to GCSEs) is typically considered an approved form of training for Child Benefit purposes.

Do you and Ryan normally live in the UK? (This is another eligibility criterion for Child Benefit.)

2026-01-19T17:08:14.708518 [actor]: live at home with son

2026-01-19T17:08:16.102890 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to clarify something about your residency status.

Are you and your son normally living in the UK? This is important for Child Benefit eligibility as there are residency requirements.

2026-01-19T17:08:16.898745 [actor]: yes UK

2026-01-19T17:08:18.878298 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK with your son.

Do you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year? (This affects whether you'll have to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which might impact your decision to claim.)

2026-01-19T17:08:19.686762 [actor]: no high income

2026-01-19T17:08:22.413299 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that about your income.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have a 17-year-old son named Ryan
- He's doing an intermediate apprenticeship in England, which is an approved form of training
- You both live together in the UK
- Neither you nor a partner have an income over £60,000

It appears that you would be eligible for Child Benefit for your son. Since Ryan is on an approved training course and is under 20, you should qualify for Child Benefit payments.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit or do you have any other questions about it?

2026-01-19T17:08:25.571065 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided correct information about eligibility for Child Benefit for a 17-year-old on an intermediate apprenticeship living in the UK.
