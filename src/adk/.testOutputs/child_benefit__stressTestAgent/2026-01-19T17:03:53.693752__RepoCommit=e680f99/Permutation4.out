2026-01-19T17:05:00.775287 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility based on UK government rules.

Do you have any children living with you that you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T17:05:01.794239 [actor]: I have a daughter who lives with me. Sofia.

2026-01-19T17:05:03.382614 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To help determine your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to understand a bit more about your situation.

How old is your daughter Sofia?

2026-01-19T17:05:04.241370 [actor]: Sofia 18 years old

2026-01-19T17:05:05.770165 [root_agent]: I understand that your daughter Sofia is 18 years old. Thank you for that information.

Is Sofia in approved education or training? This could include A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved education or training courses.

2026-01-19T17:05:06.659313 [actor]: Sofia work receptionist. Left school two years.

2026-01-19T17:05:08.840957 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Sofia is working as a receptionist and left school two years ago.

Based on the UK government rules, I need to inform you that you're not eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia. Child Benefit is typically paid until a child turns 16, or until they're 20 if they stay in approved education or training. Since Sofia is 18 and not in approved education or training, you would not qualify for Child Benefit.

Do you have any other children you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T17:05:11.214103 [actor]: No. Just Sofia. She works 30 hours every week. No other children.

2026-01-19T17:05:12.799639 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed that Child Benefit is not available for an 18-year-old who is working rather than in approved education or training.
