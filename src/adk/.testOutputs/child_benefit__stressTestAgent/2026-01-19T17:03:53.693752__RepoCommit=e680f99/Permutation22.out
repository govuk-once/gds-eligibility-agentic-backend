Are you responsible for the costs of caring for Arthur while he's in the hospital? For example, do you provide clothes, toys, or other personal items for him?

2026-01-19T17:12:41.616396 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. It's clear you're still actively involved in Arthur's care and providing for his needs.

Is anyone claiming Child Benefit for Arthur already?

2026-01-19T17:12:42.438695 [actor]: no one else claim benefit

2026-01-19T17:12:45.697682 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Arthur.

Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for your son Arthur. Even though Arthur is currently in hospital, you remain eligible because:

1. You normally live in the UK
2. Arthur is under 16 years old
3. Arthur normally lives with you when not in the hospital
4. You are responsible for Arthur and continue to provide care items for him
5. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

The hospital stays do not affect your eligibility as you're still considered responsible for Arthur, and you're providing for his needs during his hospital stay.

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T17:12:49.184504 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Jenny is eligible for Child Benefit because her son Arthur is under 16, normally lives with her, she provides care while he's in hospital, and no one else is claiming the benefit.
