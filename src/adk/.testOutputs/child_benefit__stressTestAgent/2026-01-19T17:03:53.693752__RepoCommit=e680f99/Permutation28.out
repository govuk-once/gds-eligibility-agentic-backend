2026-01-19T17:17:26.585513 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:17:28.064050 [actor]: I'll engage with the agent as a UK visitor seeking information about child benefit eligibility, playing the role of Maria with her 5-year-old son on a tourist visa.

Here with my son he's 5

2026-01-19T17:17:29.265156 [root_agent]: I'll need to gather some information to determine your child benefit eligibility. 

Do you and your son normally live in the UK, or are you just visiting?

2026-01-19T17:17:30.113680 [actor]: Just visiting tourist visa 6 months from USA

2026-01-19T17:17:33.081094 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since you and your son are visiting the UK on a tourist visa and don't normally live in the UK, you wouldn't be eligible for UK Child Benefit.

Child Benefit is generally available to people who are responsible for a child and who live in the UK. The eligibility requirements include that you must normally live in the UK (or be treated as living in the UK), and you must have the right to reside in the UK.

As you're visiting on a tourist visa for 6 months, you wouldn't meet these residence requirements for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding benefits or services while you're visiting the UK?

2026-01-19T17:17:35.264714 [actor]: I see. Vacation only so no benefits?

2026-01-19T17:17:36.623098 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed the user that as a tourist on a 6-month visa from the USA, they are not eligible for Child Benefit because they don't normally live in the UK and don't meet the residence requirements.
