2026-01-19T17:08:57.639568 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

Maya living with us now 4 years old adoption not final yet

2026-01-19T17:09:03.547934 [root_agent]: #thinking
I need to consider this carefully. This person appears to have a 4-year-old named Maya living with them, but the adoption isn't finalized yet. This could affect eligibility. According to the UK government criteria:

From https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility:
- You're typically eligible if you're responsible for a child under 16 (which Maya is at 4)
- The "responsibility" element might depend on the adoption status and current legal arrangement

I need to understand their current legal relationship with Maya to determine eligibility.

Thank you for that information. I understand that you have a 4-year-old named Maya living with you, but the adoption isn't finalized yet.

To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you tell me about your current legal arrangement with Maya? For example, are you her foster carer, do you have a special guardianship order, or what is your current legal status in relation to her?

2026-01-19T17:09:04.457224 [actor]: adoption agency placed her with us waiting for court order living with us full time

This information helps clarify the situation. They have a child placed with them by an adoption agency, and they are waiting for the final court order to complete the adoption. Maya is living with them full-time during this period.

According to the eligibility criteria:
- They appear to have responsibility for the child as she is living with them full-time
- The placement has been made officially through an adoption agency
- They're in the pre-adoption period waiting for the court order

From my understanding of the UK rules, people can typically claim Child Benefit if they're responsible for a child, even during the pre-adoption phase when the child has been placed with them but the adoption is not yet finalized. The key factor is who has day-to-day responsibility for the child.

Thank you for that clarification. Based on what you've told me, you may be eligible for Child Benefit.

Since Maya has been placed with you by an adoption agency and is living with you full-time while you await the final court order, you are considered to have responsibility for her care. This typically qualifies you to claim Child Benefit even though the adoption isn't yet finalized.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T17:09:11.381092 [actor]: both work Ali earns 40000 Zara earns 35000

2026-01-19T17:09:16.908240 [root_agent]: #thinking
This is important income information to determine if the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies:
- Ali earns £40,000
- Zara earns £35,000

According to the Child Benefit eligibility rules, the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies when an individual has an income over £50,000 per year. The charge increases gradually for incomes between £50,000 and £60,000, and if someone has an income over £60,000, they effectively receive no financial benefit (though they can still claim and choose to waive payment).

In this case:
- Neither individual earns over £50,000
- Their combined income is over £50,000, but the High Income Child Benefit Charge is based on individual income, not household income

Since neither partner earns over £50,000 individually, they would not be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Thank you for sharing that information. Since neither you nor your partner has an individual income over £50,000 per year, you wouldn't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Is Maya a UK resident? And are you and your partner UK residents as well?

2026-01-19T17:09:18.040255 [actor]: all live in London UK citizens

2026-01-19T17:09:22.937292 [root_agent]: #thinking
This confirms important residency requirements:
- Maya lives in London
- Both adults are UK citizens
- They all reside in the UK

According to the eligibility criteria, Child Benefit can generally be paid to a person who is responsible for a child if both:
- The person claiming is living in the UK
- The child is living in the UK

These residency requirements appear to be satisfied in this case.
#end_thinking

Thank you for confirming that. Since you all live in London and are UK citizens, you meet the residency requirements for Child Benefit.

Based on all the information you've provided:

1. You have responsibility for Maya who is 4 years old
2. She has been placed with you by an adoption agency and lives with you full-time
3. Neither you nor your partner earn above the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold
4. You all live in the UK and are UK citizens

It appears you are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Maya. You can apply for Child Benefit as soon as Maya came to live with you, even though the adoption is not yet finalized. The benefit can be claimed by either you or your partner, but typically it's claimed by the person who has the main responsibility for the child.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T17:09:26.754001 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly assessed that they could claim Child Benefit for a child placed with them by an adoption agency while awaiting final court order, with neither partner earning above the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
