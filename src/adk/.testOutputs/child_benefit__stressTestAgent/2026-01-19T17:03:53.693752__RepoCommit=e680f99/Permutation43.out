2026-01-19T17:23:23.068406 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility correctly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children that you're responsible for who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:23:24.810332 [actor]: I'll now play the role of a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll be obtuse, speak like I'm entering search terms, and not directly answer questions as instructed.

My son apprenticeship glasgow money help

2026-01-19T17:23:26.370583 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about help with money for your son who is doing an apprenticeship in Glasgow.

To determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit for your son, could you please confirm if you're responsible for caring for him?

2026-01-19T17:23:28.506402 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you're a dad in Glasgow looking for government support money for your son.

Could you please tell me how old your son is?

2026-01-19T17:23:31.288492 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son Callum is 17 years old and is an apprentice.

For Child Benefit eligibility purposes, could you confirm if Callum is in what's considered an "approved" education or training program? Typically, apprenticeships can qualify if they're approved by the government.

2026-01-19T17:23:34.439004 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland are typically approved training programs, which is helpful to know.

You mentioned Callum is living with you. Are you the person who is primarily responsible for Callum? (This usually means you're the person he lives with and you pay for the majority of his care and upbringing)

2026-01-19T17:23:35.246184 [actor]: Yes father single household Glasgow

2026-01-19T17:23:36.951174 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Since you're Callum's father in a single household and he lives with you, that's important for eligibility.

Does anyone else (such as Callum's other parent) receive Child Benefit payments for him already?

2026-01-19T17:23:38.064342 [actor]: No other parent money just me and son struggling

2026-01-19T17:23:39.644824 [root_agent]: I understand your situation - you're raising your son alone with no other parent providing financial support, and you're finding things financially difficult.

One more question about your income - do you or anyone in your household have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-19T17:23:40.468408 [actor]: No money problems below that amount

2026-01-19T17:23:44.109813 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Based on what you've shared, it appears you are likely eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. Your son Callum is 17 and on a Modern Apprenticeship, which typically qualifies as approved training
2. He lives with you and you're his responsible parent
3. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him
4. Your income is below the £50,000 threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would start to apply

You can apply for Child Benefit online through the UK government website or by filling out a CH2 claim form. As a single parent with financial challenges, this benefit could provide you with some helpful support while your son completes his apprenticeship.

Would you like me to explain how much Child Benefit you might receive or how to apply?

2026-01-19T17:23:48.192396 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a 17-year-old on a Modern Apprenticeship, correctly identifying that the parent would be eligible since the son is in approved training, lives with the parent, no one else claims the benefit, and the income is below the threshold.
