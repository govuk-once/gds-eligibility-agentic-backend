2026-01-19T17:07:09.887406 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you a few questions to assess your eligibility.

First, are you responsible for raising a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:07:10.785959 [actor]: child benefit for my daughter Ruby

2026-01-19T17:07:12.131956 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit for your daughter Ruby, I'll need to ask you a few more questions.

Is Ruby under the age of 16, or under 20 if she's in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:07:13.424335 [actor]: Ruby 4 years old

2026-01-19T17:07:14.923984 [root_agent]: I understand that Ruby is 4 years old, which meets the age requirement for Child Benefit. 

Does Ruby live with you? Or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit rates toward her upbringing?

2026-01-19T17:07:15.926178 [actor]: Ruby lives with me and James

2026-01-19T17:07:17.357972 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know that Ruby lives with you.

Is Ruby in the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, or a European Economic Area country?

2026-01-19T17:07:18.462177 [actor]: UK all of us

2026-01-19T17:07:20.088675 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you all live in the UK.

Now, regarding your personal circumstances, is either you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 a year before tax?

2026-01-19T17:07:20.952656 [actor]: I earn 75000 James 20000

2026-01-19T17:07:25.377899 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information about your income.

Since you earn £75,000 per year (which is above the £60,000 threshold), you'll still be eligible to claim Child Benefit, but you'll need to pay back some or all of it through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

When your individual income is over £60,000, you'll need to pay back the full amount of Child Benefit through tax. You have two options:

1. You can still claim Child Benefit and pay the tax charge through Self Assessment, or
2. You can choose not to receive the Child Benefit payments (you can still make the claim but opt out of receiving payments)

Even if you choose not to receive the payments, making the claim helps protect your National Insurance credits, which can count toward your State Pension.

Would you like me to explain more about the High Income Child Benefit Charge or your options in this situation?

2026-01-19T17:07:29.224462 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that while the user is eligible for Child Benefit for their 4-year-old daughter living with them in the UK, they would need to pay back the full amount through the High Income Child Benefit Charge due to earning £75,000, which exceeds the £60,000 threshold.
