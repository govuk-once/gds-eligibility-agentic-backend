2026-01-19T17:10:10.727311 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you that you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T17:10:12.257631 [actor]: I need to role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the rules - being obtuse, speaking like search terms, and providing minimal context.

Child benefit son hospital America

2026-01-19T17:10:14.626313 [root_agent]: I'll need to carefully understand your situation to determine Child Benefit eligibility.

Let me think about what you've shared. You mentioned having a son who is in hospital in America. Child Benefit eligibility involves several factors including responsibility for a child, where the child normally lives, and specific circumstances like hospitalization.

Could you please confirm if your child normally lives with you in the UK when not in hospital?

2026-01-19T17:10:15.609740 [actor]: UK resident yes child sent America treatment

2026-01-19T17:10:17.556665 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that you are a UK resident and your child has been sent to America for medical treatment.

For Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in hospital, this can still be allowed if certain conditions are met.

How long has your child been in hospital in America for treatment?

2026-01-19T17:10:18.361589 [actor]: 15 weeks specialist hospital rare condition

2026-01-19T17:10:20.987917 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand your child has been in a specialist hospital in America for 15 weeks due to a rare condition.

Based on the UK government guidelines, if your child is temporarily away from home because they're in hospital or receiving medical treatment, you can still qualify for Child Benefit. There isn't a specific time limit mentioned for medical treatment abroad in the guidance.

Is the hospital stay expected to be temporary, with plans for your child to return to the UK once treatment is complete?

2026-01-19T17:10:22.260997 [actor]: Yes return after treatment paying costs visit when possible

2026-01-19T17:10:24.468904 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand your child will return to the UK after completing their treatment, and you're paying costs to visit them when possible.

This is helpful information. Since your child is temporarily in hospital abroad for medical treatment and will return to live with you in the UK afterward, you would generally remain eligible for Child Benefit during this period.

Are you the person who normally has responsibility for your child when they're not in hospital?

2026-01-19T17:10:25.458244 [actor]: I'm mother primary caregiver yes pay incidental costs for him

2026-01-19T17:10:27.677060 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are the mother and primary caregiver who pays incidental costs for your child.

Based on the information you've provided, as a UK resident who is the primary caregiver for your child who is temporarily receiving medical treatment abroad but will return to your care in the UK, you would typically remain eligible for Child Benefit during this period of hospitalization.

Is there anything specific about your income or tax situation that you're concerned might affect your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-19T17:10:28.658247 [actor]: Is benefit still paid while child abroad hospital 15 weeks?

2026-01-19T17:10:32.054754 [root_agent]: Thank you for your specific question. 

Based on the UK government guidelines, Child Benefit can continue to be paid while your child is temporarily abroad receiving medical treatment. The fact that your child is in hospital for medical treatment (rather than simply living abroad) means this is considered a temporary absence for necessary medical care.

There is no specific time limit mentioned in the guidance for how long a child can be abroad for medical treatment while still qualifying for Child Benefit. Since your child will return to your care in the UK after treatment and you remain responsible for them as their mother and primary caregiver, you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit during this 15-week hospital stay abroad.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit while your child is receiving treatment?

2026-01-19T17:10:34.097810 [actor]: Thank you for information about child benefit eligibility

2026-01-19T17:10:35.777345 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit can continue during a temporary absence for medical treatment abroad, as this scenario falls within the permitted circumstances for maintaining eligibility.
