2026-01-19T17:12:00.701092 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:12:01.566896 [actor]: child benefit tina one child

2026-01-19T17:12:03.293638 [root_agent]: I notice you've mentioned "child benefit tina one child" which seems to be providing some context. To properly assess eligibility for Child Benefit, I'll need to ask you some specific questions about your situation.

Do you have responsibility for a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:12:04.029312 [actor]: ella 8 years old

2026-01-19T17:12:05.622087 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand Ella is 8 years old.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to confirm: are you responsible for looking after Ella? By this I mean, do you live with her or are you her main carer?

2026-01-19T17:12:06.489204 [actor]: divorced husband has other child

2026-01-19T17:12:07.938224 [root_agent]: I understand that you're divorced and your husband has another child. Thank you for sharing that information.

To continue determining your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please confirm if Ella lives with you most of the time or if you're her main carer?

2026-01-19T17:12:08.672477 [actor]: ella lives with me

2026-01-19T17:12:10.124970 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Ella lives with you. That's important information for determining Child Benefit eligibility.

Next question: Does anyone else (such as Ella's father or another guardian) already claim Child Benefit for Ella?

2026-01-19T17:12:11.028221 [actor]: no claim myself husband claim sam

2026-01-19T17:12:12.734383 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that no one currently claims Child Benefit for Ella, but your husband claims Child Benefit for Sam (your other child).

My next question is: Are you a UK resident? This is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-19T17:12:13.546676 [actor]: uk citizen

2026-01-19T17:12:15.504122 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK citizen. That's helpful information.

Now, I need to ask about your income level: Do you (or a partner you live with) have an individual income over £50,000 per year? This is relevant because it affects whether the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply.

2026-01-19T17:12:16.321981 [actor]: no income under 50000

2026-01-19T17:12:18.789852 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your income is under £50,000. That means you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have responsibility for Ella who is 8 years old and lives with you
- No one else currently claims Child Benefit for her
- You are a UK citizen
- Your income is under £50,000

It appears you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ella. You can typically receive £24.00 per week for your first child.

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T17:12:19.718715 [actor]: so eligible for 26.05 eldest child rate?

2026-01-19T17:12:22.182896 [root_agent]: I need to correct myself. You're right to question the amount.

The current Child Benefit rates (as of 2024) are:
- £26.05 per week for your eldest or only child
- £17.25 per week for each additional child

Since Ella appears to be your only child living with you (as your husband claims for Sam), you would be eligible for the £26.05 weekly rate for Ella as your eldest/only child.

Thank you for prompting me to provide the correct, up-to-date figure.

2026-01-19T17:12:23.413727 [actor]: yes thank you eligible

2026-01-19T17:12:25.803930 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility and correctly stated I'm eligible for £26.05 weekly for Ella as my only/eldest child.
