2026-01-19T17:10:37.048157 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

Do you have any children living with you who are under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:10:37.948902 [actor]: germany posting with two kids 8 and 10

2026-01-19T17:10:39.450785 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify, are you currently living in Germany with your children who are 8 and 10 years old? I'm trying to understand if this is a UK armed forces posting or if you've moved to Germany for other reasons.

2026-01-19T17:10:40.158290 [actor]: military base in germany

2026-01-19T17:10:41.584141 [root_agent]: I understand you're on a military base in Germany. Thank you for that information.

Are you a UK armed forces member or a Crown servant posted overseas, or the spouse/civil partner of someone who is?

2026-01-19T17:10:42.419017 [actor]: major british army

2026-01-19T17:10:44.903435 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're a Major in the British Army posted to a military base in Germany with your children aged 8 and 10, you would likely be eligible for Child Benefit.

UK armed forces personnel posted overseas maintain their eligibility for Child Benefit as if they were still living in the UK. Your children are under 16 and living with you, which meets the basic eligibility criteria.

Would you like me to explain how to claim Child Benefit or provide any additional information about the benefit?

2026-01-19T17:10:45.826506 [actor]: wife and children live with me there

2026-01-19T17:10:48.682050 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your wife and children live with you on the military base in Germany.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You're a Major in the British Army posted to Germany
- Your children (aged 8 and 10) live with you and your wife at the military base
- As UK armed forces personnel posted overseas, you maintain your UK benefit entitlements

You are eligible for Child Benefit. UK armed forces families posted overseas are treated as if they're still living in the UK for benefit purposes.

Is there anything specific about Child Benefit that you'd like to know, such as how to make a claim or the current payment rates?

2026-01-19T17:10:51.103240 [actor]: I got the information needed. I'm eligible for child benefit because I'm in the British Armed Forces posted overseas with my family.

2026-01-19T17:10:52.493685 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. As a member of the British Armed Forces posted overseas with children living with them, they correctly identified that the person is eligible for Child Benefit as UK armed forces personnel posted overseas maintain their UK benefit entitlements.
