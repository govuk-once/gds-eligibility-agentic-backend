2026-01-19T17:23:49.726566 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your situation.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:23:51.210895 [actor]: I need to play the role of someone inquiring about child benefit eligibility. I'll follow the instructions to be obtuse, answer like I'm entering search terms, and not directly answer questions.

Leo 12 years old local authority care

2026-01-19T17:23:53.339836 [root_agent]: I notice you've mentioned that Leo is 12 years old and in local authority care. This is an important detail for determining Child Benefit eligibility.

If Leo is being looked after by a local authority (in care), this affects Child Benefit eligibility. Could you please clarify if you are paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit toward Leo's upkeep, even though he is in local authority care?

2026-01-19T17:23:54.273886 [actor]: Leo visits home weekends local authority care Saturday Sunday

2026-01-19T17:23:55.973830 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Leo is in local authority care during the week and visits home on weekends (Saturday and Sunday).

For Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in local authority care, your payment situation is important. Do you pay at least the equivalent of Child Benefit toward Leo's upkeep or maintenance?

2026-01-19T17:23:56.881106 [actor]: No payments local authority handles everything Saturday visits only

2026-01-19T17:23:59.740914 [root_agent]: I understand that Leo is in local authority care, the local authority handles all payments, and Leo only visits on Saturdays.

Based on this information, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Leo. When a child is being looked after by a local authority (in care), Child Benefit is typically not payable unless you're paying at least an amount equal to the Child Benefit rate toward the child's upkeep.

Since you've mentioned that the local authority handles everything financially and you're not making payments toward Leo's upkeep, you would not qualify for Child Benefit in this situation.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-19T17:24:00.684837 [actor]: Leo comes Saturday 10AM leaves Sunday 11AM every week

2026-01-19T17:24:03.161426 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those specific details about Leo's visits. I understand that Leo stays with you from Saturday 10AM until Sunday 11AM every week.

This additional information doesn't change the eligibility assessment. Since Leo is in local authority care and you're not contributing financially to his upkeep (as you mentioned the local authority handles everything), you would still not be eligible for Child Benefit for Leo.

Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in care requires that you contribute at least the equivalent of Child Benefit toward their maintenance, regardless of the regular visits.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-19T17:24:04.069748 [actor]: Leo stays home 25 hours weekly local authority care

2026-01-19T17:24:06.787410 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Leo stays with you for 25 hours weekly while being in local authority care for the remainder of the time.

Despite Leo spending this regular time with you each week, the key factor for Child Benefit eligibility in this situation remains the financial contribution. Since you previously mentioned that the local authority handles all payments and you don't make financial contributions toward Leo's upkeep, you would still not be eligible for Child Benefit.

For a child in local authority care, Child Benefit is only payable if you contribute at least an amount equal to the Child Benefit rate toward the child's maintenance, regardless of the number of hours they spend with you each week.

Would you like information about any other aspects of Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T17:24:07.757294 [actor]: Child benefit local authority care 24 hours home rule

2026-01-19T17:24:12.391558 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about a rule related to Child Benefit, local authority care, and children spending time at home.

There is indeed a specific provision regarding Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in local authority care but regularly spends time at home. If a child who is in local authority care regularly spends at least 24 hours (1 full day) with the person who would normally be eligible for Child Benefit, then that person might be able to claim Child Benefit for the weeks when these visits occur.

However, this is subject to certain conditions. The key points to consider are:
- The visits must be regular
- The visits must last for at least 24 continuous hours
- The person claiming must still be responsible for the child during these visits

If Leo regularly spends 25 hours with you each weekend (as you mentioned earlier), and this is a continuous period of at least 24 hours, you may be eligible for Child Benefit for the weeks when these visits happen, even if you're not contributing financially to his upkeep while he's in care.

Would you like me to provide more details about this specific situation?

2026-01-19T17:24:13.582202 [actor]: Yes eligible thank you

2026-01-19T17:24:16.542060 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent initially correctly stated I was ineligible, but then incorrectly reversed their determination by stating I might be eligible based on the 24-hour home visits, without considering that these visits must be continuous 24 hours, not split across two days.
