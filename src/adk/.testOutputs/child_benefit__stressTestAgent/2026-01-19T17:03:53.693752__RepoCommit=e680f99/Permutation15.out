2026-01-19T17:09:43.599786 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. Let me ask you questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:09:44.571021 [actor]: child benefit emma daughter 12 years old

2026-01-19T17:09:45.933314 [root_agent]: I'll help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit for your 12-year-old daughter Emma.

Does Emma live with you? Or do you pay money toward caring for her?

2026-01-19T17:09:46.860106 [actor]: emma lives with mother send money sometimes birthday present

2026-01-19T17:09:49.574004 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since Emma lives with her mother and you only send money occasionally for birthday presents rather than regular child maintenance, it appears you wouldn't be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma.

Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who has main responsibility for caring for the child, which in this case would be Emma's mother. The person who the child lives with most of the time is usually considered to have the main responsibility.

Would you like to know if there are any other circumstances that might affect eligibility for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T17:09:50.485466 [actor]: send her mother money every week for food £10

2026-01-19T17:09:56.043421 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you send £10 weekly to Emma's mother for food. 

This regular financial contribution is important information. However, for Child Benefit purposes, the main consideration is who has the primary responsibility for caring for Emma day-to-day.

Since Emma lives with her mother, her mother would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit. The weekly financial contribution you make is valuable support, but doesn't generally qualify you to claim Child Benefit directly if you're not the primary caregiver.

If you and Emma's mother disagree about who should receive Child Benefit, the decision would be based on factors like who Emma lives with most of the time, who pays for most of her day-to-day needs, and who has the main responsibility for her.

Do you have any form of shared care arrangement or parental responsibility for Emma?

2026-01-19T17:09:56.859855 [actor]: mother not claim benefit

2026-01-19T17:09:59.358303 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Emma's mother is not claiming Child Benefit.

This is important information. If Emma lives with her mother but her mother is not claiming Child Benefit, you might be able to claim it if you can demonstrate that you're contributing to Emma's upbringing through your weekly financial support.

To clarify your situation further, may I ask if you have parental responsibility for Emma? For example, are you listed as a parent on her birth certificate or do you have any formal custody or care arrangements?

2026-01-19T17:10:00.293221 [actor]: birth certificate dad yes

2026-01-19T17:10:03.635544 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you're listed as Emma's father on her birth certificate, which means you do have parental responsibility.

Since you are Emma's father with parental responsibility, you regularly contribute financially to her care (£10 weekly for food), and her mother is not claiming Child Benefit, you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma.

To make a claim, you would need to:
- Show that you're contributing to Emma's upkeep
- Explain that the other parent isn't claiming the benefit

However, I should note that if Emma's mother starts claiming Child Benefit in the future, only one of you can receive it. The decision on who receives it would then be based on who has the main responsibility for Emma.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T17:10:06.573557 [actor]: I understand that I'm not eligible to receive Child Benefit for Emma. Since I only contribute £10 per week toward her care, which is less than the Child Benefit rate of £26.05 per week for an eldest child, I don't meet the minimum contribution requirement. Even though Emma's mother isn't claiming the benefit and I'm listed on the birth certificate, my financial contribution isn't enough to qualify me as "responsible" for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-19T17:10:09.270165 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent initially stated I was not eligible, then changed to saying I may be eligible, which contradicts UK guidelines that require the person to be primarily responsible for the child to claim Child Benefit.
