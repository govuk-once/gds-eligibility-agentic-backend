2026-01-19T17:24:46.978387 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T17:24:48.070792 [actor]: child benefit for my son

2026-01-19T17:24:49.387978 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit for your son, I need to understand your situation better.

How old is your son?

2026-01-19T17:24:50.245324 [actor]: he's 7

2026-01-19T17:24:51.412670 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son is 7 years old, he falls within the age range for Child Benefit eligibility.

Is your son living with you?

2026-01-19T17:24:52.217432 [actor]: yes home with me

2026-01-19T17:24:53.453863 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son lives with you. 

Is your son in full-time education or approved training?

2026-01-19T17:24:54.172660 [actor]: school yes

2026-01-19T17:24:55.573685 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son is in school.

Are you responsible for raising your son? (This typically means you're the main person looking after him and providing for his needs)

2026-01-19T17:24:56.309419 [actor]: yes i look after him

2026-01-19T17:24:57.424040 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're responsible for looking after your son.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-19T17:24:58.150516 [actor]: no job now

2026-01-19T17:25:01.549927 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Based on what you've told me, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit because:

- You have a 7-year-old son who lives with you
- Your son is in school (full-time education)
- You are responsible for raising him
- Your income is below the £50,000 threshold

Since you meet these basic eligibility criteria, you could apply for Child Benefit. The standard rate for your eldest or only child is £25.60 per week (current rate).

To apply, you would need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T17:25:02.194333 [actor]: pre settled status

2026-01-19T17:25:03.922456 [root_agent]: Thank you for mentioning that you have pre-settled status. This is an important consideration for Child Benefit eligibility.

Do you have the right to reside in the UK? Pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme typically grants you the right to reside, but I want to confirm your specific situation.

2026-01-19T17:25:04.776347 [actor]: jobseeker 95 days no job offer

2026-01-19T17:25:09.311154 [root_agent]: I understand you're currently a jobseeker and have been without a job for 95 days with no job offer yet.

This is an important detail regarding your right to reside in the UK with pre-settled status. Under current rules, EU citizens with pre-settled status need to be exercising their EU treaty rights to maintain a qualifying right to reside for benefit purposes.

As a jobseeker with pre-settled status, there are time limitations on how long you can retain your right to reside for benefit purposes. Typically, you need to show you have a genuine chance of finding work, but there are often time limits to how long you can claim benefits as a jobseeker.

Given the complexity of your situation with pre-settled status and being a jobseeker for 95 days, you may face additional eligibility considerations for Child Benefit. 

Have you previously been working in the UK before becoming unemployed?

2026-01-19T17:25:10.017515 [actor]: was working before unemployed now

2026-01-19T17:25:14.259402 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you were working in the UK before becoming unemployed, this could affect your right to reside status positively.

For EU citizens with pre-settled status who have previously worked in the UK, you may retain your worker status for a period after becoming unemployed, which could help maintain your right to reside for benefit purposes.

Given the complexity of your situation (pre-settled status, previous employment, and current jobseeker status for 95 days), I recommend you:

1. Apply for Child Benefit if you haven't already, as you meet the basic eligibility criteria for having a child in your care
2. Contact the Citizens Advice Bureau or a welfare rights advisor who specializes in EU citizens' rights for personalized advice on your specific circumstances
3. Be prepared to provide evidence of your previous employment and your ongoing efforts to find work

Your eligibility may depend on whether you're considered to have retained worker status or have another qualifying right to reside under the EU Settlement Scheme.

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit or where to seek further advice on your specific situation?

2026-01-19T17:25:15.217521 [actor]: am i eligible yes or no

2026-01-19T17:25:19.383650 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, I need to be straightforward about your eligibility:

Your eligibility is uncertain and depends on your specific right to reside status.

While you meet the basic criteria for Child Benefit (having a 7-year-old child living with you who you're responsible for), your pre-settled status combined with being unemployed for 95 days creates complications.

With pre-settled status, your right to access benefits like Child Benefit depends on whether you have a "qualifying right to reside." Your previous work history may allow you to retain worker status temporarily after becoming unemployed, but this is time-limited.

Without knowing the full details of your previous employment (how long you worked, whether it was genuine and effective work) and your current jobseeking activities, I cannot give you a definitive yes or no answer.

I would recommend applying for Child Benefit and letting the authorities make the final determination based on your complete circumstances.

2026-01-19T17:25:23.066395 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly stated that eligibility is uncertain due to the complexities of pre-settled status and jobseeker status after 95 days without work, which requires assessment of retained worker status and qualifying right to reside.
