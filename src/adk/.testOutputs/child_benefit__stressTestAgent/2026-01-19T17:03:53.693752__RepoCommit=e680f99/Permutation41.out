2026-01-19T17:22:47.215604 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess this.

Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T17:22:48.267149 [actor]: child benefit two kids don't live with me pay money every week

2026-01-19T17:22:49.569650 [root_agent]: I understand that you have two children who don't live with you, and you pay money for them every week.

Do these children live with another person who receives Child Benefit for them currently?

2026-01-19T17:22:50.577205 [actor]: ex partner has them give money weekly

2026-01-19T17:22:52.719850 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand your ex-partner has custody of your children and you provide financial support weekly.

Are you contributing at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate to your children's upkeep? (The current rates are £24.00 per week for the eldest or only child, and £15.90 per week for each additional child)

2026-01-19T17:22:53.578656 [actor]: pay 40 pounds weekly kids 10 and 8

2026-01-19T17:22:57.135890 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You pay £40 weekly for your two children aged 10 and 8, which is more than the Child Benefit rates.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you wouldn't be eligible to claim Child Benefit directly since:

1. Your children don't live with you (they live with your ex-partner)
2. Your ex-partner likely already receives Child Benefit as the person with whom the children live

When children live with someone else, generally the person they live with (in this case, your ex-partner) is the one eligible to receive Child Benefit.

The fact that you're making regular financial contributions to your children's upkeep is commendable, but it doesn't make you eligible to receive Child Benefit while they live with your ex-partner.

Would you like to know about any other support options that might be available to you as a non-resident parent?

2026-01-19T17:22:59.470703 [actor]: I need to understand how this affects me. So I don't get any money even though I pay support? money tight need help

2026-01-19T17:23:01.766118 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent provided incorrect information about non-resident parents' eligibility for Child Benefit. According to gov.uk guidance, a non-resident parent who contributes at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount to their child's upkeep CAN claim Child Benefit, even if another person is already claiming it, if they can prove they're contributing financially at least the equivalent amount.
