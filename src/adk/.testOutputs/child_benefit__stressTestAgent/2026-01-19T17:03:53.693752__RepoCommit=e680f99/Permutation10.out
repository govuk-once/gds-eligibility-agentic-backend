2026-01-19T17:07:51.414850 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T17:07:52.286158 [actor]: foster child 12

2026-01-19T17:07:53.236448 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify, are you a foster carer for a 12-year-old child?

2026-01-19T17:07:53.916882 [actor]: yes

2026-01-19T17:07:55.799897 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. 

Based on UK government guidance, foster carers typically cannot claim Child Benefit for foster children. This is because local authorities usually provide a fostering allowance that covers the costs of caring for a foster child.

Let me ask my next question: Do you receive payments from a local authority or health and social services trust for fostering this child?

2026-01-19T17:07:56.505189 [actor]: council pays money

2026-01-19T17:07:59.909977 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you receive payments from the council for fostering this child.

Based on the UK government rules, you are not eligible for Child Benefit for your foster child. This is because foster carers who receive payments from a local authority (council) for looking after a foster child cannot claim Child Benefit for that child.

The fostering allowance you receive from the council is intended to cover the costs of caring for the child, which is what Child Benefit would otherwise help with.

If your circumstances change in the future, such as if you were to adopt the child or if your fostering arrangement changes, your eligibility for Child Benefit might change as well.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about support available to foster carers?

2026-01-19T17:08:02.985199 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed the foster carer that they cannot claim Child Benefit for foster children when receiving payments from a local authority.
