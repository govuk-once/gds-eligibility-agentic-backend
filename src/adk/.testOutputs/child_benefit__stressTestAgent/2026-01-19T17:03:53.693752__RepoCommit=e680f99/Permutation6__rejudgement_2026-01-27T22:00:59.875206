According to UK government rules, Child Benefit typically stops after 12 weeks of hospital stay, but continues if the parent regularly spends money on the child's upkeep. While the agent correctly identified the user was eligible, they incorrectly stated that Child Benefit continues "regardless of how long they stay there" without mentioning the 12-week rule and the exception that applies in this case.
