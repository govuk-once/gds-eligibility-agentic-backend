2026-01-19T17:18:40.404125 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To start with, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

Do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T17:18:41.957245 [actor]: As per your request, I'll role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility. I'll follow the instructions to be obtuse, answer indirectly, and speak as if entering search terms.

child benefit daughter university

2026-01-19T17:18:43.193788 [root_agent]: I notice your mention of a daughter at university. Let me ask more specifically:

How old is your daughter who is at university?

2026-01-19T17:18:44.104256 [actor]: daughter 18 years old started uni this year

2026-01-19T17:18:45.980167 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since your daughter is 18 and has started university this year, I need to understand more about her education situation.

Is your daughter in approved education, such as A levels, International Baccalaureate, NVQs up to level 3, or a university degree course?

2026-01-19T17:18:47.010659 [actor]: university degree three years bachelor living at home

2026-01-19T17:18:49.356329 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

So your daughter is 18, living at home with you, and studying for a three-year bachelor's degree at university. 

Based on this information, you may be eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit can continue for children under 20 who are in approved education, which includes university degree courses.

To confirm your eligibility completely, may I ask if you're responsible for your daughter? This typically means you're the person who provides for her day-to-day care.

2026-01-19T17:18:50.412656 [actor]: yes responsible daughter lives with me commute to university

2026-01-19T17:18:52.997373 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're responsible for your daughter and that she lives with you while commuting to university.

Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter because:
1. She's under 20 years old (she's 18)
2. She's in approved full-time education (university bachelor's degree)
3. She lives with you and you're responsible for her

There's one more important factor I should ask about. Do you (or your partner, if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T17:18:53.862120 [actor]: income less than that amount

2026-01-19T17:18:58.086810 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your income is less than £60,000 per year.

Based on all the information you've provided, you are eligible for the full Child Benefit payment for your daughter who is:
- 18 years old
- Living at home with you
- In approved education (university bachelor's degree)
- Under your responsibility
- And your income is below £60,000 per year

If your income (or your partner's, if applicable) is between £50,000 and £60,000 per year, you would still receive Child Benefit but would need to pay back a portion of it through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

If you haven't already applied, you can claim Child Benefit by filling out the CH2 form available on the GOV.UK website. If you're already receiving Child Benefit and it stopped when your daughter turned 18 or left school, you should contact the Child Benefit Office to extend your claim since she's continuing in approved education.

2026-01-19T17:19:01.618274 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for an 18-year-old university student living at home, correctly explaining that the parent is eligible since the child is under 20, in approved education, and living at home under the parent's responsibility.
