2026-01-19T17:07:30.392307 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To start with, let me ask you:

Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T17:07:31.367293 [actor]: Hans child live with me need money benefits

2026-01-19T17:07:32.834378 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. I'll need to ask a few more questions to determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Is the child you mentioned under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:07:33.609539 [actor]: 5 year old son

2026-01-19T17:07:35.051678 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a 5-year-old son living with you.

May I ask if you're responsible for raising this child? By this I mean, do you provide for their day-to-day care and needs?

2026-01-19T17:07:35.897837 [actor]: I take care hans everyday

2026-01-19T17:07:37.242418 [root_agent]: I understand that you take care of Hans every day. Thank you for that information.

May I ask if you or anyone in your household has an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T17:07:37.985020 [actor]: no job looking for work

2026-01-19T17:07:39.374328 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you're currently looking for work.

Are you a UK resident or considered to be living in the UK for tax purposes?

2026-01-19T17:07:40.262969 [actor]: german live uk jobseeker

2026-01-19T17:07:41.658373 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're from Germany but living in the UK as a jobseeker.

Do you have the right to reside in the UK, or have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme?

2026-01-19T17:07:42.420441 [actor]: pre settled status

2026-01-19T17:07:46.099286 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you have pre-settled status.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have a 5-year-old son (Hans) who lives with you
- You provide day-to-day care for him
- You have pre-settled status in the UK
- Your income is below the £60,000 threshold

It appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit. Pre-settled status typically grants you access to benefits like Child Benefit if you're also "exercising treaty rights" (which can include looking for work as a jobseeker).

To apply for Child Benefit, you would need to complete form CH2 and send it to the Child Benefit Office along with your child's birth certificate. You can find this form on the GOV.UK website.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit that you're curious about?

2026-01-19T17:07:49.770053 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately concluded that with a 5-year-old son living with them, pre-settled status, and income below the threshold, the person would be eligible for Child Benefit.
