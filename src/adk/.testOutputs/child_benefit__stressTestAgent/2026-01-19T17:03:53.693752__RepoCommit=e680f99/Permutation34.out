2026-01-19T17:19:53.993879 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T17:19:56.614787 [root_agent]: I notice you've mentioned something about detention, custody, and youth. To properly assess your Child Benefit eligibility situation, I need to understand more clearly.

Is your question about a child who is currently in detention or youth custody? Or could you please clarify what you meant by your response?

2026-01-19T17:19:57.324862 [actor]: son in youth custody already 10 weeks

2026-01-19T17:19:59.809598 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that your son has been in youth custody for 10 weeks already.

This information is relevant to your Child Benefit eligibility. If a child is in custody, Child Benefit can usually continue for up to 8 weeks after they enter detention. Since you mentioned it's been 10 weeks, this means your Child Benefit payments for this child would typically stop.

May I ask if you have any other children living with you for whom you might be claiming Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T17:20:04.093536 [root_agent]: I understand that your son Mark, who is 15 years old, has received a six-month sentence and you used to receive Child Benefit for him.

Based on UK government rules, Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks when a child enters detention or youth custody. Since Mark has been in custody for 10 weeks already (which is beyond the 8-week period), you would not currently be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him.

The payments would normally resume when he returns to live with you after his sentence is complete, and you can reclaim at that time.

Would you like me to provide information about what you should do when Mark is released regarding your Child Benefit claim?

2026-01-19T17:20:07.423857 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately stated that Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks when a child enters detention or youth custody, and since the son had been in custody for 10 weeks, the parent would not be eligible.
