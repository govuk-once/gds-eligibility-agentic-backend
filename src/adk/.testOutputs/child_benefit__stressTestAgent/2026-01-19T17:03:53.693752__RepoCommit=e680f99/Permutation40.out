2026-01-19T17:22:27.841803 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you a few questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:22:28.730031 [actor]: Simon mental hospital 15

2026-01-19T17:22:30.849023 [root_agent]: I notice your response mentions "Simon mental hospital 15." I'm trying to understand your situation better to assess Child Benefit eligibility.

Are you asking about a 15-year-old named Simon who is in a mental hospital? If so, are you responsible for this child?

2026-01-19T17:22:31.780140 [actor]: Yes Simon son secure psychiatric unit 10 weeks mental health act

2026-01-19T17:22:34.104433 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that Simon is your 15-year-old son who has been in a secure psychiatric unit under the Mental Health Act for 10 weeks.

For Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in hospital: If your child is in hospital or residential care, you can usually continue to get Child Benefit for a limited period.

How long is Simon expected to stay in the psychiatric unit? This information will help me determine if you remain eligible for Child Benefit.

2026-01-19T17:22:35.093109 [actor]: Not sure how long total stay will be doctors say maybe few more weeks

2026-01-19T17:22:37.987608 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on UK government guidelines, if your child is temporarily in hospital (including a psychiatric unit), you can usually continue to receive Child Benefit as long as you're still supporting them and maintaining contact.

Since Simon has been in the psychiatric unit for 10 weeks with potentially a few more weeks to go, this would generally be considered a temporary stay, and you would likely remain eligible for Child Benefit during this period.

May I ask if you were receiving Child Benefit for Simon before he was admitted to the psychiatric unit?

2026-01-19T17:22:38.848711 [actor]: Yes was getting it before

2026-01-19T17:22:42.786704 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you were receiving Child Benefit for Simon before his admission to the psychiatric unit.

Based on the UK government guidelines, you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit while Simon is temporarily in the psychiatric unit, especially since you were already receiving it and the stay appears to be temporary (10 weeks with potentially a few more weeks).

When a child is in hospital, including psychiatric care under the Mental Health Act, parents generally remain eligible for Child Benefit as long as they maintain contact with the child and continue to incur costs in supporting them.

If Simon's stay becomes longer term (12 weeks or more), it would be advisable to inform the Child Benefit Office about his situation to ensure your payments continue correctly. 

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement during this time?

2026-01-19T17:22:45.994926 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit while their 15-year-old son is temporarily in a psychiatric unit, as long as they maintain contact and continue to support him.
