2026-01-29T12:40:57.099586 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:40:58.858368 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Tom, who's 17 years old. He's doing a computer coding course at the moment.

2026-01-29T12:41:01.370671 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is Tom's computer coding course an approved education or training course? (For example, is it full-time education at school, college, or an approved training program like an apprenticeship or traineeship?)**

2026-01-29T12:41:04.113289 [actor]: Well, it's a bit of a specific situation. Tom is doing a full-time computer coding course, but it's not like a regular college course. His future employer is actually paying for the course fees as part of an agreement that Tom will join them after he finishes. He's not being paid himself, but the employer covers the course costs.

2026-01-29T12:41:07.251662 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details. That's helpful context.

Let me ask you this:

**Does Tom receive a salary, wages, or any form of payment from this future employer while he's doing the course, or is he only receiving the benefit of having his course fees paid?**

(I'm asking because the type of arrangement and whether he's receiving payment can affect eligibility - if he's in approved full-time education or training and not earning, that would typically be different from being in paid employment.)

2026-01-29T12:41:09.304898 [actor]: No, Tom doesn't receive any salary or wages from the employer. He's not being paid at all - the only thing the employer is doing is paying for his course fees. Tom isn't earning anything himself during this time.

2026-01-29T12:41:11.542948 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now I need to understand more about the course itself:

**Is Tom's computer coding course full-time (meaning more than 12 hours per week of supervised study), and is it provided by a recognized educational institution such as a school, college, or registered training provider?**

2026-01-29T12:41:14.202982 [actor]: Yes, it's definitely full-time - more than 12 hours per week of supervised study. It is provided by a recognized training provider. But like I said, it's specifically set up through this agreement with his future employer - they arranged it and are paying for it as part of the deal that he'll work for them afterwards.

2026-01-29T12:41:16.547757 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's very helpful.

Let me now ask about your relationship with Tom:

**Do you live with Tom, and are you responsible for him? (By "responsible for," I mean are you the person who is primarily looking after him and meeting his everyday needs?)**

2026-01-29T12:41:20.079473 [actor]: Yes, I live with Tom and I'm responsible for him. I'm his parent and I look after him - provide his home, food, and all his everyday needs.

2026-01-29T12:41:22.308675 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your own circumstances:

**Do you normally live in the UK? (This means the UK is your main home, even if you travel abroad occasionally.)**

2026-01-29T12:41:23.869563 [actor]: Yes, I normally live in the UK. This is my main home.

2026-01-29T12:41:26.677835 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question:

**Are you the only person responsible for Tom, or does anyone else also have parental responsibility for him (such as another parent or guardian) who lives with him or contributes to his care?**

(I'm asking because if more than one person is responsible for Tom, only one of you can claim Child Benefit, though you can choose who claims it.)

2026-01-29T12:41:28.405554 [actor]: No, it's just me. I'm the only person responsible for Tom - there's no one else who has parental responsibility or contributes to his care.

2026-01-29T12:41:33.064709 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You have a child (Tom) who is 17 years old
2. ✓ Tom is in full-time approved education/training (more than 12 hours per week of supervised study at a recognized training provider)
3. ✓ Tom is not receiving wages or salary (the employer only pays his course fees)
4. ✓ You are responsible for Tom and he lives with you
5. ✓ You normally live in the UK
6. ✓ You are the only person responsible for Tom

The fact that Tom's future employer is paying for his course fees, as long as Tom himself is not receiving wages or a salary, should not disqualify him from being considered in approved education or training.

**You should be able to claim Child Benefit for Tom until he turns 20, or until he stops his approved education or training, whichever comes first.**

Would you like any further information about how to apply or anything else related to Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:41:34.954057 [actor]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know. I appreciate you taking the time to go through all of this with me.

2026-01-29T12:41:40.191154 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, a child aged 16-19 can only count for Child Benefit if they are in approved full-time non-advanced education or approved training, which specifically excludes courses where the employer pays the fees as part of an employment agreement. Since Tom's course fees are being paid by his future employer as part of an agreement that he will work for them afterwards, this represents an employment-related arrangement that disqualifies the course from being considered "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.
