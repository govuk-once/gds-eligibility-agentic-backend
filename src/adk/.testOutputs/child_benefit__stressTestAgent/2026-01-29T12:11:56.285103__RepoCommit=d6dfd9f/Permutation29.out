2026-01-29T12:28:25.930193 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 living with you?** 

(Or if they're aged 16-19, are they in approved education or training?)

2026-01-29T12:28:27.818486 [actor]: Hi, yes. My son Jordan is 17 and he lives with me. He finished his GCSEs last year.

2026-01-29T12:28:30.213386 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Is Jordan currently in approved education or training?** 

For example, is he:
- In full-time non-advanced education (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or equivalent)
- On an approved training course
- Or has he left education/training?

2026-01-29T12:28:31.962033 [actor]: No, he's not in college or any training program. He's not working either. He hasn't registered with any careers service or anything like that.

2026-01-29T12:28:34.678855 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Since Jordan is 17 and not in approved education or training, Child Benefit would typically stop. Child Benefit generally only continues for 16-19 year olds if they're in approved education or training.

However, let me ask another important question to get a complete picture:

**Are you responsible for any other children under the age of 16?**

2026-01-29T12:28:36.080097 [actor]: No, Jordan is my only child.

2026-01-29T12:28:39.949556 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me:

- Jordan is 17 years old
- He is not in approved education or training
- He is your only child

**I'm afraid you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** under current UK rules. Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 16, or for young people aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training. Since Jordan has finished his GCSEs and is not currently in college, sixth form, or an approved training program, he doesn't meet the criteria for the extension of Child Benefit beyond age 16.

If Jordan does decide to return to education or start an approved training course in the future, you may become eligible again at that point, so it would be worth checking back if his circumstances change.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or related support?

2026-01-29T12:28:45.911184 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because Jordan is 17, not in approved education or training, and Child Benefit only extends beyond age 16 for young people aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training.
