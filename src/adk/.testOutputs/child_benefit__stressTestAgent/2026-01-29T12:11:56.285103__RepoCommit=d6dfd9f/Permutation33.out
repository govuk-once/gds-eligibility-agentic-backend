2026-01-29T12:29:56.025557 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:29:57.849587 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Bella, who's 16. She lives with me and I'm responsible for her.

2026-01-29T12:29:59.974202 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Is Bella currently in approved education or training?**

This is important because children aged 16-19 can qualify for Child Benefit if they're in approved education or training.

2026-01-29T12:30:01.987165 [actor]: Yes, she is. She's started a training course to become a travel agent. It's fully paid for by a local travel agency that has employed her. It's not a standard government apprenticeship, but it's a proper training course through the agency.

2026-01-29T12:30:04.585676 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details about Bella's training course.

To determine if this training counts as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes, I need to ask:

**Is Bella's training course full-time (meaning more than 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience)?**

2026-01-29T12:30:06.550615 [actor]: Yes, it's full-time. She's there during normal working hours throughout the week, so it's definitely more than 12 hours per week.

2026-01-29T12:30:08.913366 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Now I need to understand your living situation with Bella:

**Do you live in the UK, and does Bella normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T12:30:11.159756 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK and Bella lives with me. She's my daughter and this is her home.

2026-01-29T12:30:13.773084 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your immigration status:

**Are you a UK citizen, or do you have the right to reside in the UK (for example, through settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits)?**

2026-01-29T12:30:15.279277 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK citizen.

2026-01-29T12:30:18.549738 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your income:

**Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual adjusted net income of £60,000 or more per year?**

This is important because if either of you earns £60,000 or more, you may still be able to claim Child Benefit, but some or all of it might need to be repaid through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-29T12:30:20.252974 [actor]: No, I don't have a partner and my income is below £60,000.

2026-01-29T12:30:22.883067 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

One final question to complete the assessment:

**Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Bella, or is anyone else receiving Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-29T12:30:24.543142 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Bella. It's just me - I'm her mother and she lives with me.

2026-01-29T12:30:28.527773 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Bella. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Bella, aged 16) who you're responsible for
✓ She's in full-time training (more than 12 hours per week)
✓ She normally lives with you in the UK
✓ You're a UK citizen
✓ Your income is below £60,000
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

Since Bella is 16 and in approved full-time education or training, she qualifies as a child for Child Benefit purposes (which can continue until she's 20 if she remains in approved education or training).

You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit. If you haven't already claimed, you can do so online or by post. 

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:30:34.474160 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. While Bella's training course is paid for by her employer (the travel agency), this means she is employed and earning a wage, not in approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes. According to gov.uk guidance, approved education/training for 16-19 year olds excludes paid employment or employer-funded training where the young person receives wages. The agent failed to ask whether Bella is being paid/employed, which is a critical eligibility factor.
