2026-01-29T12:39:24.294854 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T12:39:26.279648 [actor]: Yes, I have a child, but I don't live with them. I pay £50 a week for their maintenance, but only because there's a court order that makes me do it. I don't think I should be eligible because it's not like I'm doing it voluntarily - the court is forcing me to pay.

2026-01-29T12:39:30.507108 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your situation - you have a child you don't live with, and you're making maintenance payments due to a court order.

Let me ask you an important follow-up question: Do you contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate (which is currently around £25 per week for the eldest or only child, and approximately £16.50 per week for each additional child) towards the cost of looking after your child?

In your case, you mentioned paying £50 per week in maintenance. To clarify further: Is this payment going towards supporting your child's upbringing and care?

2026-01-29T12:39:33.000317 [actor]: Yes, the £50 a week goes towards supporting my child - it's for their care and upbringing. But like I said, I'm only paying it because the court order requires me to. Does it even count if I'm being forced to pay it rather than choosing to pay it voluntarily?

2026-01-29T12:39:35.345734 [root_agent]: That's a very good question, and I appreciate you being clear about the circumstances.

Let me ask you this: Besides the £50 weekly maintenance payment you're making under the court order, do you provide any other financial support or contributions towards your child's care - for example, paying for clothing, school costs, activities, or other expenses directly?

2026-01-29T12:39:37.573637 [actor]: No, I don't provide anything else beyond the £50 a week that the court order requires. That's all I pay - nothing extra, no clothing, school costs, or anything like that. Just the £50 maintenance that I'm legally obligated to pay.

2026-01-29T12:39:39.915121 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. 

Now, let me ask you: Does your child live with someone else who is responsible for them - such as the other parent, a guardian, or another family member who is their main carer?

2026-01-29T12:39:43.262205 [actor]: Yes, my child lives with their other parent. They're the main carer - they look after the child full-time and are responsible for them day-to-day.

2026-01-29T12:39:45.086900 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask one more important question:

Is the other parent (who your child lives with) currently claiming Child Benefit for your child?

2026-01-29T12:39:46.937894 [actor]: I'm not sure, to be honest. I don't know if they're claiming Child Benefit or not. Does that affect whether I can claim it?

2026-01-29T12:39:52.352043 [root_agent]: That's an important question. Let me explain the situation based on what you've told me.

**You would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit in your circumstances.** Here's why:

1. **Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child** - typically the person the child lives with and who is responsible for them.

2. **Your child lives with their other parent**, who is their main carer and responsible for them day-to-day.

3. While you are contributing financially through the £50 weekly maintenance payments, **the other parent (who the child lives with) has priority for claiming Child Benefit** as they are the primary carer.

4. Even though you're paying maintenance (whether voluntarily or under a court order), this doesn't qualify you to claim Child Benefit when someone else is the main carer and your child lives with them.

The other parent would be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit if they choose to do so. If they're not currently claiming it, they may wish to apply, as they appear to meet the eligibility criteria.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T12:39:55.321302 [actor]: Oh, I see. So even though I'm paying £50 a week, because my child doesn't live with me and lives with their other parent instead, I can't claim it. That makes sense - the person who's actually looking after the child day-to-day would be the one eligible, not me. 

No, I think you've explained it clearly. Thanks for helping me understand that.

2026-01-29T12:39:59.049689 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because the child lives with the other parent who is the main carer, and only one person can claim Child Benefit per child - specifically the person with primary care responsibility.
