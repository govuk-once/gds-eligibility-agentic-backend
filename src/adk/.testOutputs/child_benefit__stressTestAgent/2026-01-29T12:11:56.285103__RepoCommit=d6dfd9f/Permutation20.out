2026-01-29T12:23:07.794117 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:23:09.615495 [actor]: Yes, I do. I look after my granddaughter Lucia - she's 14 years old and lives with me. Her parents aren't able to care for her, so I've been taking care of her and paying for everything she needs.

2026-01-29T12:23:11.713497 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's clear you're providing care for your granddaughter Lucia.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you receiving Child Benefit for Lucia from anyone else, or is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-29T12:23:13.714614 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for her. Her parents don't contribute anything financially and they're not claiming any benefits for her. It's just me looking after her and paying for everything.

2026-01-29T12:23:15.982322 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now I need to ask:

**Do you normally live in the UK?** (This means the UK is your main home where you usually live)

2026-01-29T12:23:17.500460 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. This is my home and where I've been raising Lucia.

2026-01-29T12:23:19.334756 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question:

**Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on your right to remain in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:23:21.028990 [actor]: No, there are no immigration restrictions. I have the right to be here and there are no controls or restrictions on me.

2026-01-29T12:23:23.431403 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more question:

**Is Lucia currently living with you full-time, or does she spend significant time living with anyone else (such as in hospital, residential care, or with another family member)?**

2026-01-29T12:23:25.515156 [actor]: She lives with me full-time. It's just the two of us - she doesn't live anywhere else or spend time in any hospital or care facility. She's with me all the time.

2026-01-29T12:23:29.683571 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your granddaughter Lucia.

Here's why:
- You are responsible for Lucia, who is 14 years old (under 16)
- She lives with you full-time
- You are paying for her upbringing
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
- You normally live in the UK
- You have no immigration restrictions

As her grandparent and main carer, you can claim Child Benefit even though you're not her parent. The key factors are that you're responsible for her and she lives with you.

**You can now apply for Child Benefit for Lucia.** You'll need to make a claim to HMRC, and you may need to provide evidence that Lucia lives with you if requested.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the claiming process?

2026-01-29T12:23:32.881286 [actor]: Oh, that's wonderful news! Thank you so much for explaining that to me. I wasn't sure if I could claim since I'm her grandmother and not her parent, but it's such a relief to know I'm eligible. The extra help would really make a difference for us.

I think I have all the information I need for now. I'll look into making the claim to HMRC. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T12:23:37.899957 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that as a grandparent providing full-time care for a 14-year-old child, with no one else claiming benefits and no immigration restrictions, I am eligible for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."
