2026-01-29T12:32:51.291514 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T12:32:53.725001 [actor]: Yes, I am. My partner and I just had a baby 4 months ago. We've been so busy with everything that I'm only just getting around to filling in the form now. Will I still get the money for the past 4 months?

2026-01-29T12:32:56.863480 [root_agent]: Congratulations on your new baby!

Yes, you can backdate your Child Benefit claim, but there are limits to how far back you can go. You can usually claim Child Benefit for up to 3 months before the date you make your claim.

Since your baby is 4 months old and you're applying now, you would likely receive payment for the past 3 months, but not for the full 4 months.

Now, to continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:32:59.881496 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. So just to make sure I understand - I'll lose out on one month's worth of benefit then, because I'm claiming at 4 months instead of within 3 months?

2026-01-29T12:33:02.507929 [root_agent]: That's correct - unfortunately, you would miss out on approximately one month's worth of Child Benefit because you're claiming at 4 months rather than within the 3-month backdating window.

However, let me continue to check your eligibility so we can ensure you receive the benefit going forward.

**Are you or your partner receiving Child Benefit for this baby from another country (such as an EEA country or Switzerland)?**

2026-01-29T12:33:04.791611 [actor]: No, we're not receiving any child benefit from another country. It's just us here in the UK with our baby.

2026-01-29T12:33:07.230899 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask: **Do you or your partner earn over £50,000 a year, or do you expect to earn over £50,000 in this tax year?**

(This is important because it may affect whether you need to pay a tax charge, though you can still claim Child Benefit regardless of your income.)

2026-01-29T12:33:09.622542 [actor]: My partner earns about £55,000 a year. Does that mean we can't get Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:33:15.106461 [root_agent]: You can still claim Child Benefit even though your partner earns £55,000 a year. However, because their income is over £50,000, you would need to be aware of the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Here's how it works:
- You can still **receive** Child Benefit payments
- However, the higher earner between you and your partner would need to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the tax system via a Self Assessment tax return
- The charge is 1% of the Child Benefit for every £100 earned over £50,000
- At £60,000 or more, the charge equals 100% of the Child Benefit received

Alternatively, you could choose **not to receive the payments** but still register for Child Benefit, which protects your National Insurance credits (important for your State Pension) and your child's National Insurance number will be issued automatically.

Before we finalize your eligibility assessment, let me ask: **Are you the person mainly responsible for your child, or does your child live with someone else who is mainly responsible for them?**

2026-01-29T12:33:16.995670 [actor]: No, my partner and I are the ones looking after our baby. We're the main ones responsible - the baby lives with us.

2026-01-29T12:33:21.979601 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's a summary:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 4-month-old baby)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You're not receiving child benefit from another country
✓ You are mainly responsible for your child who lives with you

**Important points to remember:**

1. You can claim and will be able to backdate for approximately 3 months (missing out on about 1 month since your baby is now 4 months old)

2. Because your partner earns £55,000, they will need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge through Self Assessment - this would be approximately 50% of the Child Benefit you receive

3. You have two options:
   - **Receive the payments** and your partner pays back around 50% through their tax return, OR
   - **Don't receive the payments** but still register to protect your National Insurance credits for State Pension purposes

Either way, I'd recommend registering for Child Benefit to ensure your child gets their National Insurance number and you maintain your NI credits.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:33:24.786683 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you. I understand now - we're eligible but will need to pay back about half because of my partner's income, and we've missed out on one month because we're claiming late. I'll get the form filled in right away. Thanks for your help!

2026-01-29T12:33:28.669257 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the claimant is eligible for Child Benefit but can only backdate the claim for 3 months (losing the first month due to the 4-month delay), which matches the expected outcome, and correctly explained the High Income Child Benefit Charge that would apply due to the partner's £55,000 income.
