2026-01-29T12:30:36.713910 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:30:38.377246 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Mark - he's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T12:30:40.046067 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:30:41.337857 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T12:30:44.152122 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Next question:

**Does your son Mark live with you, or if he doesn't live with you full-time, are you the main person responsible for him (meaning you're contributing at least the same amount as anyone else towards his upkeep)?**

2026-01-29T12:30:45.656743 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me at the moment. He's actually in a youth custody center - he's been there for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-29T12:30:47.766202 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this must be a difficult situation.

Let me ask an important follow-up question:

**Before Mark went into the youth custody center, did he live with you and were you claiming Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-29T12:30:49.354568 [actor]: Yes, that's right. He lived with me before and I was claiming Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-29T12:30:51.180367 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

I need to ask one more question about this:

**Has Mark been in the youth custody center for more than 8 weeks continuously, or will he be staying there for more than 8 weeks in total?**

2026-01-29T12:30:53.051146 [actor]: Yes, he's been there for 10 weeks now, so it's more than 8 weeks. He was sentenced to 6 months total.

2026-01-29T12:30:57.115499 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you of the following:

**You are no longer eligible to receive Child Benefit payments for Mark** while he remains in the youth custody center, because he has been there for more than 8 weeks continuously.

The rules state that Child Benefit stops if a child is in custody (such as a youth custody center or young offender institution) for more than 8 weeks.

However, **you can reclaim Child Benefit for Mark** when he is released from the youth custody center and returns to live with you.

**What you should do:**
- You should inform the Child Benefit Office that Mark is in custody so they can stop your payments
- When Mark is released, you can contact them again to restart your claim

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or this situation?

2026-01-29T12:31:00.246113 [actor]: No, that's clear. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T12:31:02.286128 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops when a child has been in youth custody for more than 8 weeks continuously, and correctly informed the user they are no longer eligible while the child remains in custody beyond this period.
