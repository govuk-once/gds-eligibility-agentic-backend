2026-01-29T12:11:58.644572 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 living with you, or a young person aged 16 to 19 who is in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T12:12:00.659751 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who's 8 years old and he lives with us.

2026-01-29T12:12:02.725395 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Are you responsible for your son? This means you're the one who looks after him and pays towards things like food, clothes, and housing.**

2026-01-29T12:12:04.673247 [actor]: Yes, I am. He lives with me and my husband, and we take care of all his needs - his food, clothes, school things, everything really.

2026-01-29T12:12:06.508496 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Next question: **Do you normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:12:08.140405 [actor]: Yes, we do. We live in Manchester.

2026-01-29T12:12:10.197996 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Does anyone else already claim Child Benefit for your son?** For example, does your husband claim it, or does anyone else such as an ex-partner or another family member?

2026-01-29T12:12:12.005666 [actor]: No, nobody is claiming it at the moment. Neither my husband nor anyone else has claimed Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-29T12:12:14.060550 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

One more important question: **Are you or your husband subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on your right to live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:12:16.123905 [actor]: No, we're both UK nationals, so there are no restrictions or immigration issues.

2026-01-29T12:12:19.734543 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 8-year-old son)
✓ He lives with you
✓ You're responsible for him (you pay for his food, clothes, and other needs)
✓ You normally live in the UK (Manchester)
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him
✓ You and your husband are UK nationals with no immigration restrictions

You meet all the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. You can apply for it, and only one person can claim for each child - so you would need to decide whether you or your husband will make the claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:12:22.087718 [actor]: Oh that's great, thank you! Just one thing - my husband earns £35,000 a year and I work part-time earning £15,000. Does that affect anything?

2026-01-29T12:12:26.581208 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed eligibility based on all criteria (child under 16, lives with claimant, responsible for child, UK resident, no existing claim, no immigration restrictions) and appropriately noted that the income question came after the eligibility determination was complete - income affects the High Income Child Benefit Charge but not eligibility itself.
