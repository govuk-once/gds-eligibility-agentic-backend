2026-01-29T12:22:34.456027 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have any children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T12:22:36.017765 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Holly. She's 9 years old.

2026-01-29T12:22:37.954866 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Do you live in the UK, and does Holly usually live with you?

2026-01-29T12:22:40.303334 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. Yes, I live in the UK. Holly doesn't live with me full-time though - she stays with me 3 days a week and with her mum Sue 4 days a week. We're separated, you see. I do contribute to Holly's care - I buy her clothes and food when she's with me.

2026-01-29T12:22:42.626868 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. This is an important detail.

In situations where a child doesn't live with one person all the time, only one person can receive Child Benefit for that child. 

Do you know if Sue (Holly's mum) is currently claiming Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-29T12:22:45.389907 [actor]: No, she's not claiming it yet. Actually, we've both submitted claims to HMRC because we couldn't agree on who should claim it. We both look after Holly and contribute to her costs, so we both thought we should be able to claim.

2026-01-29T12:22:49.063631 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is an important situation to understand.

When both parents submit claims and can't agree, HMRC has specific rules to determine who gets the Child Benefit. They look at who has the "main responsibility" for the child.

To help assess who might be considered to have main responsibility in your case, can you tell me: apart from the number of nights Holly stays with each of you, are there other ways you're involved in her day-to-day care? For example, do you take her to school, attend parent-teacher meetings, take her to doctor's appointments, or handle other aspects of her care?

2026-01-29T12:22:52.004378 [actor]: Well, Sue handles most of the school runs and doctor's appointments since Holly is with her during the week more often. I have Holly mainly on weekends. I make sure she's fed and clothed when she's with me, and we spend quality time together, but I suppose Sue does deal with more of the day-to-day stuff like school and medical appointments because of how the days work out.

2026-01-29T12:22:57.114623 [root_agent]: Thank you for being so honest about the arrangements.

Based on what you've told me, here's what I need to explain about your eligibility:

When parents can't agree and both make claims, HMRC determines who has "main responsibility" for the child. They consider factors like:
- Who the child lives with most of the time
- Who deals with the day-to-day care arrangements like school and medical appointments
- The overall pattern of care

From what you've described - with Holly staying with Sue 4 days a week, and Sue handling most of the school runs and medical appointments - it's likely that HMRC would determine that Sue has the main responsibility for Holly's day-to-day care.

This means that **Sue would likely be the person eligible to receive Child Benefit for Holly**, even though you absolutely do contribute to her care and she spends significant time with you.

However, HMRC will make the final decision based on all the information both you and Sue have provided in your claims. They will write to both of you to explain their decision.

Does this help clarify the situation for you?

2026-01-29T12:23:02.203562 [actor]: Yes, that does help. I understand now. So even though I've put in a claim, because Holly is with Sue more often and Sue handles most of the day-to-day things like school and doctors, HMRC will probably decide that Sue should get the Child Benefit. I suppose that makes sense, even if it's not what I was hoping for. Thanks for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T12:23:05.520430 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that when both parents claim Child Benefit and cannot agree, HMRC determines who has "main responsibility" based on factors like where the child lives most of the time and who handles day-to-day care, and correctly concluded that Sue (who has Holly 4 days per week and handles school/medical appointments) would likely be eligible while Pete would not be.
