2026-01-29T12:19:43.385159 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T12:19:44.984145 [actor]: Yes, I have a son, Noah. He's 6 years old.

2026-01-29T12:19:46.525271 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is Noah living with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T12:19:48.503997 [actor]: Well, actually, he's living with his grandmother right now. I had to have surgery recently and I'm recovering, so he's staying with her temporarily for about 6 weeks. It's just while I get back on my feet.

2026-01-29T12:19:50.620878 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. I understand Noah is staying with his grandmother temporarily while you recover.

During this time while Noah is with his grandmother, are you still contributing to the cost of raising him - for example, by providing at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay, or more?

2026-01-29T12:19:52.963725 [actor]: Yes, of course I am. I'm still paying for all his expenses - his clothes, school things, everything he needs. I'm his mum, I'm just recovering from surgery so he's staying with my mum for a bit, but I'm still supporting him financially.

2026-01-29T12:19:54.811229 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. That's helpful to know.

Before Noah went to stay with his grandmother temporarily, were you already receiving Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-29T12:19:56.390641 [actor]: Yes, I was already receiving Child Benefit for Noah before he went to stay with my mum.

2026-01-29T12:19:58.445115 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more question: Are you the person responsible for Noah - meaning you normally make the main decisions about his upbringing, welfare, and day-to-day care (even though he's temporarily staying with his grandmother while you recover)?

2026-01-29T12:20:00.360230 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm his mother and I make all the decisions about his upbringing, his schooling, his healthcare - everything. My mum is just helping out temporarily while I recover. I'm still fully responsible for him.

2026-01-29T12:20:04.437144 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, **you should remain eligible for Child Benefit** for Noah.

Here's why:

• You have a child under 16 (Noah, who is 6 years old)
• You are responsible for Noah - you make the decisions about his upbringing and welfare
• You are contributing financially to his upbringing (paying for his expenses)
• Noah is only staying with his grandmother **temporarily** while you recover from surgery (approximately 6 weeks)
• You were already receiving Child Benefit before this temporary arrangement

The temporary stay with his grandmother for medical recovery reasons should not affect your Child Benefit eligibility, as you remain responsible for Noah and continue to support him financially.

You should continue to receive your Child Benefit as normal during this recovery period. There's no need to notify HMRC about this short-term, temporary arrangement while you recover from surgery.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T12:20:06.978826 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you. I was worried I might lose it while he's staying with my mum, but I'm glad to know I can keep receiving it since it's only temporary and I'm still supporting him. That's a relief!

2026-01-29T12:20:11.771733 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that temporary care arrangements during medical recovery do not affect Child Benefit eligibility when the parent remains financially responsible and retains parental decision-making authority, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible."
