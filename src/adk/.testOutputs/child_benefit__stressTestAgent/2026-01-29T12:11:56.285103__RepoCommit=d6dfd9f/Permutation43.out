2026-01-29T12:36:31.762071 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child (or children) who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T12:36:33.541281 [actor]: Yes, I have a son who's 17. He's just started a Modern Apprenticeship here in Glasgow.

2026-01-29T12:36:36.248479 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. A Modern Apprenticeship can count as approved education or training.

To help me assess your eligibility further, I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for your son? By this I mean, does he normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards his upkeep if he lives elsewhere?**

2026-01-29T12:36:37.998446 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me here in Glasgow. I'm his father and he stays with me full-time.

2026-01-29T12:36:39.988739 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Next, I need to ask:

**Are you currently living in the UK, or are you a Crown servant (such as a diplomat or member of HM Forces) posted overseas?**

2026-01-29T12:36:41.666750 [actor]: Yes, I'm living in the UK - in Glasgow, Scotland.

2026-01-29T12:36:43.701047 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your current claim status:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your son? For example, his mother or another person?**

2026-01-29T12:36:45.253908 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for him. It's just me looking after him.

2026-01-29T12:36:48.166767 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you could be eligible for Child Benefit. However, I need to ask one more important question:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year?**

This is important because if either you or your partner earns over this amount, it may affect whether you should claim Child Benefit or whether you'd need to pay some or all of it back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-29T12:36:49.823040 [actor]: No, my income is under £60,000, and I don't have a partner - it's just me and my son.

2026-01-29T12:36:53.736666 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for providing all that information.

**Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:
- Your son is 17 and in a Modern Apprenticeship, which counts as approved education or training (eligible up to age 20)
- He lives with you, so you're responsible for him
- You live in the UK (Glasgow, Scotland)
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him
- Your income is under £60,000, so you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge

You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit for your son. If you haven't already claimed, you can do so and may be able to backdate your claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:36:57.271834 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you. I'll get on with making the claim then. Appreciate your help!

2026-01-29T12:36:59.798090 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, Modern Apprenticeships do not count as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes - only approved education or training at a recognised establishment qualifies, and apprenticeships are employment-based training that do not meet this criterion.
