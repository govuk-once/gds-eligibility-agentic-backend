2026-01-29T12:21:18.984445 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:21:20.989940 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have two children - they're 8 and 10 years old.

2026-01-29T12:21:23.025214 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know you have two children aged 8 and 10.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Do your children normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T12:21:24.517208 [actor]: Yes, they do. They live with me and my wife here on the base.

2026-01-29T12:21:27.411065 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. I notice you mentioned you live "on the base" - this suggests you might be in the armed forces or similar.

Let me ask you an important question:

**Are you or your wife normally living in the UK? Or if you're serving abroad with the armed forces or civil service, are you ordinarily resident in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:21:29.391999 [actor]: Well, no - we're not currently living in the UK. I'm Major Thompson, and I'm with the British Armed Forces. I'm posted to Germany at the moment, and my wife and children are living with me here on the base in Germany.

2026-01-29T12:21:32.541637 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Major Thompson.

Since you're serving abroad with the British Armed Forces, this is an important detail for your eligibility. Let me ask you:

**Are you and your family ordinarily resident in the UK - meaning is the UK your normal home that you plan to return to after your posting?**

(People serving abroad with HM Forces, including those posted overseas, can still be considered ordinarily resident in the UK even while living abroad.)

2026-01-29T12:21:35.090677 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. The UK is our normal home. We're only in Germany because of my posting - we plan to return to the UK when my posting ends. Britain is where we're from and where we'll go back to.

2026-01-29T12:21:37.023498 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Major Thompson.

Let me ask you one more important question:

**Are you or your wife responsible for the children - meaning do you pay for things like their food, clothing, and other living costs?**

2026-01-29T12:21:38.795447 [actor]: Yes, of course. My wife and I are responsible for our children. We pay for all their needs - their food, clothing, school supplies, everything they need.

2026-01-29T12:21:44.316260 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for providing all that information, Major Thompson.

Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ You have two children aged 8 and 10 (both under 16)
✓ The children live with you
✓ You and your wife are responsible for the children
✓ You are ordinarily resident in the UK (even though you're currently posted abroad with the British Armed Forces)

The key point here is that members of HM Forces serving abroad are treated as ordinarily resident in the UK for Child Benefit purposes, as long as the UK remains your normal home - which you've confirmed it is.

**You can claim Child Benefit for both of your children.**

One final thing to be aware of: If either you or your wife has an individual income over £60,000 a year, this may affect how much Child Benefit you receive through the High Income Child Benefit Charge, but you would still be eligible to claim it.

Would you like any further information about making a claim?

2026-01-29T12:21:48.051436 [actor]: That's very helpful, thank you. I understand now that I'm eligible for Child Benefit even though we're currently stationed in Germany. I appreciate you explaining that about the High Income Child Benefit Charge as well - I'll look into that. Thanks for your help!

2026-01-29T12:21:50.457148 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Major Thompson is eligible for Child Benefit because he has children under 16 living with him, he is responsible for them, and as a member of HM Forces serving abroad, he is considered ordinarily resident in the UK, which is a correct application of the rules for armed forces personnel posted overseas.
