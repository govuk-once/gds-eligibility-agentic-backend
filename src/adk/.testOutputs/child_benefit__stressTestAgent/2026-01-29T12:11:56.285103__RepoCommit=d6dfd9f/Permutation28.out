2026-01-29T12:28:06.385143 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking you: **Do you have a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:28:08.037559 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a 5-year-old son who is with me.

2026-01-29T12:28:09.575886 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:28:11.449136 [actor]: Yes, I'm currently in the UK. I'm visiting from the United States on a tourist visa - I have a 6-month visitor visa. My son came with me.

2026-01-29T12:28:13.749741 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

**Are you ordinarily resident in the UK, meaning is the UK your main home where you normally live, or is this just a temporary visit?**

2026-01-29T12:28:15.352073 [actor]: This is just a temporary visit. The UK is not my main home - I normally live in the United States. I'm just here visiting on my tourist visa.

2026-01-29T12:28:18.279907 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that.

Based on the information you've provided, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit**. 

One of the key eligibility criteria is that you must be ordinarily resident in the UK - meaning the UK must be your main home where you normally live. Since you're visiting temporarily on a tourist visa and your main home is in the United States, you don't meet this requirement.

Child Benefit is intended for people who are settled and living in the UK as their primary residence.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or any other questions I can help with?

2026-01-29T12:28:23.514805 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because they are not ordinarily resident in the UK, as they are only temporarily visiting on a tourist visa with their main residence being in the United States.
