2026-01-29T12:25:55.782191 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking you: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:25:57.355105 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Leo, he's 5 years old.

2026-01-29T12:26:00.436636 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

My next question is: **Does Leo normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T12:26:02.401021 [actor]: Well, no, not at the moment. He's been in local authority care for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-29T12:26:04.691414 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this may be a difficult situation.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Is Leo expected to be in local authority care for more than 8 weeks in total, or has the arrangement already lasted longer than 8 weeks?**

2026-01-29T12:26:06.643231 [actor]: Yes, it's already been 10 weeks, so it's lasted longer than 8 weeks.

2026-01-29T12:26:10.447063 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to let you know that **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.

Here's why: When a child is being looked after by a local authority (in care), Child Benefit normally stops if the arrangement lasts for more than 8 weeks. Since Leo has been in local authority care for 10 weeks, this means Child Benefit would not be payable to you during this time.

The local authority itself cannot claim Child Benefit for children in their care either.

If Leo's circumstances change and he returns to live with you in the future, you would be able to claim Child Benefit again at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T12:26:12.273269 [actor]: Wait, but my husband sends £30 a week to Leo's carer to help with his upkeep. Doesn't that make a difference?

2026-01-29T12:26:14.780798 [root_agent]: Thank you for mentioning that - let me ask a clarifying question about this arrangement.

**Is your husband sending this £30 a week directly to the local authority, or is he sending it to a foster carer or someone else who is looking after Leo on behalf of the local authority?**

2026-01-29T12:26:16.582161 [actor]: He's sending it to the carer who is looking after Leo.

2026-01-29T12:26:19.199172 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

I need to ask: **Is this carer a foster carer arranged by the local authority, or is Leo living with someone else in a different arrangement (for example, a friend or family member)?**

This distinction is important because it affects whether Leo is formally "looked after by a local authority" or living with someone else in a different type of care arrangement.

2026-01-29T12:26:20.669757 [actor]: It's a foster carer arranged by the local authority.

2026-01-29T12:26:24.668962 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

In this case, my assessment remains the same: **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** while Leo is in this arrangement.

Since Leo is being looked after by a foster carer arranged by the local authority, and this has been the case for more than 8 weeks (10 weeks in total), Child Benefit cannot be paid. The fact that your husband is contributing £30 per week towards Leo's upkeep doesn't change this eligibility rule - when a child is formally in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, Child Benefit stops.

Neither you, your husband, the foster carer, nor the local authority can claim Child Benefit in this situation.

However, if Leo's care arrangement changes in the future and he comes to live with you or another family member outside of local authority care, Child Benefit could be claimed again at that point.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T12:26:27.052243 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but thank you for explaining it to me. I understand now.

2026-01-29T12:26:31.172605 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, when a parent contributes at least the weekly rate of Child Benefit towards a child's upkeep while the child is in local authority care, the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit. Since the husband was contributing £30 per week (which exceeds the Child Benefit rate), the parent should be eligible, making the expected outcome "Eligible" correct and the agent's determination of "not eligible" incorrect.
