2026-01-29T12:17:43.053836 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T12:17:45.032281 [actor]: Yes, I have a son, Ryan. He's 17 and he's just started an apprenticeship - it's a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England. He lives at home with me.

2026-01-29T12:17:48.799324 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. An apprenticeship is an important detail I need to consider carefully.

Let me ask you: Is Ryan's apprenticeship an **approved course** of education or training? Specifically, I need to know if it's:
- Full-time (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience), or
- Non-advanced (not higher than A level or Scottish Highers)

Most government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeships would typically meet these criteria, but I want to confirm the details with you to be certain.

2026-01-29T12:17:51.674827 [actor]: Well, it's an Intermediate Apprenticeship, so yes, it's non-advanced - below A-level standard. And he does have supervised study as part of it, more than 12 hours a week when you count the training days. He's doing it full-time alongside his work placement. Why do you ask? Does that mean I can still get Child Benefit for him even though he's left school?

2026-01-29T12:17:55.691906 [root_agent]: Yes, that's exactly right! You're asking a very good question.

For children aged 16-19, Child Benefit can continue if they're in approved education or training. Based on what you've told me, Ryan's Intermediate Apprenticeship appears to meet the criteria because:
- It's non-advanced (below A-level standard)
- It includes more than 12 hours a week of supervised study

However, I need to clarify one important point: **apprenticeships are generally NOT covered for Child Benefit purposes**, even if they include education or training elements. The rules distinguish between approved education/training courses and apprenticeships.

Let me ask you directly: Is Ryan registered with a school or college for a course of education or training, or is he solely on an apprenticeship program with an employer?

2026-01-29T12:17:58.117480 [actor]: No, he's not registered with a school or college separately - he's on the apprenticeship program through his employer. It's just the apprenticeship, that's all. So does that mean I can't get Child Benefit for him anymore?

2026-01-29T12:18:03.495449 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. I need to give you accurate information here.

Unfortunately, if Ryan is only on an apprenticeship program and not separately registered for an approved education or training course at a school or college, then **you would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for him** once he turns 16 and starts the apprenticeship.

The Child Benefit rules specifically exclude apprenticeships, even though they include training elements. Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds only continues if they're in full-time non-advanced education or approved training that is **not** an apprenticeship.

Now, let me ask you a couple more questions to fully assess your overall eligibility:

**Are you responsible for Ryan?** By this I mean - does he normally live with you, and do you contribute to the costs of looking after him (such as food, clothing, housing)?

2026-01-29T12:18:06.423361 [actor]: Yes, of course I'm responsible for him! He lives with me, he's my son. I pay for everything - his food, his clothes, the roof over his head. I'm his mum and he's only 17. 

So you're saying because he's doing an apprenticeship instead of staying on at college, I lose the Child Benefit? That doesn't seem fair - he's still living at home and I'm still supporting him!

2026-01-29T12:18:11.205898 [root_agent]: I completely understand your frustration - you're still supporting Ryan in exactly the same way, and it can feel unfair that the type of education or training he's doing makes such a difference.

Unfortunately, yes, that is what the rules say. Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds continues only for those in approved full-time non-advanced education or training, and apprenticeships are specifically excluded from this - even though apprentices are still learning and often still need parental support.

The Child Benefit would typically stop from the date Ryan left full-time education and started his apprenticeship, or from the Monday following his 16th birthday if he had already started the apprenticeship by then.

Let me ask you one more question to make sure I have the complete picture:

**Is there anyone else who might be claiming Child Benefit for Ryan, or who has an equal or greater responsibility for him?** For example, does he split his time between two households, or is anyone else claiming to be responsible for him?

2026-01-29T12:18:13.821938 [actor]: No, there's no one else. It's just me - I'm a single parent. Ryan lives with me full-time, and I'm the only one responsible for him. His dad isn't in the picture.

So just to be clear - you're definitely saying I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore now that Ryan's started this apprenticeship?

2026-01-29T12:18:19.411521 [root_agent]: Based on all the information you've provided, I need to give you a clear answer:

**You would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Ryan** while he is on the apprenticeship program, because:

1. Ryan is 17 years old (over 16)
2. He is on an apprenticeship, which is specifically excluded from the approved education/training that allows Child Benefit to continue for 16-19 year olds
3. He is not separately registered for an approved course at a school or college

Even though you are clearly responsible for him, he lives with you, and you're supporting him financially - which would normally meet the eligibility criteria - the apprenticeship exclusion means Child Benefit cannot continue in this situation.

The benefit would have stopped when Ryan left any previous full-time education to start the apprenticeship (or wouldn't have continued past age 16 if he went straight into the apprenticeship).

I know this isn't the answer you were hoping for, and I understand it feels unfair when you're still fully supporting your son. If Ryan were to leave the apprenticeship and return to full-time education or approved training in the future, you could potentially claim Child Benefit again at that point.

Is there anything else about your situation you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T12:18:21.561519 [actor]: No, I think you've made it clear enough. I'm not happy about it, but I understand what you're saying. Thank you for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T12:18:25.602493 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that Child Benefit cannot continue for a 17-year-old on an apprenticeship, as apprenticeships are specifically excluded from the approved education/training that allows Child Benefit to continue for 16-19 year olds, even though the parent is responsible for the child and the apprenticeship includes training elements.
