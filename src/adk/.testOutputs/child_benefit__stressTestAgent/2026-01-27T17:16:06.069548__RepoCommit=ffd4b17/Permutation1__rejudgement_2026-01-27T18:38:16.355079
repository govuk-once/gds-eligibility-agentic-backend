The agent correctly determined that the family is eligible for Child Benefit based on all criteria: Leo is 8 years old (under 16), lives with his parents who are responsible for him, both parents are UK residents, and their incomes (£35,000 and £15,000) are below the £60,000 threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
