2026-01-27T18:30:24.912538 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment. The agent correctly determined eligibility based on all required criteria: the child is under 16 (Leo is 8), lives with and is cared for by the parents, both parents are UK nationals residing in the UK, and neither has an income over £60,000 (highest is £35,000). The agent's conclusion that the family is eligible for Child Benefit matches the expected outcome.
