The agent correctly determined the family is eligible for Child Benefit by verifying all key criteria: child under 16 (Leo is 8), parents are responsible for the child's care, both parents are UK residents, and neither parent earns above £60,000 (highest income is £35,000). This matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."
