2026-01-29T10:18:45.751845 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you:

**Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:18:47.435315 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Emma. She's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T10:18:49.475765 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now I need to ask:

**Does Emma normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T10:18:51.045759 [actor]: No, she doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother.

2026-01-29T10:18:53.631839 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Since Emma doesn't live with you, I need to ask:

**Do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or more) towards Emma's upkeep?** 

(Child Benefit is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, and £16.95 per week for each additional child)

2026-01-29T10:18:55.442795 [actor]: I send £10 a week to her mother for food, and I also send Emma a birthday present once a year.

2026-01-29T10:18:59.433122 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.

Here's why:

1. Emma lives with her mother, not with you
2. To claim Child Benefit when a child lives with someone else, you must contribute **at least as much as the Child Benefit amount** towards the child's upkeep
3. The current Child Benefit rate is £25.60 per week for an eldest or only child
4. Your contribution of £10 per week plus an annual birthday present does not meet this threshold

**The person Emma lives with (her mother) would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit**, as she is the person responsible for Emma on a day-to-day basis.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T10:19:04.844642 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because the child lives with someone else and the user's contribution (£10/week plus annual birthday present) falls below the required threshold of at least £25.60/week, which matches the Child Benefit amount for an eldest or only child.
