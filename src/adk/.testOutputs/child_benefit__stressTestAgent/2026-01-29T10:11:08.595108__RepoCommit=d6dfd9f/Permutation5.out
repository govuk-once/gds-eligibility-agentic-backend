2026-01-29T10:13:04.468018 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:13:05.903861 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Lucas, he's 10 years old.

2026-01-29T10:13:07.613276 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now, the next important question:

**Does Lucas normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T10:13:09.455764 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me. He lives with his ex-wife, Jenny. But I do contribute money towards his upkeep - I send Jenny £150 every month specifically for Lucas's food and clothes.

2026-01-29T10:13:12.197664 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Since Lucas doesn't live with you, I need to ask:

**Do you contribute at least the same amount or more towards Lucas's upkeep as his mother (Jenny) does?**

In other words, when you consider all the costs of raising Lucas - including housing, food, clothes, and other expenses - does your £150 monthly contribution match or exceed what Jenny contributes to his care?

2026-01-29T10:13:15.129559 [actor]: Well, Jenny is the one Lucas lives with, so she's providing the home and day-to-day care. I'm sending £150 a month specifically for his food and clothes, which I think is more than the Child Benefit amount. But I wouldn't say I'm contributing more than Jenny overall - she's the one looking after him full-time and providing everything else.

2026-01-29T10:13:19.935021 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification.

Based on what you've told me, I need to explain the eligibility position:

**You would not be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.**

Here's why: Child Benefit is generally paid to the person the child lives with. Since Lucas lives with his mother Jenny, she would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit for him.

Even though you're contributing £150 per month towards Lucas's upkeep, the key factor is that he doesn't normally live with you, and you've confirmed that you're not contributing more than Jenny does overall (when considering housing, day-to-day care, and all other expenses).

The person who has the child living with them and is responsible for their day-to-day care is typically the one who can claim Child Benefit. In your case, that would be Jenny.

**Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?**

2026-01-29T10:13:22.252906 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's interesting because Jenny actually doesn't claim Child Benefit. She's never claimed it for Lucas. Does that change anything? I thought maybe if she's not claiming it, I might be able to?

2026-01-29T10:13:25.027954 [root_agent]: That's a good question, and I understand why you might think that could make a difference.

However, I need to ask you an important follow-up question to fully assess this:

**Are you and Jenny in agreement that you should be the one to claim Child Benefit for Lucas instead of her?** 

In other words, would Jenny be willing to support your claim, given that Lucas lives with her?

2026-01-29T10:13:27.430842 [actor]: Yes, we've talked about it and Jenny is fine with me claiming it. She doesn't want to claim it herself - she's happy for me to be the one to claim the Child Benefit for Lucas.

2026-01-29T10:13:30.521047 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important information. Let me ask one more key question to complete the assessment:

**When you claim Child Benefit, are you intending to contribute at least the equivalent amount of the Child Benefit payments towards Lucas's upkeep?**

In other words, would you be passing on the Child Benefit money (or at least that amount) to help with Lucas's costs, in addition to or as part of your current £150 monthly contribution?

2026-01-29T10:13:33.210461 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm already sending £150 a month to Jenny for Lucas's food and clothes, which is more than the Child Benefit amount anyway. So yes, I'm definitely contributing at least the equivalent of what the Child Benefit would be - I'm already doing that now.

2026-01-29T10:13:37.868591 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on all the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

**You may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas.**

Here's why: Although Lucas doesn't live with you, there is a provision where someone who doesn't live with the child can claim Child Benefit if:

1. The person the child lives with (Jenny) agrees that you should get the Child Benefit instead of her - ✓ You've confirmed this
2. You contribute at least as much as the Child Benefit amount towards the child's upkeep - ✓ Your £150 monthly contribution exceeds the Child Benefit amount

This is sometimes the case when parents have separated and have come to an arrangement between themselves.

**Important next step:** You would need to apply for Child Benefit and explain your situation. The arrangement between you and Jenny would need to be clear, and you may need to provide evidence of your regular contributions to Lucas's upkeep.

**Is there anything else about your eligibility or the application process that you'd like to know?**

2026-01-29T10:13:40.637858 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you. I understand now - I can apply and explain the situation with Jenny and show that I'm contributing towards Lucas's upkeep. I appreciate your help!

2026-01-29T10:13:44.579842 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rules for Child Benefit when a child lives with one parent but the other parent contributes to their upkeep, correctly identifying that with the resident parent's agreement and evidence of contributions at least equivalent to Child Benefit, the non-resident parent may be eligible to claim.
