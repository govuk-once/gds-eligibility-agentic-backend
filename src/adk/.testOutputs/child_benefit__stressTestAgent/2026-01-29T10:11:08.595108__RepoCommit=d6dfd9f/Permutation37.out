2026-01-29T10:31:39.882553 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:31:42.052579 [actor]: Yes, I do. I'm looking after my best friend's daughter, Nina. She's 10 years old and she's come to live with me because her mum is unwell. We've made this arrangement privately, though the local council does know about it.

2026-01-29T10:31:44.337894 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand Nina is living with you due to her mother's illness.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Is Nina's mother still claiming Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-29T10:31:46.476680 [actor]: No, she's not. Since Nina's mum has been ill, she's not claiming it anymore. Nina lives with me full-time now and I'm the one paying for everything she needs.

2026-01-29T10:31:49.477886 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's helpful to know that Nina's mother is not currently claiming Child Benefit and that you're covering all of Nina's costs.

Let me ask you another important question: **Are you receiving any financial support from the local authority (council) for looking after Nina, such as payments under a kinship care arrangement or any other formal care arrangement?**

2026-01-29T10:31:51.550634 [actor]: No, I'm not receiving any payments from the council at all. They know about the arrangement - that Nina is staying with me - but they're not paying me anything. No fostering allowance or anything like that. I'm covering all her costs myself.

2026-01-29T10:31:54.161220 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. It's clear you're taking on the full financial responsibility for Nina without any council support.

Now I need to understand your connection to Nina a bit better: **Do you have parental responsibility for Nina, or has her mother given you any formal legal authority to make decisions about her care?**

(This could include things like a court order, being appointed as her guardian, or having a formal agreement about parental responsibility)

2026-01-29T10:31:57.309582 [actor]: No, there's nothing formal like that. Her mum is my best friend, and when she became ill, we just agreed that Nina would come and stay with me. It's just a private arrangement between us - no court orders or anything legal like that. I'm just helping out while her mum is unwell.

2026-01-29T10:31:59.463890 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. I understand this is an informal, private arrangement to help your friend during a difficult time.

Let me ask you this: **Is Nina's mother contributing anything towards Nina's upbringing or maintenance costs while Nina is living with you?**

2026-01-29T10:32:01.831977 [actor]: No, she's not able to contribute anything. Because of her illness, she can't manage that. I'm covering everything - food, clothes, school things, all of Nina's day-to-day expenses. That's all coming from me.

2026-01-29T10:32:04.422067 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me ask one more important question to complete the assessment:

**Are you a resident of the UK for tax purposes, or do you meet the UK residency requirements? In other words, do you normally live in the UK (or are you a Crown servant or member of HM Forces posted overseas)?**

2026-01-29T10:32:06.489397 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I'm a UK resident and I've been living here all along. This is where Nina and I both are now.

2026-01-29T10:32:12.323191 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility for Child Benefit.

**Good news - you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina.**

Here's why:

✓ You're responsible for a child under 16 (Nina is 10)
✓ Nina lives with you full-time
✓ You're paying for everything Nina needs - her food, clothes, and general upbringing
✓ Nina's mother is not claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ You're not receiving any payments from the local authority for Nina's care
✓ You're a UK resident

Under UK rules, you can claim Child Benefit even though you don't have parental responsibility and this is an informal arrangement. The key factors are that Nina lives with you, you're contributing at least the same amount towards her upkeep as Child Benefit would provide, and no one else is claiming it for her.

Since you're covering all of Nina's costs without any financial support, you meet the criteria for claiming Child Benefit. You would need to apply through the official channels to start receiving this support.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T10:32:16.015908 [actor]: Thank you so much, that's really helpful to know! I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. That will make a real difference in helping me care for Nina. I'll look into applying for it.

2026-01-29T10:32:19.012950 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit under the rules for someone who is not the parent but is responsible for the child's upbringing, verified that no one else is claiming the benefit, confirmed the child lives with them full-time, established they are covering all costs, and confirmed UK residency - all key eligibility criteria were correctly evaluated.
