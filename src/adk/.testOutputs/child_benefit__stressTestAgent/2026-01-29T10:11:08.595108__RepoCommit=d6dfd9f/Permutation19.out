2026-01-29T10:20:43.874870 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T10:20:45.436516 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Holly. She's 9 years old.

2026-01-29T10:20:46.964319 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Holly normally live with you?

2026-01-29T10:20:48.845175 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. My ex-partner Sue and I are separated, and Holly splits her time between us. She stays with me 3 days a week and with Sue 4 days a week.

2026-01-29T10:20:50.820925 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. In situations where a child splits their time between two people, only one person can claim Child Benefit.

Have you and Sue agreed on who should claim the Child Benefit for Holly, or is one of you already claiming it?

2026-01-29T10:20:52.998787 [actor]: No, we haven't agreed. We both think we should be the one to claim it since we both look after her and buy her clothes and food. Actually, we've both submitted claims to HMRC because we couldn't come to an agreement about it.

2026-01-29T10:20:56.796651 [root_agent]: I understand this is a difficult situation. When both parents submit claims for the same child, HMRC will need to make a decision about who should receive the Child Benefit.

Generally, when a child's time is split between parents, HMRC will award Child Benefit to the person who has "main responsibility" for the child. Since Holly spends slightly more time with Sue (4 days versus your 3 days), this could be a factor in HMRC's decision.

However, HMRC considers other factors too, such as who the child is registered with at school or with a GP, and the overall care arrangements.

Do you know if Holly is registered with your address or Sue's address for things like school and GP?

2026-01-29T10:20:58.793153 [actor]: I'm not entirely sure about that. I think she might be registered at Sue's address for school, but I'm not certain. Does that mean I won't get it then?

2026-01-29T10:21:03.746954 [root_agent]: Not necessarily. While the school registration may be one factor HMRC considers, it's not the only thing they look at when determining who has "main responsibility" for Holly.

HMRC will review all the circumstances of your case, including:
- Where Holly spends her time (the number of days with each parent)
- Who is registered to receive Child Benefit (when both have claimed, they decide)
- School and GP registration
- Who provides the day-to-day care

Since you've both submitted claims, HMRC will make a decision and inform both of you. Only one of you will be able to receive the Child Benefit.

Are you a UK resident, and is Holly also living in the UK?

2026-01-29T10:21:05.611080 [actor]: Yes, we're both UK residents and Holly lives here in the UK with us - well, between both our homes here.

2026-01-29T10:21:07.584064 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: Are you or Holly currently subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on your right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-29T10:21:09.186481 [actor]: No, nothing like that. We're both British citizens, no immigration restrictions or anything.

2026-01-29T10:21:14.581113 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, here's the situation with your eligibility for Child Benefit:

**You could be eligible for Child Benefit** because:
- You are responsible for Holly (your 9-year-old daughter)
- You are a UK resident
- Holly lives in the UK
- You have no immigration restrictions
- You provide care for Holly regularly (3 days per week)

**However**, there's an important complication:

Since Holly's time is split between you and Sue, and you've both submitted claims, **only one of you can receive Child Benefit**. HMRC will need to decide who has "main responsibility" for Holly. 

Given that:
- Holly spends slightly more time with Sue (4 days vs 3 days)
- Holly may be registered at Sue's address for school

HMRC may determine that Sue has main responsibility, but this isn't automatic - they will consider all the circumstances.

**What happens next:**
HMRC will review both claims and make a decision about who should receive the Child Benefit. They will write to both you and Sue to let you know their decision. If you disagree with their decision, you have the right to challenge it.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T10:21:17.496452 [actor]: No, that's clear enough. So basically HMRC will decide between us and let us know. Thanks for explaining it all.

2026-01-29T10:21:21.790989 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that while Pete meets the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, only one person can claim when a child's time is split between parents, and HMRC will decide who has "main responsibility" - likely Sue given she has Holly for more days per week and Holly appears to be registered at her address.
