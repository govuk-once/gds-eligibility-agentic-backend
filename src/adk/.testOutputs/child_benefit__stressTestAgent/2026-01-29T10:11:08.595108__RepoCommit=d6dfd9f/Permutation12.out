2026-01-29T10:16:48.571844 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:16:50.361196 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have my son Liam who's 18 and he's studying for his A-levels. He lives with me.

2026-01-29T10:16:52.254382 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know about Liam.

Next question: **Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Liam, or are you applying for the first time?**

2026-01-29T10:16:54.091443 [actor]: I'm applying for the first time. I've never claimed Child Benefit for him before.

2026-01-29T10:16:56.199067 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Next question: **Are you responsible for Liam? This means - do you live with him and are you responsible for paying for things like his food, clothes, and housing?**

2026-01-29T10:16:58.090976 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Liam lives with me and I'm responsible for all of that - his food, clothes, housing, everything really.

2026-01-29T10:16:59.925464 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Next question: **Do you normally live in the UK? This means the UK is your main home where you normally live.**

2026-01-29T10:17:01.455513 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. This is my main home.

2026-01-29T10:17:03.237026 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Does anyone else also claim Child Benefit for Liam, such as his other parent or another person?**

2026-01-29T10:17:05.450943 [actor]: No, no one else claims Child Benefit for him. His father and I are estranged, and he's not involved.

2026-01-29T10:17:07.223209 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: **Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on your right to live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:17:08.903035 [actor]: No, I'm not subject to immigration control and I don't have any restrictions on my right to live in the UK. I don't have a partner.

2026-01-29T10:17:11.345980 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

One final question to confirm Liam's eligibility: **You mentioned Liam is 18 and studying for his A-levels. Can you confirm that he is in approved education or training? This would typically include A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or home education that has been approved by the local authority.**

2026-01-29T10:17:13.040365 [actor]: Yes, that's right. He's studying for his A-levels, which is approved education.

2026-01-29T10:17:16.291979 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

**Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam.**

Here's why:
- You are responsible for Liam (you live with him and pay for his food, clothes, and housing)
- You normally live in the UK
- Liam is under 20 and is in approved education (studying for his A-levels)
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him
- You are not subject to immigration control

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for Liam. Since he's 18 and in approved education or training, you can continue to claim Child Benefit for him until he turns 20, or until he finishes his approved education or training (whichever comes first).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:17:17.973892 [actor]: Oh, I should mention - Liam is claiming Universal Credit in his own right to help with his personal living costs while he's studying. Does that affect my eligibility for Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:17:22.219836 [root_agent]: That's an important detail, thank you for mentioning it.

Let me think about this carefully. Based on the Child Benefit eligibility rules, the key factors are whether:
- You are responsible for the child
- The child is under 16, or under 20 and in approved education or training
- You live in the UK
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for the child

The fact that Liam is claiming Universal Credit in his own right doesn't automatically disqualify you from receiving Child Benefit for him. Child Benefit eligibility is based on your responsibility for him and his circumstances (age and education), not on whether he receives other benefits.

However, to be thorough, let me ask: **Even though Liam is claiming Universal Credit, do you still provide him with accommodation in your home and are you still responsible for his day-to-day care and expenses like food and clothing?**

2026-01-29T10:17:24.879910 [actor]: Yes, definitely. He lives here with me in my home and I still provide for him - his food, clothing, and everything else he needs day to day. The Universal Credit he gets just helps him with some of his personal costs, but I'm still the one looking after him and paying for most things.

2026-01-29T10:17:28.525456 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

**Based on this additional information, you still appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam.**

The key point is that you continue to be responsible for him - he lives with you in your home and you provide for his accommodation, food, clothing, and day-to-day care. The fact that he claims Universal Credit for his own personal costs doesn't change your responsibility for him or disqualify you from claiming Child Benefit.

Child Benefit is based on:
- Your responsibility for the child (which you have)
- The child being under 16, or under 20 and in approved education (which Liam is)
- Living in the UK (which you do)

So you should still be eligible to apply for Child Benefit for Liam.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility or the application process?

2026-01-29T10:17:33.722252 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, a young person cannot be included in a Child Benefit claim if they are claiming Universal Credit in their own right, as this indicates they are financially independent and responsible for themselves rather than being the responsibility of the parent.
