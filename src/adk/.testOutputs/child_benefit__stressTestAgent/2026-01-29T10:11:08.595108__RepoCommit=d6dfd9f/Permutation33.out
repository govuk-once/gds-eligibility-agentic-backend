2026-01-29T10:29:16.078725 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or young person under the age of 20 who you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T10:29:18.026061 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, she's 16 and lives with me.

2026-01-29T10:29:20.195486 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's a good start.

Next, I need to ask: Is your daughter currently in approved education or training? This would include things like school, college, or certain approved training courses.

2026-01-29T10:29:22.067253 [actor]: Yes, she is. She's started a training course to become a travel agent. It's with a local travel agency that has employed her - they're paying for the whole course.

2026-01-29T10:29:25.899113 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. That's helpful.

To clarify further: Is this training course approved for the purposes of Child Benefit? Approved education or training typically includes things like:
- Full-time non-advanced education (like A-levels or equivalent)
- Approved training courses with an education provider
- Certain unpaid work-based training

Could you tell me more about the nature of this training course - for example, is it with an approved training provider or education institution, and is it unpaid training, or is your daughter receiving wages as an employee while doing this course?

2026-01-29T10:29:28.273368 [actor]: She's receiving wages - the travel agency has employed her and they're paying for her training course. It's not through a college or anything like that, it's employer-funded training as part of her employment with them.

2026-01-29T10:29:30.284768 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is important information.

Let me ask you another question: Does your daughter live with you in the UK, and are you responsible for her day-to-day care and expenses?

2026-01-29T10:29:32.584239 [actor]: Yes, she lives with me here in the UK and I'm responsible for her - she's my daughter and I take care of all her day-to-day needs and expenses.

2026-01-29T10:29:35.012121 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now, one more important question: Is there anyone else who might also be claiming Child Benefit for your daughter, or does anyone else consider themselves to have an equal or greater responsibility for her care?

2026-01-29T10:29:36.960070 [actor]: No, there's no one else. It's just me - I'm her mother and she lives with me. No one else is claiming anything for her.

2026-01-29T10:29:41.812754 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, I need to give you an assessment of your eligibility.

**Unfortunately, you are likely not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.**

Here's why: While your daughter is under 20 and lives with you, the key issue is the type of education or training she's in. Child Benefit generally covers children and young people who are in:
- Full-time non-advanced education (such as school or college courses up to A-level standard)
- Approved unpaid training

Since your daughter is in **paid employment** with the travel agency and receiving wages while doing her employer-funded training course, this would not typically qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes. Once a young person starts paid work, even if training is involved, they generally fall outside the Child Benefit criteria.

Child Benefit usually stops when a young person:
- Leaves approved education or training, or
- Starts paid work (even if under 20)

I hope this clarifies your situation. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:29:45.835059 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but thank you for explaining it clearly. I understand now - it's because she's employed and earning wages, not just doing unpaid training. No, I don't have any other questions. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T10:29:48.201529 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that paid employment with employer-funded training does not qualify for Child Benefit, as the scheme covers children in approved education or unpaid training, not those in paid work, even if under 20.
