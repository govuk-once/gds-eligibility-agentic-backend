2026-01-29T10:12:11.577365 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T10:12:13.963071 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have my son Ben who's 17. He finished school in June and he's registered with the local youth careers service. He's been actively looking for an apprenticeship since then.

2026-01-29T10:12:15.969516 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about Ben.

To clarify - is Ben currently in approved education or training, or is he solely looking for work or an apprenticeship at the moment?

2026-01-29T10:12:18.076277 [actor]: He's not in education or training right now - he left school in June and didn't go on to college. He's just registered with the careers service and looking for an apprenticeship. It's August now, so it's been a couple of months since he left school.

2026-01-29T10:12:20.618082 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

I need to ask: During this time since Ben left school in June, has he been registered with the government-approved careers service (such as Careers Service, Connexions, or similar), and is he registered for work, education or training with them?

2026-01-29T10:12:22.567958 [actor]: Yes, that's right. He's registered with the local youth careers service and he's actively looking for an apprenticeship through them.

2026-01-29T10:12:24.215060 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Now I need to ask about your living situation: Does Ben normally live with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T10:12:25.815856 [actor]: Yes, Ben lives with me. It's just the two of us at home.

2026-01-29T10:12:27.655366 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now I need to ask: Are you responsible for Ben? By this I mean, are you the one who looks after him and makes decisions about his care and upbringing?

2026-01-29T10:12:29.162092 [actor]: Yes, I'm his father and I'm responsible for him. I look after him and he lives with me.

2026-01-29T10:12:31.433555 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

One more important question: Are you currently living in the UK, or do you have a connection to the UK through work or receiving a UK State Pension?

2026-01-29T10:12:32.895375 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:12:38.544039 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to give you some important guidance about your eligibility:

**You may be eligible for Child Benefit for Ben, but only for a limited time.**

Here's why:

- Ben is 17 and has left approved education
- He is registered with an approved careers service and actively seeking an apprenticeship
- He lives with you and you're responsible for him
- You live in the UK

**However, there's a time limit:** You can only claim Child Benefit for a young person who has left education for up to **20 weeks** from the date they left approved education or training.

Since Ben left school in June and it's now August (approximately 8-9 weeks), you are still within this 20-week window. But once that 20-week period ends, your entitlement to Child Benefit for Ben will stop unless he starts approved education or training.

If Ben starts an apprenticeship or approved training before the 20 weeks are up, you can continue to claim Child Benefit for him until he turns 20 (as long as he remains in that approved education or training).

Would you like me to clarify anything about this?

2026-01-29T10:12:41.081129 [actor]: No, that makes sense. Thank you for explaining that - I understand now that I can still claim for the next few months while he's registered and looking, but it will stop after the 20 weeks unless he starts an apprenticeship. That's really helpful to know.

2026-01-29T10:12:45.376877 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that I am eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when Ben left education in June, and correctly noted that since it's now August (8-9 weeks later), I'm still within the eligibility window, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)".
