2026-01-29T10:18:08.589190 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:18:10.087111 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Noah, who's 6 years old.

2026-01-29T10:18:12.378215 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Do you live with Noah, and are you responsible for him - meaning you're the one who looks after him and pays towards the costs of raising him (such as food, clothes, and other expenses)?**

2026-01-29T10:18:15.212407 [actor]: Well, that's a bit complicated at the moment. Normally yes, I live with Noah and I'm responsible for him - I'm his mum and I look after him. But right now, he's actually staying with his grandmother for a few weeks. I've been recovering from surgery and there was a family emergency, so he's been living with her temporarily. It's only been about 6 weeks so far though.

2026-01-29T10:18:17.855139 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that situation. I understand that must be a difficult time for you.

Let me ask a follow-up question to understand your situation better:

**Is this temporary arrangement with Noah's grandmother expected to last for more than 52 weeks in total, or will Noah be returning to live with you before then?**

2026-01-29T10:18:20.179345 [actor]: No, it's definitely not going to be anywhere near 52 weeks! He'll be coming back to live with me very soon. The whole arrangement was only ever meant to be temporary - just while I recover from my surgery. So it'll be much less than 52 weeks total.

2026-01-29T10:18:22.107901 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know, thank you.

**Are you currently the person claiming Child Benefit for Noah, or has his grandmother (or anyone else) made a claim for Child Benefit for him during this temporary period?**

2026-01-29T10:18:24.118228 [actor]: I'm currently the one claiming Child Benefit for Noah. His grandmother hasn't made a claim - she's just helping me out while I recover, so she hasn't claimed anything.

2026-01-29T10:18:26.272615 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now let me ask you:

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on your right to live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:18:28.384171 [actor]: No, I don't have any immigration restrictions. I'm a UK resident and there's no partner - I'm a single mother. No issues with my right to live in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:18:30.639806 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question:

**Do you (or did you, if you're not currently working due to your surgery recovery) normally live or work in the UK? In other words, is the UK where you usually reside?**

2026-01-29T10:18:32.564675 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I normally live and work in the UK. This is where I reside - it's my home. I'm just off work at the moment because of the surgery, but yes, the UK is where I live and work.

2026-01-29T10:18:37.152613 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit** for Noah. Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (Noah is 6 years old)
✓ You normally live with Noah and are responsible for him
✓ The temporary arrangement with his grandmother is for much less than 52 weeks (only about 6 weeks so far, with him returning soon)
✓ You are already claiming Child Benefit for him
✓ You have no immigration restrictions
✓ You normally live and work in the UK

**Important point about the temporary arrangement:** Since Noah's stay with his grandmother is temporary and will last less than 52 weeks in total, this doesn't affect your Child Benefit eligibility. You can continue to receive Child Benefit as normal during this period because you remain responsible for him and the arrangement is short-term.

You should continue with your existing Child Benefit claim without any changes needed. Is there anything else about Child Benefit you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T10:18:40.960382 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you! I was worried that having Noah stay with his grandmother might affect my benefit, so it's good to know I can continue receiving it. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.

2026-01-29T10:18:43.118963 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the temporary care arrangement (6 weeks with grandmother, returning soon, less than 52 weeks total) does not affect Child Benefit eligibility when the parent remains responsible for the child and continues to claim the benefit.
