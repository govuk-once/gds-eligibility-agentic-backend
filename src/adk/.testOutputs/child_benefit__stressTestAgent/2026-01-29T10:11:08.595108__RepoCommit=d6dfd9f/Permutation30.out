2026-01-29T10:27:16.911859 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:27:18.418932 [actor]: Yes, I do have children that I'm responsible for.

2026-01-29T10:27:20.355022 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Is your child (or are any of your children) under 16 years old, or under 20 and in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T10:27:22.518459 [actor]: Yes, my children are under 16.

2026-01-29T10:27:24.021719 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:27:25.477783 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:27:27.670054 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Are you the person responsible for the child or children? This means you live with them and are responsible for their care, such as providing for their food, clothing, and general wellbeing.**

2026-01-29T10:27:29.220796 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for them. I live with my children and take care of them.

2026-01-29T10:27:31.398529 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Next question: **Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on your right to reside in the UK?**

(This helps determine if there are any residency conditions that might affect eligibility)

2026-01-29T10:27:33.104249 [actor]: No, we don't have any immigration restrictions. We have full right to reside in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:27:35.546324 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for clarifying that.

One more important question: **Is your child (or are any of your children) currently living in hospital or care for more than 12 weeks, or do they live with someone else who is also claiming Child Benefit for them?**

2026-01-29T10:27:37.172431 [actor]: No, my children live with me at home and nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for them.

2026-01-29T10:27:41.325733 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all those questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. 

Here's a summary of why:
- ✓ You have children under 16 years old
- ✓ You live in the UK
- ✓ You're responsible for your children and they live with you
- ✓ You have the right to reside in the UK with no immigration restrictions
- ✓ Your children are not in hospital or care long-term, and no one else is claiming for them

You meet the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. You should be able to apply for it.

**Important note:** If you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year, you can still claim Child Benefit, but there may be a tax charge (High Income Child Benefit Charge) that applies. Would you like to discuss this aspect as well?

2026-01-29T10:27:43.443422 [actor]: Actually, yes - I should mention that. I earn £18,000 a year, but my wife earns £65,000 a year. I would be the one filling out the form and receiving the payments. Does that affect anything?

2026-01-29T10:27:50.528126 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that important information. Let me clarify how this affects your situation.

**You are still eligible to claim Child Benefit**, and you can proceed with the application. However, there is an important tax implication you need to be aware of:

Since your wife earns £65,000 per year (which is over £50,000), the **High Income Child Benefit Charge** will apply to your household. 

Here's what this means:

- The person with the **higher income** between you and your partner (in this case, your wife with £65,000) will need to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through their Self Assessment tax return
- For income between £50,000 and £60,000, you pay back 1% of the Child Benefit for every £100 earned over £50,000
- Since your wife earns £65,000 (which is £15,000 over the threshold and exceeds £60,000), you would have to pay back **100% of the Child Benefit** received

**You have two options:**
1. Claim Child Benefit and receive the payments, but your wife repays it all through tax
2. Opt out of receiving the payments but still register for Child Benefit (this protects your child's National Insurance record for their future State Pension)

Does this make sense, or would you like me to explain anything further?

2026-01-29T10:27:52.571497 [actor]: Oh, I see. So even though I'm the one claiming it and receiving the money, my wife would be the one who has to pay it back through tax because she earns more?

2026-01-29T10:27:57.114348 [root_agent]: **Yes, that's exactly right.**

Even though you would be the one claiming Child Benefit and receiving the payments, it's the person with the **highest individual income** in your household who has to pay back the money through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

In your case:
- You earn £18,000
- Your wife earns £65,000
- Your wife has the higher income, so **she** would be responsible for repaying the full amount through her Self Assessment tax return

This happens regardless of who actually claims or receives the Child Benefit - it's purely based on who has the higher income between you and your partner.

Given that your wife would have to repay 100% of it, many families in this situation choose **not to receive the payments** but still submit the Child Benefit claim. This way:
- You avoid the administrative burden of receiving money and then paying it all back
- Your children still get National Insurance credits that protect their future State Pension entitlement

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-29T10:27:59.570968 [actor]: No, that makes sense now. Thank you for explaining everything clearly. So I am eligible, but we'd need to decide whether to actually receive the payments given that my wife would have to pay it all back. I appreciate your help!

2026-01-29T10:28:03.191064 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately established eligibility for Child Benefit and correctly explained the High Income Child Benefit Charge, identifying that the wife (earning £65,000) would need to repay 100% of the benefit through tax even though the claimant earns only £18,000.
