2026-01-29T10:32:52.782265 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child (or children) who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T10:32:54.642215 [actor]: Yes, I do. My wife Helen and I have two children, they're 6 and 8 years old. We adopted them as a sibling pair.

2026-01-29T10:32:56.502376 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's wonderful that you've adopted your children together.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:32:58.329765 [actor]: Yes, we live in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:33:00.555867 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Next question:

**Are you responsible for the children? This means do they normally live with you, or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent) towards looking after them?**

2026-01-29T10:33:02.605638 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. We're responsible for them - they live with us full-time. Actually, because the children have special needs, the Local Authority pays us an Adoption Allowance to help with the costs. Does that affect anything?

2026-01-29T10:33:04.581119 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. The Adoption Allowance shouldn't prevent you from claiming Child Benefit - they are separate benefits and you can receive both.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Are you or your wife currently claiming Child Benefit for these children, or has either of you made a claim before?**

2026-01-29T10:33:06.853150 [actor]: No, neither of us has claimed Child Benefit for them before. We weren't sure if we were eligible because of the Adoption Allowance, so we never applied.

2026-01-29T10:33:09.526161 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's good that you're checking now - you should be eligible to claim.

I have one more important question to help complete the assessment:

**Do either you or your wife have an individual income over £50,000 per year? This is important because it may affect whether there's a tax charge on the Child Benefit, though it doesn't affect your eligibility to claim it.**

2026-01-29T10:33:11.113360 [actor]: No, neither of us earns over £50,000 a year.

2026-01-29T10:33:15.770160 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have two children under 16 (aged 6 and 8)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ The children live with you and you're responsible for them
✓ Neither you nor your wife is currently claiming Child Benefit for these children
✓ Neither of you earns over £50,000, so you won't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge

**Important points:**
- The Adoption Allowance you receive does not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit - these are separate benefits
- Only one person can claim Child Benefit for the children, so you and your wife will need to decide which of you will make the claim
- You should be able to claim for both children

You can apply for Child Benefit online or by post. Would you like any clarification on anything I've explained?

2026-01-29T10:33:20.064617 [actor]: That's brilliant, thank you so much! That's really helpful to know. We were worried the Adoption Allowance might stop us from getting Child Benefit, but I'm glad to hear they're separate. I'll discuss with Helen which of us should apply and we'll get the claim sorted out. Thanks again for your help!

2026-01-29T10:33:22.510675 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the individual is eligible for Child Benefit, correctly identified that the Adoption Allowance does not affect Child Benefit eligibility, and provided accurate information about all relevant factors including the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold and the requirement that only one person can claim per household.
