2026-01-29T10:29:50.035520 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T10:29:51.654916 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Mark. He's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T10:29:53.628385 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Do you live in the UK, and does Mark normally live with you?

2026-01-29T10:29:55.519417 [actor]: I live in the UK, but Mark doesn't live with me right now. He's been in a youth custody center for the past 10 weeks. He was sentenced to 6 months there.

2026-01-29T10:29:58.025829 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this must be a difficult situation.

When Mark is not in the youth custody center, does he normally live with you? In other words, was he living with you before he went into custody, and will he return to live with you when he's released?

2026-01-29T10:29:59.652149 [actor]: Yes, he was living with me before he went into custody, and he'll come back to live with me when he's released.

2026-01-29T10:30:01.737218 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now, I need to ask: Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Mark, or are you applying for the first time?

2026-01-29T10:30:03.439093 [actor]: I was already claiming Child Benefit for him before he went into custody.

2026-01-29T10:30:05.402990 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question: Are you (or your partner, if you have one) paying anything towards Mark's upkeep while he's in the youth custody center? This could be things like contributing to his maintenance costs or any other financial support.

2026-01-29T10:30:07.068736 [actor]: No, I'm not paying anything towards his upkeep while he's there. The custody center covers everything.

2026-01-29T10:30:11.498524 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your situation.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that **you are not eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit while Mark is in the youth custody center**, because:

1. Mark is in a custodial institution (youth custody center)
2. You are not contributing to his upkeep while he's there
3. He's expected to be there for more than 12 weeks (6 months sentence, currently 10 weeks in)

**However**, the good news is that you can reclaim Child Benefit once Mark is released and returns to live with you.

Child Benefit stops when a child is detained in custody for more than 12 weeks and no one is contributing to their upkeep. Since Mark has been there for 10 weeks and his sentence is 6 months, this threshold will be exceeded.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-29T10:30:14.726792 [actor]: No, that's clear. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T10:30:17.439449 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit while my son is in youth custody because he has been detained for more than 12 weeks (10 weeks so far of a 6-month sentence) and I am not contributing to his upkeep, which aligns with the rules stated at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care.
