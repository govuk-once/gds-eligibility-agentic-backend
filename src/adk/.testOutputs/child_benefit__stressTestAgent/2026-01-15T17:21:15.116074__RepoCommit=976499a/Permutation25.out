2026-01-15T17:34:27.816499 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the person claiming for a child, or if you are the child in question).

2026-01-15T17:34:29.204058 [actor]: I'll help you determine your eligibility for child benefit by assuming the role of a user based on the provided situation. I'll interact with the agent until they provide an eligibility outcome.

I'm 30 benefits leo 5 years old

2026-01-15T17:34:30.135740 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. So you are 30 years old and have a 5-year-old child named Leo.

To clarify, is Leo living with you?

2026-01-15T17:34:31.032033 [actor]: leo care 10 weeks not with me

2026-01-15T17:34:32.252377 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Leo is currently receiving care for 10 weeks and is *not* living with you during this time.

Is this care being provided in a hospital or a care home? Knowing this will help me understand the specific rules that apply.

2026-01-15T17:34:32.953952 [actor]: local authority care not hospital

2026-01-15T17:34:34.157960 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that important detail. Leo is in the care of the local authority, not a hospital.

Are you, as Leo's parent, contributing financially to the upkeep of Leo while they are in local authority care? Even a small contribution is relevant.

2026-01-15T17:34:34.979394 [actor]: no income husband pays £30 weekly

2026-01-15T17:34:35.856875 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you are not contributing financially, but your husband contributes £30 weekly.

Just to be absolutely sure I understand correctly, your husband is the other parent of Leo?

2026-01-15T17:34:36.551420 [actor]: husband stepfather lives with me

2026-01-15T17:34:40.098471 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your husband is Leo’s stepfather and lives with you. This means he’s not the biological parent.

Regarding your eligibility, as Leo is in local authority care and you aren’t contributing financially, and your husband is the stepfather, the rules regarding Child Benefit become quite specific. 

According to the information available, you are **likely not eligible** to receive Child Benefit while Leo is in full-time local authority care. This is because Child Benefit generally stops when a child is in care for more than 8 weeks, and your husband is not the biological parent.

However, there *could* be exceptions, so to be 100% certain, it would be best to double-check directly with HMRC.

Would you like me to summarise the reasons for this conclusion? Or would you prefer I ask another question to confirm something?





2026-01-15T17:34:41.570065 [actor]: wrong husband contributes counts as my contribution

2026-01-15T17:34:43.805431 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent failed to recognize that the husband's contribution (£30 weekly) counts as the parent's contribution, which could maintain eligibility for Child Benefit even while the child is in local authority care.
