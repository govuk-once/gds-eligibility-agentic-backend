2026-01-15T17:44:53.379631 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to confirm you are the parent or legal guardian claiming for the child.)

2026-01-15T17:44:54.368765 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

eligible for child benefit my child hospital

2026-01-15T17:44:55.683326 [root_agent]: Thank you for the clarification. It sounds like your child is currently in hospital. To understand your situation better, could you tell me how long your child has been in hospital or is expected to be in hospital for? (This is to determine if the specific rules for children in hospital apply).





2026-01-15T17:44:56.496851 [actor]: 14 weeks hospital stay daughter 8 years old

2026-01-15T17:44:57.725473 [root_agent]: Thank you. A 14-week hospital stay for your 8-year-old daughter is a significant period.

Just to confirm, are *you* the parent or legal guardian of your daughter? (This is a general eligibility requirement for claiming Child Benefit).





2026-01-15T17:44:58.315813 [actor]: yes parent Maria

2026-01-15T17:44:59.683299 [root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. That's helpful.

To clarify further, is your daughter usually living with you, or is she normally living with someone else (like another family member) when she is *not* in hospital? This is important as there are different rules depending on where a child usually lives.

2026-01-15T17:45:00.369726 [actor]: lives with me normally just hospital now

2026-01-15T17:45:01.993358 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know – she normally lives with you. 

Now, regarding your work status, are you currently working, and if so, approximately how many hours per week do you work, on average? (This is because earnings can affect eligibility for National Insurance credits through Child Benefit). Don't worry about giving exact figures, an estimate is fine.

2026-01-15T17:45:02.714457 [actor]: part time shop 20 hours

2026-01-15T17:45:04.125159 [root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. Working part-time for 20 hours a week is useful information.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an annual income exceeding £50,000? (Income over this amount can affect the amount of Child Benefit received, through the High Income Child Benefit Charge).

2026-01-15T17:45:05.505794 [actor]: no husband income 30000 me 15000

2026-01-15T17:45:08.635328 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you, Maria. With your combined household income being £45,000, you are below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Given that your daughter is 8 years old, normally lives with you, and has been in hospital for 14 weeks, and considering your income, it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state that Child Benefit can continue to be paid for a child in hospital for up to 12 weeks – however, as your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks, we need to confirm if an extension applies.

To be absolutely certain, could you confirm whether the hospital stay is expected to continue beyond 12 weeks, or is there an expected discharge date soon?

2026-01-15T17:45:09.338504 [actor]: already been there 14 weeks now

2026-01-15T17:45:11.641508 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Since your daughter has already been in hospital for 14 weeks, which is beyond the initial 12-week period where Child Benefit continues automatically, you will need to inform HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to see if you can continue receiving it.

While you are likely eligible based on the other criteria, the extended hospital stay requires you to contact HMRC directly to confirm continued payment. 

Would you like me to explain how to contact HMRC about this, or are you already aware of how to do so?

2026-01-15T17:45:12.436155 [actor]: visit her every day

2026-01-15T17:45:14.522569 [root_agent]: That's lovely that you visit your daughter every day, Maria. It must be a difficult time.

This doesn't directly affect your eligibility, but it's good to know you're so involved in her care. 

As we've established you likely meet the general criteria, and now understand the need to contact HMRC regarding the extended hospital stay, is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit today? Perhaps information on how to claim if you haven't already?

2026-01-15T17:45:15.329040 [actor]: dont buy things hospital provides everything

2026-01-15T17:45:17.830729 [root_agent]: That's good to hear the hospital is providing everything your daughter needs. That certainly eases one worry during a long stay.

This doesn't affect your Child Benefit eligibility. The financial assistance from Child Benefit isn't dependent on whether you are purchasing items for your daughter’s care.

To summarise, it looks like you *are* eligible for Child Benefit, but you’ll need to contact HMRC to discuss continued payments now your daughter has been in hospital for over 12 weeks.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or perhaps something else entirely?

2026-01-15T17:45:21.530002 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Child Benefit can continue for a child in hospital for up to 12 weeks, and that since the child has been hospitalized for 14 weeks, HMRC needs to be contacted regarding continued payments.
