2026-01-15T17:38:46.473077 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (Child Benefit is paid to the person primarily responsible for the child, and your age can affect eligibility).

2026-01-15T17:38:47.255686 [actor]: Mark custody Lisa benefit

2026-01-15T17:38:48.535419 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that context. Just to clarify, are *you* Mark? And is Lisa the mother of the child in question?

To confirm, and to start assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-15T17:38:49.409182 [actor]: Lisa Mark's mum benefit continue?

2026-01-15T17:38:50.825817 [root_agent]: Thank you for the clarification. So, Lisa is Mark's mother, and you're asking if *Lisa* can continue to receive Child Benefit for Mark.

To best assess this, could you please confirm Mark’s date of birth? This will help determine if he is still eligible as a 'child' for benefit purposes.

2026-01-15T17:38:51.503048 [actor]: Mark 15 custody child benefit

2026-01-15T17:38:52.490847 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So Mark is 15 years old and you've mentioned custody. 

Just to be clear, is Mark living with you (Lisa) the majority of the time?

2026-01-15T17:38:53.464183 [actor]: Mark custody 10 weeks juvenile detention

2026-01-15T17:38:55.135177 [root_agent]: Thank you for the additional information. So Mark is 15, has custody arrangements, and is currently in juvenile detention for 10 weeks.

To clarify, is Mark still considered to be 'living with' you for Child Benefit purposes, despite being in detention? (I understand this sounds unusual to ask, but the rules around where a child is considered to live are specific).

2026-01-15T17:38:56.039572 [actor]: Mark sentenced 6 months detention center been 10 weeks already

2026-01-15T17:38:58.323199 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that Mark has been sentenced to 6 months in a detention center and has already served 10 weeks.

Given this information, and according to the guidance, Child Benefit can continue to be paid for a child in detention for up to 26 weeks. However, it's important to notify HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) about the change in circumstances.

To be absolutely sure, could you confirm that you were receiving Child Benefit for Mark *before* he went into detention?

2026-01-15T17:38:59.234561 [actor]: was claiming for Mark before custody

2026-01-15T17:39:01.364119 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you were claiming Child Benefit for Mark before he entered custody.

Based on the information you've provided, you *can* continue to receive Child Benefit for Mark while he is in detention, for up to 26 weeks. As he’s already been there for 10 weeks, you have 16 weeks remaining where the benefit can continue uninterrupted, *provided you notify HMRC of the change in circumstances*.

Do you want me to explain how to notify HMRC about this change?

2026-01-15T17:39:04.359574 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Child Benefit can continue for up to 26 weeks while a child is in detention, which aligns with official guidance.
