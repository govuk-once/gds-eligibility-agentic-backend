2026-01-15T17:24:37.299123 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child.)

2026-01-15T17:24:38.626016 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a user inquiring about child benefit eligibility.

Fiona UK mum Ruby 4 years old

2026-01-15T17:24:40.585571 [root_agent]: Thank you for the extra information. So, you are Fiona, a mum in the UK, and you have a daughter called Ruby who is 4 years old.

Now, to assess your eligibility, could you please tell me: Are you working, and if so, approximately how many hours per week do you work? (Even if you're not working currently, please let me know). This is to check the earnings limits.





2026-01-15T17:24:41.362421 [actor]: job full time £75000 James £20000

2026-01-15T17:24:43.715529 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So you (Fiona) work full-time and earn £75,000 per year, and James earns £20,000 per year.

Child Benefit is affected by *household income*. The higher earner’s income is used to assess eligibility. Because your income (£75,000) is above the threshold of £60,000, Child Benefit may be reduced. 

To confirm, is James the other parent of Ruby? Knowing this will help me understand the household income situation fully.

2026-01-15T17:24:44.449799 [actor]: James father Ruby live together

2026-01-15T17:24:46.638744 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So James is Ruby’s father and you both live together – that confirms you are a household.

Given your income of £75,000, your Child Benefit will be reduced. For every £100 of income *over* £60,000, the Child Benefit is reduced by £1.

Do you want me to work out an approximate amount of Child Benefit you might receive, given your income? Or would you like me to ask further questions to confirm any details?

2026-01-15T17:24:47.560589 [actor]: how much Ruby UK

2026-01-15T17:24:51.503686 [root_agent]: Okay, let's calculate an approximate Child Benefit amount for Ruby.

The current standard rate of Child Benefit is £24 per week for each child.

Your income is £75,000, which is £15,000 over the £60,000 threshold. Therefore, your Child Benefit will be reduced by £15,000 / 100 = £150 per year.

This equates to roughly £2.88 per week reduced (£150 / 52 weeks).

Therefore, your approximate weekly Child Benefit for Ruby would be £24 - £2.88 = **£21.12 per week**.

Please remember this is an *estimate*. It’s best to use the official calculator on the government website for a precise figure, but this should give you a good indication.

Would you like me to confirm anything else or move on?

2026-01-15T17:24:52.255906 [actor]: Ruby Child Benefit UK government

2026-01-15T17:24:53.789567 [root_agent]: You've mentioned Ruby and Child Benefit with the UK government, which suggests you're confirming that you're asking about claiming Child Benefit *for* Ruby.

Just to be absolutely certain, and to cover all bases, has Ruby lived with you (and James) continuously for the past 12 months? This is a key requirement for eligibility.

2026-01-15T17:24:54.518783 [actor]: yes Ruby living with us

2026-01-15T17:24:57.766805 [root_agent]: Great! That confirms Ruby has been living with you both for the past 12 months, which is a key requirement.

Based on the information you've provided:

*   You are Fiona, Ruby’s mother.
*   James is Ruby’s father and you live together.
*   Ruby is 4 years old.
*   Your income is £75,000, triggering a reduction in Child Benefit.

It appears you *are* eligible for Child Benefit, but the amount will be reduced due to your income. I estimated this to be around £21.12 per week, but I recommend using the official government calculator for a precise amount.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or any other questions you have?

2026-01-15T17:25:01.838462 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent incorrectly calculated the benefit reduction - when income exceeds £60,000 per year, the high income tax charge completely eliminates Child Benefit (100% reduction), not just reduces it partially.
