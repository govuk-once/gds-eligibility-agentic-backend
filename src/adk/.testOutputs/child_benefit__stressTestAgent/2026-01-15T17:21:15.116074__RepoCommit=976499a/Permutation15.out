2026-01-15T17:27:52.553022 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child, as eligibility depends on that).

2026-01-15T17:27:53.591609 [actor]: I'll play the role of a person asking about child benefit eligibility.

Mike 45 daughter Emma lives with mom want to claim

2026-01-15T17:27:55.070378 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So you are Mike, aged 45, and your daughter Emma lives with her mother.

To understand your situation better, are you currently living with Emma’s mother? Or are you living separately?





2026-01-15T17:27:55.876408 [actor]: separate live different house Emma with mom

2026-01-15T17:27:57.169735 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you live in a different house from Emma and her mother. 

To clarify, do you have parental responsibility for Emma? Parental responsibility means all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority that a parent has for a child and their property.





2026-01-15T17:27:58.100439 [actor]: yes my daughter have rights birthday present every year send money to ex

2026-01-15T17:27:59.687934 [root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know. Regularly sending birthday presents and financial support to your daughter suggests you maintain a strong relationship and likely have parental responsibility.

Now, to confirm – do you have a formal arrangement in place, like a court order, that specifically states you have parental responsibility for Emma? (This isn’t always necessary, but it helps to clarify).

2026-01-15T17:28:00.526631 [actor]: no court papers just send money every week for food

2026-01-15T17:28:02.146869 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Even without a formal court order, consistently providing financial support like weekly contributions for food *can* be considered evidence of parental responsibility.

Now, considering Emma lives with her mother, are you contributing financially towards Emma’s upbringing *in addition* to the weekly food money? For example, do you contribute to clothing, school trips, or other expenses?

2026-01-15T17:28:03.010190 [actor]: send £10 every week for food

2026-01-15T17:28:04.670696 [root_agent]: Okay, so your financial contribution is specifically £10 per week for food.

To assess your eligibility, could you tell me about your annual income? Please give me an estimate *before* tax deductions. This is because Child Benefit has income thresholds that may affect the amount you receive. It’s okay to give me a range if you’re not sure of the exact amount.

2026-01-15T17:28:05.607112 [actor]: what about income? money for Emma £10 weekly

2026-01-15T17:28:08.461864 [root_agent]: You're right to bring that up – I apologise for not explaining *why* I'm asking about your income. Child Benefit payments are affected by your individual income. If your income is above a certain amount, you may have to pay back some of the Child Benefit you receive through something called the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

So, to reiterate, could you please tell me your annual income *before* tax is deducted? Knowing this will help me determine if you might be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge. It's okay to give me an approximate figure or a range. The £10 weekly payment for Emma is important information, but doesn't affect this part of the eligibility check.

2026-01-15T17:28:09.741155 [actor]: don't want to say about my money just want to know if I can get child benefit for Emma

2026-01-15T17:28:12.256007 [root_agent]: I understand your hesitation, and I apologise for making you feel uncomfortable. I assure you this information is solely to determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, as per the UK government guidelines. Your income does affect whether you may have to pay back some of the benefit. 

However, respecting your privacy is important. Let’s focus on other eligibility factors. 

Given Emma lives with her mother, and you are not living with her, do you have a formal childcare arrangement with Emma's mother regarding Emma's care? (For example, a written agreement about contact times or shared responsibilities).





2026-01-15T17:28:13.245144 [actor]: no arrangement just want to know if eligible money for daughter £10 week food

2026-01-15T17:28:17.754303 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming there’s no formal arrangement.

Let's recap what we know: You are Mike, aged 45, Emma's father. Emma lives with her mother, and you live separately. You contribute £10 per week towards Emma’s food. You do not have a court order establishing parental responsibility, but you do send regular financial support and gifts.

Based on the information provided, and referring to the government guidelines, it is *possible* you could be eligible to claim Child Benefit. However, because Emma lives primarily with her mother, the main claim would likely be made by her mother. You *may* be able to claim if her mother isn’t already claiming, or if you meet specific criteria regarding taking on primary care.

To be certain, and to understand if claiming is appropriate in your specific circumstances, it would be best to review the guidance on the government website: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility.

Would you like me to summarise any of the information we’ve discussed, or perhaps focus on the possibility of the mother already claiming?

2026-01-15T17:28:18.670211 [actor]: does mom already get it? she says no

2026-01-15T17:28:21.648948 [root_agent]: Okay, that's important information – Emma's mother says she isn't currently claiming Child Benefit.

Given this, and based on the information you’ve provided – that you have parental responsibility (demonstrated through financial support), and Emma lives with her mother – you *are* likely eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma.

However, it's crucial to remember I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. To officially confirm your eligibility and start a claim, you should visit the government website: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/how-to-claim.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you'd like me to summarise the key points we've discussed?

2026-01-15T17:28:22.571038 [actor]: so am I eligible yes or no? £10 per week good?

2026-01-15T17:28:25.101792 [root_agent]: Okay, you want a simple "yes" or "no".

Based on the information *you* have provided – that you contribute financially (£10 per week), have parental responsibility, and Emma’s mother does not currently claim Child Benefit – **yes, you appear to be eligible.**

The £10 per week contribution supports the evidence of parental responsibility, which is a key factor.

However, please remember this is based on the details you’ve shared. The official confirmation comes from applying through the government website: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/how-to-claim.





2026-01-15T17:28:25.971537 [actor]: I understand I should be eligible for Child Benefit?

2026-01-15T17:28:28.137443 [root_agent]: Yes, that is correct. Based on everything you've told me – your financial contribution, parental responsibility, and the fact that Emma’s mother isn’t claiming – you *should* be eligible for Child Benefit.

I'm glad we were able to work through this together. Just remember to officially apply through the government website to confirm your eligibility and begin receiving payments: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/how-to-claim.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T17:28:31.137360 [actor]: Actually, I need to clarify something important. Based on the information I provided - that I only contribute £10 per week to my daughter Emma who lives with her mother - I would NOT be eligible for Child Benefit.

According to UK government guidelines, to be considered "responsible" for a child who doesn't live with you, you must contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit payment itself (which is £26.05 per week for an eldest child). My contribution of £10 per week is below this threshold.

2026-01-15T17:28:33.575378 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent advised I was eligible for Child Benefit despite my weekly contribution (£10) being below the required threshold (£26.05) to be considered responsible for a child living with someone else.
