2026-01-15T17:29:21.365631 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-15T17:29:22.864017 [actor]: I'll help you figure out whether you're eligible for Child Benefit by chatting with the agent as if I were a user in the situation described.

Son 19 studying A levels turning 20

2026-01-15T17:29:25.066453 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information.

Just to clarify, you are the parent or guardian of a son who is currently 19 years old and studying A-Levels, and will turn 20 soon? 

If that's correct, generally Child Benefit stops when a child turns 20. However, there's an exception if the child is continuing in full-time education.

To confirm eligibility, could you please tell me – is your son in approved full-time education?

2026-01-15T17:29:25.842314 [actor]: Full time student yes A levels

2026-01-15T17:29:27.074776 [root_agent]: Great, that’s good to know. A-Levels count as approved full-time education.

Now, to assess eligibility further, could you please confirm: are you (the person claiming) responsible for the daily care of your son?

2026-01-15T17:29:27.780185 [actor]: Taking care of him yes

2026-01-15T17:29:29.083832 [root_agent]: Thank you. And to be absolutely sure, could you tell me your National Insurance number? I understand this is personal information, but it's needed to confirm eligibility according to the guidelines. You can tell me the first few digits if you prefer, or just confirm if you have one.

2026-01-15T17:29:29.797506 [actor]: NI123456X

2026-01-15T17:29:33.012433 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that.

Now, considering all the information you’ve given me: your son is 19, studying A-Levels (full-time education), you provide his daily care, and you have a National Insurance number.

Based on this, it appears you *are* likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for your son until he turns 20, as long as he remains in approved full-time education.

However, I must state that I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. It's always best to double-check with the official government website to ensure you have the most up-to-date and accurate information.

Would you like me to summarise the key points, or is there anything else I can help you with today?





2026-01-15T17:29:33.647258 [actor]: He's turning 20 during the term

2026-01-15T17:29:36.304076 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important detail!

Okay, so your son is turning 20 *during* his A-Level term. That changes things slightly. Child Benefit can continue to be paid until the end of August after your son’s 20th birthday *if* he was in approved full-time education on his 20th birthday.

So, as he’s turning 20 *during* the term, and still studying A-Levels on his birthday, it sounds like you *will* be able to continue receiving Child Benefit until the end of August following his 20th birthday.

Does that clarify things?

2026-01-15T17:29:37.208044 [actor]: So not eligible after August when he turns 20?

2026-01-15T17:29:40.130913 [root_agent]: You are right to double-check! My apologies for any confusion.

It's not necessarily *not* eligible after August, even if he turns 20 during the term. Child Benefit can continue to be paid until **31st August following his 20th birthday** *as long as* he remains in full-time education. 

So, if he's still studying A-Levels *after* his 20th birthday in August, you can continue to claim until the end of August. If he finishes his A-Levels before then, that's when Child Benefit would stop.

Does that make more sense? I'm learning to be more precise with these rules!





2026-01-15T17:29:40.891103 [actor]: Already 20 now still in education

2026-01-15T17:29:43.807773 [root_agent]: You are absolutely right to point that out! I am making mistakes and I apologise for the continued confusion. My internal processing isn’t keeping track of the details correctly.

You stated earlier he *is* already 20 and still in full-time education. In this case, you are eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit until 31st August following his 20th birthday. As he is already 20, the eligibility continues until the end of this August.

I am still under development and learning to accurately apply these rules. Thank you for being patient and helping me improve by correcting my errors. 

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or anything else at all?

2026-01-15T17:29:44.547277 [actor]: So no more benefit after August?

2026-01-15T17:29:46.334708 [root_agent]: That is correct. As your son will have passed his 20th birthday and the end of August has passed, you will no longer be eligible for Child Benefit after August 31st.

Again, I apologize for the previous incorrect information I provided. I am still learning to process and retain information accurately. Thank you for your patience in clarifying everything with me.



Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

2026-01-15T17:29:49.974531 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided the accurate information that Child Benefit continues until August 31st after a child turns 20 if they remain in approved education, but stops after that date.
