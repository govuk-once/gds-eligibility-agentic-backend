2026-01-15T17:46:04.279468 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-15T17:46:05.397599 [actor]: I'll play the role of a UK resident seeking information about child benefit eligibility, following the "Court Order" Contributor scenario.

child benefit court order payment

2026-01-15T17:46:06.544557 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you're exploring the "Court Order" scenario. That's helpful context.

To clarify, do you have a court order stating you should be paying or receiving Child Benefit for a particular child?

2026-01-15T17:46:07.470723 [actor]: pay child maintenance £50 weekly court order my child lives with ex

2026-01-15T17:46:08.607198 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So, you have a court order to pay child maintenance, and your child lives with their other parent.

To understand your potential eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please confirm: are you currently claiming Child Benefit for this child?

2026-01-15T17:46:09.570613 [actor]: not claiming why should I pay forced by court not voluntary

2026-01-15T17:46:12.157283 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand – you’re not currently claiming, and you feel you're being forced to pay maintenance by the court, rather than doing so voluntarily.

According to the information available, even with a court order to pay child maintenance, you may still be eligible to claim Child Benefit if you meet certain conditions. It isn't automatically cancelled just because of a maintenance order.

To explore this further, could you please tell me your National Insurance number? (I understand this is personal information, and I will only use it to check eligibility based on the government guidelines. You can redact the last digit if you prefer.)





2026-01-15T17:46:13.099483 [actor]: won't give national insurance not claiming benefits don't want government information

2026-01-15T17:46:16.443903 [root_agent]: I absolutely understand and respect your decision not to share your National Insurance number or engage with government benefits at this time. I apologize for asking – it’s a habit when assessing eligibility, and I should have been more sensitive to your preference.

Given that you're not currently claiming and don't wish to, and you are subject to a court order for child maintenance, there's no action required from your side regarding claiming Child Benefit. 

However, it’s important to be aware that the *other parent* (the one your child lives with) is likely the person who would claim Child Benefit. The court order for maintenance doesn't prevent them from claiming.

Is there anything else I can help you with, perhaps regarding understanding how Child Benefit might affect the child maintenance payments, or anything else related to this situation?





2026-01-15T17:46:17.329338 [actor]: who eligible child benefit if court order maintenance want know rights

2026-01-15T17:46:22.323118 [root_agent]: You're right to ask about rights - it's good to be informed.

Generally, the person who *primarily* cares for the child is eligible to claim Child Benefit. In your situation, since the child lives with your ex-partner and you have a court order for maintenance, it's likely your ex-partner is the eligible claimant.

However, there are specific situations where someone else can claim, even if the child lives with someone else. These are detailed on the gov.uk website ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else)).

For example, if you meet specific criteria relating to providing care for the child, you *might* be able to claim. This is less common when a court order for maintenance is in place, but it’s worth being aware of.

To help me understand if this might potentially apply to you, could you tell me – beyond the court-ordered maintenance – how much time do *you* spend actively caring for the child? (e.g., overnight stays, school runs, activities together). Just a general idea is fine.

2026-01-15T17:46:23.236034 [actor]: weekend visits once month court allows no overnight stay

2026-01-15T17:46:26.727483 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So, you have weekend visits with your child once a month, but these visits do not include overnight stays, and this is in accordance with the court order.

Based on this information, and the guidelines I have access to, it's very unlikely you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit. The primary care is clearly with your ex-partner, and your limited contact doesn't meet the criteria for claiming as someone else who provides care.

Your rights in this situation relate to ensuring the maintenance payments are fair and in line with the court order. Child Benefit is separate to that, and is generally the responsibility of the parent with primary care.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your rights as a non-resident parent, or perhaps understanding the child maintenance calculation?

2026-01-15T17:46:29.263367 [actor]: Thank you for the information. Understand now my ex gets benefit not me because they have primary care. Court maintenance separate issue. Nothing else need to know right now.

2026-01-15T17:46:31.100975 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that as the non-resident parent with only monthly visits and no overnight stays, the user would not be eligible for Child Benefit, while the ex-partner with primary care would be the eligible claimant.
