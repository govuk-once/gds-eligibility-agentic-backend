2026-01-15T17:46:32.319688 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to check if *you* are eligible as the person claiming, not the child).

2026-01-15T17:46:33.387820 [actor]: I'll help you by role-playing as someone inquiring about child benefit eligibility.

My daughter Emily university college 18 years old

2026-01-15T17:46:35.115179 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that you're inquiring on behalf of your daughter, Emily, who is 18 and in university.

According to the rules, Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 18. However, there are exceptions if the child is continuing in relevant education or approved training. 

Is Emily studying a full-time course that will last at least 3 years?

2026-01-15T17:46:36.005394 [actor]: Not university college higher national certificate local Emily

2026-01-15T17:46:37.857187 [root_agent]: Thank you for the clarification. So Emily is studying a Higher National Certificate (HNC) at a local college.

HNCs *can* qualify as “relevant education” allowing Child Benefit to continue beyond age 18. However, generally the course needs to last at least 3 years full-time. 

Roughly how long is Emily’s HNC course expected to last? (Even an estimate is helpful at this stage).

2026-01-15T17:46:38.582570 [actor]: One year course HNC

2026-01-15T17:46:40.525339 [root_agent]: Thank you. As Emily’s HNC course is only one year long, unfortunately, this means she isn’t continuing in relevant education for the required 3 years.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is unlikely you would continue to be eligible for Child Benefit for Emily once she turns 18.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or would you like me to double-check any aspect of this information?

2026-01-15T17:46:43.821173 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidelines, Child Benefit stops when a child turns 18 unless they're in approved education that typically needs to be at least 3 years full-time, and a one-year HNC course doesn't qualify.
