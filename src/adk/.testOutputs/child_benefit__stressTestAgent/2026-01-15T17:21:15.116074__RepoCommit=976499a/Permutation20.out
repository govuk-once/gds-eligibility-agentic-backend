2026-01-15T17:30:21.536144 [root_agent]: Okay, I can help you with that. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? This is one of the key criteria for eligibility.



**My thought process:**

I'm starting with age as the rules state you generally need to be under State Pension age to claim. This is a foundational question before diving into details about children. I am being polite and framing it as a helpful step towards assessing eligibility. I will refer back to the provided links as needed to verify information.

2026-01-15T17:30:23.246393 [actor]: I'll help you engage with the benefits agent by playing the role of Maria, who is caring for her 14-year-old granddaughter Lucia through an informal arrangement.

looking after my granddaughter she's 14 parents not around I'm 60

2026-01-15T17:30:24.552998 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know the situation. That's helpful.

Given you are 60 years old, and looking after your 14-year-old granddaughter Lucia, are you financially responsible for her – meaning you are the main person paying for her living costs?

2026-01-15T17:30:25.319997 [actor]: yes I pay everything no help from her parents informal arrangement

2026-01-15T17:30:26.248605 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

To clarify, as this is an informal arrangement, does Lucia live with you *full-time*? This is important as Child Benefit rules differ depending on living arrangements.

2026-01-15T17:30:27.204979 [actor]: she lives with me full-time since her parents can't take care of her

2026-01-15T17:30:29.854380 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now, to be absolutely sure, are you Lucia’s legal guardian? Or do you have any legal orders relating to her care? It’s okay if you don’t – it just helps me understand the situation fully.



**My thought process:**

I'm now exploring the legal aspect of care. While an informal arrangement *can* qualify for Child Benefit (according to the linked resources regarding a child living with someone else), knowing about legal guardianship or orders will help me assess more accurately. I'm phrasing the question neutrally, acknowledging it's okay if there are no legal documents.

2026-01-15T17:30:31.025884 [actor]: no court order just family arrangement her parents agreed I look after her

2026-01-15T17:30:33.724414 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that it's a family arrangement with no court order.

Are you employed, or do you receive a State Pension or other benefits? If so, roughly what is your annual income? Don't worry about being exact, an estimate is fine. This is because Child Benefit can sometimes be affected by your income.



**My thought process:**

Now I need to investigate potential income limits. The eligibility rules mention income thresholds affecting the benefit. I'm asking about employment, State Pension *and* other benefits to get a comprehensive picture of income. I'm reassuring the user that an estimate is fine to encourage honest disclosure.

2026-01-15T17:30:35.396288 [actor]: part time shop work 15000 a year

2026-01-15T17:30:36.917317 [root_agent]: Thank you. And just to be certain, is that £15,000 your gross annual income (before tax and other deductions)?



**My thought process:**

I need to confirm whether the income provided is gross or net. Child Benefit income thresholds are based on gross income. Asking for clarification ensures I'm using the correct figure.

2026-01-15T17:30:37.673455 [actor]: yes before tax 15000

2026-01-15T17:30:42.106671 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. 

Based on the information you’ve provided – that you are 60 years old, financially responsible for your 14-year-old granddaughter Lucia who lives with you full-time, and have a gross annual income of £15,000 – you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit.

However, because your income is above the personal allowance, your Child Benefit may be taxable.

Would you like me to explain how the High Income Child Benefit Charge might affect you?



**My thought process:**

I've reviewed the information against the eligibility criteria in the provided links.  Maria is under State Pension age, is financially responsible for Lucia, and Lucia lives with her full-time. The income is below the threshold where Child Benefit is stopped completely, but high enough that the High Income Child Benefit Charge *could* apply. I am offering to explain this further rather than overwhelming her with information. I’ve stated the likely eligibility, but with the caveat about potential tax implications.

2026-01-15T17:30:45.954982 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly assessed that Maria, as the full-time caregiver for her 14-year-old granddaughter with financial responsibility (even through an informal arrangement), would be eligible for Child Benefit with her income of £15,000.
