2026-01-15T17:22:18.128046 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (Child Benefit is paid to people *responsible* for a child, not the child themselves, so I need to know about you first).





2026-01-15T17:22:18.988933 [actor]: I'm 42 years old. My daughter Sofia lives with me.

2026-01-15T17:22:20.659247 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you are 42 and that your daughter Sofia lives with you. That's good information.

Now, to help me understand your situation a bit better, could you please tell me - are you currently employed, or do you have any income from self-employment? Don't worry about the exact amount just yet, just whether you earn anything.





2026-01-15T17:22:21.333701 [actor]: receptionist daughter 30 hours weekly

2026-01-15T17:22:22.456012 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So you work 30 hours a week as a receptionist. That's helpful.

To clarify, is Sofia your biological daughter, or do you have parental responsibility for her in another way (e.g., adoption)?

2026-01-15T17:22:23.278029 [actor]: my daughter Sofia she's 18 lives with me

2026-01-15T17:22:24.736444 [root_agent]: Thanks for confirming that Sofia is your daughter and that she lives with you. It's also important that she is 18.

Child Benefit rules change once a child turns 18. To clarify, is Sofia still in full-time education? (This includes things like A-Levels, university, or approved training courses).

2026-01-15T17:22:25.560847 [actor]: left school two years ago works receptionist 30 hours

2026-01-15T17:22:27.824396 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know Sofia left school two years ago and is working 30 hours a week as a receptionist. 

Given that Sofia is 18, no longer in full-time education, and working, you are likely **not** currently eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 18 and is no longer in approved education or training.

However, there are exceptions. To be absolutely sure, could you confirm that Sofia has *never* been claimed for through Universal Credit or Child Tax Credit?

2026-01-15T17:22:28.701242 [actor]: not in training not in education

2026-01-15T17:22:31.113216 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Sofia is not in education or training.

Based on the information you've provided – that you are 42, Sofia is 18, lives with you, works 30 hours a week, and is not in education or training – you are unfortunately **not eligible** for Child Benefit. As Sofia is over 18 and not in approved full-time education, the usual conditions for receiving Child Benefit are not met.



Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on other benefits you might be eligible for?

2026-01-15T17:22:34.197607 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Child Benefit is not available for an 18-year-old who is not in education or training and is working full-time.
