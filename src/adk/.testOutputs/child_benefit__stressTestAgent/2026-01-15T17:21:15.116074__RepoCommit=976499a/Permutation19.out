2026-01-15T17:29:51.202130 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (This helps determine if you are potentially eligible as the parent/guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-15T17:29:52.062362 [actor]: Child benefit Holly daughter Sue Pete separated

2026-01-15T17:29:53.323476 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for the context. It sounds like "Holly" is the person potentially claiming Child Benefit, "Sue" is her daughter, and Holly is separated from "Pete".

To clarify, are you Holly, and are you asking about claiming Child Benefit for your daughter Sue?

2026-01-15T17:29:54.445200 [actor]: Pete separated from Sue. Holly our daughter. Holly 9 years old. Sue has Holly 4 days Pete 3 days. Both want child benefit.

2026-01-15T17:29:56.291849 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So, Holly is 9 years old, and Sue is the parent wanting to claim Child Benefit. Pete and Sue are separated, and Holly spends 4 days with Sue and 3 days with Pete. Both parents want to claim Child Benefit.

To start assessing eligibility, could you please confirm Sue’s date of birth? Knowing this will help me determine if she meets the age criteria for claiming.

2026-01-15T17:29:57.366107 [actor]: Sue adult. Pete adult. Holly 9. Live in UK. Both want money.

2026-01-15T17:29:59.420583 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Sue and Pete are both adults, Holly is 9, and you all live in the UK. 

Given this information, and based on my understanding of the rules, only *one* person can receive Child Benefit for Holly. It sounds like both Sue and Pete want to claim.

To determine who *can* claim, could you please tell me, who has day-to-day care and responsibility for Holly the majority of the time?

2026-01-15T17:30:00.500605 [actor]: Sue 4 days Holly. Pete 3 days Holly. Both buy food clothes for Holly.

2026-01-15T17:30:03.454416 [root_agent]: Okay, so Sue has Holly for 4 days a week and Pete has her for 3 days. Both contribute financially by buying food and clothes.

Based on this, and according to the rules, the person who has 'day-to-day care and responsibility' is the one who can generally claim Child Benefit. Since Sue has Holly for the majority of the time (4 days vs 3 days), it *suggests* she would be the one eligible to claim. 

However, there are exceptions. To be absolutely sure, could you tell me who receives and claims any other benefits for Holly, such as Universal Credit or Guardian's Allowance?

2026-01-15T17:30:04.657720 [actor]: Nobody claim anything now. Both want child benefit. Both submitted form. HMRC confused?

2026-01-15T17:30:07.433271 [root_agent]: Okay, so currently nobody is claiming any benefits for Holly, and both Sue and Pete have submitted Child Benefit forms to HMRC. It sounds like HMRC is understandably confused, as only one person can claim.

Given that Sue has Holly for the majority of the time (4 days a week), she is likely the one who should be receiving the Child Benefit. However, it's possible to share the benefit in certain circumstances, although this requires agreement and is less common.

To help clarify things for HMRC (and to confirm my understanding), could you tell me if there is any formal agreement in place – such as a court order – that outlines who is responsible for the financial support of Holly?

2026-01-15T17:30:08.365488 [actor]: No court order. Cannot agree. Both want benefit. Child lives both places.

2026-01-15T17:30:11.809697 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming there’s no court order and that Sue and Pete can’t agree on who should claim. It's tricky when the child lives substantially with both parents.

In this situation, and without a court order, HMRC will likely need to determine who is considered to have ‘main responsibility’ for Holly. Since Sue has day-to-day care for slightly more days, that points to her. However, given Pete’s significant involvement, HMRC may investigate further.

To be certain, and because you’ve both already submitted forms, the best course of action would be for Sue and Pete to contact HMRC directly to discuss their situation. They may ask for more detailed information to determine eligibility.

Do you want me to summarise the key points, and what the next steps might be?

2026-01-15T17:30:12.780003 [actor]: Who gets money? Sue has Holly more days.

2026-01-15T17:30:15.277371 [root_agent]: Okay, you want to know who is most likely to get the money.

Based on the information provided – Sue has Holly for 4 days a week compared to Pete’s 3 days, and there's no court order dictating financial responsibility – **Sue is more likely to be considered eligible to receive the Child Benefit.** 

The rules state that the person with 'day-to-day care and responsibility' generally receives the benefit, and having Holly for the majority of the week suggests Sue fulfills this. However, HMRC will make the final decision, and may ask for further information if needed.





2026-01-15T17:30:16.724452 [actor]: OK thank you. So Sue gets the benefit because Holly lives with her more days.

2026-01-15T17:30:19.318197 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Sue would likely be eligible for Child Benefit as Holly lives with her for more days per week (4 days vs 3 days), which constitutes having "day-to-day care and responsibility" for the majority of the time.
