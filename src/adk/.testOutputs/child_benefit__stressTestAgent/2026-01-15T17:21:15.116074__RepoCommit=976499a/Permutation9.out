2026-01-15T17:25:03.345548 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child, as Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for the child.)

2026-01-15T17:25:04.700484 [actor]: I'll play the role of Lars in this scenario, responding in an obtuse, search-engine-like manner without directly answering the agent's questions.

30 years old German UK

2026-01-15T17:25:06.424441 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Just to clarify, you are 30 years old and a UK resident originally from Germany.

To assess your potential eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand if you are responsible for a child under 20. Do you have a child or children under the age of 20? Please answer with a simple yes or no.





2026-01-15T17:25:07.115074 [actor]: Son Hans five years pre settled status

2026-01-15T17:25:08.606131 [root_agent]: Thank you. So, you have a son named Hans who is five years old and has pre-settled status.

Child Benefit rules depend on the child's nationality and immigration status. To confirm, are you the parent or legal guardian of Hans? A simple 'yes' or 'no' will be fine for now.





2026-01-15T17:25:09.884850 [actor]: Yes looking for work pre settled jobseeker

2026-01-15T17:25:11.399560 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. You are Hans' parent/legal guardian, and you are currently looking for work with pre-settled status as a jobseeker.

Now, to clarify your own status further: are you employed, self-employed, or currently unemployed? Knowing this helps determine your eligibility based on National Insurance number requirements.

2026-01-15T17:25:12.253143 [actor]: Unemployed jobseeker registered Hans school

2026-01-15T17:25:13.305563 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You are unemployed and registered as a jobseeker, and Hans is at school.

To confirm, do you have a valid National Insurance number? This is a key requirement for claiming Child Benefit.

2026-01-15T17:25:14.132150 [actor]: Yes NI number German citizen EU settlement scheme

2026-01-15T17:25:16.553575 [root_agent]: Okay, excellent. You have a National Insurance number, and you're a German citizen with status under the EU Settlement Scheme. 

Given the information so far – you are the parent of a 5-year-old son with pre-settled status, you are unemployed and actively seeking work, and you have a valid National Insurance number through the EU Settlement Scheme – it *appears* you are likely eligible for Child Benefit.

However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that you are responsible for Hans' care and that he lives with you for the majority of the time?

2026-01-15T17:25:17.448954 [actor]: Hans lives with me permanent address registered school

2026-01-15T17:25:20.677423 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Hans lives with you permanently and is registered at a school at your address.

Based on all the information you've provided: you are over 18, you have a valid National Insurance number, you are responsible for the care of your 5-year-old son Hans who has pre-settled status and lives with you, and you are actively seeking work – it is **highly likely** that you are eligible for Child Benefit.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. I strongly recommend you review the official government guidance here: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility to ensure you meet all criteria and to understand the application process.

Would you like me to summarise the key eligibility requirements based on our conversation?

2026-01-15T17:25:22.526792 [actor]: Thank you for information child benefit eligible jobseeker

2026-01-15T17:25:24.019016 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent appropriately determined that as a parent with pre-settled status, valid NI number, and responsible for a child with pre-settled status living with them, the user is likely eligible for Child Benefit.
