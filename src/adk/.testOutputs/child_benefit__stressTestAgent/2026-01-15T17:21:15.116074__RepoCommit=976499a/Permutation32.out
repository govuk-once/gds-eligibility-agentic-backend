2026-01-15T17:37:55.842710 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child, as eligibility is based on that relationship).



**My thought process:**

I am starting with age as it establishes if the person is the claimant (parent/guardian) or the child. Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for the child, *not* the child themselves. I'm referencing the general eligibility page ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)) which outlines that you must be responsible for a child to claim.

2026-01-15T17:37:56.603328 [actor]: John 17 college student

2026-01-15T17:38:00.384570 [root_agent]: Thank you for the clarification. Knowing you are a 17-year-old college student is helpful. 

To clarify, are you claiming Child Benefit *for* a child, or are you asking if *you* are eligible to *receive* Child Benefit as a young person?



**My thought process:**

The added context is a little ambiguous. A 17-year-old college student is unlikely to be a parent claiming *for* a child. They may, however, be a young person still in education who is wondering if *they* can receive Child Benefit. The rules state benefits are typically paid to parents/guardians. I need to determine which scenario applies before proceeding. I'm referencing the general eligibility page ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)) to confirm the claimant must be responsible for a child.

2026-01-15T17:38:01.038112 [actor]: father benefits me

2026-01-15T17:38:04.481863 [root_agent]: Okay, so your father is claiming Child Benefit *for* you. That's very helpful to know.

To assess eligibility, could you please confirm your date of birth? Knowing this will help determine if you're under 16, or 16-20 and in approved education or training.



**My thought process:**

This clarifies that the actor is the child, and their father is the claimant. Eligibility depends on the child's age and education status. The key age thresholds are under 16, and 16-20 while in approved education/training (as per [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)). I need the date of birth to determine which of these categories the actor falls into.

2026-01-15T17:38:05.223072 [actor]: 17 years old living with father

2026-01-15T17:38:08.159227 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. As you are 17 years old and living with your father, the next thing to check is whether you are in approved full-time education or an approved apprenticeship. Are you currently in full-time education or an approved apprenticeship?



**My thought process:**

The actor is 17 and lives with their father, so meets the residency requirement. However, to continue being eligible *after* age 16, they need to be in approved full-time education or an approved apprenticeship ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)). I need to confirm this to proceed with the eligibility assessment.

2026-01-15T17:38:09.087753 [actor]: resitting two GCSEs at local college 6 hours a week

2026-01-15T17:38:12.603818 [root_agent]: Thank you. Resitting GCSEs at college 6 hours a week *may* count as approved education, but it depends on the level and type of course. 

Could you please confirm if this course is equivalent to A-Levels or is a full-time course?



**My thought process:**

Resitting GCSEs is a step in the right direction, however, the GOV.UK guidance specifies that 16-20 year olds must be in *approved* education. Simply attending a course isn’t enough. ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)). The guidance states that courses equivalent to A-Levels are considered approved. Similarly, full-time courses also qualify. I need to ascertain whether the current arrangement meets these criteria.

2026-01-15T17:38:13.412865 [actor]: two GCSEs spend rest time gaming

2026-01-15T17:38:18.556751 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Based on the information provided – resitting two GCSEs with the rest of your time spent gaming – it’s unlikely that this qualifies as approved full-time education for Child Benefit purposes. 

To be eligible after age 16, the education needs to be a substantial, structured course, like A-Levels, or a full-time course with a significant number of guided learning hours. Spending the majority of your time gaming suggests this isn’t a full-time or equivalent educational commitment.

Therefore, it’s unlikely your father would be eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit for you. Would you like me to explain this further, or summarise the key points?



**My thought process:**

The actor is spending the majority of their time gaming *outside* of the 6 hours of GCSE resitting. This strongly suggests they are not engaged in full-time education or a qualifying apprenticeship. The key criteria for 16-20 year olds is being in approved full-time education, and this situation doesn’t meet that requirement ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)). I am delivering this information politely and offering to reiterate or summarise.

2026-01-15T17:38:22.457681 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly assessed that a 17-year-old only resitting two GCSEs for 6 hours per week while spending the rest of their time gaming does not qualify as approved full-time education required for Child Benefit eligibility for 16-20 year olds.
