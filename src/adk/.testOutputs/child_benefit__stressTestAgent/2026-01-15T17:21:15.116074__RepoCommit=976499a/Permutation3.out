2026-01-15T17:21:55.575928 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-15T17:21:56.712347 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Gary 50 son ben 17

2026-01-15T17:21:58.371935 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Gary. So you are 50 years old and your son Ben is 17. 

To clarify, is Ben currently in full-time education or an approved training course? (This is important as Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 16, unless they are in full-time education or approved training).

2026-01-15T17:21:59.269399 [actor]: ben no school june looking apprenticeship

2026-01-15T17:22:01.715613 [root_agent]: Okay, so Ben finished school in June and is currently looking for an apprenticeship.

Given this information, and to be sure I understand correctly, is Ben actively applying for apprenticeships, or does he have a confirmed start date for one? Child Benefit can continue while a young person is actively seeking employment or training after leaving education.

2026-01-15T17:22:02.524305 [actor]: registered youth careers service looking apprenticeship

2026-01-15T17:22:03.767775 [root_agent]: That's good to know, Gary. So Ben is registered with the youth careers service and actively looking for an apprenticeship.

Now, regarding your National Insurance number - do you have a National Insurance number? (Having a National Insurance number is a requirement to claim Child Benefit).

2026-01-15T17:22:04.576125 [actor]: yes have national insurance

2026-01-15T17:22:05.978424 [root_agent]: Great, that's another requirement ticked off.

To help me assess your eligibility further, Gary, what is your annual income? (There are income limits that can affect Child Benefit, particularly if you earn over £50,000). You don't need to be exact, a range is fine.

2026-01-15T17:22:06.953852 [actor]: job at factory 30,000

2026-01-15T17:22:08.050978 [root_agent]: Okay, Gary, so your annual income from your job at the factory is £30,000.

Finally, is Ben living with you? (This is important as there are different rules if a child lives with someone else).

2026-01-15T17:22:08.691919 [actor]: ben lives me

2026-01-15T17:22:12.281452 [root_agent]: Okay, Gary. Just to confirm, Ben lives with you, you are 50, he is 17, finished school in June and is seeking an apprenticeship with the youth careers service, you have a National Insurance number, and your income is £30,000.

Based on this information, it appears you *are* likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Ben. Child Benefit can continue to be paid as long as Ben is looking for work or training after leaving school and is under 20. Your income is also below the threshold that would affect your entitlement.

However, it's important you inform HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) that Ben is no longer in full-time education. You can do this through the government website. 

Would you like me to summarise this again, or is there anything else I can help you with?





2026-01-15T17:22:13.386778 [actor]: thank you eligible

2026-01-15T17:22:16.727116 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately stated that Gary is eligible for Child Benefit for his 17-year-old son who has left school in June and is actively seeking an apprenticeship through the youth careers service, which aligns with the Child Benefit extension rules for young people up to age 20 who are looking for work or training after leaving education.
