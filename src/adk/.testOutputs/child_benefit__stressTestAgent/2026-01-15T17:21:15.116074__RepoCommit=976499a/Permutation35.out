2026-01-15T17:39:07.193066 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).



**My Thought Process:**

The initial question is to determine *who* is asking about eligibility. Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for a child. Knowing the age of the person asking helps establish if they are likely a parent/guardian. This is the first step in navigating the eligibility criteria. I am deliberately avoiding asking about the child's age at this stage, as it's important to correctly identify the claimant first.


2026-01-15T17:39:08.484574 [actor]: my son Rashid

2026-01-15T17:39:10.568726 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you are referring to your son, Rashid. 

To assess eligibility, could you please tell me how old Rashid is?



**My Thought Process:**

Now I know the claimant is a parent/guardian and the child is named Rashid. The age of the child is a primary eligibility factor – Child Benefit is generally available for children under 20, but there are conditions relating to education/training. I'm focusing on this next as it's a core requirement.

2026-01-15T17:39:11.226097 [actor]: 17

2026-01-15T17:39:13.395554 [root_agent]: Okay, Rashid is 17 years old.

Is Rashid currently in full-time education or approved training? (For example, A-Levels, an apprenticeship, or a college course).



**My Thought Process:**

Rashid being 17 means eligibility depends on whether he meets the education/training criteria. The rules state that benefit can continue to be claimed as long as your child is under 20 *and* in approved full-time education or training. I need to establish this before proceeding.

2026-01-15T17:39:14.060793 [actor]: a-levels

2026-01-15T17:39:16.530440 [root_agent]: Great, Rashid is studying A-Levels, which qualifies as approved full-time education.

Now, just to confirm, are you currently working over 41 hours a week on average?



**My Thought Process:**

Since Rashid is 17 and in full-time education, he meets those key criteria. The next eligibility factor to consider is the parent's (that’s you) income and working hours. If the parent earns over a certain amount, or works more than 41 hours a week, it can affect eligibility. I'm asking about the working hours first.

2026-01-15T17:39:17.151672 [actor]: dont know

2026-01-15T17:39:19.409932 [root_agent]: Okay, that's alright. Could you tell me roughly how much you earn *before* tax, per week? Even an estimate is helpful.



**My Thought Process:**

The claimant doesn't know their working hours. Income is another key factor, and is often easier to estimate than precise hours worked. I'm asking for pre-tax income as that's what the guidelines use for the income threshold. I'm phrasing it as 'roughly' to encourage a best estimate rather than requiring exact figures.

2026-01-15T17:39:20.168158 [actor]: family business not salary

2026-01-15T17:39:22.774516 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about the family business. This can make things a little more complex! 

To help me understand your situation, could you estimate your average weekly profit from the family business *before* any tax is taken off?



**My Thought Process:**

A family business without a formal salary changes the income assessment. Child Benefit eligibility is affected by earnings, and in this case, it’s the profit from the business that counts. I'm specifically asking for profit *before* tax, as that is what HMRC uses to determine eligibility. It’s important to be clear about this to give accurate guidance.

2026-01-15T17:39:23.403145 [actor]: married son

2026-01-15T17:39:25.241730 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Just to be absolutely sure I understand - your son, Rashid, is married?



**My Thought Process:**

This information about Rashid being married is unexpected and potentially significant. Marriage doesn't automatically disqualify someone from Child Benefit, but it *could* affect eligibility if Rashid is financially independent. I need to confirm this information before proceeding, as it changes the context considerably. It's crucial to get this right.

2026-01-15T17:39:25.964871 [actor]: yes married lives with us with wife

2026-01-15T17:39:29.843007 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that Rashid is married and currently lives with you and his wife.

Given this information, it’s likely you are *not* eligible for Child Benefit for Rashid. Child Benefit usually stops when a child gets married or forms a civil partnership, even if they continue to live at home and are in full-time education. 

However, there are exceptions if Rashid is dependent on you financially. Could you please confirm if Rashid and his wife are financially independent, or do they rely on you for financial support?



**My Thought Process:**

Rashid's marriage, while living at home, is a significant factor. The general rule is that Child Benefit stops upon marriage. However, the rules state there are exceptions if the married child is financially dependent on the claimant. Therefore, I need to ascertain Rashid’s financial independence to provide a definitive answer. I’m explaining the likely outcome upfront while simultaneously gathering the crucial information needed to confirm.

2026-01-15T17:39:30.707864 [actor]: supporting both no income

2026-01-15T17:39:34.418611 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Rashid and his wife have no income and are financially supported by you, despite being married, you *are* likely still eligible to claim Child Benefit for Rashid.

The rules state that Child Benefit can continue if a married or civil partnered young person is under 20 and is dependent on you financially.

Would you like me to summarise the key points for you, and confirm that you meet the criteria based on our conversation?



**My Thought Process:**

This is a key exception to the general rule – a married child can still qualify for Child Benefit if they are financially dependent on their parents. Given the claimant has confirmed Rashid and his wife have no income and are financially supported by them, they likely *do* meet the criteria. I’m offering to summarise to ensure understanding and give the claimant confidence in the assessment.

2026-01-15T17:39:37.821089 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that Child Benefit can be claimed for a 17-year-old married child who is in full-time education (A-levels) and financially dependent on the parent.
