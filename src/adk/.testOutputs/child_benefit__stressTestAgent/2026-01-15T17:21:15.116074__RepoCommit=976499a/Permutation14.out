2026-01-15T17:27:30.679809 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for the child, and your age can affect eligibility).

2026-01-15T17:27:31.365888 [actor]: child benefit for Noah 6

2026-01-15T17:27:32.657794 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you are asking about Child Benefit for a child named Noah who is 6 years old.

To assess eligibility, let's start with your relationship to Noah. Are *you* Noah’s parent, or do you have parental responsibility for Noah?

2026-01-15T17:27:33.386120 [actor]: mother

2026-01-15T17:27:33.991142 [root_agent]: Okay, great. So you are Noah's mother. 

Now, are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-15T17:27:34.677164 [actor]: yes uk living

2026-01-15T17:27:36.039740 [root_agent]: Excellent. You are Noah's mother and you live in the UK.

To confirm, are you working, or do you have any income? (This helps determine eligibility, as income doesn’t affect Child Benefit). It’s okay if you do, it just helps me understand your situation.

2026-01-15T17:27:36.640181 [actor]: after surgery income

2026-01-15T17:27:37.930528 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you're currently receiving income after surgery. 

To clarify, is this income from employment, or is it from another source such as benefits or a pension? Knowing the source of income doesn’t change eligibility, but helps me understand the situation fully.

2026-01-15T17:27:38.711171 [actor]: work pay while recovering

2026-01-15T17:27:39.588543 [root_agent]: Okay, so you are receiving pay from your work while recovering from surgery. That's good to know.

Now, is Noah living with you full-time?

2026-01-15T17:27:40.201385 [actor]: with grandmother right now

2026-01-15T17:27:41.503307 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Noah is currently living with his grandmother.

To understand the situation fully, is this a temporary arrangement while *you* recover from surgery, or is it a more permanent living arrangement? Knowing this will help me determine if you can still claim Child Benefit.

2026-01-15T17:27:42.187717 [actor]: 6 weeks for recovery

2026-01-15T17:27:44.376152 [root_agent]: Okay, so Noah is living with his grandmother temporarily for 6 weeks while you recover from surgery. That’s helpful to know.

Given that Noah is living with his grandmother for a defined, relatively short period due to your recovery, and you are his mother, you are *likely* still eligible to claim Child Benefit. The rules allow for temporary absences from the usual care of the child.

However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that you still provide financial support for Noah while he is staying with his grandmother?

2026-01-15T17:27:45.011045 [actor]: yes money for noah

2026-01-15T17:27:47.814225 [root_agent]: That's good to know - you are providing financial support for Noah.

Based on the information you’ve provided: you are Noah’s mother, you live in the UK, you are providing financial support for Noah, and Noah is temporarily living with his grandmother for 6 weeks while you recover from surgery.

It seems very likely that you *are* eligible to claim Child Benefit. However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. 

I recommend you review the information on the UK government website to confirm and to understand the claiming process: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T17:27:51.272910 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit during a temporary absence when the child is staying with a grandmother for 6 weeks during parental recovery from surgery, as this is considered a temporary arrangement and the parent continues to financially support the child.
