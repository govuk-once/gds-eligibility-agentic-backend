2026-01-15T17:26:08.115183 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-15T17:26:09.060899 [actor]: I'm looking to find out about child benefit for my son

2026-01-15T17:26:09.909822 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying you are looking to claim for your son. 

To best assess your eligibility, could you please tell me how old your son is?

2026-01-15T17:26:10.559627 [actor]: Ryan 17

2026-01-15T17:26:11.970763 [root_agent]: Thank you. As Ryan is 17, Child Benefit will continue as long as he is:

* in full-time education
* an unpaid apprentice
* actively seeking work (and registered with the relevant authorities)

Is Ryan currently in full-time education, an unpaid apprentice, or actively seeking work and registered?

2026-01-15T17:26:12.652535 [actor]: Intermediate Apprenticeship started

2026-01-15T17:26:14.114169 [root_agent]: That’s good to know! An Intermediate Apprenticeship qualifies as eligible education for Child Benefit purposes.

Now, are *you* currently working over 8 hours a week (on average)? This is relevant because your earnings can affect the amount of Child Benefit you receive, particularly if you earn over £50,000 a year.

2026-01-15T17:26:14.734729 [actor]: Job works 40 hours

2026-01-15T17:26:16.581422 [root_agent]: Thank you. Working 40 hours a week means you are working significantly over 8 hours a week.

To confirm, is your annual income over £50,000? There's a reduction in Child Benefit if your income is between £50,000 and £60,000, and it’s stopped completely if you earn over £60,000.

2026-01-15T17:26:17.419485 [actor]: 44000 pounds salary

2026-01-15T17:26:19.336649 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful. With a salary of £44,000, you are below the threshold where Child Benefit is affected. 

Therefore, based on the information you've provided, you *are* likely eligible to claim Child Benefit for your 17-year-old son who is undertaking an Intermediate Apprenticeship.

Would you like me to summarise the key points, or do you have any other questions?





2026-01-15T17:26:20.015953 [actor]: Government funded apprenticeship England

2026-01-15T17:26:21.712685 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that it’s a government-funded apprenticeship in England. That’s good to know, and it does indeed confirm his eligibility as long as the apprenticeship continues.

Just to be absolutely certain, and to cover all bases – are you Ryan’s parent, or do you have legal care of him? Child Benefit is usually paid to the person with main responsibility for the child.

2026-01-15T17:26:22.535353 [actor]: Ryan lives at home with me

2026-01-15T17:26:24.674835 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful. As Ryan lives at home with you, it suggests you have main responsibility for him.

Based on all the information you’ve provided – your son is 17, doing a government-funded apprenticeship in England, you work over 8 hours a week with a salary under £50,000, and he lives with you – it appears you *are* eligible for Child Benefit.

Do you have any other questions, or would you like me to summarise everything again?

2026-01-15T17:26:25.470722 [actor]: I'm his mother

2026-01-15T17:26:27.544268 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you are Ryan's mother. That confirms you are the parent with main responsibility.

So, to summarise: your son Ryan is 17 years old, undertaking a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England, he lives at home with you, and you are his mother earning under £50,000 a year. 

Based on this information, you *are* eligible to receive Child Benefit for Ryan.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T17:26:31.023618 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility because 17-year-olds in approved education (including government-funded apprenticeships) are eligible for Child Benefit, and the parent's income of £44,000 is below the £50,000 threshold where reductions begin.
