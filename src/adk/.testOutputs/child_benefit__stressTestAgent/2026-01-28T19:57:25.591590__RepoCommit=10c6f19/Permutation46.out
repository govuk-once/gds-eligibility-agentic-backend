2026-01-28T20:23:49.885962 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:23:51.388645 [actor]: child benefit eligibilty pre settled status jobseeker

2026-01-28T20:23:53.344267 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you a specific question to start assessing your eligibility:

**Do you currently have a child or children who are either under 16 years old, or under 20 years old and in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:23:54.836236 [actor]: yes got child 3 years old no job 95 days now

2026-01-28T20:23:57.129975 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a 3-year-old child and have been without a job for 95 days.

Let me ask you the next important question:

**Are you responsible for the child? This means - do you live with the child and are you the person who looks after them day-to-day?**

2026-01-28T20:23:58.408344 [actor]: yes live with child look after them

2026-01-28T20:24:00.266420 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Now, let me ask about your immigration status:

**You mentioned you have pre-settled status. Can you confirm whether you currently have pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, and are you living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:24:01.488091 [actor]: yes pre settled status uk living here now

2026-01-28T20:24:03.644566 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to understand your work situation a bit better, as this can affect eligibility for people with pre-settled status:

**Before you stopped working 95 days ago, were you working in the UK? And if so, for how long were you working here?**

2026-01-28T20:24:05.000614 [actor]: was working before stopped 95 days ago looking for work

2026-01-28T20:24:06.734126 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me ask a follow-up question about your work history:

**How long were you working in the UK before you stopped 95 days ago? For example, were you working for several months, a year, or longer?**

2026-01-28T20:24:08.224818 [actor]: worked 6 months before stopped

2026-01-28T20:24:10.068736 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Now I need to ask about your current status:

**Are you currently registered as a jobseeker with a UK jobcentre or employment service, and are you actively looking for work?**

2026-01-28T20:24:11.464530 [actor]: yes registered jobcentre looking for work actively

2026-01-28T20:24:13.410675 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Let me ask one more important question:

**Is anyone else also claiming Child Benefit for your 3-year-old child? For example, is the child's other parent or another person claiming it?**

2026-01-28T20:24:14.811599 [actor]: no one else claiming just me

2026-01-28T20:24:19.648101 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Let me assess your eligibility based on the information you've provided.

**Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 3-year-old)
✓ You are responsible for the child - you live with them and look after them
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child
✓ You have pre-settled status and are living in the UK
✓ You were working in the UK (for 6 months before stopping)
✓ You are registered as a jobseeker and actively looking for work

**Important:** People with pre-settled status can claim Child Benefit if they have a "right to reside" in the UK. Being a registered jobseeker who was previously working generally gives you this right, particularly for a reasonable period while you're actively seeking work.

However, since immigration and benefit rules can be complex, I would recommend that you **apply for Child Benefit** and let the authorities make the final determination. They will assess your specific circumstances in detail.

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T20:24:21.395552 [actor]: ok thanks understand eligible now

2026-01-28T20:24:25.103312 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to the right to reside rules for Child Benefit, jobseekers with pre-settled status can only retain their right to reside as a jobseeker for up to 91 days. Since the user has been without work for 95 days, they have exceeded this period and no longer have a right to reside, making them ineligible for Child Benefit.
