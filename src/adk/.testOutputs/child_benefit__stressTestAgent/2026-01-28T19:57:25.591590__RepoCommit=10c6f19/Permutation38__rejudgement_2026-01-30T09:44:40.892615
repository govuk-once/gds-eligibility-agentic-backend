**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which is correct. However, the agent failed to accurately communicate the **limitation on backdating** that directly affects the outcome.

The agent stated: "Child Benefit can be backdated for up to 3 months from the date you make your claim. So if you apply now, you should be able to get some of the money you've missed."

This communication is misleading because:

1. The baby is now 4 months old
2. Child Benefit can only be backdated for 3 months
3. This means the user will **lose the first month's benefit** (they can only recover months 2, 3, and 4, not month 1)

The expected outcome explicitly states: "Eligible (but only for the last 3 months; they lose the first month's money)."

While the agent correctly mentioned the 3-month backdating limit, they failed to clearly explain that this means the user will **not** receive all 4 months of payments - they will lose the first month. The phrase "you should be able to get some of the money you've missed" is vague and doesn't clearly communicate that they will lose one month's worth of benefit.

The agent should have explicitly stated: "You are eligible, but because your baby is 4 months old and backdating only covers 3 months, you will receive benefit for the last 3 months but will unfortunately lose the first month's payment."
