**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key Assessment Points:**

1. **Correct identification of the situation:** The agent properly identified that Sofia is 18 years old, left school 2 years ago, is not in approved education or training, and is working as a receptionist.

2. **Accurate application of eligibility criteria:** The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is only available for:
   - Children under 16, OR
   - Young people aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training

3. **Clear communication of ineligibility:** The agent explicitly stated "Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit" and provided clear reasoning.

4. **Proper understanding of the working requirement:** While not explicitly stated in this conversation, the scenario notes that Sofia works 30 hours per week, and the agent correctly determined ineligibility based on her not being in approved education/training.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**, and the explanation provided was accurate, clear, and appropriately referenced the relevant eligibility criteria from gov.uk guidance.
