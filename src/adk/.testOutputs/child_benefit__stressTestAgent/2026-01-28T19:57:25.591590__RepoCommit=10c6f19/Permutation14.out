2026-01-28T20:04:55.057883 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child (or children) who is either:
- Under 16 years old, or
- Under 20 years old and in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T20:04:56.767893 [actor]: child benfit eligibilty 6 year old not livng with me temporarly

2026-01-28T20:04:59.346906 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. I understand you have a 6-year-old child who is not living with you temporarily.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand the situation better:

**Are you responsible for the child** - meaning do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards the child's upbringing (for example, through maintenance payments or providing for their needs)?

2026-01-28T20:05:00.957546 [actor]: grandmother looking after surgery recovery 6 weeks

2026-01-28T20:05:03.698906 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. So your child is temporarily staying with their grandmother for about 6 weeks while you recover from surgery.

This is helpful information. Now, an important question:

**Before you went into hospital/recovery, were you the person receiving Child Benefit for this child, or were you planning to claim it?**

2026-01-28T20:05:05.431467 [actor]: yes i get child benifit already just worried will loose it

2026-01-28T20:05:08.530528 [root_agent]: That's very helpful to know. Let me reassure you about your situation.

Since your child is only temporarily staying with their grandmother for a short period (6 weeks) while you recover from surgery, and you were already receiving Child Benefit, you should still be eligible to continue receiving it. Temporary absences like this, where the child will be returning to live with you, generally don't affect your Child Benefit entitlement.

However, I need to ask one more question to be completely certain:

**Is your child still considered to be part of your household and will definitely be returning to live with you after the 6 weeks?**

2026-01-28T20:05:10.158192 [actor]: yes child coming back after im better

2026-01-28T20:05:13.803524 [root_agent]: Excellent news! Based on the information you've provided, you should remain eligible for Child Benefit.

Here's why: Your 6-year-old child is temporarily staying with their grandmother for about 6 weeks while you recover from surgery, but the child is still part of your household and will be returning to live with you once you're better. This temporary arrangement for medical/recovery reasons does not affect your Child Benefit entitlement.

You should continue to receive your Child Benefit payments as normal during this period. There's no need to notify HMRC about this short temporary arrangement, as your child is still considered to be in your care and will be returning home.

**Is there anything else about your Child Benefit situation that you're concerned about or would like me to clarify?**

2026-01-28T20:05:17.283183 [actor]: no thats all thank you

2026-01-28T20:05:19.930833 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately advised that temporary absence of a child staying with grandmother for 6 weeks during surgery recovery does not affect existing Child Benefit entitlement, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible" and follows the guidance that temporary arrangements where the child remains part of the household do not impact eligibility.
