2026-01-28T20:07:29.818310 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child (under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:07:31.325390 [actor]: child benfit son 20 yrs old studying a levels

2026-01-28T20:07:34.476300 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son is 20 years old and studying A levels, which is helpful to know.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Is your son in full-time approved education or training? Specifically, is he studying at least 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience?**

(A levels typically count as approved education if they meet this requirement)

2026-01-28T20:07:36.058016 [actor]: yes full time a levls studing

2026-01-28T20:07:38.326600 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's good - full-time A level study should qualify as approved education.

Now, let me ask you:

**Are you responsible for your son? This means - does he live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards his upkeep?**

2026-01-28T20:07:39.676229 [actor]: yes he lives with me im responsible

2026-01-28T20:07:41.785978 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you currently living in the UK, or are you a UK citizen or have permission to be in the UK (such as settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or certain visa types)?**

2026-01-28T20:07:43.031683 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T20:07:45.425867 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

One more important question:

**Does anyone else currently claim Child Benefit for your son, or has anyone else been receiving it for him?**

(Only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child)

2026-01-28T20:07:46.774600 [actor]: no just me claiming

2026-01-28T20:07:50.136477 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your 20-year-old son because:

✓ Your son is under 20 years old
✓ He's in full-time approved education (A levels)
✓ He lives with you and you're responsible for him
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

However, there's one more important thing you should be aware of:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 a year?**

This doesn't affect your *eligibility* to claim Child Benefit, but if either of you earns over £50,000, there's a tax charge called the High Income Child Benefit Charge that you should know about.

2026-01-28T20:07:51.590086 [actor]: income 55000 year

2026-01-28T20:07:57.092556 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

So the good news is: **Yes, you are eligible for Child Benefit** for your son.

However, because your income is £55,000 per year (which is over £50,000), you need to be aware of the **High Income Child Benefit Charge**:

- You will have to pay back some of the Child Benefit through your tax return
- The charge is 1% of the Child Benefit amount for every £100 earned over £50,000
- In your case, earning £55,000 means you're £5,000 over the threshold
- This means you'd pay back 50% of the Child Benefit you receive

**You have two options:**

1. **Claim Child Benefit and pay the charge** - You'll receive the full Child Benefit payments but must register for Self Assessment and pay back 50% through your tax return

2. **Opt out of receiving payments** - You can still register for Child Benefit (which protects your son's National Insurance record) but choose not to receive the payments, so you won't have to pay the charge

Does your partner also have an income? If so, what is their annual income? (If their income is higher than yours, the charge would be calculated based on the higher earner)

2026-01-28T20:07:58.434847 [actor]: no partner just me

2026-01-28T20:08:03.294781 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

So to summarize your situation:

**You ARE eligible for Child Benefit**, and you can claim it for your 20-year-old son who is studying full-time A levels.

However, with your income of £55,000:
- You would receive the full Child Benefit payments (currently £25.60 per week for your eldest/only child)
- But you'd need to pay back 50% of it through the High Income Child Benefit Charge via Self Assessment tax return
- This means you'd effectively keep about £12.80 per week

**My recommendation:** Even if you choose not to receive the payments to avoid the tax charge, you should still **register your claim for Child Benefit**. This is important because it ensures your son gets National Insurance credits, which protects his future State Pension.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?**

2026-01-28T20:08:04.636951 [actor]: ok thanks understand now

2026-01-28T20:08:07.505053 [root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify your Child Benefit eligibility and the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Just to recap the key points:
- ✓ You are eligible to claim
- Remember to register even if you opt out of payments (to protect your son's National Insurance record)
- You'll need to complete Self Assessment if you receive the payments

Best of luck with your claim, and if you have any other questions in the future, feel free to ask!

Take care!

2026-01-28T20:08:12.569916 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated the claimant was eligible for Child Benefit for their 20-year-old son, but according to UK government rules, Child Benefit eligibility ceases on the child's 20th birthday regardless of whether they are still in approved education or training.
