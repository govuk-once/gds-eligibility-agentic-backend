2026-01-28T20:16:53.799243 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:16:55.445374 [actor]: child benefit son custody youth center

2026-01-28T20:16:57.863998 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a son who is in a youth center.

To assess your eligibility properly, I need to understand the situation better.

**Is your son currently living in a youth custody center or secure unit as part of a detention order, or is he in a different type of youth center (such as a residential care home)?**

2026-01-28T20:16:59.258186 [actor]: son in custody sentensed 6 months

2026-01-28T20:17:01.372093 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand your son is in youth custody serving a 6-month sentence.

This is an important factor for Child Benefit eligibility. Now I need to ask:

**Before your son went into custody, were you receiving Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T20:17:03.203092 [actor]: yes was claiming child benefit

2026-01-28T20:17:05.179905 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now I need to understand the current timing: **How long has your son been in youth custody so far - has it been more than 8 weeks, or less than 8 weeks?**

2026-01-28T20:17:06.468657 [actor]: been 10 weeks now custody

2026-01-28T20:17:09.763885 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you about an important rule regarding Child Benefit when a child is in custody:

**You can continue to claim Child Benefit for a child in youth custody for up to 8 weeks.** After 8 weeks, you are no longer eligible to receive Child Benefit for that child while they remain in custody.

Since your son has now been in custody for 10 weeks, this means you are currently **not eligible** to receive Child Benefit for him while he remains in youth custody.

However, once your son is released from custody and returns home or to your care, you will be able to claim Child Benefit for him again.

Do you have any other questions about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-28T20:17:14.908820 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the 8-week rule for children in youth custody and correctly concluded that after 10 weeks in custody, I am not eligible for Child Benefit during the remaining period of detention.
