**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user (Chloe, age 15) is **not eligible** to claim Child Benefit for her baby Mia. Specifically, the agent stated: "You cannot claim Child Benefit for Mia yourself while: You're under 16..."

However, the expected outcome is that Chloe is **eligible** to claim Child Benefit for Mia (though it may be financially suboptimal).

According to the Gov.uk guidance on child benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), a person responsible for a child can claim Child Benefit regardless of their own age. The scenario explicitly confirms: "a person under 16 can claim for their own child."

While the agent correctly identified that it might be more financially beneficial for Chloe's parents to claim (as noted in the scenario: "You'll usually get more if [someone responsible for you] claims... on your behalf"), the agent failed to communicate that Chloe **is functionally eligible** to claim.

The agent's statement that "You cannot claim Child Benefit for Mia yourself" directly contradicts the expected outcome of "Eligible (Though potentially financially suboptimal)."

Therefore, the eligibility outcome communicated by the agent does **not** agree with the expected outcome.
