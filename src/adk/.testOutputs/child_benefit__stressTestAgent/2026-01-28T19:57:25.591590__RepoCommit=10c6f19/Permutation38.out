2026-01-28T20:19:04.200215 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have any children, or are you responsible for any children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T20:19:05.916856 [actor]: baby 4 months old forgot form can i get mony back

2026-01-28T20:19:08.080951 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 4-month-old baby - that's helpful to know.

Let me ask you this: Are you the person responsible for the child? In other words, do you live with the baby and are you the main person looking after them?

2026-01-28T20:19:09.758589 [actor]: yes we have baby live with us just forgot paperwork been busy

2026-01-28T20:19:11.676453 [root_agent]: I understand - it's completely normal to be busy with a new baby!

Now, let me ask you: Are you or your partner currently living in the UK?

2026-01-28T20:19:13.103441 [actor]: yes uk live here now

2026-01-28T20:19:15.303725 [root_agent]: That's good. Let me ask another important question:

Do either you or your partner have the right to live in the UK permanently, or do you have a valid visa or immigration status that allows you to claim benefits?

2026-01-28T20:19:16.816298 [actor]: yes we can live here permanent

2026-01-28T20:19:19.180520 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now, one more important question: Is your baby living with you in the UK, or are they living somewhere else (for example, with another family member or in hospital or care)?

2026-01-28T20:19:20.461224 [actor]: baby with us at home

2026-01-28T20:19:23.720827 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you should be eligible for Child Benefit because:
- You have a child under 16 (your 4-month-old baby)
- You're responsible for the child and they live with you
- You live in the UK permanently

Regarding your concern about forgetting the paperwork and whether you can get money back - **yes, you can!** Child Benefit can be backdated for up to 3 months from the date you make your claim. So if you apply now, you should be able to get some of the money you've missed.

The sooner you make your claim, the more backdated payments you'll receive (up to that 3-month limit).

Would you like to know how to make your Child Benefit claim?

2026-01-28T20:19:29.705745 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that Child Benefit can only be backdated for up to 3 months, but according to official guidance, claims can be backdated for up to 3 months from when the claim is made OR from the date the child was born/came to live with you if that's within 3 months - meaning with a 4-month-old baby, the claimant would lose the first month's benefit. The agent failed to clarify this crucial detail that the user would not receive the full 4 months of backdated payments.
