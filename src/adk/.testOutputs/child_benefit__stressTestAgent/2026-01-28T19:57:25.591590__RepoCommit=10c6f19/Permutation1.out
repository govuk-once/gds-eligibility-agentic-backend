2026-01-28T19:57:28.122363 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:57:29.775269 [actor]: child aged 8 yrs manchster leo

2026-01-28T19:57:32.006142 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child aged 8 years old named Leo in Manchester.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Is Leo living with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards Leo's upkeep?**

2026-01-28T19:57:33.337408 [actor]: yes leo lives here with us

2026-01-28T19:57:35.856180 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Leo lives with you.

Now let me ask:

**Are you responsible for Leo? This means you're the main person looking after him - for example, you're his parent or guardian, or you've taken responsibility for caring for him.**

2026-01-28T19:57:37.391479 [actor]: parent sarah and tom both work leo goes to school

2026-01-28T19:57:39.670407 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you're Leo's parent (along with Sarah and Tom who both work), and Leo goes to school.

Let me ask the next important question:

**Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do either of you have a residence permit or visa that states you have "no recourse to public funds"?**

2026-01-28T19:57:41.128668 [actor]: uk nationals both

2026-01-28T19:57:43.533420 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you. So both parents are UK nationals, which means there shouldn't be any immigration-related restrictions.

Now let me ask:

**Is Leo currently living in hospital or in local authority care for more than 12 weeks (or expected to be)?**

2026-01-28T19:57:44.880420 [actor]: no leo at home primary scool

2026-01-28T19:57:47.759845 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Leo is at home and attending primary school.

Let me ask one more important question:

**Are you and your partner's combined income over £60,000 per year? Or does either of you individually earn over £50,000 per year?**

(This is important because if either parent earns over £50,000, you may still be eligible to claim Child Benefit, but there could be a tax charge called the High Income Child Benefit Charge that you'd need to pay back through your tax return.)

2026-01-28T19:57:49.210512 [actor]: tom teachr 35000 sarah part time 15000

2026-01-28T19:57:53.096762 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. So Tom earns £35,000 as a teacher and Sarah works part-time earning £15,000, giving a combined income of £50,000.

Based on all the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's a summary:
- You have a child (Leo, aged 8) under 16
- Leo lives with you
- You're his parents and responsible for him
- You're both UK nationals with no immigration restrictions
- Leo is not in hospital or care for extended periods
- Neither parent earns over £50,000 individually

Since neither Tom nor Sarah earns over £50,000, you won't have to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, so you can receive the full Child Benefit amount without any tax implications.

**You can apply for Child Benefit and should receive it without any deductions.**

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T19:57:58.793392 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria, asked appropriate questions about the child's age, living arrangements, parental responsibility, immigration status, and income thresholds, and correctly concluded that the family is eligible for Child Benefit without any high income charge since neither parent earns over £50,000.
