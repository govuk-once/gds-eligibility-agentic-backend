2026-01-29T18:13:53.164703 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome.

**Justification:**

The expected outcome for this scenario is **Not Eligible**, and the agent clearly communicated this same outcome to the user.

**Key evidence from the transcript:**

1. The agent explicitly stated: "**Based on the information provided, you may NOT be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.**"

2. The agent correctly identified the critical issue: the coding bootcamp is part of "an employer sponsorship and a job agreement afterwards" which "may be considered work-based training or pre-employment training, rather than approved education"

3. The agent appropriately referenced the eligibility guidance, noting that courses "doing a course with an employer's agreement - for example, to get a job" are excluded from approved education

4. The agent confirmed this assessment when the user acknowledged: "Yes, based on what you've told me, it appears you're likely **not eligible**"

**Why this aligns with the expected outcome:**

According to the scenario details and the gov.uk guidance on approved education, courses taken "with an employer's agreement - for example, to get a job" are specifically excluded. Tom's situation (employer-paid coding course with agreement to join them afterwards) falls directly into this excluded category, making him not eligible for Child Benefit.

The agent correctly assessed this situation and communicated the "Not Eligible" outcome, which matches the expected outcome.
