**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit," but the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

According to the scenario details (Permutation 12: The Young Benefit Claimant), the critical factor that makes the applicant ineligible is that **the child (Liam, 18) is claiming Universal Credit in his own right**. 

Per the eligibility criteria referenced in the rules:
- Under Criteria 2 (Child's Benefit Status), you stop getting Child Benefit if the child starts getting **Universal Credit** (or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right.

The agent failed to ask whether the child was receiving any benefits (particularly Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right. This is a crucial question that would have revealed the child's ineligibility and led to the correct outcome of "Not Eligible."

By not asking this essential question, the agent reached an incorrect conclusion that contradicts the expected outcome. The agent communicated an eligibility outcome (**Eligible**) that does not agree with the expected outcome (**Not Eligible**).
