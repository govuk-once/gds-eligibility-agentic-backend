2026-01-28T20:18:21.691943 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:18:23.524855 [actor]: child benefit eligble nina 10 yrs old livs with me now

2026-01-28T20:18:25.289588 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have Nina who is 10 years old and lives with you now.

**Are you responsible for Nina? This means you're the person who is primarily responsible for her day-to-day care and upbringing.**

2026-01-28T20:18:26.875632 [actor]: yes she stays here mums sick cant look aftr her

2026-01-28T20:18:28.810385 [root_agent]: I understand. Nina is staying with you because her mum is sick and can't look after her at the moment.

**Is Nina's mum currently receiving Child Benefit for Nina, or was she receiving it before Nina came to live with you?**

2026-01-28T20:18:30.306707 [actor]: dont no about that just need to no if i can get it

2026-01-28T20:18:31.883676 [root_agent]: That's okay. Let me ask you another important question to assess your eligibility.

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:18:33.059714 [actor]: yes uk

2026-01-28T20:18:34.761199 [root_agent]: Good, thank you. Now I need to understand a bit more about your situation with Nina.

**Is this arrangement with Nina temporary while her mum is sick, or is Nina going to be living with you for a longer period?**

2026-01-28T20:18:36.460668 [actor]: forseable futre dont no how long mums ilness

2026-01-28T20:18:38.443507 [root_agent]: I understand - Nina will be living with you for the foreseeable future while her mum recovers.

**Are you related to Nina, or what is your relationship to her?**

2026-01-28T20:18:39.906907 [actor]: mums best frend

2026-01-28T20:18:42.254397 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're Nina's mum's best friend.

**Has Nina's mum agreed that you should be the one responsible for Nina's care during this time, or have there been any formal arrangements made (such as through social services or the courts)?**

2026-01-28T20:18:43.742531 [actor]: privte arangement councel knows about it

2026-01-28T20:18:45.379899 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. One more question to help assess your eligibility:

**Are you getting any financial support from Nina's mum, or from anyone else, towards Nina's care?**

2026-01-28T20:18:46.826963 [actor]: no nothin no money from mum or councel

2026-01-28T20:18:51.998812 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your situation.

**Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ Nina is 10 years old (under 16)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ Nina lives with you
✓ You're responsible for her day-to-day care
✓ You're not receiving financial support for her from her mum or the council
✓ This is a long-term arrangement for the foreseeable future

**Important points:**

- You can claim Child Benefit even though you're not Nina's parent - the key is that you're responsible for her
- Since Nina's mum might be receiving Child Benefit, only ONE person can claim it for Nina at any time. If her mum is currently claiming it, she would need to stop her claim before you can start yours
- The private arrangement you have is acceptable - you don't need a formal court order

**One final question: Do you or your partner (if you have one) earn over £50,000 a year?** This won't affect your eligibility, but it may affect whether you need to pay a tax charge on the benefit.

2026-01-28T20:18:53.486818 [actor]: no dont earn that much

2026-01-28T20:18:56.968019 [root_agent]: Perfect. Based on everything you've told me, **you are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina**.

**Summary of your situation:**
- Nina (10 years old) lives with you for the foreseeable future
- You're responsible for her care
- You live in the UK
- You're not receiving financial support for her
- You don't earn over £50,000, so you won't face any tax charges

**Next steps:**
You can apply for Child Benefit. However, please be aware that if Nina's mum is currently receiving Child Benefit for her, only one person can claim at a time. Her mum would need to inform Child Benefit that Nina is no longer living with her so her claim can stop, and then you can make your claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-28T20:19:02.238512 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on the criteria: the child is under 16, lives with the user in the UK, the user is responsible for day-to-day care, and correctly noted that only one person can claim at a time (important consideration regarding the mother's potential existing claim).
