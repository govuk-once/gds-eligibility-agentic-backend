2026-01-28T20:22:02.342034 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T20:22:06.669582 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old in Scotland who is doing an apprenticeship.

To help determine your eligibility, I need to understand a bit more about the apprenticeship. Is your 17-year-old's apprenticeship considered "approved education or training"? 

Specifically, is it:
- An unpaid apprenticeship, or
- A course of non-advanced education (meaning below degree level, such as A levels, Scottish Highers, or similar)?

Or is it a paid apprenticeship or employment?

2026-01-28T20:22:11.462672 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your 17-year-old is doing a paid Modern Apprenticeship in Glasgow.

Unfortunately, paid apprenticeships and paid training programs generally don't count as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes. Child Benefit typically only continues past age 16 if the young person is in full-time non-advanced education (like school or college) or unpaid approved training.

However, before I can give you a final answer, I need to ask: Is your child also enrolled in any other education alongside this paid apprenticeship, such as attending college one day a week as part of the apprenticeship program?

2026-01-28T20:22:13.338081 [actor]: no jus the apprenticship fulltime starts at 8am

2026-01-28T20:22:15.321227 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, I need to confirm one more important detail:

Are you responsible for the child? In other words, do they live with you, or are you the main person who looks after them and pays for their upbringing?

2026-01-28T20:22:16.669352 [actor]: yes lives with me im the father

2026-01-28T20:22:20.783134 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, I'm afraid you would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit for your 17-year-old because:

- Child Benefit stops when a child turns 16, **unless** they are in approved full-time non-advanced education or unpaid approved training
- A paid Modern Apprenticeship is considered employment with training, not approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes
- Since your child is 17 and in full-time paid employment/apprenticeship, they don't meet the criteria for Child Benefit to continue

If your child's circumstances change in the future - for example, if they were to leave the apprenticeship and return to full-time college or sixth form education - you may become eligible again at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T20:22:23.505610 [actor]: ok thanks understood

2026-01-28T20:22:25.422883 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that a 17-year-old in a paid Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland does not qualify for Child Benefit, as paid apprenticeships are considered employment rather than approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.
