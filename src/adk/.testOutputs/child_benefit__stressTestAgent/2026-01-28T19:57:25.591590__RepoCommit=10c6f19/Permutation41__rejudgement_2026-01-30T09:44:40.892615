**Justification:**

The agent's assessment **does not align with the expected outcome** for this specific scenario.

**Expected Outcome:** Martin should be **Eligible for Ben (Full Rate), Not Eligible for Jerry** by explicitly allocating his £40 contribution unequally (£26.05 to Ben, £13.95 to Jerry).

**What the Agent Said:** The agent concluded Martin is **not eligible at all** for Child Benefit because the children don't live with him.

**The Critical Error:**

The agent failed to recognize and explore the special provision in Child Benefit rules where a person **not living with the child** can still claim Child Benefit if they contribute **at least the amount of Child Benefit** that would be payable for that child. 

The scenario specifically tests knowledge of:
1. The contribution threshold test (£26.05 for first child, £17.25 for second)
2. The ability to request **unequal allocation** of contributions
3. That Martin pays £40 total, which if allocated as £26.05 + £13.95, would make him eligible for Ben at full rate

The agent should have:
- Asked about the specific amount of contribution (£40)
- Explained the threshold requirements
- Informed Martin about the option to request unequal allocation
- Concluded he could be eligible for Ben (full rate) but not Jerry

Instead, the agent gave a blanket "not eligible" response based solely on the children not living with him, missing the entire contribution-based eligibility pathway that this permutation was designed to test.
