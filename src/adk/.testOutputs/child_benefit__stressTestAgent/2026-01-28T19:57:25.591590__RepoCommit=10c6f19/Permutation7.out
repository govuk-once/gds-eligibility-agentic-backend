2026-01-28T20:00:31.835511 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:00:33.393549 [actor]: son 14 yrs old stayin with me weekends comes home friday to sunday

2026-01-28T20:00:35.877173 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old son who stays with you on weekends (Friday to Sunday).

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Does your son normally live with you, or does he primarily live with someone else during the rest of the week?**

In other words, what is his main residence - is it with you, or with another parent or guardian?

2026-01-28T20:00:37.659451 [actor]: son in care local authority 3 months now but comes home weeknd

2026-01-28T20:00:39.694950 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son has been in local authority care for 3 months but comes home to you on weekends.

This is an important detail. Let me ask:

**Was your son living with you as his main home before he went into local authority care 3 months ago?**

2026-01-28T20:00:41.136377 [actor]: yes was living with me before care

2026-01-28T20:00:43.460516 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now I need to understand more about the care arrangement:

**Is your son expected to return to live with you permanently in the future, or is this a long-term or permanent care arrangement?**

In other words, is the local authority care temporary while issues are being resolved, or is it intended to be a more permanent situation?

2026-01-28T20:00:45.005059 [actor]: dont know yet how long just know he comes home weekends friday evening sunday evening

2026-01-28T20:00:46.991421 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining. I understand the situation is uncertain at the moment.

Let me ask another important question:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your son, or did you receive it before he went into care?**

2026-01-28T20:00:48.879168 [actor]: was getting it before not sure if still get it now

2026-01-28T20:00:50.564919 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask:

**Have you been notified by the local authority or by the Child Benefit Office about any changes to your Child Benefit since your son went into care?**

2026-01-28T20:00:52.276839 [actor]: no notifications havent heard anything

2026-01-28T20:00:54.073397 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know. Now I need to ask:

**Is your son in a children's home, with foster carers, or in another type of care arrangement during the week?**

2026-01-28T20:00:55.547200 [actor]: childrens home during week

2026-01-28T20:00:57.331533 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Now let me ask:

**Are you responsible for contributing to the costs of your son's care, or does the local authority cover all the costs while he's in the children's home?**

2026-01-28T20:00:58.885614 [actor]: local authority pays for it all

2026-01-28T20:01:01.281863 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I have one more important question:

**Are you still involved in making decisions about your son's upbringing and welfare, such as decisions about his education, health, or general wellbeing?**

In other words, do you still have parental responsibility and are you actively involved in his care planning?

2026-01-28T20:01:02.867595 [actor]: yes still make decisions for him still his dad

2026-01-28T20:01:08.188057 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your situation based on what you've told me.

**Based on the eligibility rules, I need to inform you that you are likely NOT eligible for Child Benefit in your current circumstances.**

Here's why:

When a child is in local authority care (such as living in a children's home during the week), the general rule is that Child Benefit cannot be paid to the parent during that time. This applies even though:
- Your son comes home to you on weekends
- You still have parental responsibility and make decisions for him
- The local authority is paying for his care

The key factor is that your son is not living with you as his main residence - he's primarily residing in the children's home under local authority care during the week.

**However**, if your son's care arrangement ends and he returns to live with you permanently, you would be able to claim Child Benefit again at that point.

Since you mentioned you were receiving Child Benefit before and haven't been notified of any changes, you should contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them about your son's current living arrangements to avoid any potential overpayment issues.

Do you have any questions about this assessment?

2026-01-28T20:01:09.792447 [actor]: but he stays 2 nights friday saturdai at home every week

2026-01-28T20:01:14.785792 [root_agent]: I understand this feels unfair, especially since your son is with you every weekend and you're still very much his parent.

However, the rules for Child Benefit when a child is in local authority care are quite specific. Let me clarify:

**The critical factor is where your son's main residence is** - not just how many nights he spends with you. Because he's formally in local authority care and living in a children's home during the school/work week, that is considered his main residence, even though he comes home to you every weekend.

The Child Benefit rules state that when a child is "looked after" by a local authority (which includes living in a children's home), Child Benefit generally cannot be paid to the parent during that period - regardless of weekend visits home.

Let me ask one clarifying question to be absolutely certain:

**Has the local authority formally taken your son into care with a care order, or is this a voluntary arrangement where you've agreed for him to stay in the children's home temporarily?**

This distinction might affect the situation.

2026-01-28T20:01:16.222949 [actor]: voluntary arrangement agreed to it temporary

2026-01-28T20:01:19.513198 [root_agent]: Thank you - that's a very important detail. A voluntary arrangement is different from a formal care order.

Let me ask one more crucial question:

**In this voluntary arrangement, do you still have the legal right to remove your son from the children's home and have him live with you full-time whenever you choose? Or has the local authority placed restrictions on this?**

In other words, could you decide tomorrow that you want him to come back home permanently, or would the local authority need to agree to that?

2026-01-28T20:01:21.221053 [actor]: can bring him home anytime local authority says but trying to sort things out first

2026-01-28T20:01:24.716630 [root_agent]: Thank you - this is a very important distinction that changes the assessment.

Since this is a **voluntary arrangement** where you retain the right to bring your son home at any time, and you haven't lost parental responsibility or control, the situation is different from formal local authority care.

However, I need to ask one final key question to determine eligibility:

**Who is receiving the Child Benefit currently - are you still receiving it, or has anyone else (such as the children's home or local authority) started claiming it for your son?**

This is crucial because only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child at any time.

2026-01-28T20:01:26.460701 [actor]: dont think anyone else claiming it was just coming into my account before

2026-01-28T20:01:31.194815 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on everything you've told me, let me provide you with a clearer assessment:

**You may still be eligible for Child Benefit**, but your situation is complex and you need to take action.

Here's why the situation is uncertain:

In a **voluntary care arrangement** where:
- You retain full parental responsibility
- You can bring your son home at any time
- He regularly stays with you on weekends
- This is temporary while you sort things out

The rules are less clear-cut than formal care orders. The key question is whether your son is considered to be "living with you" or if the children's home is now his main residence.

**What you need to do:**

You must contact the Child Benefit Office immediately to:
1. Inform them of your son's current living arrangements
2. Confirm whether you're still eligible to receive Child Benefit
3. Avoid any potential overpayment issues

They will make the official determination based on your specific circumstances.

**Would you like to know how to contact the Child Benefit Office to clarify your eligibility and ensure your claim is correct?**

2026-01-28T20:01:32.638307 [actor]: so am i eligible or not

2026-01-28T20:01:38.055173 [root_agent]: Based on the rules I need to follow and the information you've provided, I must give you this answer:

**You are likely NOT eligible for Child Benefit while your son is living in the children's home during the week.**

Even though this is a voluntary arrangement and he comes home on weekends, the key factor is that **the children's home is currently his main residence** - that's where he lives most of the time (5 days a week).

Under Child Benefit rules, when a child's main residence is not with you - even in a voluntary care arrangement - you generally cannot claim Child Benefit during that period.

**However**, because:
- This is temporary
- It's voluntary 
- You can bring him home anytime

You **will be eligible again** as soon as your son returns to live with you permanently as his main home.

**Important**: You need to contact the Child Benefit Office to:
- Report the change in circumstances
- Stop any payments you shouldn't be receiving
- Avoid having to repay money later

When your son comes back home to live with you full-time, you can reclaim Child Benefit from that point.

I know this isn't the answer you were hoping for. Do you have any other questions?

2026-01-28T20:01:43.897827 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, when a child in care comes home for at least one night a week, the parent can claim Child Benefit via an exception to the normal rules. The agent failed to identify this exception despite the user clearly stating their son stays home Friday and Saturday nights every week.
