2026-01-30T09:58:36.072223 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent properly assessed the situation by:

1. **Establishing the child's age**: The son is 17 years old (over 16)

2. **Confirming education/training status**: The son is not in approved education or training - he finished his GCSEs in summer 2024 and is currently at home doing nothing

3. **Applying the correct rule**: The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit stops when a young person leaves approved education after turning 16, and that it ended at the end of August 2024

4. **Delivering the correct outcome**: The agent clearly stated "**Unfortunately, you are not currently eligible for Child Benefit for your 17-year-old son**"

The scenario specifies that Jordan (the son) is "NEET" - not in education, employment, or training, and has not registered with any careers service or training program. This means he does not qualify for the 20-week extension available to 16/17-year-olds who register with approved services. The agent's determination that the user is not eligible is accurate and aligns with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
