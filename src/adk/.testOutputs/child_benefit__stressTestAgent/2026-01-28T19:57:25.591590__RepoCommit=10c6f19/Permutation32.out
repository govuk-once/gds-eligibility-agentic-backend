2026-01-28T20:15:54.832543 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T20:15:56.398460 [actor]: 17 year old colege studing gcse

2026-01-28T20:15:58.942668 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old who is studying GCSEs at college.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for this child? By this I mean, does the child live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards their upkeep?

2026-01-28T20:16:00.228092 [actor]: lives with me yes hes my son

2026-01-28T20:16:01.964662 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your 17-year-old son lives with you and is studying GCSEs at college.

Next question: Are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-28T20:16:03.278819 [actor]: uk yes live here

2026-01-28T20:16:05.334100 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming you live in the UK.

Now I need to ask: Do you have an immigration status that allows you to claim benefits in the UK? For example, are you a British citizen, have settled status, or have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-28T20:16:06.770669 [actor]: british citizen born here

2026-01-28T20:16:09.052964 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

One more important question: Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your son, or is anyone else also responsible for him (for example, does he live with anyone else or spend equal time between two households)?

2026-01-28T20:16:10.531768 [actor]: no just me he lives with me only

2026-01-28T20:16:14.307654 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a 17-year-old son who is in approved education (studying GCSEs at college)
✓ He lives with you and you're responsible for him
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You're a British citizen
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

Since your son is under 20 and in approved education or training (GCSEs count as approved education), you meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit. However, please note that if you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000, you may need to pay a tax charge called the High Income Child Benefit Charge, though you can still claim the benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:16:19.483308 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The 17-year-old is studying GCSEs, which are typically taken by students aged 14-16 and are below the level required for approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes (which requires qualifications above Level 2/GCSE standard for 16-19 year olds).
