**Justification:**

The agent made a critical error in this case. According to the UK Child Benefit rules (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), eligibility for Child Benefit **stops when a child turns 20**, even if they are still in approved education or training.

The scenario explicitly states that Dev "celebrates his 20th birthday" and that "Once a child turns 20, they are no longer eligible for Child Benefit, even if they are still finishing their course."

The agent incorrectly told Raj: "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for your 20-year-old son" and later confirmed "You ARE eligible for Child Benefit, and you can claim it for your 20-year-old son who is studying full-time A levels."

This is fundamentally wrong. The son is **20 years old**, which means he has already aged out of Child Benefit eligibility, regardless of his educational status.

**Expected outcome:** Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)

**Agent's communicated outcome:** Eligible

The agent's determination directly contradicts the expected outcome, making this a clear failure to communicate the correct eligibility status.
