**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Reasoning:**

1. The agent identified the key issue: the child (Mark, 15) is in youth custody
2. The agent correctly applied the 8-week rule, stating: "You can continue to claim Child Benefit for a child in youth custody for up to 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, you are no longer eligible"
3. The agent determined that since the child has been in custody for 10 weeks (exceeding the 8-week limit), the user is "currently **not eligible**"
4. This conclusion aligns with the expected outcome: **Not Eligible** (as Mark has been in custody for 10 weeks, exceeding the 8-week threshold)

The agent demonstrated proper understanding of the custody rules for Child Benefit and accurately communicated the ineligibility status to the user. The original judge's assessment (✓) is correct, and my assessment confirms that the eligibility outcome matches expectations.
