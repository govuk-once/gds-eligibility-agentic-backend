**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of private fostering arrangement**: The agent recognized this as a private arrangement where the council is aware but not providing financial support.

2. **Accurate application of eligibility criteria**:
   - Child is under 16 (Nina is 10) ✓
   - User is responsible for day-to-day care ✓
   - User lives in the UK ✓
   - No financial support from council or parent ✓

3. **Proper understanding of private fostering rules**: The agent correctly determined that private fosterers who are financially supporting the child CAN claim Child Benefit, unlike council-paid foster carers who cannot.

4. **Important caveat mentioned**: The agent appropriately noted that only one person can claim at a time, so if Nina's mother is currently claiming, she would need to stop her claim first.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome that Carol (the private fosterer) is eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina, as she is providing care and financial support without receiving payments from the council.
