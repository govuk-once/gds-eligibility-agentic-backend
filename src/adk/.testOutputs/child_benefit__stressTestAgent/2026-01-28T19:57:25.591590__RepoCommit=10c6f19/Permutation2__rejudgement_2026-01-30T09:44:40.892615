**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Assessment of the agent's reasoning:**

1. **Responsibility for the child**: The agent confirmed the user is responsible for his 17-year-old daughter ✓

2. **Child's age and education status**: The agent correctly identified that while the daughter is over 16, she qualifies because she is under 20 AND in approved full-time education (A-levels at college) ✓

3. **Residency**: The agent confirmed UK residency (London) with no immigration restrictions ✓

4. **Living arrangements**: The agent verified the daughter lives with the applicant ✓

5. **Final determination**: The agent clearly communicated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided a comprehensive summary of why all criteria were met ✓
