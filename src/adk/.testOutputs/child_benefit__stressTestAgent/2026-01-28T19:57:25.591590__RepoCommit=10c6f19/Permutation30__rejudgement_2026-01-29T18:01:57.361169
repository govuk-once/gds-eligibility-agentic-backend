**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user **is eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome: "Eligible (Lucas receives money; Emily pays the tax)."

Key points supporting this assessment:

1. **Eligibility Confirmed**: The agent clearly stated "you can claim Child Benefit" and "You're eligible" multiple times throughout the conversation.

2. **Correct Tax Liability**: The agent accurately explained that while Lucas (the claimant earning £18,000) is eligible to receive the payments, Emily (the higher-earning partner at £65,000) would be responsible for paying back 100% of the benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

3. **Accurate Application of Rules**: The agent correctly identified that:
   - Lucas meets all eligibility criteria
   - Emily's income exceeds £60,000
   - The tax charge would equal the full Child Benefit amount
   - Emily would need to complete Self Assessment

4. **Clear Communication**: The agent presented both options (claim with payments vs. claim without payments) while maintaining that Lucas is fundamentally eligible.

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome perfectly: Lucas is eligible and can receive the money, while Emily bears the tax liability due to her higher income.
