**Justification:**

The agent failed to communicate the correct eligibility outcome. According to the expected outcome, the user should be **Eligible** for Child Benefit.

The key issue is that the agent incorrectly applied the 12-week hospitalization rule without properly considering the international exception. According to gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit, when a child goes abroad **specifically for hospital treatment** and the parent continues to spend money on them, Child Benefit eligibility continues even beyond the standard 12-week hospitalization period.

The scenario clearly states:
- The child (Oliver, 14) went to the USA specifically for specialist hospital treatment for a rare condition
- The mother (Hannah) remains in the UK but pays for incidental costs and visits when possible
- The international exception applies: "if a child is in hospital abroad, and they only went abroad to be in hospital, eligibility continues (provided the parent is still spending money on them)"

The agent repeatedly told the user they were "NOT eligible under standard rules" and only suggested they "might" qualify for an exception. This created confusion and led the user to believe they were ineligible. The agent should have confidently stated the user **is eligible** because the international hospital exception directly applies to their situation - the child went abroad specifically for treatment, and the parent continues to contribute financially.

The correct outcome should have been a clear statement of eligibility based on the international hospital treatment exception, not a qualified "not eligible under standard rules but maybe eligible under exceptions."
