**Justification:**

The agent communicated that Karen is **eligible** for Child Benefit, stating that Ryan's apprenticeship counts as "approved training." However, this is **incorrect**.

According to the expected outcome and UK government rules, **apprenticeships in England are disqualifying events** for Child Benefit purposes. While unpaid approved training courses may qualify, apprenticeships are considered paid employment and do NOT count as "approved education or training" under Child Benefit rules.

Since Ryan is 17 and has started an apprenticeship, he no longer qualifies for Child Benefit. The expected outcome is that Karen is **Not Eligible** and must stop her claim.

The agent's eligibility determination (Eligible) **does not agree** with the expected outcome (Not Eligible), making this a failed assessment.
