**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, stating "You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit." However, the expected outcome for this scenario is **Not Eligible**.

According to the scenario details (Permutation 12), this case involves Liam (18), who is studying for A-levels but has successfully claimed Universal Credit in his own right. The criteria clearly state: "you stop getting Child Benefit if the child starts getting **Universal Credit** (or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right."

The critical issue is that the agent failed to ask whether the child receives certain benefits (Universal Credit, ESA, Income Support, or tax credits) in their own right. This is a crucial eligibility criterion that would disqualify the claim. The agent only asked about:
1. Child's age and education status
2. Responsibility for the child
3. UK residence
4. Whether anyone else is claiming

The agent never inquired about the child's benefit status, which is the disqualifying factor in this scenario. Had this question been asked and answered truthfully (that the child receives Universal Credit), the agent should have determined the applicant to be **Not Eligible**.

Therefore, the agent communicated an eligibility outcome (Eligible) that does **not** agree with the expected outcome (Not Eligible).
