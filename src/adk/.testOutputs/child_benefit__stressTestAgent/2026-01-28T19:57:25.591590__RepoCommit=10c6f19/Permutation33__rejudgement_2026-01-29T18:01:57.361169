**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of employment status**: The agent properly identified that Bella is employed by the travel agency and earning a wage, not just in training.

2. **Accurate application of eligibility criteria**: The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds requires either:
   - Full-time non-advanced education (at least 12 hours/week supervised study), OR
   - Approved training courses
   
   The agent recognized that employer-paid training as part of paid employment does not meet these criteria.

3. **Alignment with expected outcome**: The scenario explicitly states that training paid for by an employer does NOT count as "approved" education for Child Benefit purposes. The agent's conclusion matches this requirement.

4. **Clear communication**: The agent provided a clear explanation of why Bella doesn't qualify, citing that she is in paid employment rather than qualifying education or training.

The evaluation judge's assessment (✓) also agrees with this conclusion. The agent successfully communicated the correct eligibility outcome: **Not Eligible**.
