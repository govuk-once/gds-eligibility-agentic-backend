**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct identification of key facts:** The agent properly identified that the child is 17 years old and enrolled in a paid Modern Apprenticeship in Glasgow, Scotland.

2. **Correct application of rules:** The agent accurately applied the apprenticeship rule, explaining that:
   - Child Benefit continues past age 16 only for approved full-time non-advanced education or unpaid approved training
   - A paid Modern Apprenticeship is considered employment with training, not approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes
   - Therefore, the child does not meet the eligibility criteria

3. **Verification against official guidance:** According to gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, paid apprenticeships (including Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland) do not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes. The agent's determination is consistent with this guidance.

4. **Clear communication:** The agent communicated the ineligibility outcome clearly and provided helpful context about when eligibility might resume (if the child returns to full-time education).

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**, and the reasoning provided is accurate and well-supported by the official Child Benefit rules.
