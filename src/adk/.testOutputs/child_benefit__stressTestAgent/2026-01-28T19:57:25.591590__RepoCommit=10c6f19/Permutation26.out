2026-01-28T20:12:27.762101 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T20:12:29.409395 [actor]: child not livng with me can i still get

2026-01-28T20:12:31.503761 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is an important detail.

To help me assess your situation properly, can you tell me: **Are you responsible for the child**, even though they don't live with you? 

For example, do you contribute to the cost of looking after them?

2026-01-28T20:12:32.976967 [actor]: yes i send money every week for my son

2026-01-28T20:12:35.117113 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Now, can you tell me: **Does your son live with someone else who might also be claiming Child Benefit for him** (such as the other parent, a grandparent, or another relative)?

2026-01-28T20:12:37.132268 [actor]: he lives with his arnt she doesnt clame anything

2026-01-28T20:12:39.667718 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Just to clarify: **Does your son's aunt provide the main day-to-day care for him?** In other words, is she the person primarily responsible for looking after him on a daily basis?

2026-01-28T20:12:40.996961 [actor]: yes she looks after him everyday

2026-01-28T20:12:43.406624 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

This is important: **Only one person can get Child Benefit for the same child.** Since your son's aunt provides the main day-to-day care for him, she would normally be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit - even if she's not currently claiming it.

However, before I give you a final assessment, let me ask: **How old is your son?**

2026-01-28T20:12:45.223244 [actor]: hes 15 and i pay £15 evry week for him

2026-01-28T20:12:50.274671 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, here's my assessment of your eligibility:

**You would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation.** Here's why:

- Your son is 15, so he meets the age requirement (under 16)
- However, Child Benefit can only be claimed by **one person** for the same child
- The person eligible to claim is normally the one who the child lives with and who is responsible for them on a day-to-day basis
- Since your son lives with his aunt and she looks after him every day, **she is the person who would be eligible** to claim Child Benefit for him

The fact that you contribute financially by sending £15 every week shows you're supporting your son, which is commendable. However, this doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit when someone else is providing the main care.

**Important:** Your son's aunt could claim Child Benefit if she's not currently doing so, as she's the primary carer.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T20:12:51.908664 [actor]: but my mum also sends £15 week so thats £30 total does that chang anything

2026-01-28T20:12:56.441329 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information.

No, this doesn't change your eligibility. Here's why:

**The amount of money contributed doesn't determine who can claim Child Benefit.** What matters is:

- Who the child **lives with**
- Who provides the **main day-to-day care** for the child

Since your son lives with his aunt and she is responsible for looking after him every day, she remains the person eligible to claim Child Benefit - regardless of whether you, your mum, or both of you send money to help support him.

The financial contributions you and your mum make (totaling £30 per week) are separate from Child Benefit eligibility. They show you're both supporting your son financially, but they don't transfer the eligibility to claim Child Benefit away from the person providing the daily care.

So the answer remains the same: **your son's aunt is the eligible person to claim Child Benefit**, not you or your mother.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-28T20:12:58.036530 [actor]: ok so im not eligble then

2026-01-28T20:13:00.517965 [root_agent]: That's correct - **you are not eligible to claim Child Benefit** in this situation because your son lives with his aunt and she provides his main day-to-day care.

However, just to be clear: **your son's aunt would be eligible** to claim Child Benefit for him if she isn't already doing so. It might be worth letting her know about this, as she could be missing out on financial support.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit or any other questions you might have?

2026-01-28T20:13:02.566983 [actor]: no thats all i needed to know thanks

2026-01-28T20:13:06.261808 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that only the person providing day-to-day care (the aunt) can claim Child Benefit, and that financial contributions from the parent don't transfer eligibility to them.
