**Justification:**

The agent failed to communicate the correct eligibility outcome. According to the expected outcome, the user should be **Eligible** for Child Benefit.

The key issue is that the agent focused heavily on the "12-week rule" and repeatedly told the user they were "not eligible under standard rules" because the child had been in hospital for 15 weeks. However, according to gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), there is a specific exception: **if a child goes abroad specifically for hospital treatment, Child Benefit can continue as long as the parent is still spending money on them.**

In this scenario:
- The child (Oliver, 14) went to the USA specifically for specialist hospital treatment for a rare condition
- Hannah (the parent) remains a UK resident and continues to pay for the child's costs
- The child will return to the UK after treatment

This situation clearly falls under the international hospital exception, making Hannah **eligible** for Child Benefit despite the stay exceeding 12 weeks.

The agent's repeated statements that the user was "not eligible under standard rules" directly contradicts the expected outcome of "Eligible." While the agent suggested contacting the Child Benefit Office, the primary communication was that of ineligibility, which is incorrect and left the user with the wrong impression that they were not entitled to the benefit.
