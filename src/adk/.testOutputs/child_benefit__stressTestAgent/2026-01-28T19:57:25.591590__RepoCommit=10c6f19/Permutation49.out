2026-01-28T20:25:22.380158 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:25:24.322525 [actor]: child benfit for 17 year old coding cours

2026-01-28T20:25:27.210875 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To determine eligibility, I need to understand more about the coding course your 17-year-old is taking.

**Is the coding course an approved education or training program?** 

Specifically, I need to know if it's:
- Full-time education (at least 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience), or
- Approved training with an approved training provider

2026-01-28T20:25:29.366608 [actor]: coding cours company paying fees job after

2026-01-28T20:25:33.197538 [root_agent]: Thank you for that detail. This is helpful information.

Let me ask a clarifying question: **Is this coding course one where the company is providing it as part of a job or apprenticeship arrangement, or is it a full-time education course that happens to have company sponsorship and a job offer afterwards?**

I'm trying to understand if your 17-year-old is:
- Already employed/in an apprenticeship with this company, OR
- Still in full-time education (at least 12 hours a week of supervised study) that's separate from employment

This distinction is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-28T20:25:34.868837 [actor]: employer agreement join them after not paid now

2026-01-28T20:25:37.427947 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your 17-year-old is currently doing an unpaid coding course with an agreement to join the employer afterwards.

**Is this course full-time education with at least 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience?**

This is important because for Child Benefit purposes, the young person needs to be in approved education or training that meets specific requirements.

2026-01-28T20:25:38.848083 [actor]: coding course employer pays fees

2026-01-28T20:25:41.062182 [root_agent]: Thank you. Let me ask this more directly to clarify:

**How many hours per week of supervised study or coursework does your 17-year-old attend for this coding course?**

I need to know if it meets the requirement of at least 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience to qualify as full-time education for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-28T20:25:42.535535 [actor]: employer agreed course job afterwards

2026-01-28T20:25:45.203679 [root_agent]: I understand the arrangement, but I still need to know the specific details about the course structure.

**How many hours per week does your 17-year-old spend in supervised study or coursework for this coding course?**

For example, is it 10 hours, 15 hours, 20 hours per week? This specific number is important to determine if it qualifies as full-time education for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-28T20:25:46.756267 [actor]: company paying not paid himself agreement join after

2026-01-28T20:25:49.340351 [root_agent]: I understand the financial arrangement, but I need to know about the course hours to assess eligibility.

Let me ask again in a different way: **On a typical week, how many hours does your 17-year-old attend classes, tutorials, or supervised coursework for this coding course?**

This could be online or in-person - I just need to know the total weekly hours of supervised study to determine if the course meets the Child Benefit education requirements.

2026-01-28T20:25:50.750580 [actor]: cours fees paid by future employer

2026-01-28T20:25:53.686431 [root_agent]: I can see you're explaining who pays the fees, but to determine Child Benefit eligibility, I need information about the course structure itself.

**Can you tell me: Is this a full-time course, and if so, how many hours per week does your 17-year-old spend studying?**

Or alternatively, **do you have any course documentation or enrollment information that describes whether it's considered full-time education?**

The key factor for Child Benefit isn't who pays the fees, but whether the course qualifies as approved full-time education (minimum 12 hours per week of supervised study).

2026-01-28T20:25:55.126115 [actor]: employer agreement coding cours not getting paid

2026-01-28T20:25:58.238843 [root_agent]: I understand you're focusing on the employment arrangement, but I really do need specific information about the course itself to help you.

Let me try a simpler approach: **Can you find out from your 17-year-old or from the course provider whether this coding course is classified as "full-time education"?**

Or alternatively: **What is the name or type of this coding course?** (For example: is it a university course, a college course, an apprenticeship, a bootcamp, or another type of program?)

This information will help me determine if it meets the education requirements for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-28T20:25:59.756153 [actor]: specific computer coding cours employer pays he joins them after

2026-01-28T20:26:04.109668 [root_agent]: I appreciate your patience, but I'm finding it difficult to get the specific information I need about the course structure.

Let me be very direct about what I need to know:

**Is your 17-year-old currently enrolled in any form of education or training that involves:**
- Attending classes, lectures, or supervised study sessions?
- If yes, approximately how many hours per week?

**OR, if you don't know those details yet, can you tell me:**
- Has the course already started, or is it about to start?
- Is it run by a school, college, university, or private training provider?

Without understanding the actual structure and time commitment of the course, I cannot assess whether it qualifies as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes. The employment agreement afterwards and who pays the fees don't determine eligibility - it's the nature of the course itself that matters.

2026-01-28T20:26:05.611683 [actor]: taking cours now employer agreement join company coding

2026-01-28T20:26:07.792954 [root_agent]: Thank you - so your 17-year-old is currently taking the coding course now.

**Does your 17-year-old attend this course for at least 12 hours per week?**

This is a yes or no question that will help me determine if it qualifies as full-time education for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-28T20:26:09.275276 [actor]: employer pays fees agreement work there after cours

2026-01-28T20:26:12.485919 [root_agent]: I understand the arrangement with the employer, but I really must know about the course hours to help you with Child Benefit eligibility.

Let me ask you this way: **Can you ask your 17-year-old right now how many hours per week they spend on this coding course - including all class time, tutorials, and supervised study?**

Or if that's not possible: **Are you able to tell me simply whether the course is full-time or part-time?**

I cannot assess your Child Benefit eligibility without this basic information about the course structure. The employer payment arrangement doesn't determine eligibility - only whether the education meets the minimum hour requirements does.

2026-01-28T20:26:13.890670 [actor]: coding bootcamp employer sponsord

2026-01-28T20:26:16.396595 [root_agent]: Excellent! Thank you - that's very helpful information. A coding bootcamp is typically a specific type of program.

**Is this coding bootcamp full-time (usually coding bootcamps run for many hours per day, often 40+ hours per week)?**

Most coding bootcamps are intensive full-time programs, but I need to confirm this is the case for your 17-year-old's bootcamp to assess Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-28T20:26:17.865354 [actor]: full time bootcamp company pays agreement join after

2026-01-28T20:26:20.578085 [root_agent]: Thank you! That's very helpful. So your 17-year-old is in a full-time coding bootcamp.

Now let me ask the next question: **Are you responsible for this 17-year-old?** 

By "responsible," I mean:
- Do they live with you, OR
- Do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards their upkeep (even if they don't live with you)?

2026-01-28T20:26:22.191523 [actor]: responsible yes 17 year old bootcamp

2026-01-28T20:26:24.134888 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Now I need to ask: **Do you currently live in the UK, or are you treated as living in the UK for benefit purposes?**

This is important because you generally need to be living in the UK to claim Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T20:26:25.564511 [actor]: live uk coding bootcamp employer agreement

2026-01-28T20:26:27.302246 [root_agent]: Excellent. Now let me ask: **Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for this 17-year-old?**

For example, is the other parent or another person already receiving Child Benefit for them?

2026-01-28T20:26:28.820536 [actor]: no one else claiming 17 year old bootcamp

2026-01-28T20:26:31.171032 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. I have one more important question:

**Does your 17-year-old live with you, or do they live elsewhere (such as in residential accommodation for the bootcamp, with someone else, or independently)?**

This is important because different rules may apply depending on their living arrangements.

2026-01-28T20:26:32.731704 [actor]: lives with me coding bootcamp

2026-01-28T20:26:39.294624 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me now assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on the information provided, you may NOT be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.**

Here's why:

While your 17-year-old is in a full-time coding bootcamp, the key issue is whether this bootcamp qualifies as **"approved education or training"** for Child Benefit purposes.

For a young person aged 16-19 to qualify, they must be in:
- Full-time non-advanced education (at least 12 hours a week of supervised study), **OR**
- Approved training with an approved training provider (such as certain government-approved schemes)

**The concern is:** A coding bootcamp with an employer sponsorship and a job agreement afterwards may be considered:
- Work-based training or pre-employment training, rather than approved education
- Not provided by an approved training organization for Child Benefit purposes

**What you should do:**
1. Contact the Child Benefit Office directly (0300 200 3100) to check whether this specific bootcamp qualifies as approved education or training
2. Ask the bootcamp provider if they are an approved training provider for Child Benefit purposes
3. Get confirmation in writing about the course status

Would you like guidance on anything else regarding this situation?

2026-01-28T20:26:40.759759 [actor]: ok not eligble bootcamp employer agreement

2026-01-28T20:26:44.355370 [root_agent]: Yes, based on what you've told me, it appears you're likely **not eligible** for Child Benefit in this situation, because the employer-sponsored coding bootcamp with a job agreement afterwards probably doesn't qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

However, I do want to emphasize: **You should still contact the Child Benefit Office directly to confirm this**, as they can assess your specific bootcamp and give you a definitive answer. The number is **0300 200 3100**.

If the bootcamp ends before your child turns 20, and they then move into other approved education or training, you may become eligible at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T20:26:47.584513 [actor]: no thats all thankyou

2026-01-28T20:26:50.131558 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly identified that an employer-sponsored coding bootcamp with a job agreement afterwards likely does not qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes, and appropriately advised contacting the Child Benefit Office for confirmation.
