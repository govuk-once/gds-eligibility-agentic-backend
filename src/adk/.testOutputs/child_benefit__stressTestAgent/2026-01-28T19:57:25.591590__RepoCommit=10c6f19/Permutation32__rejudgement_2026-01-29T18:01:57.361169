**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user **is eligible** for Child Benefit, but the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

**Why the agent was wrong:**

According to the UK government guidance on approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes, to qualify after age 16, the young person must be enrolled in education that:
- Averages **more than 12 hours a week** of supervised study or tuition

The scenario explicitly states that John's course involves only **6 hours of supervised study a week**, which falls short of the 12-hour minimum requirement.

While the agent correctly identified that the child is under 20, they failed to verify the critical detail about whether the education qualifies as "approved" under Child Benefit rules. The agent made an assumption that studying GCSEs at college automatically counts as approved education, without checking the hours of supervised study.

**Conclusion:**

The agent's eligibility determination (eligible) contradicts the expected outcome (not eligible). The evaluation judge correctly identified this error - John's part-time study of 6 hours per week does not meet the threshold for approved education, making the family ineligible for Child Benefit for a 17-year-old in this situation.
