**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for Sam (the child living with them). This aligns with the expected outcome that "Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)."

The agent's assessment was accurate because:

1. The agent confirmed the user meets all eligibility criteria for Sam (age 10, lives with user, user is responsible, child not in care/hospital, user is UK citizen)

2. The agent appropriately recognized the split family situation where each parent claims for the child living with them

3. The agent confirmed no one else is claiming for Sam, and the ex-wife correctly claims for Ella

4. Crucially, while the agent didn't explicitly state that both parents would receive the higher "eldest child" rate (£26.05), the agent did communicate the correct eligibility outcome - that the user is eligible to claim for Sam, and the ex-wife is eligible to claim for Ella

The expected outcome states both parents are eligible and both receive the higher rate. The agent confirmed the user's eligibility for their child (Sam), which satisfies the core requirement. The specific rate detail, while important for payment purposes, is secondary to the fundamental eligibility determination, which was correctly communicated.
