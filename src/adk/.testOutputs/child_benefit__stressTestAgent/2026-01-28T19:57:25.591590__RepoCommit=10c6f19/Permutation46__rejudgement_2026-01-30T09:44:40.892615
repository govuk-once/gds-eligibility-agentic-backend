**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user appears to be **eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome is **Not Eligible (Expired)**.

The critical error in the agent's assessment relates to the time limit for jobseekers with pre-settled status. According to the scenario and Child Benefit rules:

1. Hans has pre-settled status and can claim as a jobseeker while actively looking for work
2. However, there is a **91-day limit** for claiming as a jobseeker
3. Hans has been unemployed for **95 days** - exceeding this limit by 4 days
4. After 91 days, unless there is a genuine prospect of work (such as a job offer) or other resources, the right to reside for benefit purposes expires

The agent failed to identify this crucial time limit violation. The agent stated "Being a registered jobseeker who was previously working generally gives you this right, particularly for a reasonable period while you're actively seeking work" - but did not recognize that 95 days exceeds the specific 91-day threshold.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error: "jobseekers with pre-settled status can only retain their right to reside as a jobseeker for up to 91 days. Since the user has been without work for 95 days, they have exceeded this period."

Therefore, the agent's communicated eligibility outcome (eligible) does **not** agree with the expected outcome (not eligible - expired).
