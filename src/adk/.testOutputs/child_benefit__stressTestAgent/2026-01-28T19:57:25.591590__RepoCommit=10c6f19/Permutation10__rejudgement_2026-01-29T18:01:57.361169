**Justification:** The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

The agent properly identified that:
1. Liam is in a formal fostering arrangement
2. The local council pays fostering allowances covering accommodation and maintenance
3. When the local authority is paying for a child's care, the council is considered responsible for the child
4. Therefore, Child Benefit cannot be claimed in this situation

The agent's explanation aligns with the eligibility rules stated in the government guidance (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility) which specifies that you cannot get Child Benefit for children who are being looked after by the local council. The agent communicated this outcome clearly and accurately to the user.
