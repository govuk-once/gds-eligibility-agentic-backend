**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Child's Age Verified**: The agent confirmed the daughter is 12 years old (under 16) ✓

2. **Contribution Assessment**: The agent properly evaluated the user's £120 contribution every 4 weeks:
   - This averages to £30/week (£120 ÷ 4 weeks)
   - This exceeds the £26.05 weekly Child Benefit threshold
   - The agent recognized this as a valid "lump sum" contribution pattern ✓

3. **UK Residency Confirmed**: The agent verified the user lives and works in the UK ✓

4. **Single Claimant Rule**: The agent appropriately addressed that only one person can claim Child Benefit per child, and worked under the user's assumption that the mother is not claiming it ✓

5. **Final Determination**: The agent clearly stated "Yes, you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit" with proper justification

The agent's conclusion aligns with the expected outcome that Kevin is **eligible** because his £120 every 4 weeks (averaging £30/week) exceeds the contribution threshold, his daughter is under 16, he's a UK resident, and assuming the mother isn't already claiming.
