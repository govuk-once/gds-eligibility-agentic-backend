2026-01-28T20:11:55.010659 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:11:56.407079 [actor]: child in care for 10 weks

2026-01-28T20:11:58.674946 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child who has been in care for 10 weeks.

To help me assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Is this child in care **temporarily** (for example, due to a short-term situation), or have they been placed in **long-term care** by the local council?

2026-01-28T20:12:00.089694 [actor]: local council care

2026-01-28T20:12:01.970058 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your child has been placed in local council care.

To help me assess your eligibility correctly, I need to know: Are you still contributing towards the cost of looking after your child while they're in local council care?

2026-01-28T20:12:03.508490 [actor]: no money cant afford

2026-01-28T20:12:05.484770 [root_agent]: I understand, thank you for explaining that you're not contributing financially because you can't afford to.

Let me ask another important question: Before your child went into local council care, were you receiving Child Benefit for them?

2026-01-28T20:12:06.964586 [actor]: husband pays 30 week to carer

2026-01-28T20:12:08.847214 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your husband is paying £30 per week to the carer.

Just to clarify - is your husband paying this £30 per week directly to the local council or foster carer as a contribution towards your child's care costs?

2026-01-28T20:12:10.196068 [actor]: yes pays to carer evry week

2026-01-28T20:12:12.167748 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. So your husband is paying £30 per week to the carer as a contribution towards your child's care.

Let me ask: Are you or your husband currently claiming Child Benefit for this child, or were you claiming it before the child went into care?

2026-01-28T20:12:13.530747 [actor]: need to know if eligble now

2026-01-28T20:12:15.211708 [root_agent]: I understand you want to know about your eligibility now. To give you an accurate answer, I do need to know one more thing:

Before your child went into local council care 10 weeks ago, were you (or your husband) claiming Child Benefit for them?

2026-01-28T20:12:16.509702 [actor]: was getting it before yes

2026-01-28T20:12:20.561445 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you were receiving Child Benefit before your child went into care.

Based on the information you've provided, here's my assessment:

**You can continue to claim Child Benefit** for your child even though they are in local council care, because your husband is contributing at least £30 per week towards the cost of looking after your child.

The key rule is that if your child is in care but you (or your partner) are contributing towards their care costs, you can still receive Child Benefit. Since your husband is paying £30 weekly to the carer, you meet this requirement.

You should continue to receive your Child Benefit as normal. If your payments have stopped or you have any concerns, you should contact the Child Benefit Office to confirm your ongoing entitlement.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit you'd like to know?

2026-01-28T20:12:22.101998 [actor]: ok thank you

2026-01-28T20:12:25.774945 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rule that Child Benefit can continue when a child is in local council care if the parent/guardian contributes towards care costs, and correctly identified that the husband's £30 weekly payment meets this requirement.
