2026-01-26T12:03:27.795671 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To do this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one by one.

First, are you responsible for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:03:28.967709 [actor]: I'll respond as if I'm a person looking to determine my eligibility for Child Benefit.

Hello there. Yes, I have a daughter named Sarah who is 12 years old.

2026-01-26T12:03:30.131096 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I'll continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit.

Does your daughter Sarah normally live with you?

2026-01-26T12:03:30.973142 [actor]: No, Sarah doesn't normally live with me. She lives with her mother.

2026-01-26T12:03:33.010657 [root_agent]: I understand that Sarah doesn't normally live with you but lives with her mother instead.

In this case, usually the person who Sarah normally lives with (her mother) would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit for her.

However, I'd like to ask: Do you make any financial contributions toward Sarah's upbringing that are equal to or more than the weekly rate of Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T12:03:34.257991 [actor]: Yes, I do contribute financially. I don't pay weekly maintenance, but every 4 weeks I buy a large bulk order of groceries and clothes for Sarah which costs around £120. I deliver these items directly to her mother's home.

2026-01-26T12:03:38.004649 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your financial contributions for Sarah.

The current weekly Child Benefit rate for an eldest or only child is £25.60 (which would be approximately £102.40 over four weeks). Since you're contributing around £120 every four weeks, you are contributing more than the weekly rate of Child Benefit.

However, for Child Benefit eligibility when a child lives with someone else, there are additional considerations. 

Do you and Sarah's mother have any formal agreement about who claims Child Benefit for her? Or do you know if her mother is currently receiving Child Benefit for Sarah?

2026-01-26T12:03:39.634660 [actor]: I don't have any formal agreement with Sarah's mother about Child Benefit. I believe her mother is currently receiving Child Benefit for Sarah, but we've never really discussed it in detail. I just focus on providing the groceries and clothes every month to help out.

2026-01-26T12:03:43.421920 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. 

Since Sarah normally lives with her mother, and her mother is likely already claiming Child Benefit for her, you would not typically be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah. In situations where a child lives with someone else, the person the child lives with is usually considered responsible for the child for Child Benefit purposes.

Even though you make significant financial contributions toward Sarah's upkeep, the Child Benefit is generally paid to the person who the child lives with - in this case, Sarah's mother.

If your circumstances change in the future (for example, if Sarah comes to live with you), you could become eligible to claim Child Benefit at that time.

Would you like to know about any other aspects of Child Benefit or alternative support that might be available to you as a non-resident parent?

2026-01-26T12:03:45.055869 [actor]: I see, so I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because Sarah lives with her mother, even though I contribute financially. That makes sense. No, I don't have other questions right now. Thank you for explaining this clearly to me.

2026-01-26T12:03:47.190950 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that when a child lives with someone else (Sarah's mother in this case), that person is usually eligible for Child Benefit regardless of financial contributions from the non-resident parent.
