2026-01-26T12:05:10.465358 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you assess whether you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To determine this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:05:12.116464 [actor]: Hi there, yes I do. I have my baby daughter Mia. I'm 15 years old and I live with my parents, but I want to claim Child Benefit for my baby myself.

2026-01-26T12:05:14.238906 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that you're 15 years old with a baby daughter named Mia, and you're living with your parents.

Given your age, I need to clarify something about Child Benefit eligibility. Are you the main person responsible for caring for your baby daughter Mia on a day-to-day basis?

2026-01-26T12:05:15.699555 [actor]: Yes, I'm the main person looking after Mia day-to-day. I'm her mother and I take care of her most of the time, even though we both live with my parents. My parents help out sometimes, but I'm definitely her main carer.

2026-01-26T12:05:17.972871 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. That's helpful information.

Based on the UK government's Child Benefit rules, your age doesn't automatically prevent you from claiming Child Benefit. What matters is that you're the person who has main responsibility for Mia.

However, I need to ask: is Mia living with you in the UK? (Child Benefit generally requires the child to be living with you in the UK.)

2026-01-26T12:05:19.227575 [actor]: Yes, Mia lives with me in the UK. We both live in my parents' house, but she's with me all the time.

2026-01-26T12:05:20.623784 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's important for eligibility.

Now I need to ask: do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T12:05:21.815951 [actor]: No, I don't have an income at all really. I'm still in school. And I don't have a partner - it's just me taking care of Mia.

2026-01-26T12:05:25.595491 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you don't have an income over £60,000 (or any significant income), the High Income Child Benefit Charge won't apply to your situation.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your daughter Mia because:

1. You are the main person responsible for caring for Mia day-to-day
2. Mia lives with you in the UK
3. Your income is well below the threshold where benefits would be reduced

As a young parent, you can claim Child Benefit in your own right. The money would be paid directly to you to help with Mia's upbringing costs.

To apply for Child Benefit, you would need to fill out a CH2 claim form. Would you like me to provide more information about the next steps for applying?

2026-01-26T12:05:27.416033 [actor]: That's great news that I'm eligible to claim Child Benefit for Mia. Yes, please tell me about the next steps for applying with the CH2 form.

2026-01-26T12:05:29.570919 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that a 15-year-old parent can claim Child Benefit as long as they are the main person responsible for the child living with them in the UK and they don't have income over £60,000.
