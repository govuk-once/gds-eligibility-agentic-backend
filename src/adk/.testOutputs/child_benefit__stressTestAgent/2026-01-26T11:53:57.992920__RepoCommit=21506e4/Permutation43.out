2026-01-26T12:12:02.392931 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T12:12:03.878221 [actor]: I'll help answer your question about Child Benefit eligibility by acting as a UK resident seeking information. Let me engage with the agent's questions.

Yes, I have my son Callum who's 17 living with me. We live in Glasgow, Scotland.

2026-01-26T12:12:05.478398 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your son Callum who's 17 and lives with you in Glasgow. 

Is Callum in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved education.

2026-01-26T12:12:06.890737 [actor]: He's just started a Modern Apprenticeship recently. He's quite excited about it because he gets to learn practical skills and earn some money at the same time.

2026-01-26T12:12:08.787817 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

A Modern Apprenticeship can qualify as approved training for Child Benefit purposes. 

Is Callum's Modern Apprenticeship unpaid, or does it pay £280 or less per week? (This is important because Child Benefit typically continues if training is unpaid or below certain payment thresholds)

2026-01-26T12:12:10.360497 [actor]: Callum does get paid for his apprenticeship. I think it's around £200 per week - definitely less than £280 anyway. He's just starting out so he's not on a high wage yet.

2026-01-26T12:12:11.953207 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Callum's apprenticeship pays less than £280 per week, that's within the allowable limit for Child Benefit purposes.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T12:12:13.185951 [actor]: No, my income is nowhere near that amount. I make about £35,000 a year, and I'm a single father - there's no partner in the picture.

2026-01-26T12:12:14.887796 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your income is £35,000 and you're a single father, you would not be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which only applies to individuals with income over £50,000.

Does Callum live with you all the time, or does he split time between different households?

2026-01-26T12:12:15.919577 [actor]: Yes, Callum lives with me full time. It's just the two of us in our home in Glasgow.

2026-01-26T12:12:18.953105 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've told me, it appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. Your son Callum is 17 years old and lives with you full-time
2. He is in approved training (Modern Apprenticeship)
3. His apprenticeship pays less than £280 per week
4. Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold
5. You are Callum's main caregiver

You should be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Callum until he turns 19 or leaves his approved training, whichever comes first.

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit if you haven't already done so?

2026-01-26T12:12:20.480092 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know I'm eligible for Child Benefit for Callum. That's good news that will help with our finances. 

2026-01-26T12:12:22.892827 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the individual is eligible for Child Benefit based on having a 17-year-old son in approved training (Modern Apprenticeship) who earns less than £280 weekly, with the parent earning below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
