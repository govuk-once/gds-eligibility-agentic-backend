2026-01-26T11:57:55.951810 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T11:57:57.288185 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user looking to find out about Child Benefit eligibility.

Yes, I have a son named Ryan who's 17. He lives with me at home.

2026-01-26T11:57:58.742651 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Ryan is 17 and lives with you, I need to ask: Is Ryan in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or certain other approved educational courses.

2026-01-26T11:58:00.033347 [actor]: Ryan has just started an Intermediate Apprenticeship. He finished school and started this government-funded apprenticeship program a few weeks ago. It's in England.

2026-01-26T11:58:01.576298 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Apprenticeships can qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Is Ryan's Intermediate Apprenticeship unpaid, or does he receive payment for it? And approximately how many hours per week does he spend on this apprenticeship?

2026-01-26T11:58:03.316874 [actor]: Ryan gets paid for his apprenticeship. It's a standard government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England, so he gets the apprentice minimum wage. I think he works around 30-35 hours per week on it.

2026-01-26T11:58:05.608844 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing those details about Ryan's apprenticeship.

Since Ryan is over 16 and is in paid training (receiving apprentice minimum wage), this would generally affect his eligibility for Child Benefit. Paid apprenticeships where the young person earns a wage typically don't qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

To confirm one more thing - does Ryan receive any disability benefits or have any special circumstances I should be aware of?

2026-01-26T11:58:06.977792 [actor]: No, Ryan doesn't receive any disability benefits. He's healthy and there aren't any special circumstances. He's just a regular 17-year-old who decided to do an apprenticeship instead of staying in school for A-levels.

2026-01-26T11:58:10.325630 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that information about Ryan.

Based on what you've shared, it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Ryan. This is because:

1. Ryan is over 16 (he's 17)
2. He is in a paid apprenticeship (receiving apprentice minimum wage)
3. Paid apprenticeships generally don't qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes

Child Benefit typically continues for children in approved education like A-levels, Scottish Highers, or certain unpaid training programs, but paid apprenticeships where the young person receives wages are usually considered employment rather than education for benefit purposes.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or any other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T11:58:12.774058 [actor]: I understand. I was wondering if that would be the case since he's earning money with his apprenticeship now instead of being in school. It's a bit disappointing but makes sense. 

Thank you for explaining why I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore now that Ryan's doing his apprenticeship. That's all I needed to know for now.

2026-01-26T11:58:15.351367 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that paid apprenticeships don't qualify for Child Benefit, making the parent ineligible since their 17-year-old son is in a paid apprenticeship rather than approved unpaid education or training.
