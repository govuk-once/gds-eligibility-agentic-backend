2026-01-27T18:52:53.016183 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent provided incorrect information. According to Child Benefit rules, the 12-week limit does apply to hospital stays, and the "linking rule" means Arthur's separate stays (totaling 13 weeks with gaps less than 28 days) would make Jenny ineligible for Child Benefit after the 12th cumulative week unless she's spending money on his upkeep as an exception. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" but the agent incorrectly stated eligibility would continue indefinitely.
