2026-01-26T12:08:05.156016 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:08:06.193390 [actor]: Hello there. Yes, I have a son named Mark who is 15 years old.

2026-01-26T12:08:07.462915 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your son Mark who is 15 years old. 

Does Mark normally live with you or do you pay an equal amount towards his upkeep if he lives with someone else?

2026-01-26T12:08:08.854616 [actor]: Well, actually Mark isn't living with me right now. He's been sentenced to a youth custody center for 6 months. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-26T12:08:10.390219 [root_agent]: I appreciate you sharing that information about Mark's current situation. 

Since Mark is currently in a youth custody center, I need to understand if this is his first period in custody. Have you been receiving Child Benefit for Mark before he entered the youth custody center?

2026-01-26T12:08:11.464114 [actor]: Yes, I've been receiving Child Benefit for Mark before he was sent to the youth custody center. This is his first time in custody.

2026-01-26T12:08:14.418416 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for Mark for the first 8 weeks that he's in the youth custody center. Since you mentioned he's been there for about 10 weeks now, your Child Benefit payments for Mark would have stopped after those initial 8 weeks.

Once Mark is released and returns to live with you, you can resume receiving Child Benefit for him. You would need to inform HMRC about his return.

Would you like to know any more information about Child Benefit in this situation?

2026-01-26T12:08:16.396079 [actor]: I see, so my Child Benefit has already stopped since it's been 10 weeks. That's helpful to know. When Mark comes home after his sentence, what do I need to do exactly to restart the payments? Do I need to make a whole new application or just notify someone?

2026-01-26T12:08:19.810206 [root_agent]: You're welcome. When Mark returns home after completing his sentence, you won't need to make a whole new application for Child Benefit. You'll simply need to notify HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) about his return.

You can do this by:
- Calling the Child Benefit Office on the telephone number on your award notice
- Writing to the Child Benefit Office to inform them that Mark has returned to live with you

It's best to contact them as soon as possible after Mark returns home. They'll then restart your Child Benefit payments from the date he returned to your care.

When you contact them, have your National Insurance number and Child Benefit reference number ready if possible, as this will help them process the change more quickly.

2026-01-26T12:08:21.589101 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that. So I just need to call or write to the Child Benefit Office when Mark comes home, and have my National Insurance number and Child Benefit reference number ready. That sounds straightforward enough. I appreciate the information about my eligibility situation.

2026-01-26T12:08:24.155194 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks when a child is in youth custody (the child has been in custody for 10 weeks), and provided accurate information about restarting payments when the child returns home.
