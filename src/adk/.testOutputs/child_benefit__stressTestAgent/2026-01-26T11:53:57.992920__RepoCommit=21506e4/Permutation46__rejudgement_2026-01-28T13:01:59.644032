2026-01-28T13:10:30.680819 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent did not explicitly state that the user is not eligible. The agent acknowledged the 91-day limit concern but only suggested the user's eligibility "could potentially be affected" and recommended contacting authorities, rather than clearly stating that the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Expired)" applies in this situation.
