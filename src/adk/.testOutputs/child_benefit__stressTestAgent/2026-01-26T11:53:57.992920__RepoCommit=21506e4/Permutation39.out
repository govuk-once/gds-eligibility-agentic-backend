2026-01-26T12:10:10.779685 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one by one.

First, do you have any children that you're responsible for who are under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:10:12.615925 [actor]: I'm looking into whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. I see the conversation has just started, and I need to answer the first question.

Yes, I have two children that I'm responsible for. They're adopted siblings - one is 6 years old and the other is 8 years old.

2026-01-26T12:10:13.812393 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. It's good to know that you have two adopted children aged 6 and 8 that you're responsible for.

Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T12:10:14.484450 [actor]: Yes, I do live in the UK.

2026-01-26T12:10:15.542772 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control or have any restrictions on your stay in the UK?

2026-01-26T12:10:16.555444 [actor]: No, neither my wife Helen nor I have any immigration restrictions. We're both UK citizens with no restrictions on our stay.

2026-01-26T12:10:17.784378 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To continue assessing your eligibility, do you or your wife have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T12:10:18.639481 [actor]: No, neither of us has an individual income over £60,000 per year.

2026-01-26T12:10:20.716757 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared so far, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit since:
- You have two children aged 6 and 8 that you're responsible for
- You live in the UK
- Neither you nor your wife are subject to immigration control
- Neither of you has an individual income over £60,000 per year

Do your children normally live with you, or do they live with someone else?

2026-01-26T12:10:21.863646 [actor]: Yes, the children normally live with us. My wife Helen and I are their adoptive parents, and they live in our home full-time.

2026-01-26T12:10:25.807452 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that the children live with you and your wife full-time.

Based on all the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. You have two adopted children aged 6 and 8 who live with you full-time, you and your wife are UK citizens with no immigration restrictions, you both earn under £60,000 individually, and you're responsible for the children.

You can claim Child Benefit for both children. The current rates (as of my last update) are £24.00 per week for your eldest child and £15.90 per week for your second child.

If either you or your wife has an individual income between £50,000 and £60,000 per year, you'll need to pay back some of the Child Benefit as tax (known as the High Income Child Benefit Charge). This is calculated as 1% of the Child Benefit for every £100 of income over £50,000.

Would you like me to provide information on how to make a Child Benefit claim?

2026-01-26T12:10:28.526007 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that we're eligible for Child Benefit for our adopted children. That's really helpful to know, especially the current rates of £24.00 per week for our eldest and £15.90 for the younger one.

Yes, I would appreciate information on how to make a Child Benefit claim. Also, I should mention that we do receive an Adoption Allowance from the Local Authority because the children have special needs. Does that affect our Child Benefit eligibility at all?

2026-01-26T12:10:31.137126 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for adopted children living with the claimant, correctly identified the rates, and mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
