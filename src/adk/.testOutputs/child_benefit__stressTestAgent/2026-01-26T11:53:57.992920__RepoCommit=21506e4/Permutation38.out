2026-01-26T12:09:43.866893 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T12:09:45.554760 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility.

Hi there. Yes, my wife and I have a baby who is 4 months old. We've been so busy with the newborn that we completely forgot to apply for Child Benefit until now. The baby lives with us.

2026-01-26T12:09:47.309367 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Congratulations on your new baby! It's completely understandable that applying for Child Benefit might not have been top of mind with all the adjustments that come with a newborn.

Is your baby living with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T12:09:48.406303 [actor]: Yes, we all live together in Manchester. We've been here for years.

2026-01-26T12:09:50.038063 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK. That's helpful information.

May I ask if either you or your wife earn over £60,000 per year in individual income?

2026-01-26T12:09:51.524144 [actor]: No, neither of us earns that much. I make about £35,000 and my wife is currently on maternity leave from her job where she normally makes about £28,000.

2026-01-26T12:09:52.833584 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since neither you nor your wife earns over £60,000 individually, you wouldn't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Is your baby a UK citizen, or do they have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T12:09:53.851193 [actor]: Yes, our baby was born here in the UK. Both my wife and I are UK citizens, so our baby is too.

2026-01-26T12:09:55.195443 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful.

Are you or your wife subject to immigration control, meaning that you have permission to stay in the UK but with the condition that you don't claim public funds?

2026-01-26T12:09:56.078701 [actor]: No, neither of us is subject to immigration control. As I mentioned, we're both UK citizens.

2026-01-26T12:09:59.178003 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Based on the information you've provided, it appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit. Your situation meets the key criteria:

- You have responsibility for a child (your 4-month-old baby) who lives with you
- You live in the UK
- Neither you nor your wife earns over £60,000 individually
- Your child is a UK citizen
- You're not subject to immigration control

You can claim Child Benefit for your baby, and this can be backdated for up to 3 months from your application date. As your child is 4 months old, you should be able to claim from birth if you apply soon.

Would you like me to provide information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T12:10:01.094804 [actor]: That's great news! I was worried about the fact that our baby is already 4 months old. So you're saying we can still get the money for the past months even though we're applying late? We don't lose out on those first payments?

2026-01-26T12:10:03.920338 [root_agent]: That's right! You don't need to worry about having waited until your baby is 4 months old. Child Benefit claims can be backdated for up to 3 months from the date of your application. 

Since your baby is only 4 months old, if you apply now, you should be able to receive payments covering the entire period since birth. You won't lose out on those first payments as long as you apply soon.

This is one of the helpful aspects of the Child Benefit system - they understand that new parents have a lot to handle and might not apply immediately after birth.

2026-01-26T12:10:05.996173 [actor]: That's a relief! So we'll get payments from the time our baby was born, even though we're applying a bit late. Thank you for the information. We'll make sure to apply right away to not miss out on any more time.

2026-01-26T12:10:08.965752 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility criteria and correctly explained that claims can be backdated up to 3 months, allowing the family with a 4-month-old baby to receive payments from birth.
