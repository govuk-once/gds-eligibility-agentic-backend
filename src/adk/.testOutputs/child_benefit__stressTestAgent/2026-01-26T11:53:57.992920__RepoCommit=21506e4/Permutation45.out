2026-01-26T12:13:05.018265 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK rules. Let me ask you questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T12:13:06.582784 [actor]: I'll help you find out if you're eligible for Child Benefit by answering the questions.

Yes, I have a daughter who is 8 years old.

2026-01-26T12:13:07.519605 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your 8-year-old daughter. 

Next question: Does your daughter normally live with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T12:13:08.896284 [actor]: My 8-year-old daughter normally lives with me in the UK, but she's currently in the hospital.

2026-01-26T12:13:10.091338 [root_agent]: I understand that your daughter normally lives with you in the UK but is currently in the hospital. Thank you for sharing that information.

Next question: How long has your daughter been in the hospital?

2026-01-26T12:13:10.860728 [actor]: She's been in the hospital for 14 weeks now.

2026-01-26T12:13:12.370726 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about your daughter being in the hospital for 14 weeks.

Next question: Is your daughter expected to remain in the hospital for a longer period, or do you have an estimated timeframe for when she might return home?

2026-01-26T12:13:13.685086 [actor]: The doctors aren't completely sure yet, but they think she'll need to stay for at least another month. It's been really difficult for us.

2026-01-26T12:13:15.045871 [root_agent]: I understand this must be a very difficult time for you and your family. Thank you for sharing that information.

Next question: Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T12:13:16.001067 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that amount. I'm well below the £60,000 threshold.

2026-01-26T12:13:17.537879 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your income is below the £60,000 threshold.

Next question: Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control with any restrictions on claiming benefits?

2026-01-26T12:13:18.562851 [actor]: No, I'm not subject to any immigration control or restrictions on claiming benefits.

2026-01-26T12:13:21.904839 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information.

Based on what you've shared, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit for your 8-year-old daughter. You meet the key criteria:

1. You are responsible for a child under 16
2. Your daughter normally lives with you in the UK
3. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold
4. You're not subject to immigration control with benefit restrictions

The fact that your daughter is currently in the hospital does not affect your eligibility. According to UK rules, you can continue to receive Child Benefit while your child is in the hospital for any length of time, provided they normally live with you.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit if you haven't already done so?

2026-01-26T12:13:24.076980 [actor]: Actually, I've been wondering about that. Since she's been in the hospital for 14 weeks now, does that affect my eligibility? I visit her every single day for hours to keep her company, but I don't buy food, clothes, or gifts for her since the hospital provides everything she needs. Does that make any difference to my eligibility?

2026-01-26T12:13:28.325831 [root_agent]: That's a good question. Based on the UK government guidelines, your eligibility is not affected by your daughter being in the hospital, even for an extended period like 14 weeks.

The rules specifically state that you can continue to get Child Benefit if your child goes into hospital. There's no time limit mentioned for hospital stays. The fact that you visit her regularly demonstrates that you're maintaining your parental responsibility.

The hospital providing food, clothes, and other necessities during her stay doesn't affect your eligibility. This is a temporary situation where the hospital is providing care as part of her medical treatment, but you remain responsible for her overall welfare and she normally lives with you when not in the hospital.

As long as you remain responsible for your child (which includes making decisions about her care and maintaining regular contact, as you are doing), you continue to be eligible for Child Benefit during her hospital stay.

Is there anything else about your eligibility that you're concerned about?

2026-01-26T12:13:30.356150 [actor]: Thank you for explaining. I just wanted to be sure since it's been a long hospital stay, and I wasn't sure if the rules changed after a certain time period. I'm relieved to know I'm still eligible. I don't have any other questions about my eligibility.

2026-01-26T12:13:32.878370 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit while their child is in hospital, regardless of the length of stay, as long as the child normally lives with them.
