2026-01-27T18:53:27.717521 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment that the agent passed. The agent correctly determined that Gary is eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks after Ben left education since Ben is registered with a careers service and actively seeking apprenticeships, which matches the expected outcome.
