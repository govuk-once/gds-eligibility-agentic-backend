2026-01-26T12:01:13.857151 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility correctly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:01:16.509256 [actor]: I'll role-play as a UK resident inquiring about child benefit eligibility.

I need to respond to the agent's question about my child situation based on the given scenario. I am Raj, who claims for my son Dev, who is now 20 and studying full-time for his A-levels.

To the agent's question: Yes, I have a son named Dev who is in full-time education studying for his A-levels. He just turned 20 last month though, in the middle of his term.

2026-01-26T12:01:19.113379 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Raj. 

I need to check a few more details about Dev's education situation. Since your son is 20 and studying for his A-levels, I need to confirm: is this approved education that qualifies for Child Benefit? Approved education typically includes courses up to A-level or equivalent, but the age limit is important to consider.

Could you tell me if Dev started this course before he turned 19?

2026-01-26T12:01:21.490152 [actor]: Yes, Dev started his A-levels when he was 18. He's in his second year now. He's always been a good student, but he had to take a gap year due to some health issues before starting his A-levels, which is why he's a bit older than most of his classmates. He's working hard to complete his studies now.

2026-01-26T12:01:24.922967 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Raj. 

Based on what you've shared, I need to inform you that unfortunately, Dev no longer qualifies for Child Benefit. While he is in approved education (A-levels), Child Benefit can only be paid for children in approved education up until they turn 20. Since Dev has already turned 20 last month, he is no longer eligible.

Child Benefit stops immediately when a child turns 20, even if they're still in approved education. This is one of the key age limits set by the UK government for this benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or any other support that might be available for families with children in education?

2026-01-26T12:01:27.990329 [actor]: Oh, I see. I didn't realize the benefit would stop as soon as he turned 20. I thought it might continue until he finishes his current course. This is disappointing news as the extra money was helpful for his education expenses. 

Are there any other types of support we might be eligible for to help with his education costs now that the Child Benefit has stopped? He still has a few months left to complete his A-levels.

2026-01-26T12:01:31.920409 [actor]: Thank you for asking about alternative support. Since Dev is no longer eligible for Child Benefit, you might want to look into:

1. The 16-19 Bursary Fund - This could provide money for things like clothing, books, and other equipment for students facing financial hardship
2. Education Maintenance Allowance (if in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland)
3. Advanced Learner Loans - though these are typically for students 19+ doing specific qualifications
4. Check with your local council about any discretionary learner support funds

You may also want to check if Dev might qualify for any benefits in his own right now that he's 20. The best next step would be to contact your local college student support services or Citizens Advice for personalized guidance on what's available in your specific situation.

2026-01-26T12:01:33.798956 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed Raj that Child Benefit stops immediately when a child turns 20, even if they're still in approved education, which matches the information on the gov.uk website.
