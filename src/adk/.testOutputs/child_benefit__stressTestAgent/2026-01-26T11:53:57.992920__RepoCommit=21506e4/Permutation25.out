2026-01-26T12:04:21.150497 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:04:21.969974 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Leo who is 5 years old.

2026-01-26T12:04:23.162272 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your son Leo who is 5 years old. 

Is Leo living with you in the UK? (This helps me determine if you meet the residence requirements for Child Benefit.)

2026-01-26T12:04:24.252514 [actor]: Well, not at the moment. Leo has been in local authority care for the past 10 weeks.

2026-01-26T12:04:27.188512 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about Leo's current situation. 

Since Leo is currently in local authority care, this affects your Child Benefit eligibility. Generally, Child Benefit can continue for up to 8 weeks if a child goes into local authority care. Since Leo has been in care for 10 weeks, this exceeds the standard period.

However, I need to understand if you're still contributing at least the amount of Child Benefit toward Leo's upkeep or maintenance. 

Are you contributing financially toward Leo's care or maintenance while he's in local authority care?

2026-01-26T12:04:28.793945 [actor]: I don't have any income myself, so I can't contribute to Leo's upkeep. But my husband, who is Leo's stepfather and lives with me, transfers £30 per week to the carer for Leo's upkeep.

2026-01-26T12:04:31.043123 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. 

This is important because for Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in care, someone in your household must be contributing at least the amount of the Child Benefit toward the child's maintenance.

Since your husband (Leo's stepfather) who lives with you is contributing £30 per week toward Leo's upkeep, this may qualify as maintaining the child for Child Benefit purposes.

Is there an expectation that Leo will return to live with you and your husband in the future?

2026-01-26T12:04:32.634441 [actor]: Yes, we're hoping Leo will return to live with us once his care situation is resolved. We're maintaining contact with him and working with the social services on the plan for his return.

2026-01-26T12:04:36.861410 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to hear that you're maintaining contact with Leo and working toward his return home.

Based on what you've shared:

1. Your son Leo is in local authority care, which normally would stop Child Benefit after 8 weeks
2. However, your husband (who lives in your household) is contributing £30 per week toward Leo's upkeep
3. You're maintaining contact with Leo and there's a plan for him to return to your home

In this situation, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit if the weekly contribution your husband makes equals or exceeds the Child Benefit rate (which is £24.00 per week for your eldest or only child). Since your husband is contributing £30 per week, this appears to meet the maintenance requirement.

To confirm your eligibility and continue or restart your claim, I would recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly as they can assess your specific circumstances.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit in your situation?

2026-01-26T12:04:38.854871 [actor]: So if I understand correctly, I am eligible for Child Benefit because even though Leo has been in care for more than 8 weeks, my husband's contributions of £30 per week meet the maintenance requirement? That's really helpful to know. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office to confirm. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-26T12:04:41.908660 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the user may still be eligible for Child Benefit despite the child being in care for more than 8 weeks because the household is contributing more than the Child Benefit rate (£30 vs £24) toward the child's maintenance.
