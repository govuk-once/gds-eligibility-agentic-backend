2026-01-28T13:10:33.079692 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the user would need to pay back the "full amount" of Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge. With an income of £75,000, the user would only need to pay back a portion of the benefit (not the full amount), as the expected outcome states they are "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)".
