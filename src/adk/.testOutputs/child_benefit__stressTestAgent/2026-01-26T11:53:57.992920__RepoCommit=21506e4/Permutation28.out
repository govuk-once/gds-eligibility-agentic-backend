2026-01-26T12:05:31.051603 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To determine this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T12:05:31.990754 [actor]: Yes, I have a 5-year-old son who's with me here in the UK.

2026-01-26T12:05:33.494449 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your 5-year-old son. Are you personally responsible for raising this child? This means you're the person who has the main day-to-day responsibility for them.

2026-01-26T12:05:34.802137 [actor]: Yes, I am personally responsible for raising my son. I take care of him every day and make all the decisions regarding his upbringing and wellbeing.

2026-01-26T12:05:35.913602 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Does your son normally live with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T12:05:37.014915 [actor]: Yes, he's currently living with me here in the UK. We came together when I arrived.

2026-01-26T12:05:38.480897 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Do you or your son have any immigration conditions that could restrict your access to public funds or benefits in the UK?

2026-01-26T12:05:39.905675 [actor]: Well, I'm visiting the UK on a standard 6-month tourist visa. My son is with me on the same type of visa. I'm not working while I'm here.

2026-01-26T12:05:44.604233 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that you would not be eligible for Child Benefit at this time.

To qualify for Child Benefit, you need to have the right to reside in the UK, which typically means you must have settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or be from the UK, EU, EEA or Switzerland with UK settlement status.

Since you and your son are in the UK on 6-month tourist visas, you would be considered "subject to immigration control" and generally not eligible for public funds, including Child Benefit.

Child Benefit is designed for those who are living and settled in the UK long-term, rather than for those visiting temporarily. If your immigration status changes in the future, you may want to reassess your eligibility.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T12:05:47.708158 [actor]: I see. Thank you for explaining that. I didn't realize that being on a tourist visa would make me ineligible for Child Benefit. We're just visiting for a few months, so I guess that makes sense. I don't have any other questions about this right now.

2026-01-26T12:05:50.278078 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that visitors on tourist visas are subject to immigration control and not eligible for Child Benefit, which requires the right to reside in the UK on a more permanent basis.
