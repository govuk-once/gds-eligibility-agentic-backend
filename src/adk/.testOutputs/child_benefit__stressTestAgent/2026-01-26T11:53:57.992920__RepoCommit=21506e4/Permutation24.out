2026-01-26T12:03:48.871667 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under the age of 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:03:50.593673 [actor]: Hello, yes I do have a child. My son Tom is 14 years old, though he doesn't currently live with me full-time. He's at a residential school because of his severe behavioral needs. The local council is paying for his placement there.

2026-01-26T12:03:53.145892 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that your son Tom is 14 years old and is currently at a residential school due to his behavioral needs, with the local council paying for his placement.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand more about Tom's situation. How often does Tom come home to stay with you? For example, does he return on weekends or holidays?

2026-01-26T12:03:55.293039 [actor]: Tom stays at the residential school during the week, but he does come home most weekends unless there are special activities at the school. He also comes home during school holidays. The school recommended this arrangement because of his behavioral needs, but I'm still very involved in his care and decisions about his education.

2026-01-26T12:03:57.968413 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that Tom stays at the residential school during the week but comes home most weekends and during school holidays, and you remain actively involved in his care and educational decisions.

This is important for determining your Child Benefit eligibility. Since Tom regularly returns home to you and you're still involved in his care, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit.

Next question: Are you responsible for Tom financially in any way? For example, do you buy his clothes, provide pocket money, or cover any other expenses for him?

2026-01-26T12:04:00.152767 [actor]: Yes, I'm still financially responsible for Tom in many ways. I buy all his clothes, provide his pocket money, and pay for his personal items and activities. I also cover additional therapy costs that aren't included in the school's program. Even though the local council pays for his placement at the school, I handle all his other expenses and needs.

2026-01-26T12:04:01.936984 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. The fact that you continue to provide financial support for Tom by purchasing his clothes, providing pocket money, covering personal items, activities, and additional therapy costs is important for your Child Benefit claim.

Next question: Are you a UK resident? And do you have the right to live in the UK (such as being a UK citizen, having settled status, or having indefinite leave to remain)?

2026-01-26T12:04:03.054801 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK resident and citizen. I've lived in the UK all my life. I was born here and have never lived anywhere else.

2026-01-26T12:04:04.408801 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK resident and citizen.

Next question: Is anyone else (such as Tom's other parent) currently claiming Child Benefit for Tom?

2026-01-26T12:04:05.787532 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Tom. His father isn't involved in his life and has never claimed any benefits for him. I've been the only one claiming Child Benefit up until now.

2026-01-26T12:04:07.441484 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Tom.

Next question: Does either you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year? This is important for the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-26T12:04:08.714558 [actor]: No, my income is around £28,000 per year. I'm a single parent and don't have a partner, so there's no other income to consider.

2026-01-26T12:04:13.912564 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing your income information. Since your individual income is around £28,000 per year and you don't have a partner, you wouldn't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which applies to individuals earning over £50,000.

Based on all the information you've provided, I can now assess your eligibility for Child Benefit:

It appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit for Tom because:
- Tom is under 16 years old
- You're a UK resident with the right to live in the UK
- You remain financially responsible for Tom
- Tom regularly returns home to you on weekends and holidays
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Tom
- Your income is below the threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply

Even though Tom attends a residential school paid for by the local council, since he regularly returns home to you and you continue to be financially responsible for him, you should still qualify for Child Benefit. This is because you're maintaining regular contact and financial responsibility, which are key factors in determining eligibility when a child is in residential education.

If you're not currently receiving Child Benefit for Tom, you may wish to apply or contact the Child Benefit Office to ensure your claim reflects your current situation.

2026-01-26T12:04:16.725978 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for Child Benefit for Tom. I was worried that because he's at the residential school now I might not qualify anymore. It's good to know that since he's only been there for 10 weeks, comes home regularly, and I'm still financially responsible for him, I can continue to receive this support. This will really help with all the extra expenses I have for his care.

2026-01-26T12:04:19.355428 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the user is eligible for Child Benefit since their child regularly returns home on weekends and holidays, the parent maintains financial responsibility, and meets all other eligibility criteria despite the child attending residential school.
