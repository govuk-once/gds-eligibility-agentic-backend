2026-01-26T11:59:04.644645 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T11:59:07.141413 [actor]: I need to respond as if I'm a UK resident inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll take on the role of Sophie, a single mother with a temporary childcare arrangement due to medical circumstances.

Hello! Yes, I have a 6-year-old son named Noah. He's currently staying with my mother (his grandmother) while I recover from surgery. It's been about 6 weeks since he went to stay with her.

2026-01-26T11:59:09.304413 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Sophie. I understand you have a 6-year-old son named Noah who's currently staying with your grandmother while you recover from surgery, and this arrangement has been in place for about 6 weeks.

For your situation, I need to understand a bit more about this arrangement. Is this a temporary arrangement, and do you still consider yourself as having responsibility for Noah even though he's staying with your mother at the moment?

2026-01-26T11:59:11.854304 [actor]: Yes, this is definitely a temporary arrangement. I'm still Noah's mother and have full responsibility for him. I'm just recovering from surgery right now, so my mother stepped in to help care for him while I get back on my feet. As soon as I'm well enough, Noah will be back home with me. My mother is just helping out during my recovery, but I'm still making all the decisions about his care, education, and everything else.

2026-01-26T11:59:13.994822 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Sophie. I understand that this is a temporary arrangement while you recover from surgery, and you still maintain full responsibility for Noah's care and make all the decisions regarding his upbringing.

Based on this information, you would still be considered to have responsibility for your child, which is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

May I ask if you are currently receiving Child Benefit for Noah, or are you looking to make a new claim?

2026-01-26T11:59:16.543353 [actor]: Yes, I've been receiving Child Benefit for Noah since he was born. I'm just concerned about whether I'm still eligible while he's staying with my mom temporarily. I wasn't sure if the benefit would stop since he's not physically living with me right now. My mom hasn't made any claim for his benefit - she's just helping me out during my recovery.

2026-01-26T11:59:20.487017 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation, Sophie. I understand your concern about your ongoing Child Benefit eligibility while Noah is temporarily staying with your mother.

Based on the UK government guidelines, you can continue receiving Child Benefit for Noah during this temporary arrangement. Since:

1. You still maintain responsibility for Noah
2. This is a temporary arrangement due to your medical recovery
3. You are still making decisions about his care and upbringing
4. Your mother is providing care but hasn't made a claim herself

The key factor for Child Benefit eligibility is who has responsibility for the child, rather than strictly who the child physically lives with at all times. Temporary arrangements like yours, where the child stays with a relative during a parent's illness or recovery, do not typically affect eligibility.

You should continue to receive your Child Benefit payments as normal during this period. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement?

2026-01-26T11:59:23.239622 [actor]: Oh, that's such a relief to hear! I was really worried that I might lose the benefit while Noah is staying with my mother. It's good to know that I can still receive it since I'm still responsible for him even during this temporary arrangement. That benefit really helps with Noah's expenses, which continue even while he's with my grandmother. 

Thank you so much for confirming this for me - I feel much better now knowing I'm still eligible.

2026-01-26T11:59:25.933236 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility during temporary care arrangements, correctly explaining that the mother remains eligible while her child temporarily stays with a grandmother during medical recovery.
