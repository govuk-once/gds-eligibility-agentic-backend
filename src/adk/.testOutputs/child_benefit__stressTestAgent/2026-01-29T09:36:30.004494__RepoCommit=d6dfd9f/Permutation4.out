2026-01-29T09:38:17.937880 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T09:38:19.910031 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have my daughter Sofia who lives with me. She's 18 years old.

2026-01-29T09:38:22.168542 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Is Sofia in approved education or training?**

(This is important because Child Benefit can continue for children aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training.)

2026-01-29T09:38:23.865992 [actor]: No, she's not. Sofia left school two years ago and she's been working as a receptionist. She works about 30 hours a week.

2026-01-29T09:38:26.442879 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia**. 

Here's why: Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. Since Sofia is 18 and working rather than in approved education or training, she doesn't meet the eligibility criteria.

**Do you have any other children under 16, or under 20 who are in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T09:38:28.379217 [actor]: No, Sofia is my only child.

2026-01-29T09:38:32.048862 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on our conversation, **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** because:

- Child Benefit is for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training
- Sofia is 18 years old and is working (not in approved education or training)
- She therefore doesn't meet the age and education/training criteria

If Sofia's circumstances change in the future and she returns to approved education or training before she turns 20, you may become eligible at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T09:38:33.855715 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T09:38:37.681819 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because Sofia is 18, not in approved education or training, and working 30 hours per week, which falls outside the eligibility criteria (under 16, or under 20 if in approved education/training).
