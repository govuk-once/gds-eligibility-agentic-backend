2026-01-29T09:57:44.178623 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T09:57:47.035891 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. I have a daughter, Kelly. She's 16. I'm a bit worried though because she finished her GCSEs in June and she's not actually in school right now - it's August. She has been accepted to start college for her A-levels in September, but I'm concerned that because she's not in education at the moment, I might not be eligible for Child Benefit anymore?

2026-01-29T09:57:50.008174 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information about Kelly.

That's a very understandable concern, but let me reassure you - there are specific rules that cover this situation.

Before I can give you a full assessment, I need to ask:

**Do you live in the UK, or are you a UK citizen living abroad who meets certain conditions (such as working for a UK employer or being a Crown servant)?**

2026-01-29T09:57:51.689917 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I've always lived here.

2026-01-29T09:57:54.588554 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now, regarding Kelly's situation between finishing her GCSEs and starting college - the good news is that there's typically a gap allowed between leaving school and starting further education or training. The rules recognize that young people often have a break during the summer.

However, to fully assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is Kelly currently living with you, and are you the person responsible for her day-to-day care and upbringing?**

2026-01-29T09:57:56.990377 [actor]: Yes, she lives with me and I'm responsible for her. I pay for everything - her food, clothes, all her needs. It's just me and her at home.

2026-01-29T09:58:00.070630 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

That's helpful to know. Now I need to understand a bit more about Kelly's education plans:

**When Kelly starts college in September for her A-levels, will this be approved education or training? In other words, will it be full-time education (at least 12 hours a week of supervised study) at a recognized institution like a school or college?**

2026-01-29T09:58:02.068227 [actor]: Yes, it will be full-time A-levels at a proper college. She's been accepted and everything. It's definitely more than 12 hours a week - it's a full college course.

2026-01-29T09:58:06.533866 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, let me give you some good news about your situation:

**You should still be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

1. Kelly is under 20 years old (she's 16)
2. She's going to be in approved full-time education (A-levels at college, which is more than 12 hours per week)
3. She lives with you and you're responsible for her
4. You live in the UK

Regarding your concern about the gap between finishing GCSEs in June and starting college in September - this is a normal situation that the Child Benefit rules account for. There's an extension period that covers young people who have left school and are waiting to start approved education or training. This gap during the summer holidays is expected and doesn't affect your eligibility.

Before I can fully confirm your eligibility, I have one final question:

**Is there anyone else who might also be claiming Child Benefit for Kelly, or is it just you claiming?**

2026-01-29T09:58:08.377578 [actor]: No, it's just me. I'm her only parent and no one else is claiming anything for her.

2026-01-29T09:58:12.103959 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Based on all the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit** for Kelly. Here's a summary:

✓ Kelly is 16 and will be in approved full-time education (A-levels) starting in September
✓ She lives with you and you're responsible for her
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ The gap between finishing GCSEs and starting college in September is covered - this is a normal transition period

**You can continue to claim Child Benefit for Kelly** while she's doing her A-levels, up until:
- She turns 20, OR
- She leaves approved education or training (whichever comes first)

You should make sure to inform the Child Benefit Office when Kelly starts her college course in September, as they may need confirmation that she's in approved education.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T09:58:14.637623 [actor]: Oh that's such a relief! I was really worried about the summer gap. Thank you so much for explaining that - it makes sense now. No, I think you've answered everything I needed to know. I'll make sure to let the Child Benefit Office know when Kelly starts college in September.

2026-01-29T09:58:18.701983 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit during the gap between Kelly finishing GCSEs and starting college in September, correctly applying the rules about approved education for 16-20 year olds and the allowance for transition periods between educational stages.
