2026-01-29T09:55:24.271279 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T09:55:25.907201 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, John. He's 17 years old.

2026-01-29T09:55:27.459247 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does John live with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T09:55:28.750400 [actor]: He lives with me - I'm his father, Pete.

2026-01-29T09:55:31.406130 [root_agent]: Thank you, Pete.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you or your partner receiving certain benefits or tax credits for John, such as Universal Credit, Income Support, or tax credits that include an amount for him?

2026-01-29T09:55:33.438028 [actor]: No, I'm not receiving any of those benefits or tax credits for John.

2026-01-29T09:55:35.630969 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Pete.

Next question: Is John still in approved education or training? This would include things like:
- Full-time non-advanced education (such as A-levels or equivalent)
- Approved training courses

2026-01-29T09:55:37.494068 [actor]: Yes, he's in education. He left school and is now at a local college re-sitting two GCSEs. His course involves 6 hours of supervised study a week.

2026-01-29T09:55:40.061880 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Pete.

I need to clarify something about John's education. You mentioned he has 6 hours of supervised study per week. Can you tell me:

1. Is this course considered full-time non-advanced education by the college?
2. Or is this just 6 hours total per week at the college?

This is important because for Child Benefit purposes after age 16, the education generally needs to be full-time (meaning more than 12 hours per week of supervised study).

2026-01-29T09:55:41.974630 [actor]: It's just 6 hours total per week at the college. He's only re-sitting the two GCSEs, so it's not a full-time course. He spends the rest of his time at home, mostly gaming.

2026-01-29T09:55:45.487457 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification, Pete.

Based on what you've told me, I need to let you know that John's education situation may not meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

For young people aged 16-19, Child Benefit can continue if they're in full-time non-advanced education or approved training. "Full-time" generally means more than 12 hours per week of supervised study. Since John is only doing 6 hours per week, this would not typically qualify as full-time education.

However, let me ask one more question to be thorough: Does John have any caring responsibilities, or is he registered as blind or disabled in any way?

2026-01-29T09:55:47.031411 [actor]: No, John doesn't have any caring responsibilities, and he's not registered as blind or disabled.

2026-01-29T09:55:51.301725 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions, Pete.

Based on the information you've provided, **you would not currently be eligible for Child Benefit for John**. Here's why:

- John is 17 years old, which is over the age of 16
- After age 16, Child Benefit can continue until a young person turns 20, but only if they're in full-time approved education or training
- John's course involves only 6 hours of supervised study per week, which does not meet the requirement for "full-time" education (generally more than 12 hours per week)
- He doesn't have any other circumstances (such as disability or caring responsibilities) that would affect eligibility

**Important note:** If John's education situation changes - for example, if he enrolls in a full-time course at college - you may become eligible for Child Benefit at that point, and you should apply then.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or John's situation?

2026-01-29T09:55:53.541364 [actor]: No, that's clear. Thank you for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T09:55:57.659869 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a 17-year-old in only 6 hours per week of supervised study does not meet the full-time education requirement (more than 12 hours per week) necessary for continued Child Benefit eligibility after age 16, and correctly concluded ineligibility.
