2026-01-29T09:52:37.880076 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T09:52:39.543570 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a baby girl called Mia.

2026-01-29T09:52:42.140500 [root_agent]: That's lovely! Congratulations on your daughter Mia.

Now, let me ask: Are you responsible for Mia? By this I mean, do you live with her and are you the person who looks after her day-to-day (such as feeding, clothing, and caring for her)?

2026-01-29T09:52:44.172702 [actor]: Yes, I live with her and I'm the one who looks after her - I feed her, change her, and take care of her every day. Though I do live with my parents as well.

2026-01-29T09:52:46.358920 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Living with your parents is absolutely fine - what matters is that you're the one responsible for Mia's care.

Let me ask you: Do you normally live in the UK? This means the UK is your main home where you spend most of your time.

2026-01-29T09:52:47.819039 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. This is my home.

2026-01-29T09:52:49.521183 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Now, one more important question: Is Mia living with you in the UK as well?

2026-01-29T09:52:50.959304 [actor]: Yes, Mia lives with me here in the UK.

2026-01-29T09:52:54.024857 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for answering my questions.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Mia) who is under 16 years old
✓ You are responsible for her - you live with her and care for her daily
✓ You normally live in the UK
✓ Mia lives with you in the UK

You meet the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. You can make a claim for Mia.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-29T09:52:59.444070 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user meets all the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit: they have a child under 16, they are responsible for the child's care, both live in the UK, and the user is the primary caregiver despite living with their parents.
