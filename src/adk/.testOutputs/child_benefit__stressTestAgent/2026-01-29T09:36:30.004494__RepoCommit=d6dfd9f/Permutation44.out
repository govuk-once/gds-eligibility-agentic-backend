2026-01-29T10:03:54.673764 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T10:03:56.394705 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Leo, he's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T10:03:58.583151 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Do you live in the UK, or are you a Crown servant (such as a diplomat or member of HM Forces) posted overseas?

2026-01-29T10:03:59.803755 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:04:01.878999 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Now, does Leo normally live with you? By this I mean, is he living in your household?

2026-01-29T10:04:04.109948 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. Leo is actually in local authority care, but he comes home to visit me every week. He comes home on Saturdays at 10 in the morning and goes back to the care home on Sundays at 11 in the morning.

2026-01-29T10:04:06.264384 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. This is an important detail for determining eligibility.

Let me ask: When Leo is in local authority care during the week, does the local authority pay for the full cost of looking after him, or do you contribute to his care costs?

2026-01-29T10:04:08.283008 [actor]: The local authority pays for the full cost of his care during the week when he's with them.

2026-01-29T10:04:12.147257 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to let you know that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.

Here's why: When a child is in local authority care and the local authority is paying the full cost of looking after them, you cannot claim Child Benefit for that child - even if the child visits you regularly at weekends.

The rules state that if your child is being looked after by a local authority and they're paying for the full cost of care, Child Benefit cannot be paid.

I understand this may be disappointing news, especially as Leo does come home to visit you regularly. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T10:04:18.877489 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in care, parents can still claim child benefit when a child in local authority care visits home regularly, even if the local authority pays for their care during the week - the key factor is whether the child spends time living with the parent, which Leo does on weekends.
