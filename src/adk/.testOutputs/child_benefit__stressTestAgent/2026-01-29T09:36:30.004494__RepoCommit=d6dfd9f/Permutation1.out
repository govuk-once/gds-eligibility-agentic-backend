2026-01-29T09:36:32.347636 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 living with you, or are you responsible for a young person aged 16 to 19 who is in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T09:36:34.431962 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. I have a son, Leo, who's 8 years old and he lives with me and my husband.

2026-01-29T09:36:36.841070 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know that Leo is 8 years old and lives with you.

Let me ask my next question: **Are you or your husband responsible for Leo? By this I mean, do either of you pay for things like his food, clothes, or housing, and is he part of your household?**

2026-01-29T09:36:38.838060 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. My husband Tom and I are both responsible for Leo. We pay for all his food, clothes, housing, and everything else he needs. He's our son and lives with us here in Manchester.

2026-01-29T09:36:40.663701 [root_agent]: That's great, thank you for clarifying. 

Now I need to ask: **Are you, your husband, or Leo currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T09:36:42.601381 [actor]: Yes, we all live in the UK. We're in Manchester. My husband and I are both UK nationals, and Leo was born here.

2026-01-29T09:36:44.761045 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for Leo?** For example, could Leo's other parent or another person be receiving Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-29T09:36:46.740849 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Leo. It's just our household - me, my husband Tom, and Leo. Nobody else is claiming anything for him.

2026-01-29T09:36:49.199516 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: **Is Leo currently living away from home in hospital or in care (such as local authority care), or does he normally live with you at your home address?**

2026-01-29T09:36:51.155825 [actor]: Leo lives with us at home. He's not in hospital or care - he's just at primary school during the day and comes home every evening. He lives at our home address with us.

2026-01-29T09:36:55.623347 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Leo) who is under 16 years old
✓ Leo lives with you at your home address
✓ You and your husband are responsible for Leo (paying for his food, clothes, and housing)
✓ You all live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Leo
✓ Leo is not in hospital or local authority care

You meet all the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. 

**One final question before we finish:** Do either you or your husband have an individual income over £50,000 per year? This won't affect your eligibility to claim, but it may affect whether you need to pay a tax charge on the benefit.

2026-01-29T09:36:57.477817 [actor]: My husband Tom earns £35,000 a year as a teacher, and I work part-time earning £15,000. So neither of us earns over £50,000.

2026-01-29T09:37:00.918980 [root_agent]: Excellent news! Since neither you nor your husband earns over £50,000 individually, you won't have to worry about the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

**To summarize: You are eligible for Child Benefit, and you can claim the full amount without any tax charge.**

You can apply for Child Benefit and should receive payments for Leo. The benefit is typically paid every 4 weeks.

If you'd like to proceed with claiming, you'll need to apply for Child Benefit - this is usually done by filling out a claim form. 

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T09:37:02.777836 [actor]: No, that's everything I needed to know. Thank you so much for your help!

2026-01-29T09:37:06.897942 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria (child under 16, lives with claimant, responsible for child, UK residence, no duplicate claims, not in hospital/care) and correctly concluded eligibility for Child Benefit, providing accurate information throughout the conversation.
