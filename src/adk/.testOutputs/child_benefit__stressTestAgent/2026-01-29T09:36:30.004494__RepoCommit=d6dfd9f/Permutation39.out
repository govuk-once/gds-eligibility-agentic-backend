2026-01-29T09:59:46.701991 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T09:59:48.471752 [actor]: Yes, I am. My partner and I have two adopted children - they're 6 and 8 years old.

2026-01-29T09:59:50.397875 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know you have two adopted children aged 6 and 8.

Next question: **Do you and/or your partner usually live with these children in the UK?**

2026-01-29T09:59:51.854755 [actor]: Yes, we do. Both children live with us here in the UK.

2026-01-29T09:59:54.187559 [root_agent]: That's great. Now I need to ask about your residency status.

**Are you or your partner currently living in the UK and have the right to reside here? This includes being a British citizen, having settled status, or having the right to work or claim benefits in the UK.**

2026-01-29T09:59:55.978601 [actor]: Yes, we're British citizens and we both live and work here in the UK.

2026-01-29T09:59:58.237318 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: **Are either you or your partner currently receiving Child Benefit for these children from another country (for example, from an EU country or elsewhere)?**

2026-01-29T09:59:59.829080 [actor]: No, we're not receiving any Child Benefit from another country - just here in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:00:03.978720 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit** for your two adopted children. Here's why:

✓ You are responsible for children under 16 (your adopted children aged 6 and 8)
✓ The children live with you in the UK
✓ You and your partner are British citizens living and working in the UK
✓ You're not claiming Child Benefit from another country

Since you have two children, you would receive Child Benefit for both of them (one rate for the eldest child and another for the second child).

However, please note that there is one additional consideration: if either you or your partner has an individual income over £60,000 a year, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge through Self Assessment, which could reduce or cancel out the benefit received.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:00:07.948910 [actor]: That's very helpful, thank you! I understand that we're eligible. Just to clarify - we do receive an Adoption Allowance from the Local Authority because the children have special needs. Does that affect anything?

2026-01-29T10:00:10.937753 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed eligibility based on the criteria (children under 16, living in UK, British citizens, no foreign claims) and correctly noted that Adoption Allowance from the Local Authority does not affect Child Benefit eligibility, as these are separate benefits.
