**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Adoption placement**: The agent properly recognized that the child was placed with the user by an adoption agency and that they are awaiting a final adoption order from court.

2. **Correct application of rules**: According to gov.uk guidance, you can claim Child Benefit "as soon as any child you're adopting comes to live with you" - you do not need to wait for the final adoption order. The agent correctly stated: "You can claim Child Benefit even though the adoption isn't finalized yet, as long as the child is living with you and you're responsible for them."

3. **All eligibility criteria met**:
   - Child under 16 (age 4) ✓
   - Child lives with applicant ✓
   - Applicant responsible for day-to-day care ✓
   - Lives in UK ✓
   - No one else claiming ✓
   - No immigration restrictions ✓

4. **Clear outcome communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided clear reasoning.

The agent's assessment aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of **Eligible** for this prospective adopter scenario.
