2026-01-28T23:25:42.186138 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T23:25:44.022238 [actor]: child benefit eligble daughter 12 yrs old send money evry week

2026-01-28T23:25:46.254302 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a daughter who is 12 years old, which means she meets the age requirement.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Are you responsible for your daughter? This means do you live with her and are you the main person looking after her (providing food, clothing, and a place to live)?**

2026-01-28T23:25:47.861906 [actor]: no dont live with her send 10 pound week for food mum has her

2026-01-28T23:25:49.700061 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is an important detail.

Let me ask you:

**Does your daughter's mum (or the person she lives with) currently claim Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-28T23:25:51.085028 [actor]: no mum dosnt claim it thats y im asking can i get it

2026-01-28T23:25:53.262372 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is helpful to know.

Let me ask you an important question:

**Do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit would be (or more) towards your daughter's upkeep? For context, Child Benefit is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child.**

2026-01-28T23:25:54.609654 [actor]: no i send 10 pound week to mum for food also send birthday present once year

2026-01-28T23:25:58.969912 [root_agent]: Thank you for being honest about your contributions.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to explain the eligibility criteria:

**To claim Child Benefit, you generally need to either:**
- Be responsible for the child (living with them and looking after them), OR
- If the child lives with someone else, you must contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate (currently £25.60 per week for the eldest/only child) towards their upkeep

**In your situation:**
- Your daughter lives with her mum
- You contribute £10 per week, which is less than the Child Benefit rate of £25.60 per week
- You also send a birthday present once a year

**Unfortunately, based on these circumstances, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit.** The person who is primarily responsible for your daughter (her mum) would be the one eligible to claim, even though she currently isn't claiming it.

Would you like me to clarify anything about this decision or discuss any other questions you might have?

2026-01-28T23:26:03.840394 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because I do not live with my daughter and my £10 weekly contribution is below the required Child Benefit rate of £25.60 per week, and correctly explained that the person with primary responsibility (the mother) would be eligible to claim instead.
