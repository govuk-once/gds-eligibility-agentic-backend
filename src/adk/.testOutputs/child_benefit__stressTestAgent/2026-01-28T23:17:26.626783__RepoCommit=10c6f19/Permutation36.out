2026-01-28T23:36:47.755234 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:36:49.298104 [actor]: daughter 16 not in scool right now finishd gcses

2026-01-28T23:36:51.594188 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your daughter is 16 and has just finished her GCSEs.

**Is your daughter planning to continue with approved education or training (such as A-levels, a college course, or an apprenticeship)?**

This is important because Child Benefit can continue until age 20 if the young person is in approved education or training.

2026-01-28T23:36:53.069395 [actor]: colege starts septembr

2026-01-28T23:36:55.355011 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know - your daughter will be starting college in September.

**Is your daughter currently registered or enrolled for that college course that starts in September?**

This matters because there can sometimes be a gap between finishing GCSEs and starting further education, and the rules around Child Benefit during that period depend on whether she's already enrolled.

2026-01-28T23:36:56.655145 [actor]: yes acceptd already its august now

2026-01-28T23:36:59.224240 [root_agent]: Excellent - so your daughter has been accepted and is enrolled for college starting in September, and we're currently in August.

Now let me ask about your circumstances:

**Are you responsible for your daughter? This means do you live with her and are you the main person looking after her (or sharing that responsibility equally with someone else)?**

2026-01-28T23:37:00.511590 [actor]: yes I look after her shes living with me

2026-01-28T23:37:02.085379 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. That's helpful information.

**Are you currently living in the UK, and is your daughter also living in the UK with you?**

2026-01-28T23:37:03.392185 [actor]: yes we live in uk

2026-01-28T23:37:05.493964 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about any existing Child Benefit claims:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your daughter? For example, her other parent or anyone else she might have lived with previously?**

2026-01-28T23:37:06.983014 [actor]: no just me nobody else claiming

2026-01-28T23:37:09.000845 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One final question:

**Are you or your daughter subject to immigration control (meaning do you have any restrictions on your immigration status that would prevent you from accessing public funds)?**

2026-01-28T23:37:10.362875 [actor]: no we are uk residents

2026-01-28T23:37:14.381019 [root_agent]: Excellent! Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:

✓ You have a daughter who is 16 years old  
✓ She has finished her GCSEs and is enrolled in college starting in September  
✓ You are responsible for her and she lives with you  
✓ You both live in the UK  
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her  
✓ You have no immigration restrictions

**Important points:**

- Child Benefit can continue until your daughter turns 20, as long as she remains in approved education or training
- The gap between finishing GCSEs (typically in June) and starting college in September is covered, as she's already enrolled
- You can claim Child Benefit for this period

If you haven't already claimed Child Benefit, you can apply online or by post. If you're already claiming and were worried about the gap between school and college, you should be fine to continue receiving it as long as your daughter is enrolled.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T23:37:20.222906 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit, correctly identifying that the daughter (age 16) who has finished GCSEs and is enrolled in college starting September falls within the eligibility criteria for approved education, and properly confirmed all other eligibility requirements including UK residency, responsibility for the child, and no competing claims.
