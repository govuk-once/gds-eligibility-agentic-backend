2026-01-28T23:39:10.152372 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:39:11.661635 [actor]: son in hospital mental health act can i get money

2026-01-28T23:39:14.037010 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand your son is in hospital under the Mental Health Act, and you're wondering about Child Benefit eligibility.

Let me ask you an important question to help assess this:

**How long has your son been in hospital under the Mental Health Act - has it been less than 12 weeks, or 12 weeks or more?**

This is important because the rules differ depending on the length of the hospital stay.

2026-01-28T23:39:15.889370 [actor]: been ther 10 weeks now worry about mony

2026-01-28T23:39:17.702478 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son has been in hospital for 10 weeks (which is less than 12 weeks), this is an important detail.

Let me ask you:

**Were you receiving Child Benefit for your son before he went into hospital?**

2026-01-28T23:39:19.320297 [actor]: yes was gettin it befour he went in

2026-01-28T23:39:21.491010 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know. Since you were already receiving Child Benefit before your son went into hospital, and he's been there for 10 weeks (under 12 weeks), you should still be eligible to continue receiving it.

Let me ask you another question to make sure I have the full picture:

**Is your son under 16 years old, or is he 16-19 and in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T23:39:22.658647 [actor]: hes 15 years old

2026-01-28T23:39:25.526844 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you've provided:

- Your son is 15 years old (under 16)
- You were receiving Child Benefit before he went into hospital
- He's been in hospital for 10 weeks (less than 12 weeks)

**Good news: You should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit.**

When a child is in hospital, you can continue to get Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks. Since your son has been there for 10 weeks, you're still within this period.

Let me ask one more question to ensure everything is clear:

**Are you still receiving your Child Benefit payments, or have they stopped?**

2026-01-28T23:39:27.010386 [actor]: still getting them just wanted to check if its ok

2026-01-28T23:39:29.768532 [root_agent]: That's excellent - yes, you're absolutely doing everything correctly! 

You should continue to receive Child Benefit while your son is in hospital for up to 12 weeks. Since he's been there for 10 weeks and you're still receiving payments, everything is as it should be.

**Just to be aware:** If your son's hospital stay extends beyond 12 weeks in total, the rules may change at that point, and you should contact the Child Benefit Office to discuss your situation.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your son's situation that you'd like to know?

2026-01-28T23:39:31.190094 [actor]: ok thanks that helps

2026-01-28T23:39:33.177804 [actor]: The agent has confirmed my eligibility for Child Benefit - I can continue receiving it since my son has been in hospital for 10 weeks (under the 12-week limit). The conversation has reached its conclusion with the eligibility outcome provided.

2026-01-28T23:39:35.322809 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the 12-week hospital rule for children detained under the Mental Health Act, correctly concluded eligibility continues until week 12, and provided accurate information throughout without any errors.
