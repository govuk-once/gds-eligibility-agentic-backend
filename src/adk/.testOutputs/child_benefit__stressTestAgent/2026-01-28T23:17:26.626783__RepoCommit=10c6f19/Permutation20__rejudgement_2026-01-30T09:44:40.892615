2026-01-30T09:51:01.226938 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Maria (the grandmother) is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."

The agent properly assessed all relevant criteria:

1. **Child's age**: Confirmed the granddaughter is 14 (under 16) ✓
2. **Responsibility**: Established that Maria pays for everything (food, clothes, school supplies) and is the main person looking after the child ✓
3. **Relationship**: Correctly recognized that you don't need to be a parent - grandparents can claim if they're responsible for the child ✓
4. **Residence**: Confirmed UK residence ✓
5. **No duplicate claims**: Verified parents aren't claiming Child Benefit ✓
6. **Immigration status**: Confirmed no restrictions ✓

The agent's conclusion that Maria "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" is correct and aligns with the gov.uk guidance that states you can claim Child Benefit if you have an informal arrangement to look after a relative's child, provided you're responsible for them and the local council isn't paying for their accommodation. The agent handled this informal guardianship scenario appropriately.
