2026-01-28T23:17:29.389670 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:17:30.909662 [actor]: child 8 yrs old leo scool

2026-01-28T23:17:32.525964 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have an 8-year-old child named Leo who is in school.

Now I need to ask:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T23:17:33.804546 [actor]: manchester

2026-01-28T23:17:36.185812 [root_agent]: Great, so you live in Manchester, which is in the UK.

Next question:

**Are you responsible for Leo? This means do you live with Leo and are you the person who is mainly responsible for looking after him?**

2026-01-28T23:17:37.511584 [actor]: leo lives with us yes

2026-01-28T23:17:39.354759 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Leo lives with you and you're responsible for him.

Now I need to ask:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Leo?**

2026-01-28T23:17:40.683493 [actor]: no one else claiming

2026-01-28T23:17:42.990913 [root_agent]: Excellent. Let me ask one more important question:

**Do you (or your partner, if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?**

This is important because if either you or your partner earns over this amount, it may affect your Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-28T23:17:44.457944 [actor]: husband teacher 35000 me part time 15000

2026-01-28T23:17:48.090627 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me review your situation:

✓ You have an 8-year-old child (Leo) who is in school
✓ You live in the UK (Manchester)
✓ Leo lives with you and you're responsible for him
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Leo
✓ Your household income is £50,000 combined (husband £35,000 + you £15,000 part-time)

**Good news! Based on what you've told me, you are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Leo.**

Since neither you nor your husband earns over £50,000 individually, you won't have to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means you can receive the full Child Benefit payment without any tax implications.

You can apply for Child Benefit and should receive weekly payments for Leo.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T23:17:53.541388 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately gathered all necessary information (child's age, UK residency, responsibility for the child, no duplicate claims, and household income below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold) and correctly concluded that the user is eligible for Child Benefit.
