2026-01-28T23:41:21.923854 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:41:23.528048 [actor]: child benefit wales 17 year old apprenticshp

2026-01-28T23:41:26.557713 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old who is doing an apprenticeship in Wales.

To help assess eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is your 17-year-old's apprenticeship an approved education or training program, and are they studying for up to and including A level or equivalent qualifications (such as NVQ Level 3)?**

This is important because Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training at certain levels.

2026-01-28T23:41:27.928416 [actor]: foundation apprenticeship welsh government

2026-01-28T23:41:30.076647 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. A Welsh Government Foundation Apprenticeship is generally considered approved training.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you the person responsible for the child? This means, do you live with the 17-year-old and are you responsible for their day-to-day care and upbringing?**

2026-01-28T23:41:31.545382 [actor]: yes live with mum cardiff responsible

2026-01-28T23:41:33.778719 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you live with your child in Cardiff and are responsible for them.

Let me ask the next important question:

**Are you or your child currently living in the UK? This is important as you generally need to be living in the UK to claim Child Benefit, though there are some exceptions for people working abroad or in certain circumstances.**

2026-01-28T23:41:35.368992 [actor]: live cardiff wales uk

2026-01-28T23:41:37.989991 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming you both live in Cardiff, Wales, which is in the UK.

Now I need to ask about any other care arrangements:

**Does your 17-year-old spend time living with anyone else, or are they in any form of local authority care or living in hospital for extended periods?**

2026-01-28T23:41:39.353604 [actor]: no just lives with me

2026-01-28T23:41:41.215483 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for that information.

Now I need to ask about your immigration status:

**Do you have the right to live in the UK? For example, are you a British citizen, have settled status, or have another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits?**

2026-01-28T23:41:42.475543 [actor]: british citizen wales

2026-01-28T23:41:44.432418 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

One final important question:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for this 17-year-old?**

Only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child at any one time.

2026-01-28T23:41:45.939758 [actor]: no just me nobody else claiming

2026-01-28T23:41:51.181650 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

✓ You have a 17-year-old child living with you
✓ They are in a Welsh Government Foundation Apprenticeship, which is approved training
✓ You are responsible for their day-to-day care
✓ You both live in the UK (Cardiff, Wales)
✓ You are a British citizen with the right to claim benefits
✓ Your child lives with you full-time and is not in care
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child

**Important note about the High Income Child Benefit Charge:** If you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year, you may have to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through a tax charge. However, you can still claim it and may want to do so to protect your National Insurance credits for State Pension purposes.

You can apply for Child Benefit through the government website or by post. Would you like any further clarification?

2026-01-28T23:41:56.116241 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that a 17-year-old in a Welsh Government Foundation Apprenticeship qualifies for Child Benefit as approved training, verified all necessary eligibility criteria, and correctly mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge caveat.
