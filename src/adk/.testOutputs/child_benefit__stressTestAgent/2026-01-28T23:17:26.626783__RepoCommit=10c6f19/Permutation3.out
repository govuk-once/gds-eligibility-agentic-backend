2026-01-28T23:18:26.051835 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T23:18:27.556590 [actor]: son left scool in june looking for apprenticship now

2026-01-28T23:18:29.291529 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your son left school in June and is currently looking for an apprenticeship.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: How old is your son now?

2026-01-28T23:18:30.627010 [actor]: 17 years old registerd with careers service

2026-01-28T23:18:32.747843 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your son is 17 years old and registered with the careers service, and he left school in June and is looking for an apprenticeship.

Let me ask: Is your son currently enrolled in any approved education or training program, or is he only registered with the careers service while looking for an apprenticeship?

2026-01-28T23:18:34.334917 [actor]: no eduaction just registered lookin for apprenticship

2026-01-28T23:18:36.109395 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son is 17, left school in June, is registered with the careers service, and is looking for an apprenticeship but is not currently in any education or training.

Let me ask you another question: Does your son live with you, or are you responsible for him?

2026-01-28T23:18:37.434676 [actor]: lives with me yes

2026-01-28T23:18:39.442038 [root_agent]: Thank you. And one more important question:

Are you the person responsible for your son - meaning, are you the one who is mainly looking after him or contributing to the cost of supporting him?

2026-01-28T23:18:40.611200 [actor]: yes im responsible he lives with me

2026-01-28T23:18:42.409967 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me ask one final question to complete the assessment:

Are you currently living in the UK (England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland)?

2026-01-28T23:18:43.632816 [actor]: yes uk resident

2026-01-28T23:18:48.050376 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, I need to give you some important guidance about your Child Benefit eligibility.

**You are currently NOT eligible for Child Benefit** in your situation.

Here's why: Your 17-year-old son left school in June and is currently looking for an apprenticeship but is not enrolled in any approved education or training. 

For children aged 16-19, Child Benefit can only continue if they are in **approved education or training**. Simply being registered with the careers service and looking for an apprenticeship does not qualify as being "in approved education or training."

**However**, if your son finds and starts an approved apprenticeship or enrolls in approved education or training, you could become eligible for Child Benefit again at that point, and it would continue until he turns 20 (or until he leaves that education/training, whichever comes first).

So the key thing is: once he secures and begins an apprenticeship or other approved training, you should apply for or reinstate your Child Benefit at that time.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-28T23:18:53.012135 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit continues for 20 weeks after a child leaves school/training if they register with the careers service or Connexions, which applies in this case where the 17-year-old son is registered with the careers service and looking for an apprenticeship.
