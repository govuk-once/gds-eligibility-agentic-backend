2026-01-29T18:07:21.974372 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent properly identified the key disqualifying factor: Bella's training is employer-funded and provided directly through employment at a travel agency, rather than being "approved education or training" as defined by Child Benefit eligibility criteria.

The agent:
1. Confirmed Bella is 16 and the user is her mother with responsibility for her
2. Established that the training is work-based and employer-paid
3. Verified it is not registered with any careers service as approved training
4. Correctly concluded that employer-provided training does not meet the criteria for Child Benefit eligibility for young people aged 16-19

According to gov.uk guidance, for 16-19 year olds to qualify, they must be in approved education or training - which specifically excludes employer-funded training arrangements. The agent's determination that the user is "not eligible" aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** for this scenario.
