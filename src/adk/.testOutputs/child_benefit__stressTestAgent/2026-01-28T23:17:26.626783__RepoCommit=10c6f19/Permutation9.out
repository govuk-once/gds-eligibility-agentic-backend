2026-01-28T23:21:49.693233 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T23:21:51.228704 [actor]: child benfit eligibilty pre settld status jobseekr

2026-01-28T23:21:53.095230 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you a clear question to start assessing your eligibility:

Do you have a child (or children) who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T23:21:54.338316 [actor]: yes son 5 years old

2026-01-28T23:21:55.955870 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you have a 5-year-old son.

Now, let me ask: Are you responsible for your son? By this I mean, does your son live with you?

2026-01-28T23:21:57.353204 [actor]: responsible for him yes

2026-01-28T23:22:00.087205 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're responsible for your son.

Now I need to ask about your immigration status. You mentioned "pre-settled status" and "jobseeker" earlier. 

Are you currently living in the UK, and do you have the right to reside in the UK (such as through settled status, pre-settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another form of permission to stay)?

2026-01-28T23:22:01.696156 [actor]: pre settld status from germany looking for work registerd jobseekr

2026-01-28T23:22:03.379255 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have pre-settled status from Germany and are registered as a jobseeker.

Let me ask you this: How long have you been living in the UK with your pre-settled status?

2026-01-28T23:22:04.769475 [actor]: moved uk recently registerd jobseekr actively looking

2026-01-28T23:22:06.455347 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you moved to the UK recently.

Let me ask: Before you started looking for work, were you working in the UK? And if so, for how long were you working here?

2026-01-28T23:22:07.857798 [actor]: unemployd now but registerd jobseekr genuine prospect work

2026-01-28T23:22:09.994430 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're currently unemployed but registered as a jobseeker with genuine prospects of work.

Let me ask: When you moved to the UK recently, did you come here specifically to look for work, or were you working in the UK before becoming unemployed?

2026-01-28T23:22:11.562754 [actor]: came here looking work registered jobseekr active search

2026-01-28T23:22:13.395592 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you came to the UK specifically to look for work.

Now, let me ask: Do you have any other connection to the UK, such as having worked here in the past, or do you have a spouse or partner who is working in the UK currently?

2026-01-28T23:22:14.969590 [actor]: just me and son hans actively searching employment registered jobseeker

2026-01-28T23:22:17.267090 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So it's just you and your son Hans, and you're actively searching for employment as a registered jobseeker.

Let me ask one more important question: Since arriving in the UK, have you had any job offers or started any work at all, even if it was only for a short period?

2026-01-28T23:22:18.845990 [actor]: no work yet but genuine prospect finding employment active jobseeker registered

2026-01-28T23:22:23.450043 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your situation.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that unfortunately, **you are not currently eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why: While you have pre-settled status from Germany and are responsible for your 5-year-old son Hans, the issue relates to your right to reside in the UK for Child Benefit purposes.

To be eligible for Child Benefit, you need to have a "right to reside" in the UK. Having pre-settled status gives you the right to live here, BUT if you came to the UK primarily as a jobseeker (which you've confirmed), your right to reside as a jobseeker alone is **not sufficient** for Child Benefit eligibility.

However, your situation could change if:
- You find and start employment in the UK (even part-time work could establish a different right to reside)
- You retain worker status after employment ends in certain circumstances

I understand this may be disappointing news. Is there anything else you'd like to clarify about your situation?

2026-01-28T23:22:28.440144 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to the HMRC guidance, EEA nationals with pre-settled status who are registered jobseekers with a genuine prospect of work have a qualifying right to reside for Child Benefit purposes, making me eligible for Child Benefit.
