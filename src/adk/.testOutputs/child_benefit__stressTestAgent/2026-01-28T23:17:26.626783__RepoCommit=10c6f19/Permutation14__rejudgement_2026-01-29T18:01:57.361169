**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Child's age**: The son is 6 years old (under 16) ✓

2. **Parental responsibility**: The user is a single mother who remains responsible for the child ✓

3. **Financial contribution**: The user continues to pay for the child's expenses during the temporary absence ✓

4. **Temporary nature**: The child is staying with grandmother temporarily (for surgical recovery), not permanently ✓

5. **Duration**: While the specific duration wasn't explicitly stated in weeks, the context indicates this is a short-term medical recovery situation, which would fall well within the 8-week rule mentioned in the scenario guidelines

6. **UK residence**: The user confirmed they normally live in the UK ✓

7. **No competing claim**: There's no indication the grandmother has claimed Child Benefit ✓

The agent appropriately applied the principle that temporary absences don't affect Child Benefit eligibility when the parent maintains responsibility and continues financial support. This correctly interprets the 8-week rule for temporary living arrangements and aligns with the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else.

**The communicated outcome matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."**
