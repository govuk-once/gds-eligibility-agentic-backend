**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of circumstances:** The agent properly identified that Liam is a fostered child placed by the local authority, and that the council pays a fostering allowance covering accommodation and maintenance.

2. **Accurate application of eligibility rules:** According to the criteria provided and confirmed by gov.uk guidance, you cannot claim Child Benefit for a fostered child when the local council is paying for their accommodation or maintenance. The agent correctly stated: "when a child is looked after by a local authority...Child Benefit cannot be claimed."

3. **Clear communication:** The agent explicitly told the user "**Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam**" and provided a clear explanation that the fostering allowance replaces Child Benefit in these circumstances.

4. **Agreement with expected outcome:** The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" and the agent communicated exactly this conclusion.

The agent's assessment was thorough, accurate, and properly communicated the ineligibility decision based on the fostering arrangement with local authority funding.
