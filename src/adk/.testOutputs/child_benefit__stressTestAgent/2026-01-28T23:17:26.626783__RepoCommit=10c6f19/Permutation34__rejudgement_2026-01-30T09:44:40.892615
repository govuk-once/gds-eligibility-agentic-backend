**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of custody rules**: The agent accurately identified that Child Benefit stops when a child is in youth custody, regardless of age (under 20).

2. **Proper consideration of the 8-week rule**: The child has been in custody for 10 weeks, which exceeds the 8-week threshold mentioned in the scenario criteria. The agent correctly determined this makes the claimant ineligible.

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you are not eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit while your son is in youth custody" and explained the reasoning.

4. **Appropriate guidance**: The agent advised the user to report the change in circumstances and stop claiming, while also noting they could reclaim after release.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome based on the scenario where Mark has been in youth custody for 10 weeks (exceeding the 8-week limit), making Lisa ineligible for Child Benefit during this period.
