2026-01-28T23:21:06.812283 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking:

Do you have a child (or children) who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T23:21:11.835794 [actor]: child benefit calculater ruby 4 years old

2026-01-28T23:21:14.396697 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child named Ruby who is 4 years old.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

Are you responsible for Ruby? This means do you live with her and are you the main person looking after her day-to-day (for example, providing her food, clothing, and a place to live)?

2026-01-28T23:21:15.748202 [actor]: yes live togeher responsible for ruby

2026-01-28T23:21:17.682321 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. So you live with Ruby and are responsible for her.

Now I need to ask:

Do you normally live in the UK? (This means the UK is your main home where you usually reside)

2026-01-28T23:21:19.133720 [actor]: uk resident yes

2026-01-28T23:21:21.089365 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK resident.

One more important question:

Is there anyone else who is also responsible for Ruby living in your household? For example, a partner or spouse?

2026-01-28T23:21:22.413099 [actor]: james partner lives with us

2026-01-28T23:21:24.532303 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So James, your partner, also lives with you and Ruby.

I need to ask:

Between you and James, which one of you is the main person responsible for Ruby's day-to-day care? (Only one person can usually claim Child Benefit, even if you both care for her)

2026-01-28T23:21:25.852167 [actor]: i am main carer for ruby

2026-01-28T23:21:28.167844 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are the main carer for Ruby.

Now I need to ask an important question about your income:

Do you or James have an individual income over £60,000 per year? (This is important because it can affect whether you need to pay a tax charge on Child Benefit)

2026-01-28T23:21:29.502597 [actor]: income 75000 per year

2026-01-28T23:21:31.697344 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to clarify:

Is it you who has the income of £75,000 per year, or is it James who has this income? (Or do you both earn this amount individually?)

2026-01-28T23:21:33.005522 [actor]: i earn 75000 james earns less

2026-01-28T23:21:34.983702 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you earn £75,000 per year and James earns less than that.

One final question to complete the assessment:

Is Ruby living with you full-time, or does she spend time living with someone else (for example, another parent or relative)?

2026-01-28T23:21:36.281666 [actor]: ruby lives with us fulltime

2026-01-28T23:21:42.107417 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, here's my assessment:

**You ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit** for Ruby because:

✓ Ruby is under 16 years old (she's 4)
✓ You are responsible for her and live with her
✓ You are her main carer
✓ You normally live in the UK
✓ Ruby lives with you full-time

**However, there is an important tax consideration:**

Since you earn £75,000 per year (which is over £60,000), you will need to pay the **High Income Child Benefit Charge** through Self Assessment. This charge means:

- For income between £60,000 and £80,000, you pay back some of the Child Benefit through tax
- At £75,000, you would pay back approximately 75% of the Child Benefit received
- At £80,000 or more, you pay back 100%

**You have two options:**

1. Claim Child Benefit and pay back part of it through the tax charge
2. Claim Child Benefit but opt not to receive the payments (this still gives Ruby National Insurance credits which protect your State Pension)

Would you like any clarification on this?

2026-01-28T23:21:44.970247 [actor]: ok thanks understand now

2026-01-28T23:21:47.820443 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that I am eligible for Child Benefit for my 4-year-old child Ruby, correctly explained that I would be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge due to my £75,000 income (which exceeds the £60,000 threshold), properly calculated that approximately 75% would need to be repaid, and appropriately presented both claiming options available to me.
