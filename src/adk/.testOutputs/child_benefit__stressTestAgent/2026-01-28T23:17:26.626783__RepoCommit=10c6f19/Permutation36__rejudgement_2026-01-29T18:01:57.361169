**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Age criterion met**: The daughter is 16, which is under 20 years old.

2. **Terminal dates/summer gap properly handled**: The agent correctly recognized that the gap between finishing GCSEs (June) and starting college (September) is covered when the child is already enrolled in approved further education. The agent specifically stated: "The gap between finishing GCSEs (typically in June) and starting college in September is covered, as she's already enrolled."

3. **Approved education**: The agent properly identified that college courses starting in September constitute approved education, allowing Child Benefit to continue.

4. **All other criteria verified**: The agent confirmed:
   - The parent is responsible for the child
   - They live together in the UK
   - No one else is claiming
   - No immigration restrictions

The agent's conclusion that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" directly matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**, and the reasoning provided demonstrates correct understanding of the "summer gap" rules for students transitioning between approved education courses.
