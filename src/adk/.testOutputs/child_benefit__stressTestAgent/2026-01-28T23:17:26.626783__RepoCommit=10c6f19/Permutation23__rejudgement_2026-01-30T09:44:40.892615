**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and the scenario details, the user should be **eligible**.

**Key Analysis:**

1. **The Scenario Context:** Kevin contributes £120 every 4 weeks (averaging £30/week) for groceries and clothes for his daughter Sarah, who lives with her mother. This meets the lump sum contribution criteria outlined in the permutation.

2. **GOV.UK Guidance on Contributions:** According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, a person who doesn't live with the child can still claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate to the child's upkeep. The contribution can be made as a lump sum covering a period.

3. **Sufficiency Check:** £120 over 4 weeks = £30/week, which exceeds the £26.05 weekly Child Benefit threshold mentioned in the scenario.

4. **Agent's Error:** The agent focused solely on the "child must live with you" rule and failed to explore or explain the alternative pathway to eligibility through sufficient financial contributions. The agent should have asked whether the mother is already claiming Child Benefit and explained that if she isn't, Kevin could potentially claim it based on his contributions.

**Conclusion:** The agent's communicated outcome (not eligible) contradicts the expected outcome (eligible), making this a failed assessment.
