**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome provided, the user should be **eligible**.

The key issue is the agent's interpretation of the contribution requirement. The agent stated: "you can only claim Child Benefit if you contribute **at least as much** towards the child's upkeep as the person they live with" and concluded that £50/week is "unlikely to equal what the parent the child lives with is spending on day-to-day costs."

However, according to GOV.UK guidance on Child Benefit eligibility when a child lives with someone else, payments made under a **court order** DO count as contributions toward the maintenance requirement. The £50 per week (£200+ per month) through a court-ordered maintenance payment is a substantial contribution that should be considered when determining eligibility.

The agent made an assumption that this amount wouldn't be sufficient without actually establishing:
1. What the resident parent's actual costs are
2. That court-ordered payments of this amount wouldn't meet the threshold

The expected outcome indicates the user should be found **eligible**, suggesting that the £50/week court-ordered payment does satisfy the contribution requirement. The agent's determination of "not eligible" contradicts this expected outcome.
