**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the family is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of Crown servant exception**: The agent properly recognized that as a Crown servant (British Armed Forces member) posted to Germany, the residency requirement is satisfied despite living abroad. The agent stated: "As a Crown servant (British Armed Forces member) posted to Germany, you're treated as ordinarily resident in the UK for Child Benefit purposes, even though you're living abroad."

2. **Correct eligibility determination**: The agent concluded "Your wife appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" - this is the correct outcome.

3. **Proper application of criteria**: The agent verified:
   - Children under 16 ✓
   - Primary responsibility established (wife) ✓
   - Crown servant status satisfies residency ✓
   - Children living with the family ✓

4. **Appropriate claimant identified**: The agent correctly identified that the wife should claim since she has primary day-to-day responsibility.

The agent communicated a clear eligibility outcome that aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible** for this Crown servant scenario.
