**Justification:**

The agent communicated that Mark is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and the GOV.UK guidance, Mark should be **eligible**.

**Key Issue:**

The agent failed to recognize the "contributing to upkeep" exception. According to GOV.UK guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), you can claim Child Benefit if you're responsible for a child, even if the child doesn't live with you, **provided you're contributing at least the amount of Child Benefit towards the child's upkeep**.

**Facts of this case:**
- Mark pays £150/month (approximately £34.60/week) toward Lucas's food and clothes
- Current Child Benefit rate is approximately £113/month (roughly £26/week)
- Mark's contribution **exceeds** the Child Benefit amount
- Jenny (who lives with Lucas) is **not claiming** Child Benefit
- Jenny has consented to Mark claiming

**Correct outcome:**
Mark meets the "contributing to upkeep" exception and should be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas, particularly since Jenny is not claiming it herself.

The agent incorrectly insisted that only the person the child lives with can claim, missing this important exception in the rules. The agent's determination contradicts the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
