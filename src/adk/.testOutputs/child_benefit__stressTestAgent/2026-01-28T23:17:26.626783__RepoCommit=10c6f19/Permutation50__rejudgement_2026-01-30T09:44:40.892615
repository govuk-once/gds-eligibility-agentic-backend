**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Child's status:** The agent properly recognized that a 16-year-old in the "No One Left Behind" programme qualifies as being in approved training, which extends Child Benefit eligibility beyond age 16 (up to age 20).

2. **Responsible adult:** The agent confirmed the user is responsible for and lives with the child.

3. **No duplicate claims:** The agent verified no one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child.

4. **Income threshold:** The agent correctly explained the High Income Child Benefit Charge (applies above £60,000 individual income) and confirmed the user's income is below this threshold.

5. **UK residency:** The agent confirmed the user lives in Scotland/UK, satisfying residency requirements.

6. **Final determination:** The agent explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided clear reasoning based on all the relevant criteria.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**, and the evaluation judge also marked this as correct (✓). The agent communicated the eligibility outcome accurately and comprehensively.
