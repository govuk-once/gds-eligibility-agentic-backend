**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, stating they can continue receiving it because Leo has been in care for 10 weeks (under the 12-week limit) and contributions are being made toward his upkeep.

However, this contradicts the **expected outcome** which states the user should be **Eligible** (without the time limitation caveat).

More critically, according to [Gov.UK guidance on Child Benefit for children in care](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), when a child is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, Child Benefit normally stops **unless** the parent is contributing at least the amount the local council says they should pay toward the child's upkeep.

In this case:
- Leo has been in care for **10 weeks** (exceeds the 8-week threshold)
- The council has **not specified** any contribution amount ("no council hasnt said anything")
- While the husband pays £30/week, there's no confirmation this meets any council-specified requirement

The agent incorrectly applied a "12-week rule" which doesn't align with the actual 8-week threshold in the guidance. The agent should have clarified whether the £30 payment meets the council's specified contribution requirement before determining eligibility, especially since the user confirmed the council hasn't communicated any required amount.

Given the expected outcome is "Eligible," but the agent's reasoning contains significant errors about the applicable rules and thresholds, the communicated outcome does not properly align with a correct application of Child Benefit eligibility criteria.
