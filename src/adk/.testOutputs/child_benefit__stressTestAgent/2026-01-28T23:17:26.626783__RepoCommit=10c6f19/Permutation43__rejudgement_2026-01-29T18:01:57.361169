**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

The critical error is in the agent's assessment of the Modern Apprenticeship. According to the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, Child Benefit can continue for children aged 16-19 who are in "approved education or training." However, the specific rules note that **apprenticeships in Scotland (Modern Apprenticeships) do not qualify** for Child Benefit purposes, unlike some specific exceptions in Wales.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this issue: Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland are employment-based training programs that fall outside the approved education/training criteria for extending Child Benefit beyond age 16.

The agent should have communicated that the 17-year-old doing a Modern Apprenticeship in Glasgow is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, regardless of whether the apprenticeship was described as "unpaid." Instead, the agent incorrectly confirmed eligibility, stating "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and "You meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit."

The agent's communicated outcome (Eligible) directly contradicts the expected outcome (Not Eligible).
