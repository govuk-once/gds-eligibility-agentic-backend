**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Maria is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Responsibility established**: The agent confirmed Maria pays for everything (food, clothes, school supplies) and is the main person looking after Lucia, satisfying the responsibility criterion.

2. **Relationship criterion met**: The agent correctly recognized that being a grandparent rather than a parent does not disqualify Maria from Child Benefit, as long as she has responsibility for the child.

3. **All eligibility criteria verified**:
   - Child under 16: ✓ (Lucia is 14)
   - Responsible for the child: ✓ (Maria pays for everything)
   - Lives in UK: ✓ (confirmed)
   - No one else claiming: ✓ (parents don't claim)
   - No immigration restrictions: ✓ (born in UK)

4. **Informal arrangement recognized**: The agent appropriately handled the informal family arrangement situation, which according to GOV.UK guidance is acceptable as long as the local council isn't paying for accommodation (which wasn't mentioned as a factor here).

The agent's conclusion that Maria "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" is correct and matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
