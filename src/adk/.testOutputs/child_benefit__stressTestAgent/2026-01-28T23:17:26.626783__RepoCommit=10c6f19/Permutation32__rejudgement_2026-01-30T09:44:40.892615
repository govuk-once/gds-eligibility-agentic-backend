**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

The critical error lies in the agent's assessment of the education requirement. The agent stated that "The child is in college studying for GCSEs (which counts as approved education)" without verifying the crucial detail of study hours.

According to the scenario details:
- John (17) is attending college to re-sit two GCSEs
- His course involves only **6 hours of supervised study per week**
- The rest of his time is spent gaming at home

According to gov.uk guidance on approved education for Child Benefit purposes, for a young person aged 16-19, the education must be **full-time**, which means more than **12 hours per week** of supervised study or course-related work experience.

Since John's course only involves 6 hours per week, it does **not** qualify as full-time approved education. Therefore, Child Benefit cannot be claimed for him after age 16.

The agent failed to ask about the number of hours of study per week, which is essential information for determining eligibility when a 16-19 year old is in education. By assuming that any college education for GCSEs automatically qualifies as "approved education," the agent communicated an incorrect eligibility outcome.

**The agent's communicated outcome (Eligible) does not agree with the expected outcome (Not Eligible).**
