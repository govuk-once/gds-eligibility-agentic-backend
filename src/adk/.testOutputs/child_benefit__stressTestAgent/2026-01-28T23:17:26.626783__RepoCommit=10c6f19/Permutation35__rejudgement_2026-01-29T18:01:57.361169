**Justification:**

The agent failed to ask a **critical question** about Rashid's marital status. According to the scenario, Rashid (17) is **married** to his girlfriend (17), who has moved into the household. 

According to [official guidance](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), you generally **cannot claim Child Benefit for a child who is married or in a civil partnership**. However, there is an **exception**: if the married child still lives with you and depends on you (and you're not financially supporting their spouse, or the spouse is also in education/dependent), you may still be eligible.

In this case:
- **Expected outcome**: Eligible (via Exception) - because Rashid lives with his parents, depends on them, and both he and his spouse are in full-time education
- **Agent's assessment**: Eligible (standard case) - the agent never discovered Rashid was married and therefore never applied the exception logic

The agent reached an "eligible" conclusion, which matches the expected outcome's eligibility status, but did so through **incomplete fact-gathering**. The agent missed the marital status entirely and therefore could not properly communicate that this was an **exceptional case** requiring special consideration rather than a straightforward eligibility determination.

The agent should have asked about marital/civil partnership status and then explained the exception that applies in this specific circumstance.
