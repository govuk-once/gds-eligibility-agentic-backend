**Justification:**

The agent communicated that Mark is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the official guidance and the expected outcome, Mark should be **eligible**.

**Key Issue:**

The agent incorrectly applied the "living with" requirement. According to GOV.UK guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), you can claim Child Benefit if you're responsible for a child, which includes situations where:

- You're contributing at least the equivalent of Child Benefit toward the child's upkeep (even if not living with them)

Mark pays £150/month (approximately £34.60/week), which exceeds the current Child Benefit rate of approximately £25/week for the eldest child. This satisfies the "responsibility" criterion under the contributing-to-upkeep exception.

**Critical Facts:**

1. Mark contributes more than the Child Benefit amount to Lucas's upkeep (£150/month vs ~£113/month)
2. Jenny (who lives with Lucas) is NOT claiming Child Benefit
3. There is no concurrent claim

**Correct Outcome:**

Mark IS eligible because:
- He meets the responsibility test through financial contribution exceeding the benefit amount
- No one else is claiming for Lucas
- Lucas meets the age requirement
- Mark meets residency requirements

The agent's determination that Mark is "definitely not eligible" contradicts the expected outcome of **Eligible** and misapplies the rules regarding contribution to a child's upkeep when not living with them.
