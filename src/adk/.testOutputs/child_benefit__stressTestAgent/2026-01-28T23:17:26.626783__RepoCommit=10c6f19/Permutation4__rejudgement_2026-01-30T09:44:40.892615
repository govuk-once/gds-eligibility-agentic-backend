2026-01-30T09:52:59.528684 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit for Sofia, which agrees with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.

**Justification:**

The agent properly identified all relevant disqualifying factors:

1. **Age consideration**: Sofia is 18, which is beyond the automatic eligibility age of 16
2. **Education/training requirement**: The agent correctly explained that for children aged 16-20, they must be in approved education or training to qualify
3. **Sofia's status**: Not in education (left school 2 years ago) and working 30 hours per week as a receptionist

The agent accurately applied the eligibility criteria per gov.uk guidance, which states Child Benefit continues after age 16 only if the young person is in approved education or training (until age 20 or the 31st August after their 19th birthday). Since Sofia meets neither the age criterion (under 16) nor the extended criterion (16-20 in approved education/training), the agent correctly concluded ineligibility.

The agent's communication was clear, well-reasoned, and included an offer to assess eligibility for any other children, demonstrating thoroughness. The outcome communicated aligns perfectly with the expected "Not Eligible" determination.
