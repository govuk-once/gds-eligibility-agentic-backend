**Justification:**

The agent communicated an **incorrect eligibility outcome** that does not agree with the expected outcome.

**Expected Outcome:** Not Eligible (Karen must stop her claim)

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** "Likely still eligible" and can "KEEP Child Benefit"

**Key Problems:**

1. **Misapplication of Rules**: According to gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, starting an apprenticeship in England is typically a disqualifying event. Young people on apprenticeships who receive a salary are generally NOT considered to be in "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.

2. **Incorrect Emphasis on Earnings Threshold**: The agent repeatedly focused on whether Ryan's earnings were below a certain threshold, suggesting this was the determining factor. However, the fundamental issue is that paid apprenticeships in England do not qualify as approved education/training, regardless of the wage level.

3. **Misleading Reassurance**: The agent told Karen multiple times that she was "LIKELY STILL ELIGIBLE" and could "KEEP Child Benefit," even stating "This is a positive situation - not a negative one." This directly contradicts the correct outcome that Karen is not eligible and must stop her claim.

4. **Failed to Correct Misunderstanding**: When Karen herself suggested "apprenticeships in england mean no child benefit right," the agent contradicted her, saying "No, that's not correct!" when Karen's understanding was actually closer to the correct position.

The agent should have clearly communicated that starting a paid apprenticeship disqualifies Ryan from being considered in approved education/training, meaning Karen is **not eligible** and must stop her Child Benefit claim.
