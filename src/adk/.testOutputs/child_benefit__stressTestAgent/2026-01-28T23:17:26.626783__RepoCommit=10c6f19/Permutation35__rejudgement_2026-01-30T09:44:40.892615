**Justification:**

The agent failed to ask a critical question about Rashid's marital status. According to the scenario, Rashid (17) is **married** and his wife has moved into the parents' house. This is a crucial eligibility factor.

According to GOV.UK guidance, you generally **cannot claim Child Benefit for a child who is married or in a civil partnership**, even if they are under 20 and in approved education.

However, there is an **exception**: you may still be eligible if the married child lives with you and depends on you (and you are not supporting their spouse, or the spouse is also in education/dependent).

The agent should have:
1. Asked whether Rashid is married or in a civil partnership
2. Upon learning he is married, explored the exception criteria
3. Determined that the **exception applies** (since Rashid lives with them, depends on them, and his wife is also 17 and presumably in education or dependent)
4. Communicated that they are **eligible via this exception**

Instead, the agent made a blanket determination of eligibility without ever discovering or addressing the marriage issue. While the **final outcome should be "Eligible (via Exception)"**, the agent's reasoning path was incomplete and failed to identify and properly evaluate the marriage complication that is central to this scenario.

The expected outcome is **Eligible (via Exception)** - the agent communicated **Eligible (standard)** without identifying the exception circumstances.
