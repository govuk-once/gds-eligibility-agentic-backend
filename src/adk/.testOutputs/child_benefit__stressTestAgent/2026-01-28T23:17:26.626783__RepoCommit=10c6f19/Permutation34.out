2026-01-28T23:35:51.288904 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:35:52.622163 [actor]: child benefit son 15 custdy

2026-01-28T23:35:55.009048 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 15-year-old son, which meets the age requirement.

Now I need to understand your custody arrangement better:

**Do you have your son living with you, or does he live with someone else (such as the other parent or another family member)?**

2026-01-28T23:35:56.416317 [actor]: hes in custdy been there 10 weeks

2026-01-28T23:35:58.400918 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand your 15-year-old son has been in custody for 10 weeks.

This is an important factor for Child Benefit eligibility. Let me ask:

**Is your son in youth custody (such as a young offender institution or secure children's home), or is he in a different type of care arrangement?**

2026-01-28T23:35:59.759857 [actor]: youth custdy sentance 6 months

2026-01-28T23:36:02.123843 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son is in youth custody serving a 6-month sentence.

This is relevant to your Child Benefit eligibility. Let me ask you one more important question:

**Before your son went into youth custody, was he living with you and were you receiving Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T23:36:03.864723 [actor]: yes was claiming for him before

2026-01-28T23:36:08.853123 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me give you an assessment based on what you've told me.

**Regarding your Child Benefit eligibility:**

Unfortunately, **you are not eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit while your son is in youth custody**. 

Here's why:
- Child Benefit stops when a child or young person is in custody, even if they're under 20 years old
- This applies from the date they enter custody
- Since your son has been in youth custody for 10 weeks and is serving a 6-month sentence, you should not be claiming Child Benefit during this period

**Important actions you should take:**
- If you haven't already done so, you need to report this change in circumstances to the Child Benefit Office immediately
- You should stop your Child Benefit claim while your son remains in custody

**When he's released:**
- You can reclaim Child Benefit once your son is released from custody and living with you again (assuming he's still under 20 and meets the other eligibility criteria)

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?

2026-01-28T23:36:10.581549 [actor]: ok so no child benefit while in custdy got it

2026-01-28T23:36:14.079725 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately informed the user that they are not eligible for Child Benefit while their son is in youth custody, correctly applied the rules regarding children in detention, and appropriately advised them to report the change in circumstances to the Child Benefit Office.
