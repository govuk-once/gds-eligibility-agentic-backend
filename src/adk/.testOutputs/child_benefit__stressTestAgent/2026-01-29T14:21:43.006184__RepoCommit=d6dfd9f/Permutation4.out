2026-01-29T14:23:32.356017 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T14:23:33.989027 [actor]: Yes, I have a daughter, Sofia. She's 18 years old.

2026-01-29T14:23:36.262382 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To determine your eligibility, I need to know:

**Is Sofia in approved education or training?**

(For example, is she studying full-time at school, college, or on an approved training course?)

2026-01-29T14:23:38.004239 [actor]: No, she's not in any education or training. She left school two years ago and she's been working as a receptionist. She works about 30 hours a week.

2026-01-29T14:23:40.760836 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you've told me, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia**. 

Here's why: Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved full-time education or training. Since Sofia is 18, working, and not in approved education or training, she doesn't meet the criteria.

**Do you have any other children who might be eligible, or is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?**

2026-01-29T14:23:42.996162 [actor]: No, Sofia is my only child. Thank you for helping me understand that I'm not eligible.

2026-01-29T14:23:47.621237 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because Sofia is 18 years old, not in approved education or training, and is working full-time, which means she does not meet the eligibility criteria requiring children to be either under 16 or under 20 and in approved education or training.
