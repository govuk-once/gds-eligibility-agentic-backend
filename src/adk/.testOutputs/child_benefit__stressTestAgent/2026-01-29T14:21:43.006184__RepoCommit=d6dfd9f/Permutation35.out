2026-01-29T14:49:53.788760 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T14:49:56.075424 [actor]: Hello! Yes, I do have a child. My son Rashid is 17 years old and he's currently in full-time education doing his A-Levels.

2026-01-29T14:49:58.508591 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that Rashid is 17 and in full-time education doing his A-Levels.

**Are you responsible for Rashid? In other words, do you live with him and are you responsible for his care and upbringing?**

2026-01-29T14:50:00.971792 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Rashid lives with us - with me and my wife in our house. We're responsible for his care and upbringing. He's still our dependent son living under our roof.

2026-01-29T14:50:02.525559 [root_agent]: That's very helpful, thank you.

**Are you or your wife currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:50:04.260947 [actor]: Yes, we all live in the UK. Our whole family lives here.

2026-01-29T14:50:06.463183 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

**One more important question: Are you or your wife getting certain other benefits or tax credits for Rashid that might affect Child Benefit eligibility? For example, are you claiming Universal Credit that includes an amount for him?**

2026-01-29T14:50:08.293442 [actor]: No, we're not claiming any other benefits or tax credits for Rashid. We just want to make sure we can continue claiming Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-29T14:50:13.532545 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Rashid. Here's why:

✓ Rashid is 17 years old and in full-time approved education (A-Levels), which means he qualifies as a child under the rules (children under 20 in approved education or training are eligible)

✓ You are responsible for him - he lives with you and your wife, and you're responsible for his care

✓ You live in the UK

✓ You're not claiming other benefits that would prevent you from claiming Child Benefit

**One important thing to be aware of:** If either you or your wife has an individual income over £60,000 per year, you may be liable to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge through your tax return, which could reduce or eliminate the benefit you receive. However, you would still be eligible to claim it, and many people choose to do so even if they have to pay the charge back, as it protects National Insurance credits (particularly important for the parent not working or earning less).

Do you have any other questions about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T14:50:16.217732 [actor]: Well, actually there's something I should mention. Rashid recently got married to his girlfriend - she's 17 as well. She's moved into our house with us. Does that change anything? I mean, he's still living with us and we're still supporting him while he finishes his A-Levels.

2026-01-29T14:50:18.688557 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that important information. This does change things, and I need to ask a follow-up question:

**Is Rashid's wife receiving Child Benefit for any children of their own?**

2026-01-29T14:50:20.562979 [actor]: No, they don't have any children. She just moved in with us after they got married. She's only 17 herself.

2026-01-29T14:50:24.643627 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

I need to inform you that **Rashid getting married does affect his eligibility for Child Benefit**, even though he's still under 20 and in approved education.

Under the Child Benefit rules, a young person aged 16 or over who gets married or enters into a civil partnership is no longer considered a qualifying child for Child Benefit purposes - even if they're still living with you, still in education, and you're still supporting them financially.

This means that unfortunately, **you would no longer be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Rashid** from the date of his marriage.

I understand this may not be the answer you were hoping for, especially as you're still providing for him while he completes his A-Levels. However, this is how the rules currently work.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T14:50:26.952702 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but I understand. No, I don't have any other questions. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T14:50:31.173344 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my son got married, but according to gov.uk guidance, marriage or civil partnership only disqualifies a young person from Child Benefit if they are aged 16-19 AND not in approved education or training. Since Rashid is 17 and in full-time approved education (A-Levels), he should still qualify as an exception to this rule, making me eligible for Child Benefit.
