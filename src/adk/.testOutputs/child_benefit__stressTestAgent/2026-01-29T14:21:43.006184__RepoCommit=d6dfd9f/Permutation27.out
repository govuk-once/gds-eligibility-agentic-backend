2026-01-29T14:45:55.215289 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:45:57.153329 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a baby girl, Mia. She's just a few months old.

2026-01-29T14:45:59.075133 [root_agent]: That's wonderful! Congratulations on your baby girl, Mia.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:46:00.588009 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I live with my parents.

2026-01-29T14:46:02.941762 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next, I need to ask:

**Are you the person responsible for Mia? This means you live with her and are responsible for her care (such as feeding, clothing, and providing for her day-to-day needs).**

2026-01-29T14:46:04.834004 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for Mia. I take care of her - I feed her, change her, and look after her every day. She lives with me at my parents' house.

2026-01-29T14:46:06.702983 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask:

**Is there anyone else who might also be claiming Child Benefit for Mia, or who might consider themselves equally responsible for her care?**

2026-01-29T14:46:08.335620 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming for Mia. I want to claim the Child Benefit for her myself.

2026-01-29T14:46:11.338595 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

One more important question:

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year, or do you expect to earn over £50,000 in the current tax year?**

(I ask this because while it doesn't affect your eligibility to *claim* Child Benefit, it may affect whether you need to pay some or all of it back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.)

2026-01-29T14:46:13.084027 [actor]: No, I don't earn that much at all. I'm only 15, so I don't have a job or anything like that.

2026-01-29T14:46:16.150035 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that important information.

This brings up a key question I need to ask:

**Since you're 15 years old, can you confirm whether you are Mia's parent, or are you her sibling or another relative caring for her?**

(This is important because the rules around who can claim Child Benefit depend on your relationship to the child and your circumstances.)

2026-01-29T14:46:17.733319 [actor]: I'm Mia's mum. She's my daughter.

2026-01-29T14:46:20.674600 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

I need to ask one more important question to assess your eligibility:

**Are your parents (Mia's grandparents) also involved in caring for Mia, or would they consider themselves to be equally or more responsible for her day-to-day care than you are?**

(This is important because if someone else in the household has greater responsibility for Mia's care, they might be the one who should claim Child Benefit instead.)

2026-01-29T14:46:22.603365 [actor]: Well, my parents do help out sometimes, but I'm the one who takes care of Mia. I'm her mum, so I'm responsible for her. I want to claim the Child Benefit myself.

2026-01-29T14:46:26.280779 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility:

**You appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Mia** because:

- You have a child (Mia) who is under 16
- You live in the UK
- You are responsible for Mia's care - you feed her, change her, and look after her day-to-day
- You live with Mia
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
- Your income is well below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold

The fact that you're 15 years old does not prevent you from claiming Child Benefit as Mia's parent, as long as you are the one responsible for her care.

**You can apply for Child Benefit and should be eligible to receive it.**

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-29T14:46:31.523305 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a 15-year-old parent living with their child and responsible for the child's care is eligible for Child Benefit, correctly identified all the key eligibility criteria, and appropriately noted that age does not prevent a parent from claiming if they are responsible for the child's care.
