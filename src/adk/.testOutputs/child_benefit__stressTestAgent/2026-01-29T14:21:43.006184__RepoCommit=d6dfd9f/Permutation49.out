2026-01-29T14:59:16.313756 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:59:18.086435 [actor]: Yes, I have a son who's 17. He's doing a computer coding course at the moment.

2026-01-29T14:59:20.555815 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Is the computer coding course your son is taking an approved education or training programme?** 

(For example, this could be full-time non-advanced education like A levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or approved training programmes.)

2026-01-29T14:59:22.552309 [actor]: Well, it's a full-time course, but his future employer is paying for the course fees. He's not getting paid himself, but there's an agreement that he'll join them after he finishes the course.

2026-01-29T14:59:25.766350 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

**Is this course recognized as approved education or training - such as A-levels, T-levels, NVQ level 3 or below, or another qualification approved by the government for Child Benefit purposes?**

(It doesn't matter who pays the fees - what's important is whether it's an approved educational qualification or training programme.)

2026-01-29T14:59:28.280333 [actor]: I'm not entirely sure about the specific qualification level. It's a computer coding course, but like I said, it's part of an agreement with his future employer - they're paying for it as part of a deal that he'll work for them afterwards. Does that still count as approved education?

2026-01-29T14:59:31.520107 [root_agent]: Thank you for that detail. Let me ask a more specific question to help clarify:

**Is your son enrolled with an educational institution (like a college, sixth form, or training provider) for this course, or is it an arrangement directly between him and the employer without going through a formal education or training provider?**

(The distinction is important because approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes typically needs to be through a recognized educational institution or approved training programme, rather than informal on-the-job training.)

2026-01-29T14:59:34.006453 [actor]: He's enrolled with a training provider for the course. But the employer is the one paying the fees directly, and it's all part of this agreement that he'll go work for them when he finishes. It's specifically set up so he can get a job with them afterwards.

2026-01-29T14:59:36.133367 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful information.

**Is your son receiving any wages or salary from this employer while he's doing the course?**

(This is important because if he's earning a wage or salary, he may be considered to be in employment rather than in approved education or training, which would affect Child Benefit eligibility.)

2026-01-29T14:59:38.046132 [actor]: No, he's not receiving any wages or salary. The employer is just paying for the course fees, but Tom isn't being paid anything himself.

2026-01-29T14:59:40.149612 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

**Does your son live with you, or are you responsible for him in terms of providing for his needs and making decisions about his upbringing?**

2026-01-29T14:59:41.770647 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me and I'm responsible for him - I provide for all his needs and make decisions about his upbringing.

2026-01-29T14:59:43.623187 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Are you currently living in the UK, and is your son also living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:59:45.144898 [actor]: Yes, we're both living in the UK.

2026-01-29T14:59:46.991320 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your son?**

(For example, the child's other parent, a grandparent, or another guardian?)

2026-01-29T14:59:48.571346 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-29T14:59:54.675506 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your 17-year-old son, provided that:

1. The training course he's enrolled in through the training provider is recognized as approved education or training (typically non-advanced education such as NVQ level 3 or below, or an approved training programme)
2. He remains under 20 years old
3. He continues in that approved education or training

**The key point to verify:** You'll need to confirm that the specific course your son is doing is considered "approved education or training" by HMRC. The fact that he's enrolled with a training provider (rather than just informally learning on the job), is not receiving wages, and is under 20 makes this likely to qualify - but the course itself needs to be an approved qualification.

Since you're responsible for him, he lives with you, you're both in the UK, and no one else is claiming for him, you meet the other eligibility criteria.

**Would you like to know how to check if his specific course qualifies as approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T14:59:56.587851 [actor]: Oh, that's helpful, thank you. Yes, I'd like to know how to check if his course qualifies as approved education or training please.

2026-01-29T15:00:00.035055 [root_agent]: I'm glad that was helpful!

To check if your son's course qualifies as approved education or training, you should:

**Contact HMRC's Child Benefit Office directly** - they can confirm whether the specific course your son is taking counts as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

When you contact them, have ready:
- The name of the training provider
- The name and details of the course
- Information about the qualification he'll receive at the end

You can reach the Child Benefit Office by phone, and they'll be able to give you a definitive answer about whether that particular course qualifies.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?**

2026-01-29T15:00:01.702882 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T15:00:05.910671 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent appropriately identified that I would likely be eligible for Child Benefit subject to verification that the specific training course qualifies as approved education or training, which is the correct conditional outcome since my 17-year-old son is enrolled with a training provider, is not receiving wages, lives with me, and no one else is claiming for him.
