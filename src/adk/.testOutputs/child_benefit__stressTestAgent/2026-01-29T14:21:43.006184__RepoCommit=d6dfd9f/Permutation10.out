2026-01-29T14:31:30.926330 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions to assess your situation.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T14:31:32.739082 [actor]: Yes, I do. I foster a 12-year-old boy named Liam who lives with me.

2026-01-29T14:31:35.182454 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since Liam is a foster child living with you, I need to ask: Do you receive any foster care payments or allowances from your local authority or fostering agency for looking after Liam?

2026-01-29T14:31:36.917219 [actor]: Yes, I do. The local council pays me a fostering allowance that covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance.

2026-01-29T14:31:41.199301 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** for Liam.

The reason is that foster carers who receive fostering allowances from their local authority are not entitled to Child Benefit for the foster children in their care. This is because the fostering allowance you receive is intended to cover the costs of looking after Liam, including his accommodation and maintenance.

Child Benefit is designed for parents or people who are responsible for a child without receiving such payments. Since you're already receiving financial support through the fostering allowance, you cannot claim Child Benefit for Liam as well.

However, if you have any other children of your own (biological or adopted) who live with you, you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for them - that would be a separate claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T14:31:44.899025 [actor]: No, that's very clear. Thank you for explaining that to me. I understand now that because the council pays the fostering allowance, I can't claim Child Benefit for Liam.

2026-01-29T14:31:47.284586 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that foster carers who receive fostering allowances from their local authority are not entitled to Child Benefit for foster children, as the fostering allowance already covers the child's costs, and provided clear reasoning throughout the conversation.
