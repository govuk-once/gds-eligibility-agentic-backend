2026-01-29T14:50:33.186247 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:50:35.756509 [actor]: Yes, I do. I'm worried though - my daughter Kelly is 16 and she just finished her GCSEs in June. She's been accepted into college to start her A-levels in September, but it's August now and she's not actually in school at the moment. Does that affect my Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T14:50:39.250997 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's a great question about Kelly's situation.

To help me assess this properly, I need to understand a bit more about Kelly's circumstances:

**Is Kelly currently enrolled or registered to start the college course in September, even though she's on summer break right now?**

(This is important because the rules around Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds often relate to whether they're enrolled in approved education or training, not just whether they're physically attending at this exact moment.)

2026-01-29T14:50:42.126451 [actor]: Yes, she is! She's been accepted and is registered to start her A-levels at the college in September. We've already sorted out all the enrollment paperwork. I just wasn't sure if there being this gap over the summer would be a problem for my Child Benefit.

2026-01-29T14:50:44.819274 [root_agent]: That's really helpful to know, thank you!

Let me ask you another important question to assess your eligibility:

**Are you the person who is primarily responsible for Kelly? By this I mean, does Kelly normally live with you, and are you the main person who looks after her and meets her day-to-day needs?**

2026-01-29T14:50:47.029995 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Kelly lives with me full-time and I'm her mum - I'm the one who looks after her and pays for everything she needs.

2026-01-29T14:50:49.601751 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now I need to ask about your circumstances:

**Do you normally live in the UK? And if you work, do you pay UK National Insurance contributions, or does your partner (if you have one)?**

(This helps me understand if you meet the residency and National Insurance requirements for Child Benefit.)

2026-01-29T14:50:51.272383 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK and I work here. I pay National Insurance through my job.

2026-01-29T14:50:54.104996 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for that information.

I have one more important question to complete my assessment:

**Is there anyone else who is also claiming Child Benefit for Kelly, or has anyone else claimed it for her in the past that might still have an active claim?**

(Only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child at any given time, so I need to check this.)

2026-01-29T14:50:56.056687 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming it. It's just me - I'm the only one who has claimed Child Benefit for Kelly.

2026-01-29T14:51:01.061366 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions so clearly!

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Kelly**.

Here's why:

✓ **You're responsible for Kelly** - she lives with you and you're her main carer
✓ **You live in the UK and pay National Insurance** - meeting the residency requirements
✓ **Nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Kelly**
✓ **Kelly is under 20** - she's 16 years old
✓ **Kelly is in approved education** - she's enrolled to start A-levels in September

Regarding your specific concern about the summer gap: The fact that Kelly has finished her GCSEs and is registered to start college in September should **not** affect your Child Benefit. The summer break between finishing GCSEs and starting college/sixth form is a normal transition period, and Child Benefit typically continues during this time as long as the young person is enrolled to continue their education.

Your Child Benefit should continue as long as Kelly remains in approved education or training, which can include A-levels, until she turns 20 (or until she leaves education, whichever comes first).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T14:51:03.749606 [actor]: Oh that's such a relief! I was really worried about losing it over the summer. Thank you so much for explaining that - it's really helpful to know that the summer gap between her GCSEs and starting college won't be a problem. I feel much better now!

2026-01-29T14:51:08.247664 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am eligible for Child Benefit, correctly identifying that the summer gap between finishing GCSEs and starting A-levels does not affect eligibility when the child is enrolled to continue education, and properly verified all necessary criteria including residency, responsibility for the child, and that no one else is claiming.
