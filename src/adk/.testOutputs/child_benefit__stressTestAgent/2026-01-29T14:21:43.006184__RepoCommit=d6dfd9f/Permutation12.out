2026-01-29T14:32:21.114423 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I need to ask you a few questions.

Let me start with the first one:

**Are you responsible for a child under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T14:32:22.764523 [actor]: Yes, I am. My son Liam is 18 and he's studying for his A-levels, so he's in approved education.

2026-01-29T14:32:24.667798 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that Liam is 18 and studying for his A-levels, which counts as approved education.

Now, my next question:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:32:26.272548 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T14:32:28.292652 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that.

Next question:

**Are you the person responsible for Liam? This means you're the main person looking after him and he normally lives with you.**

2026-01-29T14:32:30.050932 [actor]: Yes, Liam lives with me. I'm his mum and I look after him.

2026-01-29T14:32:32.487509 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

One more important question:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

(This is important because if either of you earns over £50,000, it may affect your Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.)

2026-01-29T14:32:34.152166 [actor]: No, my income is under £50,000.

2026-01-29T14:32:38.639224 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me:

✓ You are responsible for Liam, who is 18 and in approved education (studying for A-levels)
✓ Liam lives with you
✓ You live in the UK
✓ Your income is under £50,000

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

You meet the key criteria:
- You're responsible for a child under 20 who is in approved education or training
- The child lives with you
- You live in the UK

Since your income is under £50,000, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means you can receive the full Child Benefit payment without any tax implications.

If you haven't already claimed, you can apply for Child Benefit. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T14:32:40.942533 [actor]: Oh that's great news, thank you! No, I think that's all I needed to know.

2026-01-29T14:32:44.901375 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to the scenario, the expected outcome is "Not Eligible," but the agent concluded I was eligible for Child Benefit, which contradicts the expected outcome provided in the prompt.
