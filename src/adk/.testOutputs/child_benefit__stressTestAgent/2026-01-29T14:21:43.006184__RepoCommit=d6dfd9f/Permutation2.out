2026-01-29T14:22:16.345017 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this, I need to ask you a few questions.

Let me start with the first one:

**Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:22:38.967019 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter who's 17, and she's studying full-time for her A-levels at a local sixth-form college.

2026-01-29T14:22:42.077983 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your daughter being 17 and studying full-time for her A-levels should meet the age requirement, as Child Benefit can continue for young people under 20 in approved education or training.

Let me ask the next question:

**Do you live in the UK, or are you a Crown servant (such as a diplomat or member of HM Forces) or a cross-border worker with the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein?**

2026-01-29T14:22:43.531520 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I'm based in London.

2026-01-29T14:22:46.352172 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Now, let me ask you this:

**Are you the person responsible for your daughter? By this I mean, does she normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards her upbringing (if she lives elsewhere)?**

2026-01-29T14:22:48.087773 [actor]: Yes, she lives with me. I'm a single father and Priya lives with me here in London.

2026-01-29T14:22:50.118513 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you or your daughter subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on your right to remain in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:22:51.776651 [actor]: No, we don't have any immigration restrictions. We're UK residents with no restrictions on our right to remain.

2026-01-29T14:22:53.692982 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question:

**Is your daughter currently in hospital or in the care of a local authority (such as in foster care or a children's home)?**

2026-01-29T14:22:55.361140 [actor]: No, she's not. She lives at home with me and isn't in hospital or care.

2026-01-29T14:23:00.069502 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you should be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You have a daughter who is 17 and in full-time approved education (studying A-levels at sixth-form college)
2. ✓ You live in the UK with no immigration restrictions
3. ✓ Your daughter normally lives with you, and you're responsible for her
4. ✓ She's not in hospital or local authority care

You meet the main eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

**One final thing to be aware of:** If you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 a year, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which reduces or cancels out the benefit through the tax system. However, this doesn't affect your eligibility to claim - you can still claim and receive the payments.

Would you like any further information about how to claim or anything else regarding Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T14:23:06.701945 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria (child under 20 in approved education, UK residence, responsible person, no immigration restrictions, child not in care/hospital) and correctly concluded eligibility, while also appropriately mentioning the High Income Child Benefit Charge as additional information without affecting the eligibility determination.
