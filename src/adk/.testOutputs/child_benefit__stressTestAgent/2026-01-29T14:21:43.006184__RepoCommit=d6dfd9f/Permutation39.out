2026-01-29T14:52:25.116472 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine whether you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T14:52:27.379981 [actor]: Yes, I do. My wife Helen and I have two children - they're 6 and 8 years old. We adopted them as they're siblings.

2026-01-29T14:52:30.087915 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's wonderful that you've kept the siblings together through adoption.

Now, let me ask you: **Are you or your wife Helen responsible for the children?** By this, I mean do either of you live with the children and are responsible for paying for things like their food, clothes, and housing?

2026-01-29T14:52:32.618907 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Both Helen and I are responsible for them. We live with the children and take care of all their needs - food, clothes, housing, everything. 

I should mention that because the children have special needs, the Local Authority does pay us an Adoption Allowance to help with the costs, but we're definitely the ones responsible for their care.

2026-01-29T14:52:35.007596 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail. It's clear you and Helen are fully responsible for your children's care.

Now I need to ask: **Do you or your wife Helen currently live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:52:36.363577 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK with the children.

2026-01-29T14:52:39.081109 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Are you or your wife Helen receiving any of the following benefits or payments for the same children:**

- Guardian's Allowance
- Child Benefit from another country (such as from the EU or another nation)

Or is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for these children?

2026-01-29T14:52:40.989193 [actor]: No, we're not receiving Guardian's Allowance or Child Benefit from another country. And no one else is claiming Child Benefit for these children - it's just us looking after them.

2026-01-29T14:52:44.743525 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification.

One more important question: **Between you and your wife Helen, who would be the main person responsible for the children, or do you share responsibility equally?** 

I ask because if you both qualify, only one of you can claim Child Benefit, and it's usually better for the person with the lower income to claim (as there can be tax implications if either of you has an individual income over £60,000 per year).

So, do either you or Helen earn over £60,000 per year individually?

2026-01-29T14:52:47.963434 [actor]: Helen and I share responsibility equally really, but I suppose Helen is the main day-to-day carer since she manages most of their appointments and special needs support. 

As for income, I earn over £60,000 per year, but Helen earns less than that.

2026-01-29T14:52:54.539106 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information - that's very helpful.

Based on what you've told me, **you and Helen appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's what this means for your situation:

**Eligibility:**
- You have two children under 16 living with you
- You're both responsible for the children
- You live in the UK
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for them

**Important considerations:**

Since you earn over £60,000 per year and Helen earns less, **it would be better for Helen to claim the Child Benefit**. This is because:

- If the higher earner (you) has an individual income between £60,000-£80,000, there's a High Income Child Benefit Charge (tax charge) that applies
- The charge increases gradually, and if someone earns £80,000 or more, they have to pay back all of the Child Benefit received
- By having Helen claim it (as the lower earner), you can avoid or reduce this tax charge

**Next steps:**
Helen can apply for Child Benefit. You'll receive payments for both children.

Do you have any questions about the eligibility or the High Income Child Benefit Charge?

2026-01-29T14:52:57.081568 [actor]: That's great news, thank you! No, I think you've explained everything clearly. It makes sense for Helen to be the one to claim it given the income difference. We'll get Helen to apply for the Child Benefit then.

Thanks so much for your help!

2026-01-29T14:53:02.030574 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the family is eligible for Child Benefit based on having two children under 16, living in the UK, being responsible for their care, and no one else claiming for them. The agent also correctly advised that Helen (the lower earner) should claim to avoid the High Income Child Benefit Charge since the user earns over £60,000. The advice regarding the Adoption Allowance not affecting eligibility was implicitly correct as the agent proceeded with the assessment appropriately.
