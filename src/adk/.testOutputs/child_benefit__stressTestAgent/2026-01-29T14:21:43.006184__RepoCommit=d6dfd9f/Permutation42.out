2026-01-29T14:55:03.010087 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T14:55:05.494658 [actor]: Hello! Yes, I'm asking about my situation. I'm 17 years old and I live with my mum in Cardiff. I've recently left school and started a Foundation Apprenticeship that's funded by the Welsh Government. My mum is wondering if she can still get Child Benefit for me now that I'm doing this apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T14:55:09.120235 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. This is helpful information.

To assess your mum's eligibility for Child Benefit for you, I need to understand more about your apprenticeship.

**Is your Foundation Apprenticeship considered "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes?** 

Specifically, does it meet these criteria:
- Is it full-time (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience)?
- Is it non-advanced education (below degree level)?

Or to put it more simply: **How many hours per week does your apprenticeship involve, and is it below degree level?**

2026-01-29T14:55:12.511016 [actor]: Yes, it's definitely below degree level - it's a Foundation Apprenticeship, so it's quite a basic level really. And yes, it's full-time, definitely more than 12 hours a week. I'm there most days doing the coursework and the work placement that's part of it.

But I'm a bit confused because I thought apprenticeships might not count for Child Benefit? Is there something different about the Welsh Foundation Apprenticeships?

2026-01-29T14:55:16.580825 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You've raised an important point about apprenticeships and Child Benefit.

Let me clarify: **Is your Foundation Apprenticeship one where you are employed and receiving a wage or salary, or is it primarily an educational course without employed status?**

This is a crucial distinction because:
- If you're employed as an apprentice (even if it includes training), Child Benefit typically stops
- However, if it's an education or training course that isn't employment, it may still qualify

So, **are you employed and earning wages as part of this Foundation Apprenticeship, or is it structured more as a course with work experience?**

2026-01-29T14:55:19.331160 [actor]: I am getting paid as part of the apprenticeship - I have an employer and I'm earning a wage. It's a proper apprenticeship with a contract and everything. I work for a company and they're paying me while I do the training.

Does that mean my mum won't be able to get Child Benefit for me anymore?

2026-01-29T14:55:24.205899 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that - yes, that is an important detail.

**Unfortunately, based on the rules, your mum would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for you.** This is because you are now employed under an apprenticeship contract and earning a wage. Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training, but this specifically excludes those who are in paid employment, including paid apprenticeships.

Since you have an employer, a contract, and are receiving wages, this counts as paid work rather than qualifying education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Your mum should inform the Child Benefit Office about this change in your circumstances, as Child Benefit should stop from when you started your paid apprenticeship. This is important to avoid any overpayments that would need to be repaid later.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this decision or Child Benefit in general?

2026-01-29T14:55:26.472166 [actor]: Oh, that's disappointing but I understand. Thanks for explaining it clearly. I'll let my mum know she needs to contact the Child Benefit Office about this change.

No, I think that answers my question. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T14:55:31.519285 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent concluded that the mother is ineligible for Child Benefit because the child has a paid apprenticeship, but according to gov.uk guidance, approved training programs including certain government-funded apprenticeships can qualify for Child Benefit even when paid, and Welsh Government-funded Foundation Apprenticeships are approved training that should maintain Child Benefit eligibility until age 20.
