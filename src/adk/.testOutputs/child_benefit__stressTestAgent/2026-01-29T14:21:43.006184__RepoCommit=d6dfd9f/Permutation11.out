2026-01-29T14:31:49.766843 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T14:31:51.598070 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who's 17. He's just started an apprenticeship actually - an Intermediate Apprenticeship. He lives at home with me.

2026-01-29T14:31:54.468019 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Is your son's apprenticeship an approved apprenticeship in England? Specifically, is it one of the following types:
- Intermediate Apprenticeship
- Advanced Apprenticeship
- Higher Apprenticeship

I ask because the rules for Child Benefit state that for young people aged 16-19, they must be in approved education or training, and I need to confirm whether apprenticeships qualify under these rules.

2026-01-29T14:31:56.346108 [actor]: Yes, it's an Intermediate Apprenticeship and it's in England. He only just started it - left school to do it.

2026-01-29T14:31:59.487912 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. I need to check something important about apprenticeships and Child Benefit eligibility.

Let me ask you this: Is your son receiving a wage or salary from his apprenticeship?

This is relevant because the eligibility rules for Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds in education or training have specific criteria, and I need to understand the details of his apprenticeship to assess your eligibility correctly.

2026-01-29T14:32:01.773991 [actor]: Yes, he is getting paid. It's an apprenticeship, so he gets an apprentice wage from his employer.

2026-01-29T14:32:06.240640 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you of an important point:

Unfortunately, if your son is receiving a wage or salary from his apprenticeship, this typically means he would not qualify as being in "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes. Young people aged 16-19 who are on paid apprenticeships are generally not covered by Child Benefit because they are earning a wage.

Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds usually applies to those in full-time non-advanced education (like A-levels or similar) or unpaid approved training, but not to those in paid employment or paid apprenticeships.

However, to be thorough, let me ask: Are you the person responsible for your son? That is, does he live with you and are you responsible for him?

2026-01-29T14:32:08.350563 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for him. He lives with me at home - he's my son and I look after him.

2026-01-29T14:32:12.528688 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Based on the information you've provided:

- Your son is 17 years old
- He lives with you and you're responsible for him
- He's on an Intermediate Apprenticeship in England
- He's receiving wages from his apprenticeship

Unfortunately, you would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit in this situation.

The reason is that while Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training, paid apprenticeships do not qualify. Your son is now in paid employment through his apprenticeship, which means he's no longer considered to be in the type of education or training that qualifies for Child Benefit purposes.

Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds typically applies to those in:
- Full-time non-advanced education (such as A-levels)
- Unpaid approved training courses

Since your son is earning a wage from his apprenticeship, this would disqualify him from being counted for Child Benefit, even though he's still under 20 and living at home with you.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-29T14:32:16.392208 [actor]: No, that's clear. Thank you for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T14:32:19.123327 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that paid apprenticeships do not qualify for Child Benefit purposes for 16-19 year olds, as those in paid employment through apprenticeships are not considered to be in "approved education or training" that would maintain Child Benefit eligibility.
