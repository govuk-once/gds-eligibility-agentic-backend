2026-01-29T14:30:38.852111 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:30:40.508418 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who is 5 years old.

2026-01-29T14:30:42.358155 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Does your 5-year-old son normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T14:30:44.244775 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me.

2026-01-29T14:30:46.306539 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

**Are you responsible for your son? This means you're the one who looks after him and pays for things like food, clothes, and housing for him.**

2026-01-29T14:30:47.932277 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for him. I look after him and pay for his food, clothes, and everything he needs.

2026-01-29T14:30:49.830333 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your residency status:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:30:51.386289 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I moved here from Germany recently.

2026-01-29T14:30:54.241707 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Are you subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on your right to remain in the UK?**

(For context: if you're an EU citizen who moved to the UK recently, you may have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, or other immigration status.)

2026-01-29T14:30:55.660443 [actor]: I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme.

2026-01-29T14:30:57.907759 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

**Are you currently working in the UK, or have you worked in the UK since arriving?**

(This is important because having Pre-Settled Status may require you to have a "right to reside" which can be established through work or other qualifying circumstances.)

2026-01-29T14:30:59.797507 [actor]: I'm not currently working. I'm unemployed at the moment, but I am actively looking for work and I have registered as a jobseeker.

2026-01-29T14:31:02.237774 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Before you moved to the UK from Germany, were you working in Germany or another EU country, and if so, were you paying social security contributions there?**

(This is relevant because your previous work and social security history in the EU may affect your eligibility while you're job-seeking in the UK.)

2026-01-29T14:31:04.066736 [actor]: Yes, I was working in Germany before I moved here and I was paying social security contributions there.

2026-01-29T14:31:06.087258 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

**How long ago did you move to the UK from Germany?**

(The timing of your move and how long you've been job-seeking can be relevant to your eligibility.)

2026-01-29T14:31:07.841444 [actor]: I moved to the UK about 3 months ago.

2026-01-29T14:31:09.939410 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Is anyone else also claiming Child Benefit for your son, such as his other parent or another family member?**

2026-01-29T14:31:11.566470 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for my son.

2026-01-29T14:31:13.751404 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Let me ask one more question to complete the assessment:

**Are you receiving any UK benefits currently, such as Universal Credit or Jobseeker's Allowance, or have you applied for any?**

(This helps establish your connection to the UK benefit system and may be relevant to your right to reside.)

2026-01-29T14:31:15.484609 [actor]: No, I haven't applied for or received any UK benefits yet. I only registered as a jobseeker.

2026-01-29T14:31:21.698150 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, here's my assessment of your Child Benefit eligibility:

**You may face challenges with your Child Benefit claim** due to your immigration status and circumstances. Here's why:

✓ **You meet the basic requirements:**
- You have a child under 16 who lives with you
- You're responsible for your son
- You live in the UK

⚠ **However, there's a potential issue with "right to reside":**
- With Pre-Settled Status, you need to have a "right to reside" in the UK to claim Child Benefit
- As a jobseeker from the EU, you may have a right to reside for up to 3 months (potentially up to 6 months in some cases) while genuinely seeking work
- Since you moved 3 months ago and are unemployed, you're approaching or may have reached the time limit for jobseeker status

**My recommendation:**
You should still apply for Child Benefit, but be aware that your claim may be assessed based on your right to reside. Your previous work in Germany and social security contributions may be relevant to your case.

I'd suggest contacting the Child Benefit Office directly to discuss your specific circumstances, particularly your Pre-Settled Status and jobseeking situation, to get definitive guidance on your eligibility.

Would you like any clarification on this assessment?

2026-01-29T14:31:23.574758 [actor]: No, that's clear. Thank you for explaining everything to me.

2026-01-29T14:31:28.667295 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated "You may face challenges with your Child Benefit claim" and suggested uncertainty about eligibility, when the scenario indicates the expected outcome is "Eligible." While the agent correctly identified that I meet basic requirements, they incorrectly introduced doubt about right to reside for EU citizens with Pre-Settled Status who are jobseekers, when such individuals can be eligible for Child Benefit during their genuine jobseeking period (which I am within at 3 months).
