2026-01-29T14:33:48.827596 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T14:33:50.430061 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Emma. She's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T14:33:52.311855 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next, I need to ask: Is Emma living with you, and are you responsible for her care?

2026-01-29T14:33:54.520455 [actor]: No, she doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother. But I do contribute to her upkeep - I send money to her mum every week, about £10 for food, and I send her a birthday present each year.

2026-01-29T14:33:56.659564 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that situation.

Let me ask: Does Emma's mother currently claim Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-29T14:33:58.697756 [actor]: No, her mother doesn't claim Child Benefit for Emma.

2026-01-29T14:34:00.697528 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Since Emma doesn't live with you but lives with her mother, I need to understand the living arrangements better. Does Emma's mother have the main responsibility for Emma's day-to-day care?

2026-01-29T14:34:02.559265 [actor]: Yes, Emma's mother has the main responsibility for her day-to-day care since Emma lives with her.

2026-01-29T14:34:06.628351 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you've told me, I need to explain the eligibility criteria. Child Benefit is generally paid to the person who has the main responsibility for the child and who the child lives with.

Since Emma lives with her mother and her mother has the main responsibility for Emma's day-to-day care, her mother would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma - even though she's not currently claiming it.

The contributions you make (the £10 weekly for food and birthday presents) are very positive, but they don't make you eligible for Child Benefit when Emma doesn't live with you and someone else has the main day-to-day responsibility for her care.

**You would not be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.**

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T14:34:09.195660 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but I understand. So even though her mother isn't claiming it, I still can't claim it because Emma doesn't live with me and her mum has the main responsibility. That makes sense, I suppose.

No, I think that's clear. Thank you for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T14:34:13.556178 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter lives with her mother who has the main day-to-day caring responsibility, even though the mother is not currently claiming the benefit. This aligns with the eligibility rules that Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with and who has main responsibility for their care.
