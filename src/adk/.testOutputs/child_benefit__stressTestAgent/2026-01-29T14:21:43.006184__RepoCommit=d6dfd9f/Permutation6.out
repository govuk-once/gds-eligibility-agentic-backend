2026-01-29T14:24:32.415214 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:24:34.068963 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Chloe. She's 6 years old.

2026-01-29T14:24:35.750819 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does Chloe live with you, or does she live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T14:24:38.132789 [actor]: Well, actually, she's been in hospital for about 14 weeks now. She has a serious condition, so she's been there for quite a while. But I visit her every day.

2026-01-29T14:24:40.080475 [root_agent]: I'm sorry to hear that Chloe has been unwell. Thank you for sharing that information.

Next question: **Before Chloe went into hospital, did she normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T14:24:42.164881 [actor]: Yes, she did. She normally lives with me. It's just this hospital stay because of her condition.

2026-01-29T14:24:44.284455 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. I have a few more questions to help assess your eligibility.

Next question: **Are you currently responsible for Chloe? By this I mean, do you still make decisions about her care and wellbeing, and do you still pay for things she needs?**

2026-01-29T14:24:46.468702 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm still completely responsible for her. I make all the decisions about her care, and I spend money on her regularly - about £30 a week on things like books, pyjamas, and special food that she needs while she's in hospital.

2026-01-29T14:24:48.210937 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. That's helpful to know.

Next question: **Are you and Chloe both currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:24:50.377053 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. I'm here and Chloe is in a UK hospital.

2026-01-29T14:24:52.503471 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Do you or your partner currently receive Child Benefit for Chloe, or have you claimed it in the past?**

2026-01-29T14:24:54.393532 [actor]: No, I haven't claimed it before. That's why I'm asking now - I wanted to find out if I'm eligible.

2026-01-29T14:24:56.381434 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification.

Next question: **Are you the only person responsible for Chloe, or is there another parent or partner who also shares responsibility for her care?**

2026-01-29T14:24:58.776781 [actor]: I'm the only one responsible for her. It's just me taking care of her needs and making decisions for her.

2026-01-29T14:25:01.233782 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me ask one final question to complete the assessment:

**Do you have the right to live and work in the UK? For example, are you a UK citizen, or do you have settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits?**

2026-01-29T14:25:02.940683 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK citizen. I have the right to live and work here.

2026-01-29T14:25:08.436893 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, **you should be eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Chloe) who is under 16
✓ You are responsible for her - you make decisions about her care and spend money on her needs
✓ She normally lives with you when not in hospital
✓ Both you and Chloe live in the UK
✓ You have the right to live and work in the UK

Regarding Chloe's hospital stay: The good news is that you can continue to claim Child Benefit even while she's in hospital, as long as:
- She normally lives with you (which she does)
- You're still responsible for her (which you are)
- You continue to spend money on her (which you do - approximately £30 per week)

The fact that you visit her regularly and continue to buy things she needs shows you maintain your parental responsibility during her hospital stay.

**You can now go ahead and make a claim for Child Benefit.** Since you haven't claimed before, you'll need to start a new claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T14:25:10.977198 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you! I'm glad to know I can claim it even while she's in hospital. I'll go ahead and make the claim now.

2026-01-29T14:25:16.106460 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user is eligible for Child Benefit despite the child being in hospital for 14 weeks, correctly applying the exception that allows claims when the child is hospitalized but normally lives with the claimant, the claimant remains responsible for the child, and continues to spend money on the child's needs.
