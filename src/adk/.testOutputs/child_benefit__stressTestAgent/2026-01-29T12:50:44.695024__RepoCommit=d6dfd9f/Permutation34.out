2026-01-29T13:10:57.125676 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T13:10:58.771526 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have a son, Mark, he's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T13:11:00.282960 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Does Mark live with you?**

2026-01-29T13:11:01.947227 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me at the moment. He's been in a youth custody center for the past 10 weeks. He was sentenced to 6 months there.

2026-01-29T13:11:04.059609 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this must be a difficult situation.

To help determine your eligibility, I need to ask: **Before Mark went into the youth custody center, did he normally live with you, and are you planning for him to return to live with you when he's released?**

2026-01-29T13:11:05.949277 [actor]: Yes, he lived with me before he was sentenced, and yes, he'll be coming back home to live with me when he's released.

2026-01-29T13:11:08.228291 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now I need to ask: **Are you or your partner receiving any other benefits or financial support specifically for Mark, such as Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, or income-related Employment and Support Allowance that includes an amount for him?**

2026-01-29T13:11:09.793599 [actor]: No, I'm not receiving any other benefits or financial support specifically for Mark.

2026-01-29T13:11:11.798540 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

One more question to help me assess your situation: **Are you the only person responsible for Mark, or does anyone else also have parental responsibility for him (such as another parent or guardian)?**

2026-01-29T13:11:13.701534 [actor]: I'm his mother and I'm the one who was claiming Child Benefit for him before this happened. His father isn't involved.

2026-01-29T13:11:18.975568 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you should still be eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit for Mark** even while he's in the youth custody center.

The key factors that support your eligibility are:

- Mark is under 16 (he's 15)
- He normally lived with you before going into custody
- He will be returning to live with you after his release
- You're not receiving other benefits that include an amount for him
- You were already claiming Child Benefit for him

When a child is in custody or detention, you can generally continue to receive Child Benefit as long as the child normally lives with you and will return to you. The temporary period in the youth custody center doesn't automatically stop your entitlement.

You should be able to continue your Child Benefit claim throughout Mark's time in custody. If you have any concerns or if HMRC contacts you about this, you can explain that Mark is temporarily in custody but normally lives with you and will return home.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-29T13:11:21.291439 [actor]: Oh, that's a relief to hear! No, I think that answers my question. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T13:11:25.598320 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in custody or detention, you cannot get Child Benefit while your child is detained in custody - even temporarily. The agent incorrectly stated that I could continue claiming Child Benefit while Mark is in the youth custody center.
