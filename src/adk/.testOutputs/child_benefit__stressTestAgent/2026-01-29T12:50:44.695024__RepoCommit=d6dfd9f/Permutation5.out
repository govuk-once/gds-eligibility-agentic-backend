2026-01-29T12:53:17.071826 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T12:53:18.684996 [actor]: Yes, I am. My son Lucas is 10 years old.

2026-01-29T12:53:20.490612 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now, to continue assessing your eligibility: **Does your son Lucas normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T12:53:22.241467 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me. He lives with his ex-wife Jenny. But I do contribute money towards his upkeep - I send Jenny £150 every month specifically for Lucas's food and clothes.

2026-01-29T12:53:24.771660 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Since Lucas lives with your ex-wife Jenny, I need to understand the living arrangements better: **Does Lucas ever stay with you, and if so, how often does he stay with you compared to staying with Jenny?**

2026-01-29T12:53:27.323919 [actor]: He stays with me some weekends, but he mainly lives with Jenny full-time. She's his primary residence - he goes to school from her house and that's where all his things are. I just have him for occasional visits.

2026-01-29T12:53:31.798128 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you've told me, I need to explain how Child Benefit works in your situation:

**Child Benefit is generally only paid to one person for each child** - typically the person the child lives with most of the time. Since Lucas lives primarily with Jenny (his main residence is with her, he attends school from her house, and he only stays with you occasionally), **Jenny would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas, not you.**

The fact that you contribute financially towards Lucas's upkeep is admirable and shows you're fulfilling your parental responsibilities, but financial contributions alone don't make you eligible for Child Benefit when the child doesn't live with you as their main home.

**However**, let me ask one more question to be thorough: **Is Jenny currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucas?**

2026-01-29T12:53:33.320063 [actor]: No, Jenny is not claiming Child Benefit for Lucas. She's never applied for it.

2026-01-29T12:53:37.128765 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important information.

This changes things. Even though Lucas doesn't live with you primarily, there's a possibility you could still claim Child Benefit in this situation.

Let me ask: **Do you and Jenny have any formal or informal agreement about Lucas's care arrangements, and would Jenny be willing to confirm in writing that she is not claiming Child Benefit and does not intend to claim it?**

This is important because if the person the child normally lives with chooses not to claim Child Benefit, someone else who contributes to the child's upkeep may be able to claim it instead - but this typically requires the person the child lives with to agree to this arrangement.

2026-01-29T12:53:39.593494 [actor]: Yes, we have an informal agreement. I send her £150 every month - it's a regular arrangement we've had since the divorce. Jenny's not interested in claiming Child Benefit herself, and I'm sure she'd be willing to confirm that in writing if needed. She knows I contribute to Lucas's upkeep.

2026-01-29T12:53:44.070063 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification.

Based on the information you've provided, here's my assessment:

**You may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas**, but there are important considerations:

1. **You contribute regularly to Lucas's upkeep** - the £150 monthly payments for his food and clothes demonstrate you're contributing to the cost of supporting him.

2. **Jenny (the person Lucas lives with) is not claiming Child Benefit and would confirm she doesn't intend to claim it** - this is crucial, as only one person can claim for each child.

3. **The arrangement would need to be formalized** - Jenny would likely need to provide written confirmation that she's not claiming and agrees to you claiming instead.

**My recommendation would be that you are potentially eligible to apply for Child Benefit in these circumstances.** However, given that Lucas doesn't live with you primarily, you should apply and explain your specific situation to HMRC, including that you contribute to his upkeep and that Jenny (with whom he lives) is not claiming and doesn't wish to claim.

Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T12:53:46.027749 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your help - I'll go ahead and apply then and explain the situation to HMRC.

2026-01-29T12:53:50.758882 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that while the child lives primarily with the ex-wife, the user may be eligible to claim Child Benefit because they contribute regularly to the child's upkeep (£150 monthly), the primary carer is not claiming and won't claim, and only one person can claim per child - which aligns with the rules at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else that allow someone who contributes to a child's upkeep to claim if the person the child lives with is not claiming.
