2026-01-29T13:04:28.176147 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T13:04:29.760802 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter who's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T13:04:31.884027 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next, I need to ask: Is your daughter living with you, or are you responsible for her?

2026-01-29T13:04:33.903957 [actor]: No, she doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother.

2026-01-29T13:04:36.067845 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Since your daughter doesn't live with you, I need to understand more about your situation. Do you contribute towards your daughter's upbringing - for example, do you pay maintenance or contribute financially to her care?

2026-01-29T13:04:37.801740 [actor]: Yes, I do contribute. Every 4 weeks, I buy a large bulk order of groceries and clothes for my daughter that costs £120, and I deliver them to her mother.

2026-01-29T13:04:39.528245 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Let me ask: Does anyone else currently claim Child Benefit for your daughter - for example, does her mother claim it?

2026-01-29T13:04:41.579519 [actor]: I'm not sure if her mother claims it or not. I haven't really discussed that with her.

2026-01-29T13:04:43.979694 [root_agent]: I understand. Let me ask you another important question:

Are you the main person responsible for your daughter - meaning, do you have the main day-to-day responsibility for her care and upbringing, even though she doesn't live with you full-time?

2026-01-29T13:04:45.770133 [actor]: No, I wouldn't say I have the main day-to-day responsibility. Her mother does - she's the one who looks after her on a daily basis since Sarah lives with her.

2026-01-29T13:04:50.257994 [root_agent]: Thank you for being clear about that.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to inform you about your eligibility:

**You are not eligible to claim Child Benefit** in your current situation.

Here's why:

- Child Benefit is typically claimed by the person the child lives with, or the person who has the main responsibility for the child
- Since your daughter lives with her mother and her mother has the main day-to-day responsibility for her care, her mother would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit
- While you do contribute financially by providing groceries and clothes every 4 weeks, this alone doesn't make you the main carer or give you eligibility for Child Benefit when the child lives primarily with someone else

Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child. If her mother isn't already claiming it, she would be the appropriate person to do so as she has your daughter living with her and has the main responsibility for her day-to-day care.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T13:04:57.194522 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, a person who contributes at least the amount of Child Benefit (or the equivalent value of the Child Benefit rate) towards a child's upkeep can claim Child Benefit even when the child lives elsewhere, provided no one else is claiming. The agent failed to verify whether the mother was actually claiming and did not properly assess whether the £120 every 4 weeks contribution meets the threshold for eligibility.
