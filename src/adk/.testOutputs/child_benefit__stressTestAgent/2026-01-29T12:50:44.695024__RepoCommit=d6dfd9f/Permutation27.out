2026-01-29T13:07:30.912082 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I need to ask you some questions.

Let me start with the first one:

**Do you have a child or children under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T13:07:32.704481 [actor]: Yeah, I do. I have a baby girl called Mia.

2026-01-29T13:07:35.180220 [root_agent]: That's lovely! Congratulations on your daughter Mia.

Now, my next question:

**Are you responsible for Mia? This means do you live with her and are you the main person looking after her (providing for her care, making decisions about her upbringing, etc.)?**

2026-01-29T13:07:36.988740 [actor]: Yes, I live with her and I look after her. I mean, I live with my parents too, but Mia is my baby and I take care of her.

2026-01-29T13:07:38.819099 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that you live with Mia and are responsible for her care.

My next question:

**Do you normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T13:07:40.295538 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T13:07:42.833816 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on your right to reside in the UK?**

2026-01-29T13:07:44.451488 [actor]: No, I don't have any restrictions. I was born here.

2026-01-29T13:07:46.629445 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

One more question:

**Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Mia, or is anyone else claiming her in a tax credit or Universal Credit claim?**

2026-01-29T13:07:48.387935 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming for Mia.

2026-01-29T13:07:53.034285 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Mia. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Mia) who is under 16 years old
✓ You are responsible for her - you live with her and look after her
✓ You normally live in the UK
✓ You don't have any immigration restrictions
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Mia

Even though you live with your parents, as long as you are the person primarily responsible for Mia's care, you can claim Child Benefit.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for Mia. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-29T13:07:54.989905 [actor]: Oh that's great, thank you! No, I think that's all I needed to know.

2026-01-29T13:07:59.909903 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I meet all the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit (having a child under 16, being responsible for the child's care, living in the UK, no immigration restrictions, and no one else claiming for the child) and correctly concluded that I am eligible, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."
