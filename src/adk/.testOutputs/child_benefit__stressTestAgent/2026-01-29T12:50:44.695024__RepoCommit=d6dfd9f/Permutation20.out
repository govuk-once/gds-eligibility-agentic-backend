2026-01-29T13:02:12.670460 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T13:02:14.747312 [actor]: Yes, I do. I look after my granddaughter Lucia - she's 14 years old and lives with me.

2026-01-29T13:02:17.228672 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know that you care for your 14-year-old granddaughter Lucia.

Next question: **Are you legally responsible for Lucia, or do her parents still have parental responsibility? In other words, do you have a legal arrangement (such as a special guardianship order, child arrangements order, or are you her appointed guardian)?**

2026-01-29T13:02:19.116024 [actor]: No, there's no legal arrangement or court order. It's just an informal family arrangement - her parents aren't able to care for her, so she lives with me and I pay for everything she needs. They don't contribute financially at all.

2026-01-29T13:02:21.389825 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. It's clear you're providing a lot of care and financial support for Lucia.

Next question: **Do Lucia's parents claim Child Benefit for her, or is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-29T13:02:23.039768 [actor]: No, her parents don't claim Child Benefit for her. Nobody else is claiming it either - it's just me looking after her and paying for everything.

2026-01-29T13:02:25.082373 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. That's helpful to know.

Next question: **Does Lucia live with you full-time, or does she spend time living with her parents or anyone else? If she does spend time elsewhere, roughly how much time does she spend with you versus with them?**

2026-01-29T13:02:27.242108 [actor]: She lives with me full-time. Her parents aren't able to care for her, so she doesn't live with them at all. It's just me and Lucia in my home.

2026-01-29T13:02:29.430964 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Just a couple more questions to help determine your eligibility.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T13:02:31.040783 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T13:02:33.104461 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Next question: **Are you working in the UK, or receiving certain benefits or payments such as State Pension, or are you registered for National Insurance (for example, to protect your State Pension)?**

2026-01-29T13:02:34.845610 [actor]: Yes, I'm 60 years old and I do have National Insurance. I've worked here in the UK.

2026-01-29T13:02:40.591094 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Lucia.** Here's why:

✓ Lucia is 14 years old (under 16)
✓ She lives with you full-time in the UK
✓ You're responsible for her and pay for everything she needs
✓ Nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ You live in the UK and have National Insurance

**Important points to be aware of:**

Since there's no formal legal arrangement (like a court order or special guardianship), Child Benefit rules state that the person with the "main responsibility" for the child can claim. The fact that you:
- Have Lucia living with you full-time
- Pay for everything she needs
- Her parents don't contribute financially

...suggests you have the main responsibility for her.

However, because her parents still have parental responsibility (as there's no legal order transferring this), they could potentially also claim. But since they're not claiming and you're the one actually caring for her, you should be able to claim.

**One final question: If you were to apply, would you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £50,000 per year?** This wouldn't stop you claiming, but it might mean you need to pay a tax charge.

2026-01-29T13:02:42.353652 [actor]: No, I don't have a partner and my income isn't over £50,000 a year.

2026-01-29T13:02:47.143153 [root_agent]: Perfect! Based on all the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your granddaughter Lucia.**

Here's a summary of why you're eligible:

✓ Lucia is 14 (under 16)
✓ She lives with you full-time in the UK
✓ You have the main responsibility for her - you pay for everything she needs
✓ Nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ You live in the UK with National Insurance
✓ Your income is under £50,000, so there's no High Income Child Benefit Charge to worry about

**Next steps:**

You can apply for Child Benefit through the government website or by post. You'll need Lucia's birth certificate (or adoption certificate if applicable) when you apply.

Since you're caring for Lucia in an informal arrangement without a legal order, it's worth noting that if her parents wanted to claim in the future, there could potentially be a dispute about who has the "main responsibility." However, given that she lives with you full-time and you provide all her financial support, you clearly have the main responsibility right now.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T13:02:49.287735 [actor]: No, that's very helpful, thank you! I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll look into applying for it.

2026-01-29T13:02:53.498789 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the grandmother is eligible for Child Benefit based on having main responsibility for her 14-year-old granddaughter who lives with her full-time, with no one else claiming the benefit, and correctly applied the rules regarding informal care arrangements where the person with main day-to-day responsibility can claim even without a formal legal arrangement.
