2026-01-29T13:01:23.203340 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a few questions to assess your eligibility.

**First question: Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T13:01:25.213337 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have a daughter named Holly who is 9 years old. I'm her dad, Pete.

2026-01-29T13:01:27.279184 [root_agent]: Thank you, Pete. It's good to know about Holly.

**Next question: Does Holly normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards her upbringing?**

2026-01-29T13:01:29.530893 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. Holly's mum Sue and I are separated. Holly stays with me 3 days a week and with Sue 4 days a week. I buy her clothes and food when she's with me, and Sue does the same when Holly's with her.

2026-01-29T13:01:33.003056 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that, Pete. That does make the situation a bit more complex.

When a child spends time with both parents, typically only one person can claim Child Benefit. In situations where a child's time is split between parents, the person who has "main responsibility" is usually the one who can claim.

**Next question: Between you and Sue, who would you say has the main day-to-day responsibility for making decisions about Holly - for example, who organizes her healthcare appointments, school matters, or who Holly is registered with at her GP and school?**

2026-01-29T13:01:36.482845 [actor]: To be honest, we both do quite a bit. We both take her to appointments when she's with us, and we both handle school things. Holly is registered at her school with both our addresses. We really share the responsibility - that's why I think I should be able to claim it too. Actually, I've already submitted a claim to HMRC, and I think Sue has as well. We couldn't agree on who should claim, so we both just went ahead and applied.

2026-01-29T13:01:40.571142 [root_agent]: Thank you for being honest about the situation, Pete. I understand it can be frustrating when you're both equally involved in Holly's care.

However, I need to explain an important rule: **only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child**. Even when parents share responsibility equally, Child Benefit cannot be split or paid to both parents.

Since you've both submitted claims to HMRC, they will need to decide who has priority. According to the rules, when both parents claim and the child's time is split fairly equally, HMRC will generally pay Child Benefit to the parent with whom the child spends the most time. In cases where time is very evenly split, they may consider other factors.

**Let me ask: Have you and Sue received any communication from HMRC yet about your claims, or has either of you been awarded Child Benefit for Holly?**

2026-01-29T13:01:43.430344 [actor]: No, we haven't heard back from HMRC yet. We only just submitted the claims recently. So what you're saying is that even though I'm her dad and I look after her three days a week and pay for her things, HMRC might give it to Sue just because Holly stays with her one more day per week? That doesn't seem fair when we both contribute equally to her costs.

2026-01-29T13:01:49.818934 [root_agent]: I understand your frustration, Pete. It's clear you're very involved in Holly's care and contribute significantly to her upbringing.

You're right that the current situation means Sue may have priority because Holly spends slightly more time with her (4 days versus 3 days). However, let me clarify a few important points:

**Even if Sue receives the Child Benefit payment, you could potentially come to an agreement between yourselves about sharing it or how it's used for Holly's benefit.** The payment going to one person doesn't diminish your role as Holly's father or your contributions to her care.

Also, if your circumstances change in the future - for example, if the time Holly spends with each of you changes significantly - the eligibility can be reassessed.

**My question: Aside from the shared care arrangement we've discussed, are you currently living in the UK, and is Holly living in the UK as well?**

(I need to check this to fully assess your eligibility, as residency is another requirement for Child Benefit.)

2026-01-29T13:01:52.596151 [actor]: Yes, we're both living in the UK. Holly and I are both here. 

Look, I understand what you're saying, but I just want to know - am I actually eligible to claim it or not? Because I've already submitted my claim. Will HMRC just reject mine automatically because Sue applied too?

2026-01-29T13:01:57.374106 [root_agent]: That's a good question, Pete. Let me be clear about your eligibility:

**Yes, you are eligible to claim Child Benefit.** You meet the basic criteria:
- You're responsible for a child under 16 (Holly, age 9)
- You live in the UK
- Holly lives in the UK
- You contribute to Holly's upbringing

**However, being eligible doesn't automatically mean you'll receive the payment**, because of the rule that only one person can be paid for the same child.

HMRC won't automatically reject your claim just because Sue also applied. Instead, they will assess both claims and decide who has priority based on who has the main responsibility for Holly. Given that Holly spends 4 days with Sue and 3 days with you, HMRC will likely award it to Sue - but they will make the final decision.

**One more question to complete the assessment: Is your individual income over £50,000 per year?**

(This doesn't affect whether you *can* claim, but it may affect whether there's a tax charge if you do receive it.)

2026-01-29T13:01:59.535328 [actor]: No, my income is under £50,000.

So just to be clear - you're saying I am eligible, but HMRC will probably give it to Sue instead because Holly spends one more day with her? And there's nothing I can do about that?

2026-01-29T13:02:04.415485 [root_agent]: Yes, Pete, that's essentially correct based on the information you've shared:

- **You are eligible** to claim Child Benefit based on the criteria
- **HMRC will likely award it to Sue** because Holly spends slightly more time with her (4 days vs 3 days), which suggests she has the main day-to-day responsibility
- **Only one of you can receive the payment** for Holly

As for what you can do:

1. **Wait for HMRC's decision** - They will review both claims and notify both of you about their decision

2. **Discuss with Sue** - Even if Sue receives the payment, you could agree between yourselves how to use it for Holly's benefit, since you both contribute to her care

3. **If circumstances change** - If the care arrangement changes significantly in the future (for example, if Holly starts spending equal or more time with you), you could notify HMRC and they would reassess

I know this might not be the answer you were hoping for, but you've done the right thing by applying. HMRC will make the final determination and contact both of you with their decision.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T13:02:06.460822 [actor]: No, I think I understand now. Thanks for explaining it to me. I guess I'll just have to wait and see what HMRC decides.

2026-01-29T13:02:10.352866 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Pete is eligible to claim Child Benefit based on meeting the basic criteria (responsible for a child under 16, UK residency, contributes to upbringing), but correctly advised that HMRC would likely award the benefit to Sue since Holly spends more time with her (4 days vs 3 days), as only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child.
