2026-01-29T12:58:05.808307 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child (or children) who is either:
- Under 16 years old, OR
- Under 20 years old and in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T12:58:08.076075 [actor]: Yes, we have a child living with us. Her name is Maya and she's 4 years old. We've been approved as adopters and she was placed with us by the adoption agency. She's been living in our home now, though we're still waiting for the final adoption order from the court.

2026-01-29T12:58:10.468835 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's great that Maya is living with you and that you're going through the adoption process.

Now I need to ask: Are you (or your partner if you have one) responsible for Maya? By this I mean, do you pay for things like her food, clothes, and other needs?

2026-01-29T12:58:12.739552 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. My partner Zara and I are both responsible for Maya. We pay for everything she needs - her food, clothes, and all her other expenses. She lives with us full-time and we take care of all her needs.

2026-01-29T12:58:14.820455 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Next question: Are you or your partner Zara currently living in the UK?

2026-01-29T12:58:16.395134 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. Maya lives here with us as well.

2026-01-29T12:58:18.236307 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you.

Now, one more important question: Is Maya also living in the UK with you, or does she spend time living abroad?

2026-01-29T12:58:19.794770 [actor]: Yes, Maya lives here in the UK with us. She doesn't spend any time living abroad - she's with us in our home here.

2026-01-29T12:58:24.546928 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming all of that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you should be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ Maya is under 16 years old (she's 4)
✓ You and Zara are responsible for her - you pay for her food, clothes, and other needs
✓ Maya lives with you in the UK
✓ You both live in the UK
✓ Maya has been placed with you by an adoption agency as approved adopters

The key point here is that you don't need to wait for the final adoption order to claim Child Benefit. As approved adopters with Maya placed in your care by the adoption agency, you are responsible for her and she's living with you, which means you meet the eligibility criteria.

You can go ahead and make a claim for Child Benefit. Only one of you (either you or Zara) can claim it, so you'll need to decide between you who will be the claimant.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the claiming process?

2026-01-29T12:58:27.336420 [actor]: Oh that's wonderful news! Thank you so much for clarifying that. We weren't sure if we needed to wait for the final adoption order to come through before we could claim. It's really helpful to know we can claim now.

I think we have all the information we need for now. We'll discuss between us who should make the claim and get the process started. Thanks again for your help!

2026-01-29T12:58:31.357251 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the couple is eligible for Child Benefit as approved adopters with a child placed in their care by an adoption agency, correctly noting that they do not need to wait for the final adoption order, and verified all necessary criteria including the child's age, residency, and that they are responsible for the child's care.
