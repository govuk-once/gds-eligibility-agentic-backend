2026-01-29T13:10:02.542104 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16 who lives with you, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T13:10:04.305152 [actor]: Yes, I have a 16-year-old daughter, Bella, who lives with me. She's just started a training course to become a travel agent.

2026-01-29T13:10:06.777965 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know that Bella is 16 and in training, which means she could potentially qualify.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for Bella? By this, I mean do you look after her day-to-day needs and pay towards the costs of raising her (such as food, clothes, and housing)?**

2026-01-29T13:10:08.700176 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Bella lives with me and I'm fully responsible for her. I pay for all her day-to-day needs - her food, clothes, housing, everything she needs.

2026-01-29T13:10:10.655646 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's an important part of the eligibility criteria.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T13:10:12.124014 [actor]: Yes, I am living in the UK.

2026-01-29T13:10:14.257703 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question:

**Does anyone else also claim Child Benefit for Bella, such as her other parent or another person she might live with part of the time?**

2026-01-29T13:10:16.045629 [actor]: No, no one else claims Child Benefit for Bella. She lives with me full-time and I'm the only one who would be claiming.

2026-01-29T13:10:19.622789 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

I have one more important question:

**Is Bella's training course an approved education or training programme? This would typically include things like:
- A-levels or similar qualifications
- Scottish Highers
- NVQs up to level 3
- Home education (if it started before she turned 16)
- Certain training courses with an approved provider that include education or training for at least 12 hours a week**

Do you know if her travel agent training course fits into any of these categories?

2026-01-29T13:10:22.364435 [actor]: Well, it's a training course that the travel agency she works for is paying for. They employed her and are fully funding the training themselves - it's not a government apprenticeship or anything like that. I'm not entirely sure if that counts as approved training or not.

2026-01-29T13:10:24.729960 [root_agent]: Thank you for that detail. That's an important distinction to understand.

Let me ask a follow-up question to help clarify:

**Does Bella's training course include at least 12 hours per week of actual education or training (not just work experience)? And do you know if it leads to a recognized qualification, such as an NVQ or other accredited certificate?**

2026-01-29T13:10:27.131351 [actor]: I'm not completely certain about all the details, but I know it's a proper training course - not just work experience. She is learning how to be a travel agent. I believe it does lead to some kind of qualification, though I'm not sure exactly what level it is. The travel agency set it all up for her.

2026-01-29T13:10:30.038942 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me ask one more specific question about the training:

**Is the training course through an approved training provider or organization? For example, is it provided through a college, a registered training organization, or as part of a formal apprenticeship scheme - even if it's employer-funded rather than government-funded?**

This will help determine if it meets the "approved education or training" requirement for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-29T13:10:32.647962 [actor]: I don't think it's through a college or a formal apprenticeship scheme. The travel agency itself is providing and paying for the training - they're the ones who've set it all up and are funding it directly. It's more of an employer-funded training program they've organized for her.

2026-01-29T13:10:35.162893 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is helpful information.

Let me ask you this:

**How many hours per week does Bella spend in supervised training or education (not including time she's just working in the travel agency)? And does she receive a wage or salary from the travel agency while doing this training?**

This will help determine whether the training meets the specific requirements for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-29T13:10:38.122732 [actor]: She does receive a wage from the travel agency - they employed her, so yes, she's being paid by them. As for the exact hours of supervised training versus working, I'm not entirely sure of the breakdown. It's all part of her role with them - the training and the work are quite integrated.

2026-01-29T13:10:41.917738 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is helpful.

Based on what you've told me, let me clarify an important point about the training requirement:

**If Bella is employed and earning a wage, the training would generally need to be "non-advanced education" of at least 12 hours per week to qualify for Child Benefit purposes. However, if she's primarily in paid employment with some training on the side, this may not meet the Child Benefit criteria.**

To help determine this more accurately, let me ask:

**Would you say Bella is primarily a student/trainee who happens to also work, or is she primarily an employee who receives some training as part of her job?**

2026-01-29T13:10:44.158968 [actor]: I'd say she's primarily an employee who's receiving training as part of her job. The travel agency employed her and the training is part of that employment - it's how they're training her up to do the work properly.

2026-01-29T13:10:49.876261 [root_agent]: Thank you for being so clear about that. This is an important distinction.

Based on what you've told me, I need to give you some guidance about your eligibility:

**Unfortunately, it appears you may not be eligible for Child Benefit for Bella in this situation.**

Here's why: Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds requires the young person to be in **approved education or training**. This typically means:
- Full-time non-advanced education (like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3)
- Approved training programs of at least 12 hours per week

When a young person is primarily an employee receiving on-the-job training as part of their employment, this usually doesn't qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes - even if the training is valuable and leads to qualifications.

However, I'd recommend you check directly with HMRC or the Child Benefit Office, as they can assess the specific details of Bella's training course and confirm whether it meets their criteria. Sometimes employer training programs can qualify if they meet certain conditions.

**Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit eligibility, or would you like to know how to contact HMRC to discuss Bella's specific situation?**

2026-01-29T13:10:55.101576 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent appropriately concluded I was not eligible for Child Benefit because my 16-year-old daughter is primarily an employee receiving on-the-job training rather than being in approved education or training, which is required for Child Benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds.
