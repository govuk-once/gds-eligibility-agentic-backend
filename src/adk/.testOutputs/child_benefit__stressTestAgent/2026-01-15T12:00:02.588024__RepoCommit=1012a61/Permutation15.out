2026-01-15T12:04:07.530745 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:04:08.297757 [root_agent]: Hello! I can help you with that. To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:04:09.027053 [actor]: 45 years old

2026-01-15T12:04:09.692946 [root_agent]: Thank you! And does the child you’re interested in claiming Child Benefit for live with you?

2026-01-15T12:04:10.521727 [actor]: daughter living with ex

2026-01-15T12:04:11.365991 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. To clarify, your daughter lives with her mother. Do you contribute financially to the upkeep of your daughter?

2026-01-15T12:04:12.226264 [actor]: send 10 pounds weekly food money birthday present

2026-01-15T12:04:14.611911 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to be clear, you send £10 per week to your daughter’s mother for food, and you also send a birthday present each year. 

According to the rules, to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with you, you need to be contributing at least the same amount as the current Child Benefit rate – which is £26.05 per week. 

Do you contribute anything *else* towards your daughter’s upbringing, beyond the £10 per week and the birthday present?

2026-01-15T12:04:15.303573 [actor]: no only ten pounds weekly

2026-01-15T12:04:17.319023 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided, and according to the current rules, you wouldn’t currently meet the requirements to claim Child Benefit for your daughter. This is because the amount you contribute weekly (£10) is less than the current full rate of Child Benefit (£26.05 per week). 

Would you like me to explain this in a bit more detail, or perhaps discuss other potential options?

2026-01-15T12:04:20.796710 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Mike is not eligible because his weekly contribution (£10) is below the required amount (£26.05) to claim Child Benefit for a child not living with him.
