2026-01-15T12:01:04.814127 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:01:05.569482 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you work that out. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:01:06.472648 [actor]: 42

2026-01-15T12:01:06.994111 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is the child you are asking about?

2026-01-15T12:01:07.928386 [actor]: daughter sofia 18

2026-01-15T12:01:08.832835 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Is Sofia currently in approved full-time education, or undergoing approved training? This could be things like A-levels, university, or an apprenticeship.

2026-01-15T12:01:09.596760 [actor]: working receptionist

2026-01-15T12:01:10.280427 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. And approximately how many hours a week does Sofia work as a receptionist?

2026-01-15T12:01:10.994780 [actor]: 30 hours

2026-01-15T12:01:13.573598 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me – that you are 42, your daughter Sofia is 18, and she works 30 hours a week as a receptionist – it appears you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit. 

Child Benefit generally stops when a child turns 16, or if they are 16 or 17 and not in approved education or training. Working 30 hours a week means Sofia is not considered to be in approved education or training.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





2026-01-15T12:01:14.729029 [actor]: not eligible then

2026-01-15T12:01:16.960837 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the applicant is not eligible for Child Benefit since Sofia is 18, not in approved education or training, and working 30 hours per week.
