2026-01-15T12:04:22.630425 [actor]: I'll help by role-playing a UK resident in this specific situation to test another agent. I'll follow all the rules provided, including being obtuse, not answering direct questions clearly, and speaking in search-term style.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:04:23.589541 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?





2026-01-15T12:04:24.312456 [actor]: son 14 years

2026-01-15T12:04:24.840853 [root_agent]: Thank you. And is your son currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:04:25.663688 [actor]: Oliver hospital america treatment

2026-01-15T12:04:26.576062 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. So your son is receiving treatment in a hospital in America. 

Has your son been in hospital for more than 12 weeks?

2026-01-15T12:04:27.491233 [actor]: 15 weeks already specialist care rare condition

2026-01-15T12:04:28.196996 [root_agent]: Thank you. And was the main reason your son went to America specifically to receive hospital treatment?

2026-01-15T12:04:29.097208 [actor]: sent there special hospital treatment UK no have

2026-01-15T12:04:30.025866 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. And just to be clear, while your son is receiving treatment abroad, are *you* still financially supporting him – paying for things he needs?

2026-01-15T12:04:30.774877 [actor]: pay visits when possible incidental costs yes

2026-01-15T12:04:32.491944 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you *are* likely to continue being eligible for Child Benefit. 

The rules state that if a child is in hospital abroad specifically for treatment, and the parent is still financially supporting them, eligibility can continue.

However, to be absolutely certain, I should confirm – are you a UK resident?

2026-01-15T12:04:33.252487 [actor]: UK resident yes

2026-01-15T12:04:34.841508 [root_agent]: Excellent. Based on everything you've told me – your son is 14, he's in hospital in America for specialist treatment that isn't available in the UK, you are financially supporting him, and you are a UK resident – you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





2026-01-15T12:04:38.479350 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Hannah remains eligible for Child Benefit because Oliver went abroad specifically for hospital treatment and Hannah continues to financially support him, which matches the international exception rule.
