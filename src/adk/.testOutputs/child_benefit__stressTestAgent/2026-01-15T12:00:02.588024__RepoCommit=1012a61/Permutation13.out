2026-01-15T12:03:36.690244 [actor]: I'll help by assuming the role you described. I'll act as Ali or Zara who are prospective adopters with Maya placed in their home but without the final adoption order yet.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:03:37.611667 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you’re eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please confirm how old you are?





2026-01-15T12:03:38.343699 [actor]: 35

2026-01-15T12:03:39.028220 [root_agent]: Thank you. And could you please tell me, is the child living with you full-time?

2026-01-15T12:03:39.929164 [actor]: yes maya lives with us

2026-01-15T12:03:41.100028 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know. 

Now, is Maya your biological child, or are you her legal guardian, or are you caring for her under other arrangements – for example, as a prospective adopter?





2026-01-15T12:03:41.900707 [actor]: prospective adopter

2026-01-15T12:03:42.591948 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. And to confirm, have you been formally approved as an adopter by an adoption agency?

2026-01-15T12:03:43.587762 [actor]: approved agency placed child with us

2026-01-15T12:03:44.074626 [root_agent]: Great. Finally, has the final adoption order been granted by the court yet?

2026-01-15T12:03:44.799535 [actor]: not yet

2026-01-15T12:03:47.149130 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for providing all of that information.

Based on what you’ve told me – you are 35, Maya lives with you full-time, you are approved adopters with the child placed with you by an agency, but the final adoption order hasn’t been granted – you *are* eligible to claim Child Benefit. 

You can claim as soon as any child you’re adopting comes to live with you, and you don't have to wait for the final adoption order.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T12:03:50.273950 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that as approved adopters with Maya living with them, they can claim Child Benefit even before the final adoption order is granted.
