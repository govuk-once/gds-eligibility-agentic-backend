2026-01-15T12:05:10.731032 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:05:11.659047 [root_agent]: Hello! I can help you assess whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?


2026-01-15T12:05:12.689110 [actor]: child 9 years old

2026-01-15T12:05:13.534821 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Now, could you please tell me, on average, how many nights a week does your child live with you?

2026-01-15T12:05:14.357818 [actor]: 3 nights pete 4 nights sue

2026-01-15T12:05:15.134106 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. 

Just to clarify, are you Pete or Sue? Knowing this will help me understand the situation better.

2026-01-15T12:05:15.846819 [actor]: Pete

2026-01-15T12:05:16.582816 [root_agent]: Thank you, Pete.

Now, are you and the child’s mother separated? Or divorced? Or are you both living together?

2026-01-15T12:05:17.335012 [actor]: separated sue mother

2026-01-15T12:05:18.291238 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are separated from Sue, who is the child’s mother.

Do you contribute towards the costs of bringing up your daughter, such as buying clothes or food?

2026-01-15T12:05:19.031597 [actor]: buy clothes food 9 year old

2026-01-15T12:05:20.724681 [root_agent]: Thanks, Pete. It sounds like you are actively involved in supporting your daughter.

Given that you and Sue are separated and both contribute to your daughter’s care, and she spends more nights with Sue, HMRC will likely award Child Benefit to Sue, as she is the person your daughter lives with the most. However, are you currently claiming Child Benefit for her yourself?

2026-01-15T12:05:21.506820 [actor]: both claim

2026-01-15T12:05:23.470070 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know that both you and Sue have submitted claims to HMRC.

As only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child, HMRC will need to decide who should receive it. Because your daughter lives with Sue for more nights of the week, HMRC is likely to award the benefit to her. 

Do you understand that HMRC will make the final decision? Or would you like me to explain the process further?

2026-01-15T12:05:27.532011 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that HMRC will likely award Child Benefit to Sue since the child stays with her more nights (4 vs 3), which aligns with HMRC's priority rules when both parents submit claims.
