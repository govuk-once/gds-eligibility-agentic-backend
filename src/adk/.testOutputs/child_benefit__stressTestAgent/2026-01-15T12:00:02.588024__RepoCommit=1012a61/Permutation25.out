2026-01-15T12:07:09.603708 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:07:10.715116 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:07:11.656200 [actor]: 30 years old woman with child

2026-01-15T12:07:12.203876 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is your child?

2026-01-15T12:07:13.133063 [actor]: Leo 5 years old in care

2026-01-15T12:07:14.439346 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. I understand your child, Leo, is 5 years old and currently in care. 

To help me understand your situation better, for how long has Leo been in local authority care? Please give me an answer in weeks.





2026-01-15T12:07:15.174731 [actor]: 10 weeks local authority

2026-01-15T12:07:16.336803 [root_agent]: Thank you. That’s helpful to know.

Now, regarding financial contributions, do *you* personally contribute financially towards Leo’s upkeep while he is in care? Even a small amount counts.

2026-01-15T12:07:17.261889 [actor]: no income cant pay

2026-01-15T12:07:18.677216 [root_agent]: Thank you for being honest. I understand you currently have no income and are unable to contribute financially towards Leo’s upkeep.

Is there anyone else who contributes financially towards Leo’s upkeep – for example, a partner, or another family member? If so, do they contribute at least £20 per week?

2026-01-15T12:07:19.558515 [actor]: husband pays 30 pounds weekly to carer

2026-01-15T12:07:20.425759 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, you and your husband are married or in a civil partnership and you both live at the same address?

2026-01-15T12:07:21.420623 [actor]: yes married same house

2026-01-15T12:07:24.708511 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. 

Based on the information you’ve provided, it sounds like you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. Here’s why:

*   Leo is under 20.
*   He has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks.
*   Although you don't have an income, your husband is contributing £30 a week towards Leo’s upkeep, and as you are married and live together, his contribution counts as your contribution. This meets the requirement for financial contribution.



However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. To be absolutely certain, I recommend checking the official government website or contacting HMRC directly. Would you like me to summarise the relevant information from the guidance for you?

2026-01-15T12:07:29.065031 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent recognized that while the child has been in care for over 8 weeks, the husband's financial contribution of £30/week counts toward Beatrice's eligibility since they are married and live together.
