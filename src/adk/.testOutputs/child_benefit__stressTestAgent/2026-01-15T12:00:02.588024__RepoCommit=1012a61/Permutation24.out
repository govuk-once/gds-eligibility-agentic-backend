2026-01-15T12:06:54.883192 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:06:56.083215 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand. I will ask you questions one at a time to assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, based on the UK government rules. 

First, could you please tell me the age of the child you are claiming for?


2026-01-15T12:06:56.844679 [actor]: son 14 years old

2026-01-15T12:06:57.335840 [root_agent]: Thank you. And is your son currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:06:58.156648 [actor]: residential school

2026-01-15T12:06:58.912926 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Is this residential school paid for by the local council?

2026-01-15T12:06:59.721506 [actor]: council pays yes

2026-01-15T12:07:00.509504 [root_agent]: Thank you. And approximately how long has your son been at the residential school? Just an estimate in weeks is fine.





2026-01-15T12:07:01.295169 [actor]: 10 weeks now

2026-01-15T12:07:02.074049 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, is this a residential school specifically because of special educational needs or behavioural needs?

2026-01-15T12:07:02.860572 [actor]: behaviour needs severe

2026-01-15T12:07:05.632636 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you've provided – your son is 14, lives in residential accommodation paid for by the local council due to severe behavioural needs, and has been there for 10 weeks – it appears you *are* currently eligible for Child Benefit. 

Children in residential accommodation, rather than being 'in care', can continue to be claimed for Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks. As your son has been there for 10 weeks, you are still within that timeframe.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit or any other related questions?





2026-01-15T12:07:08.946171 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that for children in residential accommodation (not in care), Child Benefit eligibility continues for up to 12 weeks, and since the child has only been there for 10 weeks, the parent remains eligible.
