2026-01-15T12:02:41.294833 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:02:42.266955 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?


2026-01-15T12:02:43.028227 [actor]: child 5 years old

2026-01-15T12:02:43.701964 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's good to know. 

Are you responsible for the care of this child?

2026-01-15T12:02:44.578326 [actor]: yes taking care of my son

2026-01-15T12:02:45.472332 [root_agent]: Okay, great. And just so I understand your situation fully, what is your current employment status? Are you currently working, or are you currently not working?

2026-01-15T12:02:46.251323 [actor]: unemployed looking for work job seeker

2026-01-15T12:02:47.196935 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know.

You mentioned you are looking for work and a jobseeker. Do you have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme?





2026-01-15T12:02:48.362812 [actor]: German citizen pre settled status registered jobseeker

2026-01-15T12:02:50.313371 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided – that you are a registered jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status, responsible for a 5-year-old child – you *likely* meet the criteria for Child Benefit. 

However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm if you have comprehensive sickness insurance, or sufficient resources to not require claiming benefits? This is a factor in eligibility with Pre-Settled Status.





2026-01-15T12:02:51.177292 [actor]: job seeker allowance looking for work genuine prospect

2026-01-15T12:02:54.123294 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Receiving Jobseeker Allowance and actively looking for work with a genuine prospect of finding employment supports your right to reside.

Based on everything you’ve told me – being a German citizen with Pre-Settled Status, actively seeking work and receiving Jobseeker Allowance, and being responsible for a 5-year-old child – you *do* appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. To be absolutely certain, and to make a claim, I recommend visiting the government website: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T12:02:57.878219 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that a person with Pre-Settled Status who is a registered jobseeker with genuine prospects of work has a qualifying right to reside for Child Benefit purposes when responsible for a child of eligible age.
