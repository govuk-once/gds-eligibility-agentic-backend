2026-01-15T12:01:17.793491 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:01:18.850369 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are interested in claiming for?


2026-01-15T12:01:19.650284 [actor]: son 10 years old

2026-01-15T12:01:20.185292 [root_agent]: Thank you. And is the child currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:01:21.265173 [actor]: lives with mother. I pay money for him

2026-01-15T12:01:22.509140 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. To clarify, you don’t live with your son, but you financially support him. Roughly how much do you contribute each month towards your son’s expenses? Just an approximate amount is fine.

2026-01-15T12:01:23.333271 [actor]: 150 pounds monthly for food and clothes

2026-01-15T12:01:24.017162 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to be clear, is anyone *currently* claiming Child Benefit for your son?

2026-01-15T12:01:24.897810 [actor]: ex-wife not claim benefit

2026-01-15T12:01:25.609145 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. Just one final question for now: Are you currently resident in the UK?

2026-01-15T12:01:26.449382 [actor]: yes UK

2026-01-15T12:01:30.050275 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering my questions. Based on the information you've provided – your son is 10 years old, he lives with his mother, you contribute £150 per month towards his expenses, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for him, and you are resident in the UK – it appears you *may* be eligible to claim Child Benefit.

Because your son doesn’t live with you, eligibility depends on the level of financial contribution you make. Since £150 per month exceeds the current amount of Child Benefit, this meets the criteria.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. I recommend you review the information on the UK government website to confirm your eligibility and understand the application process fully. Would you like me to summarise the key points from the government website about claiming when the child doesn’t live with you?

2026-01-15T12:01:31.080387 [actor]: so can i get the money

2026-01-15T12:01:33.805553 [root_agent]: Based on the information you’ve given me, it *appears* you can apply for Child Benefit. You are contributing financially to your son's upkeep at a rate higher than the Child Benefit amount, and no one else is currently claiming for him. 

However, HMRC (the people who handle Child Benefit claims) will make the final decision based on all the details of your situation. Applying doesn't guarantee you'll receive it, but based on what you’ve told me, you meet the initial criteria.

Would you like me to explain a bit more about how to apply, or perhaps summarise the key eligibility points again?

2026-01-15T12:01:37.747331 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately stated that Mark appears eligible for Child Benefit because he contributes more than the Child Benefit amount (£150 > £113/month), his son is of eligible age, and no one else is claiming.
