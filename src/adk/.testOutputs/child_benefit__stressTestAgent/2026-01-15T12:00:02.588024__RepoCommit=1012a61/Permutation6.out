2026-01-15T12:01:38.475390 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:01:39.455973 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, are you responsible for the care of the child?

2026-01-15T12:01:40.301108 [actor]: child in my care daughter

2026-01-15T12:01:40.794268 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. And how old is your daughter?

2026-01-15T12:01:41.594571 [actor]: daughter 6 years old

2026-01-15T12:01:42.161263 [root_agent]: Okay, great. To assess your eligibility further, is your daughter currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:01:43.083769 [actor]: daughter hospital 14 weeks visit daily

2026-01-15T12:01:43.973270 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. So your daughter is currently in hospital. Has she been in hospital continuously for more than 12 weeks?

2026-01-15T12:01:44.834334 [actor]: yes 14 weeks hospital now

2026-01-15T12:01:45.664029 [root_agent]: Thank you. And while your daughter is in hospital, are you regularly spending money on things for her, such as clothes, food, or other items she needs?

2026-01-15T12:01:46.511180 [actor]: buy books pyjamas food £30 weekly

2026-01-15T12:01:48.877526 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, and the rules around Child Benefit, it appears you *are* likely to continue being eligible for Child Benefit, even though your daughter has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks. This is because you are regularly contributing to her upkeep while she's in hospital.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. Would you like me to summarise the key points relating to hospital stays and Child Benefit, as stated on the government website?

2026-01-15T12:01:50.118758 [actor]: thank you yes eligible

2026-01-15T12:01:52.720277 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly noted that Child Benefit can continue beyond 12 weeks of hospitalization when the parent regularly contributes to the child's upkeep, which Mary does by spending £30 weekly.
