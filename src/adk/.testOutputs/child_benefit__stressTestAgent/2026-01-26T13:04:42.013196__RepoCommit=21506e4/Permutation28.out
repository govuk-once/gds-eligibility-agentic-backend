2026-01-26T13:16:51.677083 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine whether you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

To start, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T13:16:52.645405 [actor]: Yes, I have a son who is 5 years old. He's here with me in the UK.

2026-01-26T13:16:53.842291 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I'll continue with some more questions to determine your eligibility.

Is your son living with you? By this I mean, do you have the main responsibility for your son's care?

2026-01-26T13:16:55.198278 [actor]: Yes, my son is living with me. I am his mother and have full responsibility for his care. We're staying together during our visit to the UK.

2026-01-26T13:16:56.575227 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to understand your residential status to determine eligibility.

Are you and your son normally living in the UK? By this I mean, is the UK your main home and not just a temporary visit?

2026-01-26T13:16:57.763867 [actor]: No, the UK is not our main home. We're from the United States and are just visiting the UK on a tourist visa for a few months. We're planning to return to the US after our visit is over.

2026-01-26T13:17:00.282220 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. 

Based on the information you've provided, you would not be eligible for UK Child Benefit. This is because Child Benefit eligibility requires that you normally live in the UK. Since you and your son are visiting the UK temporarily on tourist visas and your main home is in the United States, you don't meet this residency requirement.

Child Benefit is designed for those who have their main home in the UK and have responsibility for a child who also normally lives in the UK.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about UK benefits or services during your stay?

2026-01-26T13:17:02.817440 [actor]: That makes sense. I didn't think I would be eligible since we're just visiting, but I wanted to check just in case. We'll be here for about 5 months total on our tourist visa. Are there any other services or support available for visitors with children during our stay? Or is everything generally limited to residents?

2026-01-26T13:17:04.803295 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit requires normal UK residency, which the tourist visitor from the US doesn't meet.
