2026-01-27T18:48:04.713288 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The expected outcome should be "Eligible" but the agent incorrectly determined that the father is not eligible for Child Benefit when he should be eligible based on his sufficient financial contributions of £120 every 4 weeks (£30/week), which exceeds the minimum threshold of £26.05.
