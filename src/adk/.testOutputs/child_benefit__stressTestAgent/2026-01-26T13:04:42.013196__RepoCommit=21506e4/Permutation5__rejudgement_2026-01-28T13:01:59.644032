2026-01-28T13:06:23.440855 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that Mark is not eligible for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome was "Eligible." According to UK rules, while Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with, a non-resident parent who contributes financially to the child's upkeep with an amount exceeding the Child Benefit rate can be eligible when the resident parent is not claiming.
