2026-01-26T13:15:09.652132 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:15:10.585554 [actor]: Yes, I have a 5-year-old son named Leo.

2026-01-26T13:15:11.900670 [root_agent]: I'll continue helping you determine your eligibility for Child Benefit.

Thank you for letting me know about your 5-year-old son, Leo. 

Next question: Does Leo normally live with you?

2026-01-26T13:15:13.484390 [actor]: Well, Leo has been in local authority care for the past 10 weeks. I don't have any income myself to contribute to his upkeep, but my husband (Leo's stepfather) who lives with me does send £30 per week to the carers for Leo's needs.

2026-01-26T13:15:14.993600 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that Leo has been in local authority care for 10 weeks, and your husband contributes £30 per week for Leo's needs.

Next question: Before Leo went into local authority care, was he living with you?

2026-01-26T13:15:16.012824 [actor]: Yes, Leo was living with me before he went into local authority care. He's been with us since birth until he went into care 10 weeks ago.

2026-01-26T13:15:17.223782 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Is Leo expected to return to live with you, and if so, do you know approximately when?

2026-01-26T13:15:18.921690 [actor]: I'm not completely sure when exactly he'll return home. The social workers are still assessing our situation, but we're hoping it will be within the next few months. We're working with the local authority on a plan for his return.

2026-01-26T13:15:20.417992 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about Leo's situation.

Next question: Are you or your husband receiving any other benefits or support for Leo while he's in local authority care?

2026-01-26T13:15:21.716865 [actor]: No, we're not receiving any other benefits or support for Leo while he's in care. The only financial contribution we make is the £30 per week that my husband sends to help with Leo's expenses.

2026-01-26T13:15:22.715646 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: Is anyone else (apart from the local authority) claiming Child Benefit for Leo at the moment?

2026-01-26T13:15:24.455853 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Leo. I was receiving Child Benefit before he went into care, but I wasn't sure if I should still be claiming it now that he's in local authority care.

2026-01-26T13:15:29.528250 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on the details you've provided, here's my assessment of your Child Benefit eligibility:

Since Leo has been in local authority care for 10 weeks (which is less than 8 weeks), you can generally continue to receive Child Benefit. However, there are some specific rules for children in care:

- You can usually get Child Benefit for the first 8 weeks your child is looked after by a local authority
- This can be extended to 12 weeks in some circumstances, such as if you're regularly spending money on your child while they're in care (which you are, through your husband's £30 weekly contribution)
- Since you're working toward Leo returning home, and making regular financial contributions to his care, you may continue to be eligible

I would recommend that you:
1. Contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them of Leo's current situation
2. Explain the regular financial contributions you're making
3. Ask about your continued eligibility based on your specific circumstances and the plan for Leo to return home

Would you like me to provide more specific information about contacting the Child Benefit Office?

2026-01-26T13:15:32.334092 [actor]: I think there might be some confusion. Leo has been in local authority care for 10 weeks, which is actually more than 8 weeks, not less. But you mentioned that this can be extended to 12 weeks if we're regularly spending money on him while in care, which we are through my husband's weekly contributions. Since we're working toward Leo returning home and making these regular payments, it sounds like I may still be eligible. 

Yes, I'd appreciate the information about contacting the Child Benefit Office so I can explain our situation.

2026-01-26T13:15:36.481452 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the error in my previous response. Thank you for the correction. Leo has indeed been in care for 10 weeks, which is more than 8 weeks but less than 12 weeks.

Since you're regularly contributing financially to Leo's care (through your husband's £30 weekly payments) and you're working toward him returning home, you may still be eligible under the extended 12-week rule.

To contact the Child Benefit Office:

Phone: 0300 200 3100
Monday to Friday: 8am to 6pm
Closed on weekends and bank holidays

When you call, have your National Insurance number and Child Benefit number ready (if you have one). Explain Leo's situation, including:
- The length of time he's been in care (10 weeks)
- Your regular financial contributions
- That you're working with the local authority on a plan for his return

They can provide guidance specific to your circumstances and let you know if you need to complete any forms or provide any additional information.

2026-01-26T13:15:39.298859 [actor]: Thank you for the correction and for providing the contact information for the Child Benefit Office. I'll call them at the number you provided (0300 200 3100) and make sure to have my National Insurance number and Child Benefit number ready. I'll explain Leo's situation, including the 10 weeks he's been in care, our regular £30 weekly contributions, and that we're working with the local authority on his return plan. 

Just to be clear - am I still eligible for Child Benefit at this point since we're within the 12-week extension period and making regular contributions?

2026-01-26T13:15:42.386792 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that the person may still be eligible for Child Benefit as their child has been in care for 10 weeks, which is less than the 12-week extended period that applies when regular financial contributions are being made.
