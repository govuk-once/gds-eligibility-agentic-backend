2026-01-26T13:15:43.719510 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T13:15:45.368903 [actor]: Hello there! I'm wondering if I can get Child Benefit for my situation. My son Zahid is 15 years old, but he actually doesn't live with me. He lives with his aunt.

2026-01-26T13:15:47.171082 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about your situation with Zahid. 

Since your son lives with his aunt rather than with you, this affects your Child Benefit eligibility. Generally, Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with.

Could you tell me if you contribute financially to your son Zahid's upbringing, such as providing money for food or clothing?

2026-01-26T13:15:48.559500 [actor]: Yes, I do contribute financially. I send £15 a week to his aunt to help with his upkeep. My mother (Zahid's grandmother) also sends £15 per week to help with his expenses.

2026-01-26T13:15:50.349972 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know that you contribute financially to Zahid's upbringing.

In the case where a child lives with someone else but you contribute to their upbringing costs, the eligibility for Child Benefit can be more complex. 

Do you know if Zahid's aunt is currently claiming Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-26T13:15:51.315129 [actor]: No, Zahid's aunt isn't claiming Child Benefit for him at all.

2026-01-26T13:15:53.220366 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Zahid's aunt isn't claiming Child Benefit for him.

Since you contribute financially to Zahid's upbringing, but he lives with his aunt, there are specific considerations. 

Could you tell me if there's any formal arrangement regarding Zahid living with his aunt? For example, is there a court order, or is this an informal family arrangement?

2026-01-26T13:15:54.693948 [actor]: It's just an informal family arrangement. There's no court order or anything formal like that. We just decided as a family that it would be best for Zahid to live with his aunt, but I still want to support him financially as his father.

2026-01-26T13:15:56.686906 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that it's an informal family arrangement. That helps me understand your situation better.

In cases of informal family arrangements, Child Benefit can sometimes be paid to a parent who doesn't live with the child if they contribute substantially to the child's maintenance.

Since you contribute financially to Zahid's upkeep, could you tell me if you're in regular contact with him? For example, do you visit him or does he visit you?

2026-01-26T13:15:58.370192 [actor]: Yes, I see Zahid regularly. He comes to stay with me one weekend a month, and I also visit him at his aunt's house about once a week. We talk on the phone a couple of times a week as well. I'm still very much involved in his life, even though he lives with his aunt.

2026-01-26T13:16:03.267958 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. It's good to hear that you maintain regular contact with Zahid through visits and phone calls, staying involved in his life despite the living arrangement.

Given what you've shared, there are a few important points to consider regarding your Child Benefit eligibility:

1. Since you contribute financially to Zahid's upkeep (£15 per week)
2. You maintain regular contact with him (weekly visits and phone calls)
3. He stays with you periodically (one weekend per month)
4. His aunt is not claiming Child Benefit for him
5. This is an informal family arrangement

Based on these factors, you may have grounds to claim Child Benefit for Zahid, even though he doesn't live with you full-time. However, the decision would ultimately be made by HMRC based on who is considered to have the main responsibility for Zahid.

May I ask if you are working and, if so, what your annual income is? This is relevant because of the High Income Child Benefit Charge that may affect your benefit if you earn over £50,000 per year.

2026-01-26T13:16:04.676936 [actor]: My annual income is about £38,000 per year. I work full-time as an IT technician.

2026-01-26T13:16:08.300477 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your income information. Since your annual income is £38,000, you would not be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which only applies to individuals earning over £50,000 per year.

Based on all the information you've provided:

1. You contribute financially to Zahid's upkeep
2. You maintain regular contact with him
3. You have an ongoing parental relationship with him
4. His aunt is not claiming Child Benefit
5. Your income is below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge

You may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid. You would need to apply to HMRC explaining your circumstances, including details about your financial contributions and regular contact with Zahid.

One more question to confirm: Is Zahid in full-time education? Child Benefit is typically available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training.

2026-01-26T13:16:09.385949 [actor]: Yes, Zahid is in full-time education. He's 15 and attending secondary school.

2026-01-26T13:16:14.160120 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Zahid is 15 and in full-time secondary education.

Based on all the information you've provided, here's my assessment of your eligibility for Child Benefit:

You may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid because:
1. He is under 16 and in full-time education
2. You contribute financially to his upkeep (£15 per week)
3. You maintain regular contact with him (weekly visits and phone calls)
4. He stays with you periodically (one weekend per month)
5. His aunt (who he lives with) is not claiming Child Benefit for him
6. Your income (£38,000) is below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge

To make a claim, you would need to apply to HMRC using the Child Benefit claim form (CH2). In your application, you should explain your circumstances clearly, including details about:
- Your financial contributions to Zahid's upkeep
- Your regular contact and involvement in his life
- The fact that his aunt is not claiming the benefit
- The informal family arrangement for his care

HMRC will consider who has the main responsibility for Zahid when making their decision. Given your ongoing involvement in his life and financial support, along with the fact that no one else is claiming, you have reasonable grounds to make a claim.

2026-01-26T13:16:16.998597 [actor]: Thank you for that detailed explanation! I'm glad to hear that I might be eligible for Child Benefit for Zahid even though he lives with his aunt. I'll make sure to fill out the Child Benefit claim form and explain all the details about our situation - my financial contributions, regular visits, and our overall arrangement. It's good to know that my income won't be an issue since I'm below that £50,000 threshold. I appreciate your help with this.

2026-01-26T13:16:19.530049 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a non-resident parent who maintains financial contributions and regular contact with their child.
