2026-01-26T13:19:20.100799 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

First, are you responsible for raising a child or children who live with you?

2026-01-26T13:19:21.220889 [actor]: Yes, my son Rashid lives with me. He's 17 years old and still lives at home.

2026-01-26T13:19:22.841569 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. So you have a 17-year-old son named Rashid who lives with you.

Is Rashid currently in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or approved training courses.

2026-01-26T13:19:23.903821 [actor]: Yes, Rashid is currently studying for his A-Levels. He's in his final year of sixth form.

2026-01-26T13:19:25.703956 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Rashid is 17 and studying for his A-Levels, that's positive for your eligibility.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T13:19:26.708319 [actor]: No, neither my wife nor I earn anywhere near that amount. Our combined household income is well below £60,000.

2026-01-26T13:19:28.120547 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since neither you nor your wife has an individual income over £60,000, you wouldn't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge.

Do you or your wife usually live in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:19:29.030137 [actor]: Yes, we've lived in the UK for over 20 years now. This is our permanent home.

2026-01-26T13:19:30.220871 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK. 

Are you or your wife subject to any immigration control that would state you cannot claim public funds?

2026-01-26T13:19:31.194989 [actor]: No, we're not subject to any immigration restrictions. We have settled status in the UK.

2026-01-26T13:19:34.037118 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying your immigration status.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit for your son Rashid because:

1. He is 17 years old and living with you
2. He is in approved education (studying A-Levels)
3. Neither you nor your wife has an individual income over £60,000
4. You live in the UK and have settled status with no immigration restrictions on claiming public funds

You should be able to receive Child Benefit for Rashid until he completes his A-Levels (typically until age 18-19 depending on when his course finishes). If he continues to approved education or training after that, eligibility may extend further.

2026-01-26T13:19:35.491285 [actor]: Oh, I forgot to mention something important. Rashid recently got married to his girlfriend, who is also 17. She's moved into our house too. Does this affect whether I can still claim Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-26T13:19:38.728879 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing this important information. This does affect your Child Benefit eligibility.

If Rashid is married, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, regardless of whether he lives with you or continues in approved education.

According to the eligibility rules, Child Benefit stops when a child gets married or forms a civil partnership, even if they are still under 20 and in approved education or training. Once a young person marries, they are no longer considered a qualifying child for Child Benefit purposes.

If you are currently receiving Child Benefit for Rashid, you should inform the Child Benefit Office about his marriage, as this change in circumstances means you are no longer eligible to receive payments for him.

2026-01-26T13:19:40.332343 [actor]: I see, that's disappointing news. So even though Rashid still lives at home with us and we're supporting both him and his wife while he finishes his A-Levels, I can't claim Child Benefit for him anymore?

2026-01-26T13:19:44.317921 [root_agent]: That's correct, and I understand your disappointment. Even though Rashid still lives at home with you and you're supporting both him and his wife while he completes his A-Levels, you can no longer claim Child Benefit for him because of his marital status.

According to the UK government rules, once a child gets married or forms a civil partnership, they no longer qualify for Child Benefit, regardless of their age, living arrangements, or educational status. Marriage changes their status in terms of benefit eligibility.

If you were receiving Child Benefit for Rashid before his marriage, you should inform the Child Benefit Office about this change in circumstances to avoid any overpayments that might need to be repaid later.

There may be other forms of support available to help young married couples in education, though these would typically be applied for by Rashid and his wife directly rather than through you as a parent.

2026-01-26T13:19:46.452883 [actor]: I understand now. It's unfortunate, but those are the rules. I'll make sure to inform the Child Benefit Office about Rashid's marriage right away so I don't receive any payments I'm not entitled to. Thank you for explaining this clearly to me.

2026-01-26T13:19:49.158298 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that once a child gets married, they no longer qualify for Child Benefit regardless of age, living arrangements, or educational status, which aligns with UK government guidelines.
