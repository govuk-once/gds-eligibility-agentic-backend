2026-01-27T18:48:32.524524 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judgment. The agent incorrectly stated that Child Benefit continues for up to 52 weeks. According to gov.uk guidelines, for children in hospital or residential accommodation (which includes psychiatric units), Child Benefit continues for up to 12 weeks, not 52 weeks. The correct outcome should have been "Eligible (until week 12)."
