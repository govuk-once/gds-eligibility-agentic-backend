2026-01-26T13:05:58.242926 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a series of questions, one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:06:00.367473 [actor]: I need to role-play as someone checking their eligibility for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll respond to the agent's questions based on the scenario of Mark, a 40-year-old divorced father.

Yes, I have responsibility for my son Lucas who is 10 years old. He lives with my ex-wife Jenny, but I contribute £150 per month towards his food and clothes.

2026-01-26T13:06:02.512087 [root_agent]: I notice you're role-playing as Mark, a divorced father. I'll continue helping you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in this scenario.

Thank you for that information about your 10-year-old son Lucas. Since Lucas lives with your ex-wife Jenny rather than with you, I need to ask: Do you have a formal family-based arrangement with Jenny where Lucas regularly stays with you overnight?

2026-01-26T13:06:04.389830 [actor]: No, I don't have a formal arrangement where Lucas stays with me overnight. He lives full-time with Jenny, my ex-wife. But I do make sure to financially support him by sending £150 every month specifically for his food and clothes. Jenny and I agreed this is the best arrangement for Lucas right now, even though I wish I could see him more often.

2026-01-26T13:06:07.552022 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying your situation with Lucas. 

Based on what you've shared, it appears you may not be eligible for Child Benefit for Lucas. Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with, which in this case would be your ex-wife Jenny. Since Lucas lives with her full-time and doesn't regularly stay overnight with you, Jenny would be considered the person with main responsibility for Lucas under the Child Benefit rules.

While your financial contribution of £150 per month is commendable, Child Benefit eligibility is primarily determined by who has day-to-day care and responsibility for the child, rather than who provides financial support.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you as a non-resident parent?

2026-01-26T13:06:09.912846 [actor]: I understand that Jenny would normally be eligible, but she actually isn't claiming Child Benefit for Lucas at all. I thought since I'm contributing financially to his upkeep with more than the Child Benefit amount would be, and no one else is claiming it, I might be eligible to claim it instead. Does that make any difference to my situation?

2026-01-26T13:06:13.876124 [root_agent]: That's an important detail, thank you for sharing that information.

Even though Jenny isn't currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucas, you still wouldn't be eligible to claim it based on what you've described. Under UK government rules, Child Benefit is paid to the person who is responsible for a child, which typically means the person the child lives with.

Since Lucas lives full-time with Jenny and doesn't regularly stay overnight with you, she would still be considered the person with main responsibility, regardless of whether she's currently claiming the benefit or not. Your financial contributions, while significant, don't change the eligibility criteria which is based on caring responsibility rather than financial support.

If you believe it would benefit Lucas, you might want to discuss with Jenny about her applying for Child Benefit if she's eligible, as this could provide additional financial support for Lucas's care.

Would you like to know about any other forms of support that might be available in your situation?

2026-01-26T13:06:16.377330 [actor]: I see. I thought that since I contribute more than the Child Benefit amount each month specifically for Lucas, and Jenny isn't claiming it, I might be able to claim it myself. That's disappointing to hear.

Yes, please let me know if there are any other forms of support available for my situation as a non-resident parent who is financially supporting my child.

2026-01-26T13:06:18.789173 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with (Jenny) regardless of financial contributions or whether she is currently claiming it.
