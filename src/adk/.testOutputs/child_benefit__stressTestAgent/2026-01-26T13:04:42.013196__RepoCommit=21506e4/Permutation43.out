2026-01-26T13:22:29.472125 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:22:31.503582 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hello there! Yes, I'm responsible for my son Callum. He's 17 and has just started a Modern Apprenticeship program in Glasgow where we live. It's just me and him - I'm a single father. I was wondering if I can still claim Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-26T13:22:33.522192 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. I understand you're a single father responsible for your 17-year-old son Callum who has recently started a Modern Apprenticeship program in Glasgow.

To determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to confirm if the Modern Apprenticeship program Callum is doing is considered "approved education or training" under the Child Benefit rules.

Is Callum's Modern Apprenticeship program unpaid, or does he receive payment for it?

2026-01-26T13:22:35.231059 [actor]: Yes, Callum does get paid for his Modern Apprenticeship. He's earning about £4.50 an hour - it's not much, but it's his first proper job really. The company pays him while he's learning on the job and getting his qualifications. Is that going to affect the Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T13:22:38.443265 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Callum is receiving payment for his Modern Apprenticeship at £4.50 per hour, this is an important factor in determining eligibility.

Under UK rules, Child Benefit generally stops when a child starts paid work that counts as "approved training" if they're earning above a certain threshold. Modern Apprenticeships typically count as approved training, but the payment your son receives may affect eligibility.

Does Callum work more than 24 hours per week in his apprenticeship program?

2026-01-26T13:22:41.093104 [actor]: Yes, he does work more than 24 hours per week. It's a full-time apprenticeship, so he works about 35-40 hours per week between his time in the workplace and the college component. They structured it to be like a regular full-time job with training mixed in.

2026-01-26T13:22:45.003124 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is an important detail for determining Child Benefit eligibility.

Since Callum is 17, works more than 24 hours per week, and receives payment for his Modern Apprenticeship, I'm afraid he would not qualify as being in "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.

Under UK government rules, Child Benefit can continue for children aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training, but this generally doesn't include paid apprenticeships where the young person works more than 24 hours per week.

Therefore, based on the information you've provided, you would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Callum. The benefit typically stops when a child starts paid work like this type of apprenticeship.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation or other potential support that might be available?

2026-01-26T13:22:47.509640 [actor]: I see. That's disappointing, but I understand. I was hoping we might still qualify since he's still learning, but if paid apprenticeships don't count then I guess that's that. Thanks for explaining it clearly. I'll have to adjust our budget accordingly. Are there any other benefits I might look into as a single parent with a son in this situation?

2026-01-26T13:22:49.881648 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available when a child is in a paid apprenticeship working more than 24 hours per week, which matches government guidelines for Child Benefit eligibility.
