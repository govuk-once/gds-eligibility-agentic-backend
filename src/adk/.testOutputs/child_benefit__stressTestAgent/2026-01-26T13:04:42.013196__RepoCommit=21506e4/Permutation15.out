Let me assess whether this person is eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. I should ask questions one at a time to gather the necessary information, and I'll only use the provided links for reference.

From the gov.uk links provided, the main eligibility criteria for Child Benefit include:
1. The person must be responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training)
2. The person must live in the UK
3. There are income considerations (if either the claimant or their partner earns over £60,000, they may have to pay back some or all of their Child Benefit through tax)
4. Immigration status considerations (the person must have the right to live in the UK)

I'll start with the most fundamental question - whether they are responsible for a child.
#THINKING#

Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. 

To start, are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T13:10:25.846236 [actor]: I'm Mike, I'm 45 and my daughter Emma is 12. She doesn't live with me though - she lives with her mother. Her mother doesn't claim Child Benefit for her, and I was wondering if I could claim it. I send Emma a birthday present each year and I give her mother £10 a week to help with food.

Thank you for providing this context. Let me analyze Mike's situation:

1. Mike has a 12-year-old daughter named Emma
2. Emma doesn't live with Mike; she lives with her mother
3. The mother doesn't claim Child Benefit for Emma
4. Mike sends Emma a birthday present each year
5. Mike gives Emma's mother £10 a week to help with food

According to the gov.uk guidance on "Child Benefit if a child lives with someone else" (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else), for a person to claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with them:
- They must be paying at least the same amount as the weekly rate of Child Benefit toward the child's upkeep
- The current weekly Child Benefit rates are £24.00 for the eldest or only child, and £15.90 for each additional child

Mike pays £10 per week, which is less than the £24.00 weekly Child Benefit rate for an only/eldest child. This suggests Mike may not be eligible based on his current financial contribution.

I should also consider whether Mike is considered "responsible" for Emma in other ways according to the guidance.

Thank you for that information, Mike. Based on what you've shared, I need to understand a bit more about your situation.

For you to be eligible for Child Benefit when your child lives with someone else, you would typically need to contribute at least the same amount as the weekly Child Benefit rate toward your child's upkeep. The current weekly rate is £24.00 for an eldest or only child.

You mentioned you provide £10 a week. Would you be able to tell me if you provide any other financial support or contributions to Emma's upkeep beyond the £10 weekly payment?

2026-01-26T13:10:33.864170 [actor]: No, that's all I can afford right now. Just the £10 per week and I buy her a birthday present each year. Why, is that not enough?

2026-01-26T13:10:39.631404 [root_agent]: #THINKING#
Based on Mike's response, he only provides £10 per week plus an annual birthday present for Emma. This is less than the required weekly Child Benefit rate of £24.00 for an eldest/only child.

According to the guidance on "Child Benefit if a child lives with someone else" (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else), to be eligible for Child Benefit when the child lives with someone else, the person must be paying at least the same amount as the weekly Child Benefit rate toward the child's upkeep.

Since Mike's contribution (£10 per week) is less than the weekly Child Benefit rate (£24.00), he does not meet this requirement. Therefore, he is not currently eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma.

I should provide this information clearly and sensitively, while also explaining what would make him eligible.
#THINKING#

I understand your situation, Mike. Unfortunately, to be eligible for Child Benefit when your child lives with someone else, you would need to contribute at least the same amount as the weekly Child Benefit rate toward your child's upkeep. Currently, that rate is £24.00 per week for an eldest or only child.

Since you're contributing £10 per week plus an annual birthday present, this falls below the minimum contribution required to qualify for Child Benefit in your circumstances.

If you were able to increase your financial support to at least £24.00 per week, you might then become eligible to claim, assuming you meet other eligibility criteria such as UK residency requirements.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility that might be relevant to your situation?

2026-01-26T13:10:41.078672 [actor]: I see. That's disappointing - I didn't realize I needed to contribute that much to be eligible. So if the mother isn't claiming it either, does that mean no one gets Child Benefit for Emma?

This is an important question about a situation where neither parent is claiming Child Benefit.

According to the UK government guidelines, Child Benefit is designed to help with the costs of raising a child, and if eligible, someone should be claiming it for Emma's benefit.

The person who has primary responsibility for the child (in this case, Emma's mother since Emma lives with her) would typically be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit. The fact that she isn't claiming doesn't automatically make Mike eligible if he doesn't meet the criteria.

From the information provided on gov.uk, if Emma's mother is responsible for her (which appears to be the case as Emma lives with her), then she would likely be eligible to claim Child Benefit, assuming she meets other eligibility criteria (like UK residency, etc.).

I should advise Mike that Emma's mother might want to consider applying for Child Benefit if she's eligible, as this support is intended to help with a child's upbringing.
#THINKING#

That's a good question, Mike. If neither you nor Emma's mother is claiming Child Benefit, then yes, it means no one is currently receiving this support for Emma.

Since Emma lives with her mother, her mother would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for her, assuming she meets other eligibility criteria like UK residency requirements. The fact that she isn't claiming doesn't automatically transfer eligibility to you unless you meet the contribution threshold we discussed.

It might be worth having a conversation with Emma's mother about this situation. Child Benefit is designed to help with the costs of raising a child, and if she's eligible, she may want to consider applying. This could help with Emma's overall care and wellbeing.

Would you like to know anything else about how Child Benefit works or how someone can apply for it?

2026-01-26T13:10:49.708335 [actor]: I understand now. Thank you for explaining - I'll talk to Emma's mother about applying since she would be eligible. I appreciate your help in clearing this up.

2026-01-26T13:10:52.290217 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Mike is not eligible for Child Benefit because his £10 weekly contribution falls below the required £24 weekly threshold when the child lives with someone else.
