2026-01-26T13:24:01.158013 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you several questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T13:24:02.112844 [actor]: I have a 4-year-old son who lives with me. His name is Jakob.

2026-01-26T13:24:03.384160 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your 4-year-old son Jakob who lives with you.

Is Jakob under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:24:04.291245 [actor]: Yes, he's 4 years old, so he's definitely under 16.

2026-01-26T13:24:05.714795 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Jakob is 4 years old and under 16.

Are you responsible for raising Jakob? This typically means you live with them and are their main carer.

2026-01-26T13:24:06.669452 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for raising him. I'm his father and he lives with me full-time.

2026-01-26T13:24:07.603492 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're responsible for raising Jakob as his father and he lives with you full-time.

Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:24:08.380008 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-26T13:24:09.568432 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T13:24:10.611243 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that. I'm currently unemployed and looking for work.

2026-01-26T13:24:11.630202 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. 

Are you a UK national or do you have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:24:12.647487 [actor]: I have Pre-Settled Status in the UK. I'm originally from Germany.

2026-01-26T13:24:15.942186 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you have Pre-Settled Status and are originally from Germany.

Based on the information you've provided so far, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have a child (Jakob) who is under 16
2. You're responsible for raising him and he lives with you full-time
3. You live in the UK
4. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold
5. You have Pre-Settled Status, which generally gives you the right to reside in the UK

Having Pre-Settled Status means you typically have access to UK benefits like Child Benefit.

To apply for Child Benefit, you would need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T13:24:17.550827 [actor]: Actually, I should mention that I've been unemployed and claiming Child Benefit as a "Jobseeker" for about 95 days now. I'm still looking for work but don't have any job offers yet. Does that affect my eligibility at all?

2026-01-26T13:24:21.328768 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing this additional information.

Being unemployed and claiming benefits as a "Jobseeker" doesn't disqualify you from receiving Child Benefit. Child Benefit eligibility is primarily based on your responsibility for a child, rather than your employment status.

With Pre-Settled Status, there are some considerations regarding your right to reside in the UK when claiming benefits. However, if you've been legally residing in the UK and are already receiving Child Benefit as a Jobseeker, you're likely meeting the necessary requirements to maintain your eligibility.

The 90-day period is sometimes relevant for EU citizens with Pre-Settled Status claiming certain benefits, but if you're actively looking for work and can provide evidence of this, you can generally continue to be eligible for benefits.

Are you currently receiving Child Benefit payments for Jakob, or are you looking to apply?

2026-01-26T13:24:23.155244 [actor]: Yes, I'm currently receiving Child Benefit for Jakob, but I'm worried because someone told me there might be an issue after 90 days of being unemployed with Pre-Settled Status. I don't have any job prospects at the moment but I'm still actively looking. Is my Child Benefit at risk now that I've passed 90 days as a jobseeker?

2026-01-26T13:24:28.384700 [root_agent]: I understand your concern about the 90-day period as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status.

You're right to be aware of this issue. For EU citizens with Pre-Settled Status, there can be a limitation on retaining your "qualified person" status as a jobseeker beyond 91 days without employment. This could potentially affect your right to claim certain benefits.

However, it's important to note:

1. If you're genuinely seeking employment and can provide evidence of this (such as job applications, interviews attended, registration with employment agencies), you may be able to extend your status as a jobseeker beyond the 91 days.

2. Child Benefit specifically has different rules than some other benefits. If you're already receiving it and your circumstances regarding Jakob haven't changed, you may still qualify even with these jobseeker limitations.

Given your situation, I would recommend:
- Continue documenting all your job search activities thoroughly
- Contact the Child Benefit Office directly to discuss your specific situation
- Consider seeking advice from a welfare rights advisor or organization like Citizens Advice who can provide guidance specific to your circumstances

This is a complex area where immigration status intersects with benefit entitlement, and personalized advice would be beneficial.

2026-01-26T13:24:30.909874 [actor]: Thank you for the information. This is quite concerning for me. So if I understand correctly, since I've been a jobseeker for 95 days now (which is more than the 91-day limit) and don't have a job offer, my eligibility for Child Benefit might be affected? I'll definitely start documenting my job search better and contact the Child Benefit Office. Do you think I should inform them right away about passing the 91-day period?

2026-01-26T13:24:36.675341 [root_agent]: I understand your concern, and this is indeed a delicate situation that warrants careful consideration.

Since you've passed the 91-day period as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status, there could potentially be implications for your benefit eligibility. However, I want to emphasize that this is a complex area of policy where immigration status and benefit entitlement intersect.

Regarding informing the Child Benefit Office:

It's generally advisable to be proactive about reporting changes in circumstances that might affect your eligibility. However, before making any declarations, I would recommend:

1. Gathering evidence of your genuine and effective job search activities over the past months (applications submitted, interviews attended, communications with potential employers, registration with job agencies, etc.)

2. Seeking specialized advice first - organizations like Citizens Advice, a welfare rights advisor, or an immigration specialist who understands the intersection of EU settled status and benefits would be able to assess your specific situation

3. Once you have this advice and have organized your evidence, then approach the Child Benefit Office with a clear understanding of your position

The rules around maintaining your right to reside as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status can be interpreted differently depending on individual circumstances, and having professional guidance could make a significant difference in how your case is assessed.

Does that help clarify what steps you might take next?

2026-01-26T13:24:39.369171 [actor]: Yes, that clarifies things. I'll definitely gather all my job search evidence first and then seek advice from Citizens Advice before approaching the Child Benefit Office. I've been applying to jobs regularly but haven't been keeping good records. I'll start doing that right away. This is worrying because Jakob depends on this benefit. How quickly do you think I need to act on this? Would it be considered fraudulent if I continue receiving the benefit while sorting this out?

2026-01-26T13:24:45.247868 [root_agent]: I understand your concern, especially given how important this benefit is for Jakob's wellbeing.

Regarding urgency and concerns about potential fraud:

It's good to act reasonably promptly, but there's no need to panic. Continuing to receive benefits while you're actively sorting out your situation and seeking proper advice is not typically considered fraudulent, especially when:

1. You're genuinely uncertain about how the rules apply to your specific situation
2. You're taking active steps to clarify your position and seek proper guidance
3. You haven't received any formal notification that your eligibility has changed

What would be problematic is if you knowingly continued claiming benefits after being clearly informed you were no longer eligible, or if you deliberately withheld relevant information that was explicitly requested.

I'd suggest the following timeline:
- Start compiling your job search evidence immediately (even retrospectively where possible)
- Arrange an appointment with Citizens Advice within the next 1-2 weeks
- Continue your job search efforts with thorough documentation going forward

If you're concerned about the record-keeping for past applications, you could:
- Check your email history for application confirmations
- Contact companies you applied to for verification
- Note down as much detail as you can remember about previous applications

The most important thing is to show that you've been genuinely looking for work throughout this period and continue to do so.

2026-01-26T13:24:47.458122 [actor]: Thank you, that's really helpful. I'll start gathering my evidence right away and contact Citizens Advice within the next week. I'll be sure to document all my job search activities thoroughly from now on. It's a relief to know that I'm not doing anything wrong by continuing to receive the benefit while I get this sorted out. I appreciate your help with this complicated situation.

2026-01-26T13:24:50.127798 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that EU citizens with Pre-Settled Status may face limitations after 91 days as jobseekers, but provided correct information about Child Benefit eligibility and appropriate next steps.
