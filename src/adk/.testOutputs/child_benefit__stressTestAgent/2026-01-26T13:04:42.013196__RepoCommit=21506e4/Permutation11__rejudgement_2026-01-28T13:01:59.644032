2026-01-28T13:06:30.713636 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that Karen is eligible for Child Benefit. According to gov.uk guidance, an apprenticeship in England is a disqualifying event for Child Benefit, unlike staying in approved education. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" but the agent told Karen she was eligible.
