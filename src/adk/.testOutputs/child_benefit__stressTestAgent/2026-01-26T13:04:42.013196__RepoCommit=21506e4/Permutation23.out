2026-01-26T13:14:19.162591 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First question: Do you have any children under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:14:20.040289 [actor]: Yes, I have a daughter named Sarah who is 12 years old.

2026-01-26T13:14:21.238977 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your daughter Sarah. 

Next question: Do you live in the UK? (This includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland)

2026-01-26T13:14:22.014572 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-26T13:14:22.971625 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Next question: Is Sarah living with you? Or is she living with someone else?

2026-01-26T13:14:23.927039 [actor]: Sarah doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother.

2026-01-26T13:14:25.480705 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about Sarah's living arrangement.

Next question: Do you contribute financially to Sarah's upbringing or pay child maintenance for her?

2026-01-26T13:14:26.676695 [actor]: Yes, I do contribute financially. Every 4 weeks, I buy a large bulk order of groceries and clothes for Sarah costing about £120, and I deliver these directly to her mother's house.

2026-01-26T13:14:27.808622 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your financial contributions to Sarah.

Next question: Is Sarah's mother (or anyone else) already claiming Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-26T13:14:28.812430 [actor]: I believe Sarah's mother is already claiming Child Benefit for her, yes.

2026-01-26T13:14:32.398323 [root_agent]: Thank you for this information. Based on what you've shared, I can now provide you with an assessment of your eligibility for Child Benefit:

Since Sarah lives with her mother and her mother is already claiming Child Benefit for her, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah. In the UK, Child Benefit can typically only be claimed by one person for a child, and this is usually the person the child lives with.

However, if your circumstances change in the future (for example, if Sarah were to come and live with you), then your eligibility could change.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you as a parent who doesn't have primary residence of their child?

2026-01-26T13:14:34.537363 [actor]: I understand. So since Sarah lives with her mother who is already claiming Child Benefit, I'm not eligible to claim it myself. That makes sense.

Is there any other financial support I might be eligible for as a non-resident parent who still contributes financially?

2026-01-26T13:14:36.747439 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that since the child lives with her mother who already claims Child Benefit, the father is not eligible to claim it, which aligns with UK government guidelines.
