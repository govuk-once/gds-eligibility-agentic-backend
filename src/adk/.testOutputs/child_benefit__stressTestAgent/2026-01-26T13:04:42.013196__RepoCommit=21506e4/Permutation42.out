2026-01-26T13:22:07.625144 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:22:09.350012 [actor]: I'm Sian's mother from Cardiff, Wales. My daughter Sian is 17 and has recently left school. She's now started a Foundation Apprenticeship that's funded by the Welsh Government. I was wondering if I'm still eligible to receive Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-26T13:22:11.572699 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand you're Sian's mother from Cardiff, Wales, and your daughter is 17 and has recently started a Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government.

To determine if you're still eligible for Child Benefit for Sian, I need to know if her Foundation Apprenticeship qualifies as approved education or training under the Child Benefit rules. 

Is Sian's apprenticeship unpaid or does she receive a wage that's less than £274 per week?

2026-01-26T13:22:13.154951 [actor]: Yes, it's a Foundation Apprenticeship, so she gets a training allowance rather than a full wage. It's definitely less than £274 per week. The Welsh Government funds these apprenticeships specifically for young people her age who have just left school.

2026-01-26T13:22:14.497715 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know that Sian receives a training allowance that's less than £274 per week.

Now, I need to confirm if you're responsible for Sian - does she normally live with you at home?

2026-01-26T13:22:15.448978 [actor]: Yes, Sian lives with me at our home in Cardiff. I'm her mother and her primary caregiver.

2026-01-26T13:22:18.163616 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Sian lives with you and you're her primary caregiver.

Based on the information you've provided so far, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Sian since:

1. She is 17 years old (under 20)
2. She is undertaking a Foundation Apprenticeship, which appears to qualify as approved education or training
3. Her training allowance is less than £274 per week
4. She lives with you and you are responsible for her

To be completely certain about your eligibility, I need to ask: Do either you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T13:22:19.289649 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near £60,000. I'm a single mother and my income is well below that threshold.

2026-01-26T13:22:23.158750 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information. 

Based on all the details you've provided, I can now give you a clear assessment of your eligibility:

You should be eligible to receive Child Benefit for your daughter Sian because:
- She is 17 years old (under 20)
- She is on a Foundation Apprenticeship, which appears to qualify as approved education or training
- Her training allowance is less than £274 per week
- She lives with you and you are her primary caregiver
- Your income is well below the £60,000 threshold

Since your income is below £50,000, you should be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit amount without the High Income Child Benefit Charge affecting you.

If you're already receiving Child Benefit, it should continue as long as Sian remains on her approved apprenticeship and meets the other criteria. If you're not currently claiming, you may want to apply for Child Benefit through the official UK government website.

2026-01-26T13:22:25.534249 [actor]: That's great news! I was worried that because she left school and started this apprenticeship, I might lose the Child Benefit. It really helps with our household expenses. I'll make sure to keep receiving it while she's on her Foundation Apprenticeship. Thank you for confirming I'm still eligible!

2026-01-26T13:22:27.988026 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent provided incorrect information when stating an income threshold of £50,000, when in fact the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies to individuals with income over £50,000 (not below), and it gradually increases until income reaches £60,000.
