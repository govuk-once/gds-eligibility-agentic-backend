2026-01-26T13:21:43.479361 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:21:44.829582 [actor]: I have two children, Ben who's 10 and Jerry who's 8. But they actually live with my ex-partner, not with me. I do send money to help support them though.

2026-01-26T13:21:47.226216 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since your children Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner rather than with you, this affects your eligibility for Child Benefit.

To clarify your situation further, do you have an arrangement with your ex-partner about who claims Child Benefit for the children?

2026-01-26T13:21:49.329688 [actor]: My ex-partner currently gets the Child Benefit for both kids. But I send about £40 a week to help support them. I was wondering if I might be eligible for some portion of the Child Benefit since I'm contributing financially to their care. Does that make sense?

2026-01-26T13:21:53.978042 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation. Based on the UK government rules for Child Benefit, only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child. Since your ex-partner is already receiving Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry, and they are living with your ex-partner, you would not be eligible to receive Child Benefit for them at the same time.

The financial contribution you make (£40 per week) is commendable, but it doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit while your ex-partner is already claiming it. Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with, which in this case is your ex-partner.

If circumstances were to change - for example, if the children came to live with you - then you could apply for Child Benefit at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T13:21:56.725262 [actor]: I see. So even though I'm contributing financially, I can't receive any portion of the Child Benefit because my ex has already claimed it and the kids live with them. That makes sense, but it's a bit disappointing. I wasn't aware of this rule.

Just to be clear, there's absolutely no way for me to claim any part of the Child Benefit while continuing our current living arrangement? I was hoping there might be some recognition of my financial support.

2026-01-26T13:22:00.992804 [root_agent]: You're correct in your understanding. Under the UK Child Benefit rules, there is no provision for splitting or sharing Child Benefit between parents - only one person can claim it for a child, and this is typically the person the child lives with.

Even though you're providing financial support (which is important and valuable), this doesn't qualify you to receive any portion of the Child Benefit while maintaining your current living arrangement. The system doesn't have a mechanism to recognize partial financial contributions through the Child Benefit program.

I understand this is disappointing news. The rules are designed this way because Child Benefit is intended to go to the main caregiver where the child normally lives.

If your circumstances were to change significantly - such as the children coming to live with you for an equal or greater amount of time - then you might be able to discuss with your ex-partner about who should claim the benefit. But as long as they live primarily with your ex-partner, your ex-partner would typically remain the eligible claimant.

2026-01-26T13:22:03.143957 [actor]: Thank you for clarifying that. It is disappointing, but I understand the rules now. Since my children live with my ex-partner full-time, she remains the only one eligible to receive the Child Benefit, regardless of my financial contributions. I appreciate you taking the time to explain this to me.

2026-01-26T13:22:06.140364 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that since the children live with the ex-partner who already claims Child Benefit, the user is not eligible to receive any portion of it despite providing financial support.
