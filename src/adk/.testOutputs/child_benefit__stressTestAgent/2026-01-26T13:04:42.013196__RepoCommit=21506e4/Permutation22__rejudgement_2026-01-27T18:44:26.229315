2026-01-27T18:48:09.668255 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ The agent failed because they gave incorrect information. The expected outcome should be "Not Eligible" since Arthur's hospital stays exceed 12 cumulative weeks and are linked by the 28-day rule (he returned to hospital within 15 days). The agent incorrectly stated the clock resets when a child goes home briefly, but failed to apply the linking rule.
