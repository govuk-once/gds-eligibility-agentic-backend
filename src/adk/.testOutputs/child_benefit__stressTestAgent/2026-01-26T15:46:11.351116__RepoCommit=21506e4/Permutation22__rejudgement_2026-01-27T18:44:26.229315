2026-01-27T18:46:35.917420 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed to correctly apply the "linking rule" for hospital stays. When a child returns to hospital within 28 days (Arthur returned after 15 days), the hospital stays are linked, counting as one continuous stay. Arthur has been in hospital for 13 weeks total (10 weeks + 3 weeks), exceeding the 12-week limit for Child Benefit eligibility. The correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)."
