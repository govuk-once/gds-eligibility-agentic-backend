2026-01-28T13:04:21.829684 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the user is eligible for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is "Not Eligible." According to Child Benefit rules, when a child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks and the parent is not regularly spending money on the child's care or upkeep during this time, they become ineligible. The agent did not correctly apply this 12-week hospital rule with the spending requirement exception.
