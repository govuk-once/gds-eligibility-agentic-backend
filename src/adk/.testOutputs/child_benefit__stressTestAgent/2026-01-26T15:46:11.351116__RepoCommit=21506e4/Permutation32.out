2026-01-26T15:59:35.544976 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to determine your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:59:37.006482 [actor]: I'll roleplay as someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hello there. Yes, I have a son John who is 17 years old. He lives with me - I'm Pete, his father.

2026-01-26T15:59:38.534836 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Pete. Since your son John is 17, I need to ask: is John currently in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved courses.

2026-01-26T15:59:39.869943 [actor]: Yes, John is in education. He's attending a local college to re-sit two GCSEs. He goes in for classes about 6 hours a week. The rest of the time he's mostly at home playing video games.

2026-01-26T15:59:41.858976 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to understand more about John's education status. 

Is John's GCSE re-sit program considered full-time education (usually at least 12 hours per week of supervised study) and recognized/approved by the education authorities?

2026-01-26T15:59:43.609295 [actor]: No, it's not considered full-time. He only goes to the college for about 6 hours a week for the GCSE re-sits. It's definitely less than the 12 hours of supervised study you mentioned. The college is a proper educational institution, but his course isn't full-time.

2026-01-26T15:59:45.941083 [root_agent]: I understand. Since John is over 16 and his education doesn't meet the requirement of at least 12 hours per week of supervised study in approved education, he wouldn't qualify as an eligible child for Child Benefit purposes.

Child Benefit is typically available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved full-time education or training.

May I ask if you have any other children you're responsible for who might qualify for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:59:48.097022 [actor]: No, John is my only child. So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit then? That's disappointing but I understand. Thanks for explaining the situation to me.

2026-01-26T15:59:50.802715 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed the user that they're not eligible for Child Benefit since their 17-year-old son is not in approved full-time education (only studying 6 hours per week, below the required 12 hours).
