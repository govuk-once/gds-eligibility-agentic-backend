2026-01-26T15:47:34.188107 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:47:35.163145 [actor]: Yes, I have a son who's 10 years old. His name is Lucas.

2026-01-26T15:47:36.653652 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your 10-year-old son, Lucas. 

Does Lucas normally live with you or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards looking after him?

2026-01-26T15:47:37.972158 [actor]: Lucas doesn't live with me. He lives with my ex-wife Jenny. We're divorced. I do send Jenny £150 per month specifically for Lucas's food and clothes.

2026-01-26T15:47:40.146458 [root_agent]: I understand that Lucas lives with your ex-wife Jenny, and you contribute £150 per month for his needs.

To determine your eligibility, I need to understand who has the main responsibility for Lucas. Does anyone else (such as your ex-wife Jenny) already receive Child Benefit for Lucas?

2026-01-26T15:47:41.219671 [actor]: No, Jenny doesn't claim Child Benefit for Lucas. That's why I'm thinking about claiming it.

2026-01-26T15:47:43.384223 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Since Lucas lives with your ex-wife Jenny but you contribute financially to his upbringing, I need to clarify a few more points about your situation.

Even though you make regular payments for Lucas, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who has the child living with them (in this case, your ex-wife Jenny).

Do you have any arrangements specified in a court order regarding who should receive Child Benefit for Lucas?

2026-01-26T15:47:44.770337 [actor]: No, there's no court order specifying who should receive Child Benefit. Jenny and I have an informal arrangement where I send money for Lucas's expenses, but nothing formal about benefits.

2026-01-26T15:47:48.178849 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that information.

Based on the UK government's Child Benefit rules, it appears that you may not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas since:

1. Lucas lives with your ex-wife Jenny rather than with you
2. There's no court order specifying that you should receive the benefit
3. Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who the child lives with

In this situation, Jenny would likely be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit for Lucas since he lives with her. Even though you make financial contributions toward his care, the primary eligibility factor is who has day-to-day responsibility for the child.

Would you like me to provide more information about this situation or would you like to ask me about any other aspects of Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:47:50.352756 [actor]: I'm a bit confused. I thought I could claim since I contribute more than the Child Benefit amount each month (£150, which is more than the £113 Child Benefit), and Jenny isn't claiming it at all. Does that not make me eligible? I read something about being able to claim if you contribute to the child's upkeep.

2026-01-26T15:47:55.070716 [root_agent]: I understand your confusion, and I appreciate you providing those additional details. Let me clarify this point specifically.

You're referring to an important aspect of the eligibility criteria. According to the UK government guidelines, you can qualify for Child Benefit if you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (which you do, at £150 per month compared to the benefit amount) towards your child's upkeep.

However, there's an important consideration here: when parents are separated, Child Benefit is typically only paid to one person. Since Lucas lives with Jenny, she would normally have priority for claiming it, even if she hasn't done so yet.

That said, if Jenny agrees not to claim Child Benefit, and you are contributing at least the equivalent amount toward Lucas's upkeep (which you are), you could potentially be eligible.

Have you discussed with Jenny about who should claim Child Benefit for Lucas?

2026-01-26T15:47:57.167626 [actor]: I've briefly mentioned it to Jenny. She confirmed she's not planning to claim it and doesn't mind if I do. She knows I'm contributing regularly to Lucas's expenses and thought it might make sense for me to claim since I'm helping financially anyway. We have a good co-parenting relationship despite the divorce.

2026-01-26T15:48:01.639474 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. This changes the situation significantly.

Based on what you've shared:

1. You contribute more than the Child Benefit amount (£150 vs £113) toward Lucas's upkeep
2. Jenny, who has Lucas living with her, has confirmed she's not claiming and doesn't object to you claiming
3. You have a cooperative co-parenting arrangement

In this case, you may indeed be eligible to claim Child Benefit. When the person the child lives with (Jenny) isn't claiming the benefit, and you're contributing at least the equivalent amount to the child's upkeep, you can potentially qualify.

I would recommend that you:
1. Get Jenny's agreement in writing if possible
2. Be prepared to provide evidence of your regular financial contributions
3. Explain in your application that Lucas lives with his mother but that you provide financial support and she is not claiming the benefit

Would you like to know how to proceed with making a claim?

2026-01-26T15:48:04.118816 [actor]: Yes, please! That's great news. I'd like to know how to proceed with making the claim. Should I download a form or apply online? And what evidence should I prepare about my financial contributions to Lucas?

2026-01-26T15:48:06.969369 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent initially provided incomplete information but ultimately correctly identified that the user is eligible to claim Child Benefit because they contribute more than the benefit amount, Lucas lives with someone who isn't claiming the benefit, and that person doesn't object to the user claiming.
