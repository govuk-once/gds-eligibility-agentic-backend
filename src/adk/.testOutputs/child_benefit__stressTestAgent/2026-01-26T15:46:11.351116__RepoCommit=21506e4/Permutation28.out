2026-01-26T15:58:07.833164 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To properly assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:58:08.918826 [actor]: Hi there! Yes, I have a son who's 5 years old. He's with me here in the UK.

2026-01-26T15:58:10.496385 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know your son is 5 years old and lives with you in the UK.

Next question: Are you and your son living in the UK? And do you have the right to reside in the UK (such as being a UK citizen, having settled status, etc.)?

2026-01-26T15:58:11.715019 [actor]: Yes, my son and I are living in the UK right now. I'm a US citizen visiting on a 6-month tourist visa. We've been here for about a month now.

2026-01-26T15:58:16.564052 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying your situation. 

Based on what you've shared, I need to consider your residency status carefully. While you and your son are physically in the UK, you're here on a 6-month tourist visa as a US citizen. 

To be eligible for Child Benefit, you generally need to have the right to reside in the UK, which goes beyond simply being physically present. A tourist visa is considered a temporary stay and doesn't typically qualify as having the right to reside for benefit purposes.

Under UK government rules, to qualify for Child Benefit:
- You must be "living in" the UK, which means having your home here with a sufficient degree of permanence
- You must have the right to reside in the UK (which tourist visas don't typically provide for benefit purposes)

Based on this information, it appears you would not currently be eligible for Child Benefit. If your immigration status were to change in the future to one that gives you the right to reside in the UK (such as settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or other qualifying immigration statuses), your eligibility could change.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T15:58:19.185077 [actor]: Oh, I see. I wasn't aware that my tourist visa wouldn't qualify me for Child Benefit. Thank you for explaining that so clearly. I was just exploring what options might be available while we're here visiting. We'll be returning to the US in a few months anyway. Is there anything else I should know about while we're visiting the UK with my son?

2026-01-26T15:58:21.267856 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that a tourist visa doesn't establish the right to reside in the UK for benefit purposes, making the person ineligible for Child Benefit.
