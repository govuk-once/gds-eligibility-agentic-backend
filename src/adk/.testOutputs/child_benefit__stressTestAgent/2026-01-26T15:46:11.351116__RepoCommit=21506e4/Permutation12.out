2026-01-26T15:50:18.329325 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you assess if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one by one to determine this.

First, are you responsible for raising a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:50:19.526509 [actor]: I need to check if I'm eligible for Child Benefit. My son Liam is 18 and lives with me. He's currently studying for his A-levels.

2026-01-26T15:50:21.170716 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Liam is 18 and studying for his A-levels, that's helpful to know.

Is Liam in approved education or training? A-levels would typically count as approved education, but I just want to confirm this is a full-time course.

2026-01-26T15:50:22.581573 [actor]: Yes, he's studying A-levels full-time. It's definitely approved education according to the requirements.

2026-01-26T15:50:23.814440 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's good to know that Liam is in full-time approved education.

Do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:50:24.776421 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. I've been here my whole life.

2026-01-26T15:50:25.723410 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Liam already?

2026-01-26T15:50:26.972118 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Liam. He lives with me, and I'm his mother. His father isn't involved in his life.

2026-01-26T15:50:28.047080 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Are you subject to immigration control or do you have any restrictions on your right to be in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:50:28.909058 [actor]: No, I don't have any immigration restrictions. I'm a UK citizen.

2026-01-26T15:50:30.092792 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information.

Based on what you've shared, are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 a year?

2026-01-26T15:50:31.325029 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that much. I'm a single parent and my income is well below £60,000.

2026-01-26T15:50:35.918208 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. Your son Liam is 18 and in approved full-time education (A-levels)
2. You live in the UK
3. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Liam
4. You're not subject to immigration control
5. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold (though you would still be eligible above this threshold, but would need to pay back some or all of it through the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

As Liam is living with you and you're responsible for him, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit until he completes his approved education or turns 20, whichever comes first.

You can apply for Child Benefit by filling out the CH2 form, which you can download from the GOV.UK website or get from your local post office.

2026-01-26T15:50:38.199388 [actor]: There's one thing I should probably mention - Liam actually receives Universal Credit in his own right. He successfully applied for it because of our specific circumstances to help with his personal living costs. Does that affect whether I can get Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-26T15:50:42.273686 [root_agent]: That's an important detail to mention, thank you.

The good news is that Liam receiving Universal Credit in his own right doesn't automatically disqualify you from claiming Child Benefit for him. Child Benefit and Universal Credit are separate benefit systems that can be claimed simultaneously in many circumstances.

As long as:
- He's still under 20
- In approved education (which his A-levels are)
- Living with you as his parent/guardian
- You're responsible for him

You should still be eligible to claim Child Benefit. Liam receiving Universal Credit for his personal living costs doesn't change these qualifying conditions.

However, it's worth noting that your Child Benefit might be taken into account when calculating Liam's Universal Credit entitlement. The system looks at household income when determining Universal Credit amounts, though this varies based on specific circumstances.

Would you like me to clarify anything else about your eligibility?

2026-01-26T15:50:43.839661 [actor]: I'm sorry, but I think there might be some confusion here. I was told that if my child gets Universal Credit in their own right, I can't receive Child Benefit for them anymore. Is that not correct?

2026-01-26T15:50:48.623656 [root_agent]: Thank you for bringing this up. I need to clarify this important point.

Let me think through this carefully based on the official eligibility guidelines...

You're right to question this, and I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Looking more closely at the rules:

If your child (Liam) is claiming Universal Credit in his own right, this can indeed affect your Child Benefit eligibility. When a young person receives certain benefits in their own right, including Universal Credit, they are generally considered to be financially independent.

According to the UK government guidelines, Child Benefit typically stops when a child claims certain benefits in their own name, including Universal Credit.

So you are correct - if Liam is receiving Universal Credit in his own right, you would likely not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, even though he's under 20 and in approved education.

I apologize for my earlier incorrect information. Thank you for prompting me to double-check this important detail.

2026-01-26T15:50:50.332488 [actor]: That's what I thought. It's disappointing since he's still in education and living at home, but I understand the rules. Thank you for confirming this for me.

2026-01-26T15:50:53.429265 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent initially provided incorrect information but corrected itself when challenged, confirming that a child receiving Universal Credit in their own right makes the parent ineligible for Child Benefit, which aligns with UK government guidelines.
