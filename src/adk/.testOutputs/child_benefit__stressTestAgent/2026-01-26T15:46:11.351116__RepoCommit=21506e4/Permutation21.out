2026-01-26T15:54:57.959898 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First question: Are you responsible for raising a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:55:00.050179 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a user inquiring about child benefit eligibility.

Yes, I am responsible for raising a child. My son Sam is 10 years old and lives with me. I recently got divorced from my ex-wife Tina, and she has our daughter Ella who is 8 years old. We separated and each took one child.

2026-01-26T15:55:01.398170 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're responsible for your 10-year-old son Sam who lives with you, and your ex-wife Tina has your daughter Ella.

Next question: Are you living in the United Kingdom?

2026-01-26T15:55:02.531172 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I've been here all my life, and Sam lives with me full-time since the divorce.

2026-01-26T15:55:03.893114 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK and that Sam lives with you full-time.

Next question: Do you or your ex-wife currently receive Child Benefit for Sam or Ella?

2026-01-26T15:55:05.566194 [actor]: I don't currently receive any Child Benefit for Sam. I'm not entirely sure if my ex-wife Tina is receiving any benefits for Ella. We haven't really discussed that since the divorce was finalized a few months ago. I'm just trying to figure out what I'm entitled to for taking care of Sam.

2026-01-26T15:55:07.230741 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're responsible for Sam who lives with you full-time, you would generally be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, regardless of whether your ex-wife claims for Ella.

Next question: Do you have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:55:08.257539 [actor]: No, my income is around £40,000 per year. I work as a teacher at a secondary school.

2026-01-26T15:55:10.891663 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. With your income at around £40,000 per year, you would be eligible for the full Child Benefit payment for Sam.

Since your income is below £50,000, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge. If your income were between £50,000 and £60,000, you would have to pay back some of the benefit through tax, and if it were over £60,000, you would have to pay it all back.

Next question: Is Sam a UK citizen, or does he have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:55:11.971320 [actor]: Yes, Sam is a UK citizen. He was born here in Birmingham and has lived here his whole life.

2026-01-26T15:55:15.233109 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Sam is a UK citizen.

Based on all the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your son Sam because:

1. You're responsible for raising him
2. He's under 16 years old
3. He lives with you
4. You're a UK resident
5. Your income is below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge
6. Sam is a UK citizen

You can apply for Child Benefit even if you're separated from your ex-wife and she's claiming for your daughter. Each person responsible for a child can claim for the children living with them.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:55:17.223751 [actor]: Yes, that's great news to hear I'm eligible! I would definitely like to know how to apply for Child Benefit for Sam. How do I get started with the application?
