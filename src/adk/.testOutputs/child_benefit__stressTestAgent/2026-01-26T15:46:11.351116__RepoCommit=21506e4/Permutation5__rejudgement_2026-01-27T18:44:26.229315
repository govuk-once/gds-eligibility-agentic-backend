The agent correctly determined that Mark is eligible for Child Benefit since he contributes more than the benefit amount to Lucas's upkeep (£150 vs £113), Jenny isn't claiming the benefit, and she doesn't object to Mark claiming. After initially providing incomplete information, the agent properly corrected their assessment when they received full details, arriving at the correct outcome of eligibility.
