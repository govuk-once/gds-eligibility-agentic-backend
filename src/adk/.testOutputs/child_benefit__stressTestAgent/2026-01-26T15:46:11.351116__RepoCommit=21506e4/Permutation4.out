2026-01-26T15:47:22.492823 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To provide you with accurate information, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T15:47:23.500156 [actor]: Yes, I have one daughter, Sofia, who lives with me. She's 18 years old.

2026-01-26T15:47:24.777731 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to know: 

Is your daughter Sofia in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:47:25.735481 [actor]: No, she's not in education or training. She left school two years ago and now works as a receptionist.

2026-01-26T15:47:28.547074 [root_agent]: I understand that Sofia is 18 years old, not in education or training, and is working as a receptionist.

Based on the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit in the UK, I need to inform you that you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia. 

Child Benefit is typically paid until a child reaches 16 years of age. It can continue until they're 20 if they stay in approved education or training, but since Sofia is 18 and not in education or training, she doesn't meet this requirement.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other potential benefits you might be eligible for?

2026-01-26T15:47:30.769368 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know. That makes sense since she's working now and not in school anymore. I wasn't sure about the age limits for Child Benefit. Do you know if there are any other benefits I might be eligible for as a parent of a working adult child?

2026-01-26T15:47:32.747795 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available for an 18-year-old who is not in approved education or training.
