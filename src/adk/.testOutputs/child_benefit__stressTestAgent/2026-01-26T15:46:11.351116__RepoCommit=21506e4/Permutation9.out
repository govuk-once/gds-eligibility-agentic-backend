2026-01-26T15:49:13.511289 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one by one.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:49:14.933667 [actor]: I'll help you with your Child Benefit eligibility question by role-playing as a user in this conversation.

Hello! Yes, I have a 5-year-old son named Hans who lives with me. I'm responsible for him.

2026-01-26T15:49:15.977014 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know about your 5-year-old son Hans.

Next question: Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:49:17.068605 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I moved here recently from Germany. I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme.

2026-01-26T15:49:18.118220 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme is relevant to your eligibility.

Next question: Is your child living with you most of the time?

2026-01-26T15:49:19.158290 [actor]: Yes, Hans lives with me full-time. I'm his father and have sole responsibility for him.

2026-01-26T15:49:20.685497 [root_agent]: I understand that Hans lives with you full-time and you have sole responsibility for him as his father.

Next question: Is your income, or your partner's income if you have one, over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:49:21.842090 [actor]: No, my income is not over £60,000 per year. I'm currently unemployed and looking for work. I've registered as a jobseeker here in the UK.

2026-01-26T15:49:23.609141 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Your income being below £60,000 is relevant to the payment amount you may receive.

Next question: Has Hans been living in the UK since you moved here? And approximately how long ago did you move to the UK?

2026-01-26T15:49:24.830497 [actor]: Yes, Hans has been living with me in the UK since we moved here. We've been here for about six months now. We moved together from Germany.

2026-01-26T15:49:28.455785 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. That's helpful to know that both you and Hans have been in the UK for about six months with Pre-Settled Status.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have responsibility for Hans, who is under 16 years old
2. You live in the UK and have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme
3. Hans lives with you full-time
4. Your income is below £60,000 per year

With Pre-Settled Status, you generally have the right to claim benefits like Child Benefit. The current rate for Child Benefit is £25.60 per week for your first child.

You can apply for Child Benefit online or by post using the CH2 form. You'll need your child's birth certificate and your National Insurance number when applying.

Would you like me to explain how you can apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:49:30.413154 [actor]: That's great news! Yes, I would be interested in knowing how to apply for Child Benefit. I do have my National Insurance number and Hans's birth certificate, so it sounds like I have what I need to start the application.

2026-01-26T15:49:32.861401 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that the person with Pre-Settled Status living in the UK with responsibility for a child under 16 who lives with them full-time is eligible for Child Benefit.
