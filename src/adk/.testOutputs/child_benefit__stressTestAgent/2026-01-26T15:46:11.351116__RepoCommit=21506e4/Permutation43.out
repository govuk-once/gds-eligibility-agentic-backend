2026-01-26T16:04:28.488805 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T16:04:30.628049 [actor]: I'll help you by role-playing as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

I'll respond to the agent's question as if I were Callum's father from Glasgow.

"Yes, I have a son named Callum who is 17. He's living with me here in Glasgow."

2026-01-26T16:04:32.138070 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Callum is 17, which is over 16, I need to ask: Is Callum currently in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:04:33.797077 [actor]: "Aye, he's started a Modern Apprenticeship recently. He's learning a trade while earning a bit of money. It's a good opportunity for him, but I was wondering if I can still get Child Benefit while he's doing this apprenticeship."

2026-01-26T16:04:36.346342 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about Callum's Modern Apprenticeship. 

To determine if you can still get Child Benefit, I need to understand more about this apprenticeship. Is Callum's Modern Apprenticeship considered an "approved" training program? Approved training typically includes programs arranged or funded by the government, and in Scotland these are often called Employability Fund programs, No One Left Behind, or specific training programs approved by the Scottish Government.

2026-01-26T16:04:38.518538 [actor]: "I don't think it's one of those government schemes you mentioned. It's just a standard Modern Apprenticeship with a local company. He's getting paid a wage while he learns the trade. They're teaching him on the job and he goes to college one day a week as part of it. But it's not specifically one of those Employability Fund programs or anything like that."

2026-01-26T16:04:41.276404 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Based on the information you've provided, I need to understand more about Callum's apprenticeship.

Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland can qualify as approved training for Child Benefit purposes, particularly if they include educational components like the college day you mentioned.

Is Callum's apprenticeship one that leads to a recognized qualification (like an SVQ, NVQ, or other vocational qualification)? And could you confirm if he's working more than 24 hours per week on average?

2026-01-26T16:04:43.388252 [actor]: "Yes, he'll get an SVQ qualification at the end of his apprenticeship. That's part of why I thought this was good for him.

As for his hours, aye, he works more than 24 hours a week. He's doing pretty much full-time hours - about 35 hours a week in total. That includes his one day at college and the rest at the workplace."

2026-01-26T16:04:47.003636 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details about Callum's apprenticeship.

I'm afraid I have to inform you that based on the information you've shared, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Callum. While his apprenticeship does lead to a recognized qualification (SVQ), the fact that he's working more than 24 hours per week means it doesn't qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

For Child Benefit eligibility, apprenticeships or training programs must generally involve less than 24 hours of paid work per week. Since Callum is working approximately 35 hours per week, including his college day, this exceeds the threshold.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T16:04:49.669751 [actor]: "I see. That's disappointing, but thank you for letting me know. I didn't realize the hours would make a difference. So once they're on an apprenticeship working those kinds of hours, I'm no longer eligible for any support even though he's still living at home and only 17? Well, I suppose that's that then. Thanks for clearing it up for me."

2026-01-26T16:04:52.189059 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available when a child is on an apprenticeship working more than 24 hours per week, even though the apprenticeship leads to a recognized qualification.
