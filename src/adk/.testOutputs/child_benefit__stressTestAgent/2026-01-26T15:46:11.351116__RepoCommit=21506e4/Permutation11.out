2026-01-26T15:49:50.680546 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess this.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:49:53.012632 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a parent seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. Let me respond to the agent's question.

Yes, I'm responsible for my son Ryan. He's 17 years old and has just started an Intermediate Apprenticeship that's government-funded here in England. He still lives at home with me.

2026-01-26T15:49:55.674508 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know about Ryan.

Since your son is 17 and in an apprenticeship, I need to check if his education/training qualifies. 

Is Ryan's Intermediate Apprenticeship considered "approved education or training" by UK standards? (This typically includes A-levels, NVQs, and certain government-approved training programs)

2026-01-26T15:49:58.279322 [actor]: Well, it's a government-funded apprenticeship program. He's learning a trade and getting some qualifications through it. It's official - he gets paid a bit while training. It's not like A-levels though, he's actually working most of the time with some classroom learning. Does that count as approved education?

2026-01-26T15:50:00.019900 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details about Ryan's apprenticeship.

For Child Benefit purposes, approved education includes apprenticeships in the UK that are part of government-recognized programs. Since you mentioned Ryan is in a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship, this would typically qualify as approved education or training.

Now I need to ask: Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:50:00.938555 [actor]: Yes, we live in the UK. We're in Manchester, been here all my life.

2026-01-26T15:50:02.729464 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK. That's an important eligibility criterion.

Now I need to ask about your immigration status. Do you have the right to live in the UK? This could be because you're a British citizen, have settled status, or have another immigration status that allows you to live in the UK.

2026-01-26T15:50:03.916051 [actor]: Yes, I'm a British citizen. Born and raised here.

2026-01-26T15:50:05.667371 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your citizenship status.

Now I need to ask about your income. The Child Benefit has a High Income Tax Charge that may apply if you or your partner (if you have one) has an individual income over £50,000 per year. 

Do you or a partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:50:07.267702 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that much. I work as an admin assistant and make about £28,000 a year. I'm a single parent, so there's no partner's income to consider.

2026-01-26T15:50:08.567077 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your income.

Now I need to ask: Is Ryan currently living with you most of the time? (For Child Benefit purposes, the child should normally live with you)

2026-01-26T15:50:09.571122 [actor]: Yes, Ryan lives with me full-time. He's still at home while doing his apprenticeship.

2026-01-26T15:50:12.399805 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Ryan lives with you full-time.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You are responsible for Ryan, who is 17 and in approved education (a government-funded apprenticeship)
2. You live in the UK and are a British citizen
3. Your income is below the £50,000 threshold where the High Income Tax Charge would begin to apply
4. Ryan lives with you full-time

You should be eligible to receive Child Benefit until Ryan finishes his approved education or training program, or until he turns 20, whichever comes first.

Would you like me to explain how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:50:14.149465 [actor]: I appreciate you telling me I'm eligible. That's helpful to know I can get Child Benefit while Ryan is doing his apprenticeship. Yes, I would like to know how to apply for it please.

2026-01-26T15:50:16.898270 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user is eligible for Child Benefit since they care for a 17-year-old in a government-funded apprenticeship (approved education), live in the UK as a British citizen, earn below the £50,000 threshold, and the child lives with them full-time.
