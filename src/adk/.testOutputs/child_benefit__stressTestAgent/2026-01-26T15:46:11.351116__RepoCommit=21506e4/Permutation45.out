2026-01-26T16:05:18.508829 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to understand your situation better.

First, are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:05:19.628414 [actor]: I have a daughter who's 8 years old, so yes, I'm responsible for a child under 16.

2026-01-26T16:05:21.517700 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your 8-year-old daughter.

Does your daughter normally live with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:05:23.304175 [actor]: Well, my situation is a bit complicated. My daughter has been in the hospital for 14 weeks now. I visit her every single day and spend hours with her, but she hasn't been home during this time. The hospital is providing everything she needs - food, clothes, and care.

2026-01-26T16:05:27.409896 [root_agent]: I'm sorry to hear about your daughter's extended hospital stay. That must be a difficult situation for you both, and I appreciate you visiting her daily.

For Child Benefit purposes, your daughter's stay in the hospital doesn't affect your eligibility. Children who are in hospital temporarily are still considered as living with you for Child Benefit purposes, regardless of how long the hospital stay lasts.

May I ask if you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:05:29.627292 [actor]: Yes, I normally live in the UK. Our home is here, and that's where my daughter will return when she's released from the hospital. I'm just concerned because it's been quite a long time now - 14 weeks - and I wasn't sure if that changes anything.

2026-01-26T16:05:31.918148 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you normally live in the UK. 

I can assure you that the length of your daughter's hospital stay doesn't affect your Child Benefit eligibility. When a child is temporarily in hospital, they're still considered to be living with you for Child Benefit purposes, regardless of how long the hospital stay lasts.

May I ask if you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T16:05:33.209002 [actor]: No, my income is definitely below that amount. I make about £25,000 per year, and I'm a single parent.

2026-01-26T16:05:36.280269 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared:

1. You are responsible for your 8-year-old daughter
2. You and your daughter normally live in the UK
3. Your daughter's temporary hospital stay does not affect eligibility
4. You're a single parent with an income of around £25,000 per year, which is below the £60,000 threshold

Based on this information, you appear to be eligible for the full Child Benefit payment. Your daughter's hospital stay, regardless of its length, does not affect your eligibility as she is considered to be living with you for Child Benefit purposes.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T16:05:38.256858 [actor]: Are you sure that her being in the hospital for 14 weeks doesn't affect my eligibility? I don't actually spend any money on her while she's there because the hospital provides everything - food, clothes, and all her needs. I just visit her every day to keep her company. Does that make any difference?

2026-01-26T16:05:42.415976 [root_agent]: I understand your concern, and it's a good question. 

Yes, I'm certain that your daughter being in the hospital for 14 weeks doesn't affect your Child Benefit eligibility. According to UK government guidelines, when a child is temporarily in hospital, they are still considered to be living with you for Child Benefit purposes, regardless of how long the hospital stay lasts or the fact that the hospital is currently providing for her needs.

The key point is that this is a temporary arrangement, and your daughter would normally live with you. You're still her parent and responsible for her, and you're maintaining your relationship by visiting her daily. The fact that you're not currently paying for her immediate needs while she's in hospital doesn't change your eligibility.

When she returns home, you'll resume covering all her expenses, and Child Benefit helps support parents with these ongoing responsibilities.

2026-01-26T16:05:44.058580 [actor]: That's good to know. I wasn't sure if I needed to be buying things for her while she's in the hospital to qualify. So I can still claim Child Benefit even though I'm not spending money on her right now? I just want to make sure I'm doing everything correctly.

2026-01-26T16:05:47.806070 [root_agent]: Yes, you can absolutely still claim Child Benefit even though you're not currently spending money on your daughter while she's in hospital. You're doing everything correctly.

Child Benefit is designed to help with the costs of raising a child overall, not just immediate day-to-day expenses. While your daughter is temporarily in hospital, your entitlement to Child Benefit continues as normal.

The hospital stay is considered temporary, and your daughter is still regarded as living with you for Child Benefit purposes. The fact that the hospital is currently providing for her immediate needs doesn't affect your eligibility or entitlement.

You remain her parent and the person responsible for her, which is what matters for Child Benefit eligibility. When she returns home, you'll resume covering all her expenses directly, but your status as her parent and guardian hasn't changed during her hospital stay.

2026-01-26T16:05:50.604640 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that so clearly. I'm relieved to know I can still claim Child Benefit while my daughter is in the hospital, even though I'm not buying things for her right now. I'll go ahead with my application. This will really help when she comes home from the hospital.

2026-01-26T16:05:53.563757 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that a child temporarily in hospital is still considered living with the parent for Child Benefit purposes, regardless of the length of stay or that the hospital is currently providing for the child's needs.
