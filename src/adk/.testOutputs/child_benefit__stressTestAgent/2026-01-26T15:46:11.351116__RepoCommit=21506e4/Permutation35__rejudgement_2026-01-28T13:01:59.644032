2026-01-28T13:04:09.145314 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly stated the user was not eligible for Child Benefit. According to the exception rules provided, the user should be eligible since Rashid still lives with his parents, is still financially dependent on them, and they are not financially supporting his spouse (who is also a student). The expected outcome was "Eligible (via Exception)" but the agent communicated "not eligible".
