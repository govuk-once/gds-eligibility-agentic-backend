2026-01-26T15:51:24.707224 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To do this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you that you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T15:51:26.548941 [actor]: I'll help by role-playing as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hi there. Yes, I have a 6-year-old son named Noah. Well, he's not exactly living with me right now. He's staying with my mother - his grandmother - temporarily because I'm recovering from surgery. It's been a family emergency situation.

2026-01-26T15:51:27.978322 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand Noah is temporarily staying with your grandmother due to your health situation.

May I ask how long Noah has been staying with your grandmother, and is this arrangement intended to be temporary?

2026-01-26T15:51:29.691654 [actor]: Yes, Noah has been staying with my grandmother for about 6 weeks now. It's definitely a temporary arrangement - just while I'm recovering from my surgery. I expect him to come back home to live with me once I'm well enough to take care of him properly again.

2026-01-26T15:51:31.639494 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining. I understand Noah is temporarily staying with your grandmother for about 6 weeks while you recover from surgery, and he'll be returning to live with you once you're well enough.

Next question: Are you currently receiving any payment from your mother for looking after Noah?

2026-01-26T15:51:33.240008 [actor]: No, I'm not receiving any payment from my mother for looking after Noah. It's actually the opposite - she's helping me out by taking care of him temporarily while I recover. There's no money changing hands between us for his care.

2026-01-26T15:51:34.522359 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. That makes sense given the circumstances.

Could you tell me if Noah is a UK resident? Also, do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:51:35.727870 [actor]: Yes, Noah is definitely a UK resident. We both are. We've always lived here in the UK and this is our permanent home.

2026-01-26T15:51:36.917750 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both you and Noah are UK residents.

Is Noah in full-time education? At 6 years old, I assume he's attending primary school, but I'd like to confirm.

2026-01-26T15:51:38.664339 [actor]: Yes, Noah is in primary school. He's in Year 1 now. He's still attending the same school even while staying with my mother - she lives close enough to take him to his regular school.

2026-01-26T15:51:39.902156 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Noah is in primary school. That's helpful information.

May I ask if you or your partner (if you have one) earn over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:51:41.178363 [actor]: I'm a single mother, so there's no partner in the picture. And no, I definitely don't earn anywhere near £60,000 per year. My income is well below that amount.

2026-01-26T15:51:42.183975 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. 

Are you receiving any other benefits for Noah, such as Guardian's Allowance?

2026-01-26T15:51:43.618754 [actor]: No, I'm not receiving any Guardian's Allowance or any other specific benefits for Noah. I just wanted to check if I'm still eligible for Child Benefit while he's temporarily staying with my mother.

2026-01-26T15:51:47.581670 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying.

Based on the information you've provided, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit for Noah even while he's temporarily staying with your grandmother. This is because:

1. Noah is under 16 and in full-time education
2. You are both UK residents
3. Noah is temporarily staying with your mother due to your medical situation, but this is a temporary arrangement
4. You remain responsible for Noah, and no payments are being made between you and your mother for his care
5. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply

The temporary nature of the arrangement while you recover from surgery doesn't affect your eligibility. When a child stays temporarily with someone else, the person who normally cares for the child and is responsible for them can still receive Child Benefit.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit that you would like to know?

2026-01-26T15:51:50.661054 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm still eligible for Child Benefit while Noah is temporarily staying with my grandmother. That's a relief to hear. I was worried that because he's not physically living with me right now, I might lose the benefit, but I'm glad to know the temporary nature of the arrangement doesn't affect my eligibility. I don't have any other questions at the moment, this answers exactly what I needed to know.

2026-01-26T15:51:53.402812 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility during a temporary absence, confirming that the parent remains eligible when a child is temporarily staying with a relative due to the parent's medical situation.
