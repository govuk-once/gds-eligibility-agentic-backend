2026-01-26T15:57:02.819081 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you that you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T15:57:04.201194 [actor]: Hi there. My son Zahid doesn't live with me actually. He's 15 and lives with my sister, his aunt. I was wondering if I could still get Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-26T15:57:05.786311 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit regarding your son Zahid who lives with your sister, I need to ask a few more questions.

Since Zahid lives with your sister, does your sister currently receive Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-26T15:57:06.909784 [actor]: No, my sister doesn't claim any Child Benefit for Zahid. She's just looking after him but hasn't applied for any benefits.

2026-01-26T15:57:08.118465 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Do you financially support Zahid by contributing at least the same amount as the Child Benefit payment toward his upkeep or maintenance?

2026-01-26T15:57:09.567060 [actor]: I send £15 a week to my sister for Zahid's care. My mother, Zahid's grandmother, also sends another £15 a week to help out. So in total, our family is sending £30 a week to support him.

2026-01-26T15:57:12.887195 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining how you support Zahid financially.

Child Benefit is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, which means your individual contribution of £15 per week is less than the Child Benefit rate.

In cases where a child lives with someone else, you would typically need to contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate to be eligible to claim it. Since your personal contribution is below this amount, you likely wouldn't be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid.

Your sister, who has Zahid living with her, could potentially apply for Child Benefit instead, as she is caring for him. Would you like me to explain how she might apply?

2026-01-26T15:57:14.975077 [actor]: I'm a bit confused. I thought it might be the total family contribution that matters, not just mine personally. So even though my mother and I together send £30 a week, which is more than the Child Benefit amount, I still can't claim it? Does it have to be just from one person?

2026-01-26T15:57:18.328692 [root_agent]: I appreciate your question, and I understand the confusion.

You're right to seek clarification. When determining eligibility for Child Benefit when a child lives with someone else, the rules focus on individual contribution rather than combined family contributions.

According to the UK government guidelines, to qualify for Child Benefit for a child who lives with someone else, you personally would need to contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate toward the child's upkeep.

Since your individual contribution is £15 per week (which is less than the Child Benefit rate of £25.60 for the eldest or only child), you wouldn't meet this specific criterion, even though the combined family contribution with your mother exceeds the benefit amount.

In this situation, the person who has the child living with them (your sister) would typically be in the best position to claim Child Benefit for Zahid. Would you like me to explain more about how your sister might apply?

2026-01-26T15:57:20.287892 [actor]: I see, so I'm not eligible because my individual contribution is below the threshold. That makes sense now. Thank you for explaining this to me. I'll talk to my sister about applying instead since she's caring for Zahid. I appreciate your help with understanding the rules.

2026-01-26T15:57:22.979610 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent explained that to claim Child Benefit for a child living elsewhere, the individual must personally contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate (£25.60/week), and since the person only contributes £15/week individually, they are not eligible.
