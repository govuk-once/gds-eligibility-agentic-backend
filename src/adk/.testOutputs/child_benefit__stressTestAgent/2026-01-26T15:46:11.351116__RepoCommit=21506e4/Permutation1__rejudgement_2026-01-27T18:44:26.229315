2026-01-27T18:47:08.471495 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment. The agent correctly determined the family is eligible for Child Benefit based on all relevant criteria: child's age (8), living arrangements (with parents), UK nationals status, and income below the high-income threshold. The agent provided accurate information matching the expected outcome.
