2026-01-26T16:01:26.567505 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions to assess your eligibility according to UK government rules.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T16:01:28.807077 [actor]: I'll engage as a user who's unsure about Child Benefit eligibility, as described in the context.

Yes, I have my daughter Kelly living with me. She's 16 and just finished her GCSEs in June. I'm a bit worried about her benefit status because she's not technically in school right now during the summer break, but she has been accepted to start A-levels at the local college in September.

2026-01-26T16:01:31.119020 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Summer breaks don't affect your Child Benefit eligibility, so you don't need to worry about that period between GCSEs and starting A-levels.

Since your daughter is 16 and will be continuing her education with A-levels, this is relevant to your eligibility. 

May I ask if you are responsible for Kelly? By that I mean, are you her parent, guardian, or otherwise responsible for her care?

2026-01-26T16:01:32.792500 [actor]: Yes, I'm her mother, Joan. I've been raising her and she lives with me full-time. I've been receiving Child Benefit for her previously, but I was concerned about this gap between her finishing school and starting college in September.

2026-01-26T16:01:36.580644 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Joan. Since you're Kelly's mother, responsible for her care, and she lives with you full-time, you continue to meet that eligibility requirement.

For a child who is 16 or over, Child Benefit can continue if they stay in approved education or training. A-levels at college are considered approved education, so you remain eligible during this summer transition period between GCSEs and starting her A-levels.

The summer break is considered a normal part of education, so your Child Benefit payments should continue uninterrupted as long as Kelly does start her A-level course in September as planned.

May I ask if your income is over £60,000 per year? This is relevant because of the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-26T16:01:37.770185 [actor]: No, my income is well under £60,000 per year. I work part-time and earn about £24,000 annually.

2026-01-26T16:01:41.526712 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Joan. Since your income is around £24,000 per year, which is well below the £60,000 threshold, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge. This means you'll receive the full Child Benefit amount without having to pay any of it back through tax.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You are Kelly's mother and responsible for her care
- She's 16 and lives with you full-time
- She's continuing in approved education (A-levels)
- Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold

I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit, and your eligibility will continue while Kelly is studying for her A-levels. The payments should continue as normal through the summer break period.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement?

2026-01-26T16:01:43.799371 [actor]: That's wonderful news! I'm relieved to hear that the summer break won't affect her benefit and that it will continue while she's doing her A-levels. Thank you for confirming that I'm still eligible - that puts my mind at ease. I don't have any other questions right now about the Child Benefit.

2026-01-26T16:01:46.206219 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit continues during the summer break between GCSEs and A-levels, correctly assessed eligibility based on the child's age (16), education status, and the parent's income being below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
