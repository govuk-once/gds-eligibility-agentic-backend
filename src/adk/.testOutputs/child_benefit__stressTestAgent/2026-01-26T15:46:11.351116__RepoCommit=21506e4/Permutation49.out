2026-01-26T16:07:06.465179 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T16:07:07.755335 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user asking about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll respond to the agent's question based on the scenario provided.

Yes, I have my son Tom living with me. He's 17 years old.

2026-01-26T16:07:09.207054 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your son Tom. I'll continue asking questions to determine your eligibility.

Is Tom in approved education or training? For Child Benefit purposes, this typically means full-time education such as A-levels, NVQs, or similar qualifications.

2026-01-26T16:07:10.983734 [actor]: Tom is currently doing a computer coding course. It's not a traditional qualification like A-levels, but he has an agreement with a company that's paying for all his course fees. They've agreed to hire him once he completes the course. He doesn't get paid during the training though.

2026-01-26T16:07:13.246606 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about Tom's computer coding course.

For Child Benefit eligibility purposes, I need to understand more about this training. Is Tom's computer coding course considered an "approved training course"? Specifically, is it unpaid and arranged by a government department or agency? Examples of approved training include Foundation Apprenticeships, Training for Work, or courses arranged by the Department for Work and Pensions.

2026-01-26T16:07:15.087070 [actor]: No, it's not arranged by any government department. It's a private arrangement between Tom and this company. The company is paying for his training directly to the course provider, and they've promised him a job after he completes it. It's unpaid during the training period, but it's not a government scheme or anything like that.

2026-01-26T16:07:17.489035 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that information about Tom's training arrangement.

Based on what you've shared, Tom's computer coding course would not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes since it's not arranged by a government department or agency. 

For Child Benefit eligibility, young people aged 16 to 19 must be in what's defined as approved education (such as A-levels or equivalent qualifications) or approved training (government-arranged unpaid training).

Now I need to ask: Does Tom have any disabilities or health conditions?

2026-01-26T16:07:19.064727 [actor]: No, Tom doesn't have any disabilities or health conditions. He's healthy and is just focused on completing this coding course so he can start his job with the company afterward.

2026-01-26T16:07:22.861975 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Tom doesn't have any disabilities or health conditions.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to inform you that you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Tom. This is because:

1. Tom is 17 years old (over 16)
2. He is not in what's officially recognized as "approved education" (such as A-levels or equivalent qualifications)
3. He is not in "approved training" (as his coding course is a private arrangement, not a government-arranged program)
4. He doesn't have disabilities that would extend eligibility

Child Benefit typically stops on August 31st after a child turns 16, unless they continue in approved education or training, or have qualifying disabilities.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other potential support that might be available?

2026-01-26T16:07:25.538797 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that. It's disappointing to hear I'm not eligible anymore. I wasn't aware that his training wouldn't count since the company is paying for it. Is there any way to appeal this decision or any other benefits we might be eligible for since he's still living at home and I'm supporting him during his training?

2026-01-26T16:07:28.140002 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available for a 17-year-old in a private coding course not recognized as "approved education or training" by government standards.
