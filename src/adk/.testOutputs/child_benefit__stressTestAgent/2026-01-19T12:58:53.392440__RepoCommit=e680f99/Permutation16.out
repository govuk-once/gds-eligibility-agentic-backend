2026-01-19T13:05:57.876434 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T13:05:59.669685 [actor]: I need to play the role of someone in the situation described. I'll act as Hannah, who has a son currently receiving treatment in the USA.

2026-01-19T13:06:01.411085 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in your situation, Hannah. 

Is your son normally resident in the UK but temporarily receiving medical treatment in the USA?

2026-01-19T13:06:02.408766 [actor]: yes specialist treatment rare condition 15 weeks

2026-01-19T13:06:04.215255 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Hannah. I understand your son is receiving specialist treatment for a rare condition in the USA for 15 weeks.

Is your son under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:06:04.968221 [actor]: Oliver 14

2026-01-19T13:06:06.321706 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that your son Oliver is 14 years old.

Are you responsible for Oliver in the UK? By this I mean, are you normally caring for him when he's in the UK?

2026-01-19T13:06:07.173985 [actor]: yes responsible pay for costs visit when can

2026-01-19T13:06:08.704688 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're responsible for Oliver in the UK, including paying for costs and visiting him when possible.

Is either you or Oliver normally living in the UK? In other words, is the UK your normal place of residence?

2026-01-19T13:06:09.507876 [actor]: UK resident

2026-01-19T13:06:13.341913 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you're a UK resident.

Based on the information you've provided, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit while Oliver is temporarily receiving specialist medical treatment in the USA.

The rules state that Child Benefit can continue to be paid when a child is temporarily away from home for medical treatment. Since Oliver is normally resident in the UK but temporarily receiving treatment abroad, and you remain responsible for him, your Child Benefit should continue during this period.

If you're already receiving Child Benefit, it should continue during his treatment. If you haven't applied yet, you can do so as you meet the eligibility criteria.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement in this situation?

2026-01-19T13:06:17.033530 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility because they accurately informed Hannah that she remains eligible for Child Benefit while her son is temporarily receiving medical treatment abroad, as she is a UK resident responsible for her child who is normally resident in the UK.
