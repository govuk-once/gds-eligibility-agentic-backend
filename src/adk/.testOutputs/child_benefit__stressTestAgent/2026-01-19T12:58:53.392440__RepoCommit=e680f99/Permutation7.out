2026-01-19T13:01:14.758702 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children who live with you?

2026-01-19T13:01:16.282873 [actor]: I'm looking for child benefit for my son Jack. He's 14 but he's been in care for three months now. Still see him on weekends though.

2026-01-19T13:01:18.323295 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your son Jack. 

Since Jack is currently in care but you still see him on weekends, I need to understand more about your situation to determine your Child Benefit eligibility.

When a child goes into care, Child Benefit rules can be complex. Could you tell me if you were receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into care?

2026-01-19T13:01:19.490297 [actor]: Yes receiving child benefit before care. He comes home every Friday evening stays until Sunday evening.

2026-01-19T13:01:22.671583 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, since Jack is in care but regularly comes home to stay with you every weekend (Friday evening to Sunday evening), you may still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit.

According to the UK government guidelines, if your child is in residential care provided by a local authority, you can usually continue to get Child Benefit if your child regularly spends at least 24 hours with you, which appears to be the case with your weekend arrangements.

However, I need to ask: Has the local authority informed you of any changes to your Child Benefit entitlement since Jack went into care?

2026-01-19T13:01:24.009902 [actor]: No letters about benefit changes. Social worker mentioned something might change after 8 weeks in care.

2026-01-19T13:01:27.680195 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

The social worker was correct to mention potential changes. According to government guidelines, if your child has been in residential care provided by the local authority for more than 8 weeks, there can be implications for Child Benefit.

However, since Jack regularly comes home to stay with you every weekend for more than 24 hours (Friday evening to Sunday evening), you should still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit even though he's been in care for three months.

To confirm your ongoing eligibility, I would recommend that you contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them of Jack's current living arrangements. They can provide definitive guidance based on your specific circumstances.

May I ask if you've had any communication with the Child Benefit Office about Jack's care situation?

2026-01-19T13:01:28.651549 [actor]: Haven't called them yet. Need to know if I'm still eligible before I contact them.

2026-01-19T13:01:32.551915 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit for Jack. Since he regularly comes home to stay with you every weekend (Friday evening to Sunday evening) for more than 24 hours, this meets the criteria for maintaining eligibility even though he's been in residential care for three months.

According to the UK government guidelines, you can usually continue to receive Child Benefit if your child is in care provided by a local authority but regularly spends at least 24 hours with you, which is the case in your situation.

It's advisable to contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them of Jack's current circumstances. This ensures your records are up to date and confirms your continued eligibility. When you call them, explain the regular weekend arrangement you have with Jack, as this is the key factor in maintaining your eligibility.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-19T13:01:35.000998 [actor]: Thank you for confirming I'm still eligible for Child Benefit. Good to know the weekend visits mean I can keep receiving it even though Jack's been in care over 8 weeks.

2026-01-19T13:01:36.585585 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit because their child regularly spends more than 24 hours with them on weekends, despite being in care for three months.
