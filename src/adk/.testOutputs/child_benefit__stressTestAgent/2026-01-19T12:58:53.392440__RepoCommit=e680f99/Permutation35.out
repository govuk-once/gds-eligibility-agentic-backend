2026-01-19T13:13:19.966215 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility correctly, I'll need to ask you some questions.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T13:13:20.905235 [actor]: child benefit eligibility son married school

2026-01-19T13:13:22.142252 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I'll need to ask some more specific questions to determine your eligibility for Child Benefit.

Do you have a son who is living with you?

2026-01-19T13:13:23.081970 [actor]: yes son Rashid lives with us school A-levels

2026-01-19T13:13:23.985542 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son Rashid lives with you. 

How old is Rashid?

2026-01-19T13:13:24.820575 [actor]: Rashid 17 years old

2026-01-19T13:13:26.557392 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Rashid is 17 years old and studying A-levels, I need to confirm a few more details.

Is Rashid in approved education, such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs or similar full-time education?

2026-01-19T13:13:27.519315 [actor]: A-levels still studying

2026-01-19T13:13:28.907485 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Rashid is studying A-levels. 

Are you responsible for Rashid? By this I mean, do you pay for his accommodation, clothing, food, or other living costs?

2026-01-19T13:13:29.773425 [actor]: yes support him living our house

2026-01-19T13:13:31.405609 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you support Rashid and he lives in your house.

Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T13:13:32.398900 [actor]: no not earning that much

2026-01-19T13:13:35.746303 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. Your son Rashid is 17 years old and is in approved education (A-levels)
2. He lives with you and you're responsible for supporting him
3. Your income (and your partner's if applicable) is below the £60,000 threshold

Child Benefit can be paid for children under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training. Since Rashid is 17 and studying A-levels, he falls within this category.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T13:13:36.545642 [actor]: Rashid recently married his girlfriend moved in with us

2026-01-19T13:13:39.525923 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing this important information. This changes the assessment.

If Rashid is married, this affects his Child Benefit eligibility. Under UK rules, Child Benefit cannot be claimed for a child who is married or in a civil partnership, regardless of their age or education status.

Based on this new information, you would not be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Rashid since he is married, even though he is under 20 and in approved education.

Is there anything else you would like to know about this situation or any other benefits you might be eligible for?

2026-01-19T13:13:42.632145 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit cannot be claimed for a child who is married, regardless of their age or education status.
