2026-01-19T13:11:57.730699 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First question: Are you responsible for raising a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:11:58.553797 [actor]: john 17 at college

2026-01-19T13:12:02.168455 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit for John.

So you have a 17-year-old named John who is attending college. This is helpful information.

Since John is between 16 and 20 years old and in education, he may qualify as an eligible child for Child Benefit purposes. 

My next question is: Is John in approved education or training? By approved education, this typically means full-time education (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study) such as A-levels, BTECs, NVQs up to level 3, or similar approved courses.

2026-01-19T13:12:03.047376 [actor]: college resit GCSEs

2026-01-19T13:12:04.446990 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Are you responsible for John? This means you're either living with him and responsible for his care, or you're contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit toward his upkeep.

2026-01-19T13:12:05.331767 [actor]: Dad Pete John lives with

2026-01-19T13:12:07.081467 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. 

To make sure I understand correctly - it sounds like John lives with his dad Pete, and you're asking about Child Benefit eligibility. Is that right? Or are you Pete (John's dad) asking about your own eligibility to claim Child Benefit for John?

2026-01-19T13:12:07.678980 [actor]: Pete

2026-01-19T13:12:09.578557 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're Pete, John's dad.

Since John is 17, lives with you, and is resitting GCSEs at college (which counts as approved education), this helps establish potential eligibility.

My next question is: Do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-19T13:12:10.341834 [actor]: yes UK

2026-01-19T13:12:12.106149 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Next question: Is there anyone else who might have a stronger claim to Child Benefit for John? For example, another parent or guardian who has John living with them for more days of the week?

2026-01-19T13:12:12.858480 [actor]: just me

2026-01-19T13:12:14.810903 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're the sole guardian responsible for John.

Next question: Do you have an individual income over £60,000 per year? (This affects whether you'll need to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.)

2026-01-19T13:12:15.629267 [actor]: no earn less than that

2026-01-19T13:12:20.329396 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information about your income.

Based on all the information you've shared:

1. You're Pete, responsible for your son John who lives with you
2. John is 17 years old and attending college to resit GCSEs (which qualifies as approved education)
3. You live in the UK
4. You're the only person claiming responsibility for John
5. Your income is below £60,000 per year

I can confirm that you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for John. Since John is over 16 but under 20 and in approved education (resitting GCSEs at college), and you're responsible for him, you meet the key eligibility criteria.

You can claim Child Benefit by filling out form CH2, which is available on the government website, and submitting it to the Child Benefit Office. Since John is already 17, you would need to provide evidence of his education.

Would you like any specific information about the application process or payment amounts?

2026-01-19T13:12:21.241286 [actor]: about college 6 hours a week studying

2026-01-19T13:12:25.469887 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing this important detail about John's studies. 

This changes my assessment. For approved education, the UK government typically requires that the child or young person is in education for more than 12 hours per week of supervised study.

Since you mentioned John is only studying for 6 hours per week at college, this unfortunately doesn't meet the criteria for "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes. For young people aged 16-19, they need to be in education or training for at least 12 hours per week to qualify.

Based on this information, it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for John, as his current education arrangement doesn't meet the minimum hour requirement for approved education.

Is there any possibility that John's study hours might increase to at least 12 hours per week in the near future?

2026-01-19T13:12:27.510737 [actor]: I understand now. Since my son John is only studying 6 hours per week at college for his GCSE resits, and this is below the minimum 12 hours of supervised study required to qualify as "approved education," I am not eligible for Child Benefit for him. 

2026-01-19T13:12:30.207136 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately concluded that Pete is not eligible for Child Benefit since John's 6 hours of weekly study doesn't meet the minimum 12 hours required for approved education for 16-20 year olds.
