2026-01-19T13:10:26.330210 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:10:27.962450 [actor]: I need to understand your situation better to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Based on what you've shared, I'll assume the role of someone inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

I have baby. 15 years old myself. Live with parents.

2026-01-19T13:10:30.255713 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that you're 15 years old, you have a baby, and you live with your parents.

Since you're under 16 yourself, I need to understand your situation a bit better to determine Child Benefit eligibility. 

Are you the main person responsible for the care of your baby, or are your parents taking primary responsibility for your baby's care?

2026-01-19T13:10:31.280009 [actor]: baby care myself. parents help sometimes. want own benefit claim.

2026-01-19T13:10:34.806485 [root_agent]: I understand you're primarily caring for your baby yourself, with some help from your parents, and you'd like to know if you can make your own Child Benefit claim.

Yes, you can claim Child Benefit even though you're 15 years old. There's no minimum age requirement to claim Child Benefit, and since you're the main person caring for your baby, you're eligible to claim.

The payment is usually around £25.60 per week for your first child, which can be paid directly into your bank account every 4 weeks.

To apply, you'll need to fill out a CH2 claim form. You'll also need to register your baby's birth before claiming if that hasn't been done already.

Would you like me to explain how the payment works or how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T13:10:35.649659 [actor]: eligible? bank account details

2026-01-19T13:10:39.029763 [root_agent]: Yes, you are eligible for Child Benefit as the main person responsible for caring for your baby, regardless of your age.

Regarding bank account details, you'll need to have your own bank account to receive Child Benefit payments. The payments will be made directly into your bank account every 4 weeks.

If you don't have your own bank account yet, you may need to open one. Some banks offer accounts for people under 16, though you might need a parent or guardian to help you open one.

When you apply for Child Benefit using the CH2 form, you'll need to provide your bank account details including:
- The account holder name
- Bank/building society name
- Account number
- Sort code

Is there anything specific about the bank account requirements you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-19T13:10:42.720206 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately stated that there is no minimum age requirement to claim Child Benefit and correctly advised that as the main carer for her baby, the 15-year-old is eligible to claim.
