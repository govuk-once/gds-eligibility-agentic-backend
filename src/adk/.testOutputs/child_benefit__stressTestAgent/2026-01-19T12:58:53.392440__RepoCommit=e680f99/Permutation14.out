2026-01-19T13:05:10.116848 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children who live with you?

2026-01-19T13:05:10.935841 [actor]: Child benefit

2026-01-19T13:05:12.010385 [root_agent]: Thank you for your interest in Child Benefit. To determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK, I need to ask you some questions.

Do you have any children who live with you?

2026-01-19T13:05:13.054324 [actor]: My son Noah currently with grandmother

2026-01-19T13:05:14.623115 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that your son Noah is currently staying with his grandmother. 

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask if you're responsible for Noah even though he's staying with his grandmother? By responsible, I mean providing for his day-to-day care and/or financially supporting him.

2026-01-19T13:05:15.485192 [actor]: Responsible yes Noah 6 years old surgery recovery

2026-01-19T13:05:18.321706 [root_agent]: I understand that you're responsible for Noah, who is 6 years old and is staying with his grandmother while recovering from surgery. Thank you for sharing this information.

Based on UK government guidelines, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit even if your child is temporarily staying with someone else, as long as you remain responsible for them.

Could you tell me if you normally live in the UK? (This is another factor in determining eligibility)

2026-01-19T13:05:19.366372 [actor]: UK resident yes

2026-01-19T13:05:20.587825 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are a UK resident.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for Noah?

2026-01-19T13:05:21.505514 [actor]: No grandmother not claiming

2026-01-19T13:05:23.589451 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Noah's grandmother is not claiming Child Benefit for him.

Next question: Does your individual income exceed £60,000 per year? (This affects whether you would have to pay a High Income Child Benefit Charge, though you can still claim and choose to waive payment if your income is between £50,000-£60,000).

2026-01-19T13:05:24.393336 [actor]: No not earning that much

2026-01-19T13:05:27.084956 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your income situation.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you are likely eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You are responsible for your 6-year-old son Noah
2. You are a UK resident
3. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Noah
4. Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold

Even though Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother while recovering from surgery, this doesn't affect your eligibility as you remain responsible for him.

Would you like me to explain how to apply for Child Benefit or provide any other information about the benefit?

2026-01-19T13:05:29.262502 [actor]: Yes Noah at grandmother for 6 weeks only temporary

2026-01-19T13:05:30.634188 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that temporary stays with a grandmother while recovering from surgery doesn't affect eligibility when the parent remains responsible for the child.
