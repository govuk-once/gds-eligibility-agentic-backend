2026-01-19T13:04:12.343272 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T13:04:13.332413 [actor]: child benefit eligibility need money son lives with me

2026-01-19T13:04:14.553073 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I understand your son lives with you and you're interested in Child Benefit eligibility.

How old is your son?

2026-01-19T13:04:15.365855 [actor]: 18 A-levels

2026-01-19T13:04:16.689916 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son is 18 and studying A-levels.

Is your son in approved education, such as A-levels at a school or college, or is he in approved training?

2026-01-19T13:04:17.536322 [actor]: a-levels school yes

2026-01-19T13:04:18.940319 [root_agent]: I understand your son is 18 and studying A-levels at school, which counts as approved education.

Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-19T13:04:19.653228 [actor]: jessica 40 uk yes

2026-01-19T13:04:21.110161 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Jessica.

Do you earn over £60,000 a year (individual income, not household)?

2026-01-19T13:04:21.858258 [actor]: no income less

2026-01-19T13:04:25.260192 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your income is less than £60,000.

Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You live in the UK
2. Your son is 18 and in approved education (A-levels)
3. Your son lives with you
4. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold

Child Benefit is usually paid until August 31st after your child turns 16, but continues until they're 20 if they stay in approved education or training, which applies in your case with your son studying A-levels.

You can claim £24.00 per week for your eldest or only child, and the payments are usually made every 4 weeks.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T13:04:26.128418 [actor]: liam universal credit has

2026-01-19T13:04:28.982600 [root_agent]: I understand that Liam receives Universal Credit. This is helpful information.

Child Benefit can be claimed alongside Universal Credit, and they are separate benefits. In fact, claiming Child Benefit can sometimes increase your Universal Credit entitlement as it shows you are responsible for a child.

Child Benefit won't reduce your Universal Credit payments - they're calculated separately. So if you're eligible for Child Benefit (which it appears you are based on what you've told me), you can claim it while receiving Universal Credit.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T13:04:29.798147 [actor]: universal credit liam gets himself

2026-01-19T13:04:33.429873 [root_agent]: I appreciate the clarification. I understand that Liam (your son) receives Universal Credit himself, not you.

This is important information. Since your son is 18 and receiving Universal Credit in his own name, this suggests he may be considered financially independent.

For Child Benefit purposes, if your son is claiming Universal Credit in his own right, this could affect your Child Benefit claim. Typically, Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for a child under 16 or under 20 if they're in approved education.

Since your son is 18 and appears to be managing his own benefits, I should ask: Is your son still financially dependent on you despite receiving his own Universal Credit? Do you still provide his main home and support most of his living costs?

2026-01-19T13:04:34.247078 [actor]: lives with me but his money

2026-01-19T13:04:38.337265 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand your son lives with you but manages his own money through Universal Credit.

This is an important point for Child Benefit eligibility. Since your son is 18, in approved education (A-levels), and lives in your home, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit even if he receives his own Universal Credit.

The key factor is that you are still providing his main home and he's in approved education. The fact that he has some financial independence through Universal Credit doesn't automatically disqualify you from receiving Child Benefit for him.

However, if your son has left regular education or is working more than 24 hours per week alongside his studies, this could affect eligibility.

Would you like me to explain how to apply for Child Benefit or would you like to know any other specifics about your eligibility?

2026-01-19T13:04:39.342297 [actor]: his own benefit universal credit

2026-01-19T13:04:43.332118 [root_agent]: I appreciate your clarification. The fact that your son receives his own Universal Credit is important to consider.

Based on the rules for Child Benefit, eligibility can be affected when a young person claims benefits in their own right. Since your son is 18 and receiving Universal Credit independently, this typically indicates he's being treated as an adult by the benefits system.

In general, you cannot claim Child Benefit for a child who is claiming income-related benefits (such as Universal Credit) in their own right. This is because the system considers them to be financially independent, even if they still live with you.

Therefore, while your son meets some eligibility criteria (being under 20 and in approved education), the fact that he receives his own Universal Credit likely means you would not be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit or alternative support that might be available to you?

2026-01-19T13:04:46.781191 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Child Benefit cannot be claimed for a child who is receiving Universal Credit in their own right, as this indicates financial independence from the parent.
