First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years of age, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:14:29.775950 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you have a 4-month-old baby. 

Does this baby live with you? (This helps determine if you have responsibility for the child)
