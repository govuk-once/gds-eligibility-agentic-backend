2026-01-19T12:59:35.795710 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:59:36.907519 [actor]: child benefit 17 year old son left school looking for apprenticeship

2026-01-19T12:59:39.668579 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context about your situation. 

To clarify, you have a 17-year-old son who has left school and is currently looking for an apprenticeship. This is relevant to your Child Benefit eligibility.

Is your son currently registered with a careers service, Connexions (in some areas), or local authority to find:
- work or apprenticeship training
- or has he made arrangements through their school or college for any work or training?

2026-01-19T12:59:40.653264 [actor]: yes registered with careers service in August after leaving school in June

2026-01-19T12:59:43.502692 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared, your 17-year-old son has left school in June and registered with a careers service in August, which is good news for your Child Benefit eligibility.

Child Benefit can continue for children aged 16-19 who have left education but are registered with an approved education provider, careers service, Connexions, or local authority seeking work or training. This period is allowed for up to 20 weeks after leaving education.

Do you normally live in the UK? (This is another eligibility factor for Child Benefit.)

2026-01-19T12:59:44.240429 [actor]: UK Birmingham

2026-01-19T12:59:45.528694 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK, specifically in Birmingham.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-19T12:59:46.507245 [actor]: no income 28k

2026-01-19T12:59:49.325144 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. With your income being £28,000, you're below the £50,000 threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would begin to apply.

Based on the information you've provided so far:
- You have a 17-year-old son who left school in June
- He registered with a careers service in August (within the required timeframe)
- You live in the UK (Birmingham)
- Your income is below the £50,000 threshold

One more question: Is your son living with you? Or is he living with someone else?

2026-01-19T12:59:50.203036 [actor]: lives with me

2026-01-19T12:59:54.362785 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son lives with you.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit for your 17-year-old son. You meet the key criteria:

1. Your son is under 20 and has registered with a careers service after leaving education
2. This registration was within the required timeframe (20 weeks after leaving education)
3. You live in the UK
4. Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold
5. Your son lives with you, meaning you have responsibility for him

You should continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when your son left education in June, provided he remains registered with the careers service and is looking for work or an apprenticeship during this time.

If your son starts an approved training or education program, you may be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit beyond this period, so it would be worth updating HMRC if his circumstances change.

2026-01-19T12:59:56.218421 [actor]: Thank you for confirming my eligibility for Child Benefit. I understand I can continue receiving it for up to 20 weeks after my son left education in June, as long as he stays registered with the careers service while looking for an apprenticeship.

2026-01-19T12:59:58.800728 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit would continue for up to 20 weeks after the 17-year-old left education in June, as the son is registered with a careers service and meets all other eligibility criteria.
