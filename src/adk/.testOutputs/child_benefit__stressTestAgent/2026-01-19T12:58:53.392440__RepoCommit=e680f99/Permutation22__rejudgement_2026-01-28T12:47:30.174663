2026-01-28T12:54:20.849709 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly stated the user is eligible for Child Benefit. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)" because the child has been in hospital for a cumulative 13 weeks (10+3) with less than 28 days between stays (only 15 days), which exceeds the 12-week eligibility limit.
