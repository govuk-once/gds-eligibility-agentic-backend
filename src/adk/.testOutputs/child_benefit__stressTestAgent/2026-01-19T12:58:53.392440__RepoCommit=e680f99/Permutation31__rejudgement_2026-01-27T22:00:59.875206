2026-01-27T22:07:20.258321 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment but for a different reason. The agent incorrectly stated that university education qualifies as "approved education" when it's actually classified as "advanced education." Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education such as a university degree, regardless of age, so the correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
