2026-01-19T13:11:01.235377 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. To make this assessment, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T13:11:02.047858 [actor]: jordan living with dad

2026-01-19T13:11:03.815187 [root_agent]: I notice you've mentioned Jordan living with their dad. To understand your eligibility for Child Benefit better, I need to clarify your relationship to the child.

Are you the father that Jordan is living with, or are you inquiring about Child Benefit in relation to Jordan who lives with their father (not you)?

2026-01-19T13:11:04.723578 [actor]: steve dad jordan in house

2026-01-19T13:11:06.420714 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand you are Steve, the father, and Jordan lives with you in your house.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask how old Jordan is?

2026-01-19T13:11:07.237131 [actor]: jordan 17 years

2026-01-19T13:11:08.453734 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Jordan is 17 years old and lives with you.

Is Jordan currently in full-time education or approved training?

2026-01-19T13:11:09.261826 [actor]: no school no work no training

2026-01-19T13:11:12.760795 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared, I need to inform you that Jordan would not qualify for Child Benefit in this situation.

Child Benefit can be paid for children under 16, or for those aged 16 to 19 who are in approved education or training. Since Jordan is 17 and not in education or approved training, they wouldn't meet the eligibility requirements.

If Jordan's circumstances change in the future and they return to approved education or training before they turn 20, you could then become eligible to claim Child Benefit for them.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-19T13:11:16.197274 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit isn't available since Jordan is 17 years old and not in education or training, which aligns with the official eligibility criteria.
