Per the gov.uk guidance, when someone contributes financially to a child's upkeep with an amount exceeding the Child Benefit rate (which this person does at £150/month vs. £113/month), they can claim Child Benefit if no one else is claiming it for that child (which is the case here as the ex-wife is not claiming).
