2026-01-27T22:07:38.477688 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The expected outcome was "Eligible" but the agent concluded the user was not eligible to claim Child Benefit. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit typically goes to the person with day-to-day care responsibility (the ex-wife), but this contradicts the expected outcome provided.
