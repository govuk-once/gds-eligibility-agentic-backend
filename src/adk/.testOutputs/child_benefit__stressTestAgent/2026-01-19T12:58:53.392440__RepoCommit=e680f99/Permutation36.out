2026-01-19T13:13:44.330553 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your situation.

Do you currently have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:13:46.192422 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user in this situation about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the rules to be obtuse, speak like I'm using search terms, and not directly answer questions.

Kelly daughter sixteen finished school college September

2026-01-19T13:13:47.901456 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you're mentioning Kelly, who may be your daughter, is sixteen and finished school, and there's something about college in September.

To clarify your situation better, may I ask: Are you currently responsible for caring for Kelly, who is 16 years old?

2026-01-19T13:13:48.846399 [actor]: Yes care for Kelly live at home worried about money summer gap

2026-01-19T13:13:51.274663 [root_agent]: I understand that you care for Kelly who is 16 years old, she lives at home with you, and you're concerned about finances during a summer gap period.

To help determine your Child Benefit eligibility, could you please tell me if Kelly will be starting approved education or training in September? By approved, I mean things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other qualifying education.

2026-01-19T13:13:52.506046 [actor]: A levels college acceptance letter already got it waiting until September worried about benefit stops now

2026-01-19T13:13:56.251978 [root_agent]: I understand your concern. Kelly is 16, has completed school, has an acceptance letter for A-levels at college starting in September, and you're worried about Child Benefit stopping during this summer gap.

Based on the UK government guidelines, you should remain eligible for Child Benefit during this summer gap. Child Benefit can continue for a child who is 16 if they're going to continue in approved education (such as A-levels) or training. The benefit typically extends through the summer period between school and college when they have been accepted into approved education.

You don't need to notify HMRC of this gap if Kelly will be starting approved education in September and you already have confirmation of her place.

Is there anything specific about your Child Benefit situation that you're concerned about regarding this transition period?

2026-01-19T13:13:57.561890 [actor]: So benefit continues August until college starts?

2026-01-19T13:13:59.686783 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. Your Child Benefit should continue through August until Kelly starts college in September. The benefit doesn't stop during this summer gap period between finishing school and starting A-levels in September, as long as Kelly has been accepted into this approved education.

You won't need to make any special applications for this transition period. The Child Benefit will continue automatically during the summer months before Kelly begins her A-level studies at college.

2026-01-19T13:14:01.135960 [actor]: Thanks that's what I needed to know

2026-01-19T13:14:03.640593 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit continues during the summer gap between finishing school and starting approved education (A-levels) for a 16-year-old with confirmed college acceptance.
