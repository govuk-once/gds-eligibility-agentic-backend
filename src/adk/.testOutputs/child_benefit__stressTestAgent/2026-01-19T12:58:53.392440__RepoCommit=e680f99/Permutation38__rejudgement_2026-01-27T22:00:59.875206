2026-01-27T22:08:14.393310 [confirmation_judge]: I'll review this transcript carefully to determine if I agree with the judge's assessment.

The transcript is incomplete as it doesn't show the full conversation or the final judgment by the evaluation judge. I can only see the beginning of a conversation where the agent asks about the child's age (learning it's 4 months old) and whether the child lives with the person. The conversation doesn't reach a conclusion about eligibility or address the backdating issue, which is critical to the expected outcome.

Since I don't see the judge's assessment (with either a ✓ or ✗) or the agent's final determination regarding the claim being eligible only for the last 3 months, I cannot evaluate whether I agree with the judgment.

☹ I cannot make an assessment because the transcript is incomplete - it doesn't show the full conversation or the judge's final decision, nor does it address the key issue of 3-month backdating limitation.
