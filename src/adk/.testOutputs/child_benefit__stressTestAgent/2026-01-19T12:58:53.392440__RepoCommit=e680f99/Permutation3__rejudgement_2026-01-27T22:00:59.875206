The agent correctly determined that Gary is eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks after Ben left education in June, which matches the expected outcome. The agent verified all relevant criteria including Ben's registration with a careers service, Gary's UK residency, income below threshold, and that Ben lives with him.
