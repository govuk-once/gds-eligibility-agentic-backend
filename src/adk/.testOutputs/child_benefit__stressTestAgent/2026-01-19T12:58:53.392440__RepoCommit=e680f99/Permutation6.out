2026-01-19T13:00:56.474801 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To do this, I'll need to ask you several questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T13:00:57.382832 [actor]: child hospital Chloe 14 weeks

2026-01-19T13:00:59.030887 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand your child Chloe is 14 weeks old and is in hospital.

Is Chloe your child, and would she normally live with you when not in hospital?

2026-01-19T13:01:00.028368 [actor]: Chloe 6 years old hospital stay 14 weeks visit daily

2026-01-19T13:01:01.404605 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that Chloe is 6 years old, has been in hospital for 14 weeks, and you visit her daily.

When Chloe is not in hospital, does she normally live with you?

2026-01-19T13:01:02.247756 [actor]: Yes my daughter lives with me when not hospital

2026-01-19T13:01:05.553886 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Chloe normally lives with you when she's not in hospital.

Based on the information you've provided, you may be eligible for Child Benefit since:

1. You have responsibility for a child (Chloe, age 6)
2. She normally lives with you when not in hospital
3. Children who are in hospital temporarily still qualify for Child Benefit as long as you're contributing to their maintenance and you visit them regularly, which you've indicated you do by visiting daily

To maintain your Child Benefit eligibility while Chloe is in hospital, you should continue your regular visits and contribute to her care as you've been doing.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T13:01:06.574126 [actor]: buy books pyjamas food £30 weekly

2026-01-19T13:01:09.930171 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. 

The fact that you're contributing £30 weekly to buy books, pyjamas, and food for Chloe while she's in hospital further supports your eligibility for Child Benefit. These contributions demonstrate that you're maintaining financial responsibility for her needs during her hospital stay.

Based on all the information you've shared, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit as you:
- Have responsibility for Chloe (your 6-year-old daughter)
- She normally lives with you when not in hospital
- You're maintaining regular contact through daily visits
- You're contributing financially to her care (£30 weekly for books, pyjamas, and food)

Would you like information about how to claim Child Benefit if you haven't already, or is there anything else about your eligibility you'd like me to address?

2026-01-19T13:01:13.406265 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately stated that the user is eligible for Child Benefit since their child is temporarily in hospital, they maintain regular contact through daily visits, and contribute financially to the child's care.
