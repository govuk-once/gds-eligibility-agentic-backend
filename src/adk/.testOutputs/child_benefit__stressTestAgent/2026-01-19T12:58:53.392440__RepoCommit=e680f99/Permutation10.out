2026-01-19T13:02:41.169465 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you one question at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:02:42.167878 [actor]: Child benefit fostered child 12 years

2026-01-19T13:02:55.248411 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You mentioned a fostered child who is 12 years old. To better understand your situation and determine eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask: Are you a foster carer for this 12-year-old child through a local authority (council) or private fostering arrangement?

2026-01-19T13:02:56.074229 [actor]: Foster local council placed with me

2026-01-19T13:02:59.018725 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that the child is placed with you by the local council as a foster carer.

In this case, I need to inform you that you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for a foster child placed with you by a local authority. The local authority is responsible for providing financial support for the child through fostering allowances instead.

Child Benefit is generally not available for children who are looked after by a local authority, which includes children placed with foster carers through council arrangements. The fostering allowance you receive from the local authority is designed to cover the costs of caring for the child.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about foster care financial support or other benefits you might be eligible for?

2026-01-19T13:03:00.397449 [actor]: Yes local council pays allowance not eligible for benefit

2026-01-19T13:03:02.598990 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that foster carers who have children placed with them by a local authority are not eligible for Child Benefit as they receive fostering allowances instead.
