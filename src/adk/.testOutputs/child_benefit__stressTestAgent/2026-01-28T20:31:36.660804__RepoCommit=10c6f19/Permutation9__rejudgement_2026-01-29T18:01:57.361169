**Justification:**

While there was an error in the agent's reasoning process, I need to assess whether the agent communicated the correct **eligibility outcome** compared to the expected outcome.

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** "Unfortunately, you are likely NOT eligible for Child Benefit at this time" - Not Eligible

The agent explicitly told the user they are "likely NOT eligible" and explained they would need to start working first to become eligible. This outcome directly contradicts the expected outcome of "Eligible."

However, upon reviewing the Gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), I need to verify the Pre-Settled Status jobseeker provisions. The scenario states that Lars "has Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme" and "is currently unemployed but actively looking for work and has registered as a jobseeker" and that he "fits this category" for having a qualifying right to reside.

The agent determined the user was NOT eligible, while the expected outcome indicates they ARE eligible. The evaluation judge correctly identified that registered jobseekers with pre-settled status who are genuinely seeking work can have a right to reside for Child Benefit purposes without needing prior UK work history.

**Therefore, the agent communicated an eligibility outcome (Not Eligible) that does NOT agree with the expected outcome (Eligible).**
