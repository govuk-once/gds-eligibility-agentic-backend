2026-01-28T20:34:57.689705 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:34:59.345315 [actor]: son 14 stays weekends fridy to sunday

2026-01-28T20:35:01.208413 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old son who stays with you on weekends from Friday to Sunday.

Let me ask you an important follow-up question:

**Where does your son live during the rest of the week (Monday to Thursday)?**

2026-01-28T20:35:02.463315 [actor]: local authority care 3 months now

2026-01-28T20:35:04.883897 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. So your son has been in local authority care for 3 months and stays with you on weekends.

This is an important factor for eligibility. Let me ask you:

**Are you contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards the cost of looking after your son? (For example, through regular payments to support his care or maintenance.)**

2026-01-28T20:35:06.354745 [actor]: i dont pay anythng just he comes home weekeds

2026-01-28T20:35:08.129030 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. 

Let me ask another important question to understand your situation better:

**Does anyone else currently claim Child Benefit for your son? (This could be the local authority, a foster carer, or another family member.)**

2026-01-28T20:35:09.598781 [actor]: no one else claming just me want to know if i can

2026-01-28T20:35:12.082456 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you one more key question:

**Are you the person who is mainly responsible for your son - meaning, even though he's in local authority care during the week, are you still actively involved in his upbringing and he regularly stays with you on weekends as part of an arrangement?**

2026-01-28T20:35:13.540471 [actor]: yes im his father he comes home every weekend friday and sunday nights

2026-01-28T20:35:17.766835 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your situation based on what you've told me.

Based on the eligibility rules, I need to inform you that **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation**.

Here's why:

When a child is in local authority care (even if it's temporary), and you're not contributing at least the equivalent amount of Child Benefit towards their care costs, you cannot claim Child Benefit for that child. The fact that your son stays with you on weekends is positive for maintaining your relationship, but it doesn't change the eligibility rules when a child is being looked after by the local authority during the week.

**However**, if your situation changes - for example:
- If your son comes back to live with you full-time, or
- If you start making regular financial contributions toward his care that equal or exceed the Child Benefit amount

Then you could potentially become eligible at that point.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T20:35:23.501846 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to GOV.UK guidance, a person can claim Child Benefit for a child in local authority care if they are contributing to the cost of looking after the child at least the amount of Child Benefit, OR if the child lives with them for part of the week. The child stays with the user every weekend (Friday to Sunday), which constitutes living with them for part of the week, making them eligible via this exception even without financial contributions.
