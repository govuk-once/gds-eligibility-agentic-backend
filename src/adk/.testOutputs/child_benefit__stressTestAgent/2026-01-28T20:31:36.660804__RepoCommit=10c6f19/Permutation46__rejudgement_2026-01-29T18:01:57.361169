**Justification:**

I disagree with the original evaluation judge's assessment. After careful review of the transcript and UK Child Benefit eligibility rules, the agent actually communicated an **incorrect outcome** that does **not** align with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Expired)."

**Key Analysis:**

1. **The Scenario Context**: Hans has Pre-Settled Status and has been claiming Child Benefit as a "Jobseeker" for 95 days, which exceeds the 91-day limit for jobseekers without a genuine prospect of work or job offer.

2. **Right to Reside Requirements**: According to the scenario's criteria, after 91 days as a jobseeker without a job offer or other resources, the right to reside for benefit purposes expires. The user has been job-seeking for 95 days with no job offers.

3. **Agent's Determination**: The agent told the user "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and stated that "Your employment status (currently looking for work) does not affect your eligibility."

4. **The Error**: The agent failed to recognize that:
   - The 91-day jobseeker limit had been exceeded (95 days vs. 91-day limit)
   - Without a genuine prospect of work/job offer, the right to reside expires
   - The user should be "Not Eligible (Expired)"

The original judge correctly identified this as a failure (✗), noting the agent "incorrectly determined my eligibility." Therefore, I agree with that assessment - the agent communicated the wrong outcome.
