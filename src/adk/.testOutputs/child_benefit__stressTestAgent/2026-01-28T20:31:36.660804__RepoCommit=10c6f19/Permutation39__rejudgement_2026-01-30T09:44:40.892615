**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome.

**Key factors the agent identified correctly:**

1. **Responsibility criterion**: The agent confirmed the children (aged 6 and 8) live with the user and are cared for by them
2. **Age criterion**: Both children are under 16, meeting the basic eligibility requirement
3. **Adopted children**: The agent correctly stated that adopted children qualify for Child Benefit just like biological children
4. **No duplicate claims**: The agent verified no one else is claiming Child Benefit for these children
5. **Adoption Allowance**: Most importantly, the agent correctly advised that "the council allowance you receive for their special needs should not prevent you from claiming Child Benefit - these are separate benefits"

This last point is crucial to the scenario. The agent correctly distinguished that an Adoption Allowance (unlike a fostering allowance) does not disqualify someone from receiving Child Benefit. According to gov.uk guidance, fostering allowances typically cover full maintenance and would prevent Child Benefit claims, but adoption allowances are different.

The agent's conclusion that the user "should be eligible for Child Benefit for your two adopted children" directly aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
