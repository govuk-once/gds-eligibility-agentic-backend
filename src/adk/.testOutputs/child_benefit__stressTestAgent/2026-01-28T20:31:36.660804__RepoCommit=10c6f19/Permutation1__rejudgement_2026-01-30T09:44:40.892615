**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Eligible for Child Benefit

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible

**Analysis:**

The agent systematically gathered information about all relevant eligibility criteria:

1. **Child's age and education status:** Confirmed the child is 8 years old (under 16) and attending school ✓
2. **Living arrangements:** Confirmed the child lives with the applicant in Manchester ✓
3. **Responsibility:** Confirmed the applicant has main responsibility for the child's care ✓
4. **Immigration/residency:** Confirmed both parents are UK nationals with no immigration restrictions ✓
5. **High Income Child Benefit Charge:** The agent appropriately mentioned the £60,000 threshold as a consideration (though income details weren't explicitly discussed, the agent correctly noted this wouldn't affect eligibility to claim)

The agent clearly communicated: "**you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**" and provided a comprehensive summary of why the user meets the criteria.

This outcome aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of **Eligible** based on the permutation scenario where:
- Child is 8 years old (under 16) ✓
- Child lives with parents ✓
- Parents are UK nationals ✓
- Parents have responsibility for the child ✓
- Highest individual income (£35,000) is below the £60,000 HICBC threshold ✓

**Judgement:** 👍

The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome.
