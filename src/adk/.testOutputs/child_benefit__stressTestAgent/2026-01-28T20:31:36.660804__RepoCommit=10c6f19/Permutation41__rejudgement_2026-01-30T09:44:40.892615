**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible for Child Benefit for either Ben or Jerry**. However, according to the expected outcome, the user should be:
- **Eligible for Ben (Full Rate)**
- **Not Eligible for Jerry**

The scenario describes a specific provision where HMRC can consider **unequal splitting** of contributions. The user pays £40 per week total, which can be allocated as:
- £26.05 to Ben (exceeding Ben's threshold of £25.60, making him eligible)
- £13.95 to Jerry (falling short of Jerry's threshold of £16.95, making him ineligible)

The agent failed to:
1. Recognize that contributing at least the Child Benefit amount for a child who doesn't live with you CAN make you eligible (contrary to what the agent repeatedly stated)
2. Explore the option of unequal allocation of the £40 contribution
3. Explain that the user could request HMRC to allocate contributions unequally between children

The agent incorrectly insisted throughout the conversation that "Child Benefit can only be claimed by the person the child lives with" without acknowledging the contribution-based exception mentioned in the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else.

The communicated outcome (not eligible for either child) does NOT agree with the expected outcome (eligible for Ben, not eligible for Jerry).
