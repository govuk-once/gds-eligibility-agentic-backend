**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and the official guidance, the user **is eligible**.

**Key Points:**

1. **The user does not live with the child** - This is correctly identified by the agent.

2. **The user makes regular contributions** - The user provides £120 every 4 weeks in groceries and clothes, which averages to **£30 per week**.

3. **The threshold for eligibility** - According to gov.uk guidance on "Child Benefit if your child lives with someone else," a parent who doesn't live with their child can still claim Child Benefit if they contribute **at least the amount of Child Benefit** to the child's upkeep. The Child Benefit rate for the eldest/only child is approximately £26.05 per week (as of recent rates).

4. **The user meets the contribution requirement** - At £30/week average, the user's contributions exceed the Child Benefit threshold of £26.05/week.

5. **Both parents can potentially claim** - When parents don't live together, the one who contributes at least the Child Benefit amount can claim, even if the child doesn't live with them.

**Agent's Error:**

The agent failed to explore whether the user's contributions met the threshold for eligibility under the "child lives with someone else" provision. The agent assumed only the resident parent could claim, without investigating the contribution-based eligibility route.

**Conclusion:**

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent (not eligible) does not agree with the expected outcome (eligible).
