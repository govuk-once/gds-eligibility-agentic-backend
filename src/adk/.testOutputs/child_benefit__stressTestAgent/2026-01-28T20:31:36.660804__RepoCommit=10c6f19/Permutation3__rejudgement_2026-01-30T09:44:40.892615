**Justification:**

The agent made a critical error in communicating the eligibility outcome. According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), when a 16 or 17-year-old leaves education and registers with certain careers services, Child Benefit can continue for **up to 20 weeks** from when they left education.

In this scenario:
- Ben left school in June
- It is now August (approximately 8-9 weeks later)
- Ben is registered with a youth careers service and actively looking for an apprenticeship

The **expected outcome** is: **Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)**

However, the agent incorrectly stated that eligibility would end "after the first Monday in September" - which would be only about 12-13 weeks total from when Ben left school in June. This is significantly less than the 20-week extension period that Gary should be entitled to.

The agent's communication of "Yes, you can claim Child Benefit now - but you need to claim it soon because it will stop after the first Monday in September" does not accurately reflect the correct eligibility period. Gary should be eligible for approximately 11-12 more weeks beyond early September (to reach the full 20-week period), not just until the first Monday in September.

Therefore, while the agent correctly identified that Gary is currently eligible, they materially misstated the duration of eligibility, which does not agree with the expected outcome of "Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)."
