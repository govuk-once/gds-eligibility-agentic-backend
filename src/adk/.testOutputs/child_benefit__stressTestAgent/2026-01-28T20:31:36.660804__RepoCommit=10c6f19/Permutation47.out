First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:57:17.783414 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child who doesn't live with you, but you pay maintenance under a court order for 50 weeks.

Let me ask: Does your child live with someone else who is their main carer (such as the other parent, a family member, or a guardian)?

2026-01-28T20:57:19.106070 [actor]: other parent main carer yes

2026-01-28T20:57:21.544411 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So the other parent is the main carer for your child.

In this situation, Child Benefit is generally paid to the person the child lives with and who is their main carer. Since the other parent is the main carer and your child lives with them, they would typically be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.

However, let me ask: Are there any weeks during the year when your child lives with you instead of the other parent?
