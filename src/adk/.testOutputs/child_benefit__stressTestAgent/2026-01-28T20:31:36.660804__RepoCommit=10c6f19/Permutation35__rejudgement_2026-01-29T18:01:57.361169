**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the father is **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit because his son is married, stating: "if your son is married, you are NOT eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, even though he lives with you, you support him financially, and he's still in full-time education."

However, the **expected outcome is: Eligible (via Exception).**

According to the scenario notes, there is an **exception** to the marriage rule when:
- The child lives with the claimant
- The claimant is not financially supporting the child's spouse (or the spouse is also in full-time education/dependent)

In this case:
- Rashid (17) lives with his parents
- Both Rashid and his wife (17) are in full-time education (A-Levels)
- The parents support both of them
- The wife is also dependent/in education

The gov.uk guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility indicates that while married children are generally ineligible, exceptions can apply in specific circumstances where the child remains dependent and living with the claimant.

The agent failed to identify or apply this exception, incorrectly determining the father to be ineligible when he should have been found eligible via the exception pathway. Therefore, the agent's communicated eligibility outcome does **not agree** with the expected outcome.
