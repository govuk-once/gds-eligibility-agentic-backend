**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** without any time limitation or qualification about the 12-week rule. The agent stated "you should be eligible for Child Benefit" and "You can claim Child Benefit for your son" without mentioning that this eligibility is time-limited.

However, the **expected outcome** is: **Eligible (until week 12)**.

According to GOV.UK guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, when a child is in residential accommodation paid for by the local authority, parents can only claim Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks. Since the son has been at the residential school for 10 weeks, the parent has only 2 weeks of eligibility remaining before losing entitlement.

The agent's response was **incomplete and misleading** because:
1. It suggested ongoing, unlimited eligibility
2. It failed to communicate the critical 12-week time limit
3. It did not inform the parent that their eligibility would end after week 12
4. It attributed eligibility primarily to the child coming home during holidays, rather than explaining the specific 12-week rule for residential accommodation

The agent should have clearly stated that while the parent is currently eligible, this eligibility will end after the child has been in residential accommodation for 12 weeks total, which is only 2 weeks away from the current 10-week mark.
