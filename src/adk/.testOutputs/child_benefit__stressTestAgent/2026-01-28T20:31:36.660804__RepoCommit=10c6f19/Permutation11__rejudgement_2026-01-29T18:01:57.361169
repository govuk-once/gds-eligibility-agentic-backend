**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user **is eligible** for Child Benefit, stating that Ryan's government-funded intermediate apprenticeship counts as "approved education/training." However, the expected outcome is that Karen should be **Not Eligible** and must stop her claim.

According to UK Child Benefit rules, **apprenticeships do not count as approved education or training** for Child Benefit purposes. The gov.uk guidance specifically excludes apprenticeships because they are employment-based training programs, not non-advanced education courses. Approved education must be a course of non-advanced education (such as A-levels) involving at least 12 hours per week of supervised study.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error: "apprenticeships (including government-funded intermediate apprenticeships) do NOT count as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes."

Since Ryan (17) has started an apprenticeship and is no longer in approved education, Karen is not eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit for him. The agent's determination directly contradicts the expected outcome.
