2026-01-28T20:44:50.781140 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T20:44:52.131594 [actor]: child in care 10 weks

2026-01-28T20:44:54.675841 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child who has been in care for 10 weeks.

To help me assess your eligibility, I need to understand the care situation better.

Is your child in local authority care (for example, with foster parents or in a children's home), or are they in hospital?

2026-01-28T20:44:56.180178 [actor]: local authority care foster

2026-01-28T20:44:58.357902 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Your child is in local authority care with foster parents.

To determine your eligibility for Child Benefit in this situation, I need to know:

Are you still contributing to the cost of looking after your child (for example, paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit would provide, which is currently at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate per week)?

2026-01-28T20:44:59.841912 [actor]: no income cant pay but husband pays

2026-01-28T20:45:01.910473 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your husband is paying towards the cost of looking after your child.

To clarify the situation further:

Is your husband the child's parent or does he have parental responsibility for the child?

2026-01-28T20:45:03.293142 [actor]: stepfather lives with me pays 30 week to carer

2026-01-28T20:45:05.745171 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your husband is the child's stepfather, lives with you, and pays £30 per week to the carer.

To assess your eligibility, I need to understand:

Is the £30 per week that your husband pays at least equal to the amount of Child Benefit that would be payable for this child? (Child Benefit is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, and £16.95 per week for additional children)

2026-01-28T20:45:07.035158 [actor]: yes 30 pound each week he pays

2026-01-28T20:45:09.224141 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Your husband pays £30 per week, which is more than the Child Benefit rate.

Now I need to clarify one important point:

Are you the child's parent or do you have parental responsibility for the child?

2026-01-28T20:45:10.450036 [actor]: yes im the mother

2026-01-28T20:45:15.138075 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are the child's mother.

Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your situation:

- You are the child's mother (so you have parental responsibility)
- Your child is in local authority foster care
- Your household is contributing £30 per week towards the child's care (through your husband)
- This amount is at least equal to the Child Benefit rate

**You should be eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit** for your child while they are in local authority care, because someone in your household is contributing at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount towards the cost of looking after your child.

The key rule is that if your child is in care for more than 8 weeks, you can only keep getting Child Benefit if you're contributing to the cost of looking after them - which you are doing through your husband's payments.

Do you currently claim Child Benefit for this child, or are you looking to make a new claim?

2026-01-28T20:45:18.116215 [actor]: ok thnak you

2026-01-28T20:45:20.355348 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am eligible for Child Benefit because my household contributes £30 per week (through my husband) towards my child's care in local authority foster placement, which exceeds the Child Benefit rate, and this contribution allows me to continue claiming despite the child being in care for more than 8 weeks.
