**Justification:**

While the evaluation_judge marked this as a failure (✗), I believe the agent actually communicated an **incorrect eligibility outcome**, which paradoxically means my assessment should be 👍 because the expected outcome is "Not Eligible (Expired)" and the agent said the user was eligible.

Let me clarify the reasoning:

**Expected Outcome:** Not Eligible (Expired)

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Eligible

**Why the user should be Not Eligible:**
- Hans has Pre-Settled Status and has been job-seeking for **95 days**
- The jobseeker right to reside for benefit purposes expires after **91 days**
- He has no job offer (no "genuine prospect of work")
- He is not receiving any benefits and has no other qualifying status

**What the agent said:**
The agent concluded: "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and stated "Your employment status (currently looking for work) does not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit."

This is **incorrect**. For someone with Pre-Settled Status claiming as a jobseeker, there IS a 91-day time limit, after which the right to reside expires unless there's a genuine prospect of employment.

**Conclusion:**
The agent communicated an outcome (Eligible) that **does not agree** with the expected outcome (Not Eligible - Expired). Therefore: 👎

Wait, I need to reconsider my symbol. The agent said ELIGIBLE but should have said NOT ELIGIBLE. This means the outcomes DO NOT AGREE. So it should be 👎.

**Final Answer: 👎**
