**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct eligibility assessment**: The agent properly identified that Jordan (17 years old) does not meet the criteria because:
   - He is over 16 years old
   - He is not in approved education or training
   - He has not registered with any careers service or training program

2. **Accurate application of rules**: The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit stops at age 16 unless the young person remains in approved education or training (which can extend eligibility until age 20).

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you are not eligible for Child Benefit" and provided clear reasoning for this decision.

4. **Consistent with expected outcome**: The scenario states Jordan is "NEET" (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) and has not registered with any careers service, making him ineligible for the 20-week extension. The expected outcome is "Not Eligible," and the agent communicated exactly this.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome, and the original evaluation judge also confirmed this with a ✓.
