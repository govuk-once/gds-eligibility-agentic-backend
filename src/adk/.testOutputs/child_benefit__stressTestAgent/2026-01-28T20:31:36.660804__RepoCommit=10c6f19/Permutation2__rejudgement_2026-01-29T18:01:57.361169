**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Child's age and education status**: The agent correctly identified that the 17-year-old daughter qualifies because she is under 20 and in full-time approved education (A-levels at sixth form).

2. **Responsibility criteria**: The agent confirmed that Amit is responsible for his daughter as she lives with him and he is her primary carer.

3. **Residency**: The agent verified UK residency status.

4. **Education timeline**: The agent confirmed the daughter started her approved education before turning 19.

5. **High Income Child Benefit Charge**: The agent correctly noted that with an income of £40,000, Amit is below the £50,000 threshold and will not face the tax charge.

The agent's final determination clearly stated: "**You are eligible for Child Benefit**" and provided accurate reasoning based on all relevant eligibility criteria outlined in the government guidance. This matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** for this scenario.
