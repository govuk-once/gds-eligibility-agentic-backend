**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly communicated the eligibility outcome based on the expected result for this scenario.

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible for Ben (Full Rate), Not Eligible for Jerry (by explicitly allocating contributions).

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Not eligible for either Ben or Jerry.

**Analysis:**

This scenario tests knowledge of a specific but important exception in Child Benefit rules. According to the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, when a parent doesn't live with their children but contributes to their upkeep, they may be eligible for Child Benefit if their contribution equals or exceeds the Child Benefit amount for that child.

The key facts:
- Martin pays £40/week total for two children
- Ben's Child Benefit rate: £25.60 (eldest child rate)
- Jerry's Child Benefit rate: £16.95 (additional child rate)
- Combined rate: £42.55/week

By default, HMRC splits contributions equally (£20 each child), which would fail the threshold test for both. However, the guidance explicitly allows requesting unequal allocation. Martin can request £25.60 be allocated to Ben and £14.40 to Jerry, making him eligible for Ben's full Child Benefit but not Jerry's.

The agent repeatedly insisted that living arrangements are the only criterion and completely missed this contribution-based eligibility pathway, even when the user (correctly) challenged this position multiple times. The agent dismissed the user's correct understanding as misinformation.
