2026-01-28T20:45:54.258012 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start assessing your eligibility, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:45:55.770748 [actor]: baby 6 months old live with mum dad

2026-01-28T20:45:57.604210 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 6-month-old baby who lives with both mum and dad.

Let me ask the next question:

**Are you responsible for the child - meaning do you live with the child and are you the main person looking after them?**

2026-01-28T20:45:59.014598 [actor]: yes i look after mia im her mum

2026-01-28T20:46:01.205513 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you're Mia's mum, she's 6 months old, you live with her, and you're responsible for looking after her.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Do you (or your partner) normally live in the UK, or are you a Crown servant or member of the armed forces posted overseas?**

2026-01-28T20:46:02.611503 [actor]: live in uk with my parents

2026-01-28T20:46:04.644047 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you live in the UK with your parents, along with your 6-month-old daughter Mia.

Let me ask the next question:

**Is Mia currently living with you full-time, or does she spend time living with someone else (for example, does she live with her father part of the time)?**

2026-01-28T20:46:06.075152 [actor]: mia lives with me all the time

2026-01-28T20:46:07.917450 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Mia lives with you all the time.

Let me ask one more question to complete the assessment:

**Is Mia currently in local authority care, or has she been in hospital continuously for more than 12 weeks?**

2026-01-28T20:46:09.276310 [actor]: no shes with me at home

2026-01-28T20:46:12.143948 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

✓ You have a child (Mia) who is under 16 years old (she's 6 months old)
✓ You are responsible for her - you live with her and look after her
✓ You live in the UK
✓ Mia lives with you full-time
✓ She is not in local authority care or long-term hospital care

You should be able to claim Child Benefit for Mia. 

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-28T20:46:17.876340 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The user has a 6-month-old child living with them in the UK, is the main carer, and the child is not in care or hospital - meeting all eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.
