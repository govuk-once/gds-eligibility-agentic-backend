**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and the specific circumstances described, the user **should be eligible**.

**Key Analysis:**

1. **The Contribution Test**: According to GOV.UK guidance on child benefit when a child lives with someone else (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else), a parent who doesn't live with their child may still claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit to the child's upkeep.

2. **Calculation of Contribution**:
   - User pays £120 every 4 weeks for groceries and clothes
   - This equals £30 per week (£120 ÷ 4 weeks)
   - The Child Benefit rate for one child is approximately £26.05 per week
   - £30/week > £26.05/week ✓

3. **Meeting the Criteria**:
   - The user contributes regularly (every 4 weeks)
   - The contribution amount (£30/week equivalent) exceeds the Child Benefit threshold
   - The contributions are for the child's upkeep (groceries and clothes)

**Agent's Error**: The agent failed to consider or inform the user about the provision that allows a non-resident parent to claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the equivalent amount to the child's care. The agent focused solely on the living arrangement without exploring the contribution pathway to eligibility.
