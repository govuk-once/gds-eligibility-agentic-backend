2026-01-28T20:35:25.591884 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child who is under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you are responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:35:27.292087 [actor]: child beneffit 4 year old daughter 75000 salary

2026-01-28T20:35:29.762943 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 4-year-old daughter, which means she meets the age requirement.

Now I need to ask you a few more questions to assess your eligibility:

**Are you responsible for your daughter? This means do you live with her and are you the main person looking after her (or sharing the main responsibility equally with a partner)?**

2026-01-28T20:35:31.030170 [actor]: yes live with daughter and partner

2026-01-28T20:35:33.710349 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you live with your daughter and partner, and you're responsible for her care.

I noticed you mentioned a salary of £75,000. This is important for understanding your situation.

**Next question: Is your individual income over £50,000 per year, or is your partner's individual income over £50,000 per year?**

(This affects whether the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply to you.)

2026-01-28T20:35:35.259948 [actor]: 75000 income partner earns less

2026-01-28T20:35:37.370536 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your income is £75,000 and your partner earns less than that.

Let me ask you one more question to complete the assessment:

**Is your daughter living with you full-time, or does she spend time living with someone else (for example, if you have shared custody arrangements)?**

2026-01-28T20:35:38.861160 [actor]: daughter lives with us full time

2026-01-28T20:35:44.448386 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility for Child Benefit:

**Good news - you ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit.**

Here's what this means for your situation:

✓ Your 4-year-old daughter meets the age requirement (under 16)
✓ You are responsible for her and she lives with you full-time
✓ You meet the basic eligibility criteria

**However, there's an important consideration regarding the High Income Child Benefit Charge:**

Since your individual income is £75,000 (which is above £50,000), you would need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge through your tax return. 

- For income between £50,000 and £60,000, you pay back 1% of the Child Benefit for every £100 of income over £50,000
- At £75,000, you would need to pay back 100% of the Child Benefit you receive

This means you can still **claim** Child Benefit, but you would need to repay all of it through the tax system. Some people in this situation still choose to claim it (even though they repay it all) because it helps protect the National Insurance record for the person claiming, which can affect their State Pension.

Do you have any questions about this?

2026-01-28T20:35:46.307327 [actor]: ok so can get it or not confused

2026-01-28T20:35:50.900624 [root_agent]: I understand the confusion - let me make this clearer:

**YES, you CAN get Child Benefit.**

You meet all the eligibility requirements to claim it.

**BUT** - because your income is £75,000, you would have to pay it all back through a tax charge.

Think of it this way:
- The government would pay you Child Benefit (currently £25.60 per week for your first child)
- Then you'd have to pay it all back when you do your tax return because your income is over £60,000

So practically speaking, you wouldn't end up with any money from it.

**However**, many people in your situation still claim it anyway because it protects your National Insurance record, which counts towards your State Pension in the future.

**Your choice is:**
1. Claim it and pay it back (but protect your pension rights), OR
2. Don't claim it at all

Does that make more sense?

2026-01-28T20:35:56.684573 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that the user is eligible for Child Benefit but subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which at £75,000 income means repaying 100% of the benefit received - this matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)".
