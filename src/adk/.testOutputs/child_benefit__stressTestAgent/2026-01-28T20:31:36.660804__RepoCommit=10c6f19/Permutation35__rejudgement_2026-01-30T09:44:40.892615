**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the father is **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit because the son is married, stating: "if your son is married, you are NOT eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, even though he lives with you, you support him financially, and he's still in full-time education."

However, the expected outcome is: **Eligible (via Exception)**.

According to the scenario details, there is an **exception for marriage** when:
- The child lives with the claimant AND
- The claimant depends on them (and is not financially supporting the spouse, or the spouse is also in education/dependent)

The transcript clearly establishes:
- The son (17) lives with his parents
- The parents support both him and his wife
- Both the son and his wife are in full-time education (A-Levels)
- The wife has moved into the parents' house

This situation meets the criteria for the exception. The agent failed to recognize or apply this exception, instead giving a blanket ruling that marriage disqualifies eligibility. The agent should have communicated that while normally marriage would disqualify the claim, an exception applies in this specific circumstance where the married child still lives with and depends on the parent, and the spouse is also in education/dependent.

The agent's communicated outcome (Not Eligible) does **NOT** agree with the expected outcome (Eligible via Exception).
