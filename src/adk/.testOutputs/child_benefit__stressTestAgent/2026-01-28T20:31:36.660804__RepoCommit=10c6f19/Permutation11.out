2026-01-28T20:37:06.545958 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:37:07.891343 [actor]: ryan apprenticship 17 yrs old

2026-01-28T20:37:09.750017 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have Ryan who is 17 years old and in an apprenticeship.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:37:11.357871 [actor]: yes live uk

2026-01-28T20:37:13.553662 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. You live in the UK and have a 17-year-old in an apprenticeship.

Next question:

**Is Ryan living with you, or are they your main responsibility (meaning you're contributing at least the same amount as anyone else towards their upkeep)?**

2026-01-28T20:37:14.736685 [actor]: ryan lives with me

2026-01-28T20:37:17.735205 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Ryan lives with you in the UK.

Now I need to ask:

**Is Ryan's apprenticeship an approved form of education or training? Specifically, is it a course of non-advanced education (up to A level or equivalent) that involves more than 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience?**

2026-01-28T20:37:19.178129 [actor]: government funded intermediate apprenticship england

2026-01-28T20:37:21.153733 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. A government-funded intermediate apprenticeship in England would typically qualify as approved education or training.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you the only person claiming Child Benefit for Ryan, or is someone else also claiming for him?**

2026-01-28T20:37:22.723406 [actor]: only me claiming

2026-01-28T20:37:25.223515 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you. Just one more question to complete the assessment:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year?**

(This won't necessarily stop you from claiming, but it's important to know as it may affect whether you need to pay a tax charge.)

2026-01-28T20:37:26.681036 [actor]: no income under 60000

2026-01-28T20:37:30.237159 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's a summary of why:

✓ You have a child (Ryan, age 17) under 20 years old  
✓ Ryan is in approved education/training (a government-funded intermediate apprenticeship)  
✓ Ryan lives with you in the UK  
✓ You are the only person claiming for Ryan  
✓ Neither you nor your partner earns over £60,000 per year (so you won't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

You should be able to claim Child Benefit for Ryan. You can make your claim through the UK government's system.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:37:35.963326 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, apprenticeships (including government-funded intermediate apprenticeships) do NOT count as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes, even though they may involve study. Only non-advanced education courses of at least 12 hours per week of supervised study qualify, and apprenticeships are specifically excluded from this definition as they are employment-based training programs.
