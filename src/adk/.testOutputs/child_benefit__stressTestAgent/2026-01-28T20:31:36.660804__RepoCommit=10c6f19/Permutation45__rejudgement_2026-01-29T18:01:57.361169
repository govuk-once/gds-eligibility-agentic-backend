**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

According to the UK government guidance on child benefit for children in hospital (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks when:
1. The child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks, AND
2. The cost of accommodation and maintenance is paid by the NHS or from public funds

The key facts established in this conversation were:
- The child has been in hospital for **14 weeks** (exceeds the 12-week threshold)
- The **hospital provides everything** (full board and accommodation paid by NHS/public funds)

While the parent visits daily for hours, the scenario explicitly states that Maria "does not buy food, clothes, or gifts" and "the hospital provides everything." The exception for continuing Child Benefit after 12 weeks requires the parent to "regularly spend money" on the child's upkeep. Visiting alone, without financial contribution, does not satisfy this exception.

The agent's conclusion that the user is "likely eligible" directly contradicts the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** and misapplies the 12-week hospital rule. The agent should have explained that Child Benefit eligibility ends after 12 weeks in these circumstances.
