**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Initial Assessment:** The agent properly established that most standard eligibility criteria were met:
   - Liam (18) is under 20
   - He's in approved education (A-levels)
   - He lives with his mother (the applicant)
   - The applicant is a UK resident and responsible for him

2. **Critical Information:** When the user revealed that Liam receives Universal Credit in his own name as his own claim, the agent correctly identified this as disqualifying.

3. **Correct Outcome:** The agent explicitly stated: "*you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for him*" and "*you are not eligible for Child Benefit for him*"

4. **Accurate Reasoning:** The agent properly explained that when a young person claims Universal Credit in their own right, they are considered independent rather than a dependent child, which disqualifies the parent from receiving Child Benefit.

This aligns with the government guidance that Child Benefit stops if the child starts receiving Universal Credit in their own right. The agent's final determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
