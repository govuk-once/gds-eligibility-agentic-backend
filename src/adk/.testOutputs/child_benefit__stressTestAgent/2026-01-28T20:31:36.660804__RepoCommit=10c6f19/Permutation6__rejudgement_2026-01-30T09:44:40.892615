**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct application of hospital rules**: The agent properly distinguished between:
   - Children in hospital for medical treatment (84-week limit)
   - Children placed in hospital by local authority care (12-week limit with potential exceptions)

2. **Accurate exception handling**: The scenario involves a child (Chloe, 6 years old) who has been in hospital for 14 weeks for medical treatment. The mother visits daily and spends £30/week on the child's upkeep (books, pyjamas, food).

3. **Proper outcome communication**: The agent clearly stated: "You should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Chloe" and explained that medical treatment allows continuation for up to 84 weeks.

4. **Alignment with expected outcome**: According to the Gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital, when a parent regularly spends money on a hospitalized child's upkeep, they retain eligibility beyond standard limits. The agent's conclusion matches this exception criteria.

The agent successfully identified the exception that applies and communicated the correct eligibility outcome to the user.
