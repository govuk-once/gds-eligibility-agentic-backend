**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly assessed the eligibility outcome due to a misunderstanding of the "linking rule" for hospital stays.

**What the agent said:**
The agent concluded that Jenny remains eligible for Child Benefit because the 2-week period at home "broke the 12-week period" and the count restarted, meaning only the current 3-week hospital stay counts toward the limit.

**What the correct outcome should be:**
According to the linking rule, when a child returns to hospital within 28 days of discharge, the separate hospital periods are linked together and count cumulatively toward the 12-week limit. Arthur was discharged, stayed home for 2 weeks (14 days), then was readmitted 15 days later - well within the 28-day linking period. Therefore:
- First hospital stay: 10 weeks
- Second hospital stay: 3 weeks  
- **Cumulative total: 13 weeks**

Since the cumulative hospital time exceeds 12 weeks, Jenny is **not eligible** for Child Benefit after the 12th cumulative week (unless she is contributing to Arthur's upkeep, which wasn't discussed).

**Expected outcome:** Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)
**Agent's communicated outcome:** Eligible

The agent's assessment does not agree with the expected outcome.
