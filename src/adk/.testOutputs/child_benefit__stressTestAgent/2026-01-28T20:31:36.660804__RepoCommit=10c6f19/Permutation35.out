2026-01-28T20:49:48.957467 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:49:50.848977 [actor]: child benefit my son still in school married though lives here

2026-01-28T20:49:52.756307 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a son who is still in school and lives with you.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: **How old is your son?**

This will help me determine if he falls within the age requirements for Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T20:49:54.148643 [actor]: 17 years old doing a levels

2026-01-28T20:49:56.274964 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your 17-year-old son is doing A Levels and lives with you.

Next question: **Are you (or your spouse/partner) the person responsible for your son? This means you're the one looking after him and paying for things like food, clothes, and other living costs.**

2026-01-28T20:49:57.765084 [actor]: yes we pay for everything he needs food clothes everything

2026-01-28T20:49:59.799179 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you. So you and your spouse are responsible for your son's care and expenses.

Next question: **Do you or your spouse normally live in the UK?**

(This is important as you generally need to live in the UK to be eligible for Child Benefit)

2026-01-28T20:50:01.283269 [actor]: yes we live in uk always have

2026-01-28T20:50:04.030694 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now, an important question: **Is your son continuing in approved education or training after he turns 16?**

Since he's doing A Levels, I need to confirm - is he enrolled in full-time non-advanced education (such as studying for A Levels or similar qualifications at school or college)?

2026-01-28T20:50:05.304975 [actor]: yes full time a levels at school

2026-01-28T20:50:07.631690 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: **Has anyone else already claimed Child Benefit for your son?**

(Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child, so I need to check if you or someone else has already made a claim)

2026-01-28T20:50:09.191702 [actor]: no one else claiming just me his father

2026-01-28T20:50:14.486285 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You have a son who is 17 years old
2. ✓ He is in full-time approved education (A Levels at school)
3. ✓ He lives with you in the UK
4. ✓ You are responsible for him and pay for his needs
5. ✓ You normally live in the UK
6. ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

Your son can continue to be covered by Child Benefit until he turns 20, as long as he remains in approved education or training.

However, there is one thing you should be aware of: **Do you or your spouse have an individual income over £50,000 per year?** 

If either of you earns above this amount, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which reduces the benefit through the tax system. You can still claim, but the higher earner would pay some or all of it back through their tax return.

2026-01-28T20:50:16.413336 [actor]: ok thank u but what about him being maried does that mater

2026-01-28T20:50:19.565787 [root_agent]: That's an excellent question, and I apologize for not asking about this earlier.

**Yes, your son being married could affect his eligibility for Child Benefit.**

Let me clarify: **Does your married son still live with you in your household, and are you still responsible for him (meaning you still support him and pay for his living costs)?**

This is important because if he's married and living independently or being supported by his spouse rather than by you, this could impact the eligibility.

2026-01-28T20:50:21.232602 [actor]: yes he lives with us his wife moved in we support both of them she also in school

2026-01-28T20:50:24.735262 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is helpful information.

So your 17-year-old son is married, his wife lives with you both in your home, and you support both of them while they're both in school.

Let me think about this carefully. The key question here is whether a young person who is married can still qualify you for Child Benefit, even if they live with you and you support them.

**One more question: Is your son's wife also under 20 and in approved education or training?**

(I ask this because there may be separate considerations about Child Benefit for her as well, depending on her circumstances and who is responsible for her)

2026-01-28T20:50:25.935193 [actor]: yes she is 17 too doing a levels

2026-01-28T20:50:31.612068 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me be clear about the situation regarding your son being married:

**Unfortunately, if your son is married, you are NOT eligible to claim Child Benefit for him**, even though he lives with you, you support him financially, and he's still in full-time education.

The rules state that a young person who is married or in a civil partnership does not qualify their parent for Child Benefit, regardless of whether they still live at home or are in education.

**Regarding your son's wife:** Similarly, if she is married (to your son), her parents would also not be able to claim Child Benefit for her, even if you are supporting her.

The marriage status is the determining factor here that makes both of them ineligible for Child Benefit to be claimed on their behalf, despite them both being 17, in education, and being supported by you.

I'm sorry this isn't the answer you were hoping for. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T20:50:36.768755 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to the official gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, a child who is married or in a civil partnership is NOT eligible for Child Benefit - the agent correctly identified this rule and properly determined that I am not eligible despite my son living with me and being in full-time education.
