**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **not eligible**.

The critical error is in the agent's assessment of Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland. According to UK government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, apprenticeships generally do **not** qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes in Scotland (and England and Northern Ireland). The key distinction is that apprenticeships are employment contracts where the young person earns a wage, rather than being in unpaid education or training.

The agent stated: "He's enrolled in an official modern apprenticeship in Scotland, which counts as approved education or training" - this is incorrect. Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland involve employment with a training contract and do not meet the criteria for Child Benefit extension beyond age 16.

The agent should have determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit for their 17-year-old son who is doing a Modern Apprenticeship, as apprenticeships do not qualify under the "approved education or training" exception that would extend Child Benefit eligibility to age 20.

The evaluation judge's assessment (✗) correctly identified this error, noting that Modern Apprenticeships are employment with training contracts where the apprentice earns a wage, and therefore do not count as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.
