2026-01-28T20:49:02.883018 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:49:04.376909 [actor]: son in custody 10 weeks claim child benfit still

2026-01-28T20:49:06.187226 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. So you have a son who has been in custody for 10 weeks, and you want to know if you can still claim Child Benefit for him.

Let me ask: **How old is your son?**

2026-01-28T20:49:07.692583 [actor]: 15 years old custody 10 weeks child benfit eligble

2026-01-28T20:49:09.638536 [root_agent]: Thank you. Your son is 15 years old and has been in custody for 10 weeks.

This is an important situation. Let me ask: **Is your son in youth detention/custody as a result of being remanded or sentenced by a court?**

2026-01-28T20:49:11.101523 [actor]: sentenced youth custody 6 months benfit for him

2026-01-28T20:49:13.508216 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Your son is 15 years old and has been sentenced to 6 months in youth custody, and he's currently been there for 10 weeks.

Let me ask you: **Before your son went into custody, were you receiving Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T20:49:15.084612 [actor]: yes was claiming before he went custody still get it now

2026-01-28T20:49:17.195039 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. You were claiming Child Benefit for your son before he went into custody.

Now, an important question: **Is your son expected to return to live with you after he is released from youth custody?**

2026-01-28T20:49:18.722449 [actor]: yes coming back home after release still eligible child benfit

2026-01-28T20:49:22.862313 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son will be returning home to live with you after his release.

Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your situation:

**You should still be eligible for Child Benefit** for your son, even though he is currently in youth custody, because:

1. Your son is under 16 years old (he's 15)
2. He is expected to return to live with you after his release
3. You were claiming Child Benefit for him before he went into custody

When a child is in custody or detention but is expected to return home, you can generally continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks. However, since your son has been in custody for 10 weeks and is sentenced to 6 months, there are specific considerations.

Let me ask one more important question: **Have you informed HMRC (the Child Benefit Office) that your son is in youth custody?**

2026-01-28T20:49:24.597102 [actor]: no havent told them yet do i need to report it

2026-01-28T20:49:29.249202 [root_agent]: **Yes, you do need to report it to HMRC (the Child Benefit Office).**

This is important because:

1. You have a legal responsibility to report changes in your circumstances that might affect your Child Benefit claim

2. Your son has now been in custody for 10 weeks, and the rules around Child Benefit when a child is in custody or detention are specific

3. Generally, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks when a child is in custody, but since your son is sentenced to 6 months, this exceeds that period

You should contact the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible to:
- Inform them that your son is in youth custody
- Confirm his expected release date
- Discuss your ongoing eligibility

**To report this, you can:**
- Call the Child Benefit helpline on 0300 200 3100
- Write to the Child Benefit Office

It's better to inform them now rather than risk having to repay any overpaid benefit later. They will be able to give you specific guidance about your situation and whether you can continue receiving Child Benefit during his custody period.

**Do you have any other questions about this?**

2026-01-28T20:49:31.028772 [actor]: so am i eligble or not confused about 12 weeks rule

2026-01-28T20:49:36.789950 [root_agent]: Let me clarify this for you - I apologize for the confusion.

**Based on the standard rules, you may NOT be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit** after the first 12 weeks of your son being in custody.

Here's why:

- When a child is in custody or detention, you can usually continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **12 weeks**
- Your son has already been in custody for **10 weeks**
- He is sentenced to **6 months total**

This means:
- You would have about 2 weeks left of eligibility under the 12-week rule
- After 12 weeks total, your Child Benefit would normally stop because he's still in custody beyond that period

**However**, you still need to contact HMRC urgently because:
1. You must report this change in circumstances
2. They need to assess your specific situation 
3. There may be other factors that could affect your eligibility
4. You need to avoid overpayments

The Child Benefit Office will be able to confirm exactly when your payments should stop and what happens when your son is released.

**Does this make more sense now?**

2026-01-28T20:49:38.403024 [actor]: ok so not eligble after 12 weeks got it thanks

2026-01-28T20:49:41.551025 [root_agent]: **Yes, that's correct.** After 12 weeks of your son being in custody, you would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit while he remains in custody.

Since he's already been there for 10 weeks, you have about 2 weeks of remaining eligibility.

**Important reminder:** Please contact the Child Benefit Office (0300 200 3100) as soon as possible to:
- Report your son's custody situation
- Confirm when your payments should stop
- Avoid any overpayments that you'd have to repay later

When your son is released and returns home to live with you, you can claim Child Benefit for him again.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T20:49:43.068072 [actor]: no thats all thanks for help

2026-01-28T20:49:47.124006 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit eligibility stops after 12 weeks when a child is in custody, and since the son has been in custody for 10 weeks of a 6-month sentence, the claimant would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit beyond the 12-week mark. The agent also correctly advised the claimant to contact HMRC to report the change in circumstances.
