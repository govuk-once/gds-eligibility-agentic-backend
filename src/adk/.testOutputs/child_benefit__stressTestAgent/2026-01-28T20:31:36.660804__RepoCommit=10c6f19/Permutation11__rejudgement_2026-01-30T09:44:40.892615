**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user (Karen) is **eligible** for Child Benefit, stating that Ryan's government-funded intermediate apprenticeship qualifies as "approved education/training." However, the expected outcome is that Karen is **not eligible** and must stop her claim.

According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, apprenticeships in England are specifically **excluded** from counting as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes. The rules state that Child Benefit can continue for children under 20 only if they are in approved education or training, which means:
- Non-advanced education (up to A-level or equivalent)
- At least 12 hours per week of supervised study

Apprenticeships, while they may include some study component, are classified as **employment-based training programs** rather than education. When a young person starts an apprenticeship, this is considered a disqualifying event for Child Benefit.

The agent made a critical error in determining that the intermediate apprenticeship qualified as approved education. This led to an incorrect eligibility outcome. The agent should have informed Karen that Ryan's apprenticeship means he no longer qualifies, and therefore Karen is not eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit for him.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, and I concur with that assessment. The agent's communicated outcome (eligible) does not agree with the expected outcome (not eligible).
