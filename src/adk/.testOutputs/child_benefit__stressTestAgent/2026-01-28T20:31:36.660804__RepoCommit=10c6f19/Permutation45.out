2026-01-28T20:56:14.023613 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:56:15.677027 [actor]: daughtr 8 hospital long time

2026-01-28T20:56:17.746559 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have an 8-year-old daughter who has been in hospital for a long time.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:56:19.009576 [actor]: yes uk live here

2026-01-28T20:56:21.025895 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you live in the UK and have an 8-year-old daughter who has been in hospital for a long time.

Now I need to ask:

**How long has your daughter been in hospital - has it been more than 12 weeks (84 days)?**

2026-01-28T20:56:22.250431 [actor]: 14 weeks hospital

2026-01-28T20:56:24.986720 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks, which is more than 12 weeks.

This is important to know: **Is the hospital providing your daughter's full board and accommodation, and is this being paid for by the NHS or through local authority funding?**

2026-01-28T20:56:26.287573 [actor]: yes hospital provides everything

2026-01-28T20:56:28.269885 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. I need to understand one more important detail about the hospital stay:

**Are you still involved in your daughter's care and do you regularly visit or maintain contact with her while she's in hospital?**

2026-01-28T20:56:29.771173 [actor]: visit every day for hours

2026-01-28T20:56:33.785692 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all this information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Assessment:**

Based on the information you've shared:
- You live in the UK ✓
- You have an 8-year-old daughter (under 16) ✓
- She's been in hospital for 14 weeks (more than 12 weeks)
- The hospital provides full board and accommodation paid for by the NHS/local authority
- You visit her every day and remain actively involved in her care

**You are likely eligible for Child Benefit**, even though your daughter has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks.

The key factor here is that you're maintaining regular contact and involvement in your daughter's care. When a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks with full board provided by the NHS or local authority, Child Benefit can continue if you're still providing care or contributing to the child's upbringing - which your daily visits demonstrate.

**Would you like information about how to claim Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-28T20:56:38.872061 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital or care, Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks if the child is in hospital and the cost of accommodation and maintenance is paid by the NHS or from public funds, regardless of parental visits or involvement in care.
