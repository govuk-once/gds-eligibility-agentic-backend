**Justification:**

Looking at the scenario details, this is **Permutation 19: The Rival Claimants (Disputed)** where:
- Pete has Holly 3 days/week
- Sue has Holly 4 days/week  
- Expected outcome: **Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible**

In the transcript, the user states "she stays wit me 3 days week" and "other parent has her 4 days", which means the user is **Pete** (3 days custody).

The agent concluded: "You ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit" but then explained that HMRC will likely award it to the other parent who has Holly 4 days per week.

According to the expected outcome, **Pete is Not Eligible**. The agent's statement "You ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit" directly contradicts this expected outcome. While the agent did explain that HMRC would likely award the benefit to the other parent (which aligns with Sue being eligible), the agent's primary eligibility determination for Pete was incorrect.

The agent should have communicated that Pete is **not eligible** because Sue (the other parent with 4 days custody) has main responsibility and will receive the benefit. The agent's mixed messaging - saying Pete is eligible but won't receive payment - does not clearly communicate the correct eligibility outcome.
