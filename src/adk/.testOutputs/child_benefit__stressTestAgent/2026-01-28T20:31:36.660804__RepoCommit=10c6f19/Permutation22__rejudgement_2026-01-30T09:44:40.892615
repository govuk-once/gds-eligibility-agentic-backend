**Justification:**

The agent made a critical error in applying the hospital linking rules for Child Benefit eligibility.

**What the agent said:**
The agent concluded that Jenny remains eligible because the 2-week break at home "broke the 12-week period" and the count restarted, meaning only the current 3-week stay counts toward the limit.

**What the rules actually state:**
According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit when children are in hospital, if a child returns to hospital within **28 days** of leaving, the hospital stays are "linked" and count cumulatively toward the 12-week limit. This is the "Linking Rule" mentioned in the scenario.

**Analysis of Jenny's situation:**
- First hospital stay: 10 weeks
- Home period: 2 weeks (14 days)
- Arthur returned to hospital: 15 days after discharge (within the 28-day linking period)
- Second hospital stay: 3 weeks
- **Cumulative total: 10 + 3 = 13 weeks**

Since Arthur returned to hospital within 28 days (he returned after only 15 days), the linking rule applies. The cumulative time in hospital (13 weeks) exceeds the 12-week threshold.

**Expected outcome:** Not eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)

**Agent's communicated outcome:** Eligible

The agent's determination directly contradicts the expected outcome and misapplies the hospital stay rules.
