2026-01-28T20:42:14.305536 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:42:15.758492 [actor]: granddaughter 14 lives with me

2026-01-28T20:42:17.767051 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your 14-year-old granddaughter lives with you.

Let me ask you the next important question:

**Are you responsible for your granddaughter? This means are you the main person who looks after her day-to-day - for example, providing her with food, clothing, and a home?**

2026-01-28T20:42:19.241408 [actor]: yes pay for evrything clothes food school stuff

2026-01-28T20:42:21.356887 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful to know that you're paying for everything for her - clothes, food, and school items.

Now I need to ask:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your granddaughter?** For example, are her parents claiming Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-28T20:42:22.797051 [actor]: parents cant take care of her dont give money

2026-01-28T20:42:25.253335 [root_agent]: I understand that the parents can't take care of her and don't provide financial support.

Let me clarify my question more specifically:

**Do you know if either of her parents (or anyone else) is actually claiming Child Benefit from the government for your granddaughter right now?** Even if they're not giving you money or taking care of her, they might still be claiming the benefit.

2026-01-28T20:42:26.664303 [actor]: no they dont claim anything

2026-01-28T20:42:28.180610 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your residency:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:42:29.517534 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T20:42:31.775127 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

One more important question:

**Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on accessing public funds as part of your immigration status?**

2026-01-28T20:42:33.397823 [actor]: no restrictions born here

2026-01-28T20:42:37.184134 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your granddaughter. Here's why:

✓ Your granddaughter is 14 years old (under 16)
✓ She lives with you
✓ You are responsible for her - you're the main person looking after her and paying for her clothes, food, and school items
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You have no immigration restrictions

As her grandparent who is responsible for her care, you can claim Child Benefit even though you're not her parent. The key factor is that you're the person responsible for her day-to-day care.

**You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for your granddaughter.**

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T20:42:41.669253 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a grandparent who is responsible for a child's day-to-day care, with whom the child lives, and for whom no one else is claiming Child Benefit, is eligible to claim Child Benefit for that child.
