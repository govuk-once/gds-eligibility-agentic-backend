2026-01-26T15:00:06.580165 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I need to ask you a few questions one by one.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:00:08.395757 [actor]: I'm Elena, and I'm wondering about Child Benefit for my daughter Sofia. She's 18 now. She left school about two years ago and works as a receptionist for 30 hours a week. She's not taking any courses or training at the moment. We live together in our flat.

2026-01-26T15:00:12.021304 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Elena. Based on what you've shared, I need to assess Sofia's situation regarding Child Benefit eligibility.

Since Sofia is 18, has left school two years ago, is working 30 hours per week as a receptionist, and is not in any approved education or training, she would not qualify for Child Benefit.

Child Benefit can be paid for children under 16, or for those under 20 who are in approved education or training. As Sofia is 18 but not in education or training, she doesn't meet the eligibility criteria.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available?

2026-01-26T15:00:14.248290 [actor]: I understand. So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia because she's over 16 and not in education or training. That makes sense since she's working full-time now. Thank you for explaining that to me. I don't have any other questions about Child Benefit at the moment.

2026-01-26T15:00:16.617989 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit cannot be claimed for Sofia who is 18, working 30 hours per week, and not in approved education or training.
