2026-01-26T15:14:53.646936 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:14:54.887321 [actor]: Hi there. Yes, my wife and I have a baby - we just had our first child 4 months ago. We're responsible for them.

2026-01-26T15:14:56.674520 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Congratulations on your new baby!

Is your baby living with you? (This means they normally live with you, or you're paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards looking after them)

2026-01-26T15:14:57.908622 [actor]: Yes, our baby lives with us full-time. We're the parents and primary caregivers.

2026-01-26T15:14:59.025078 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful information.

Do you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:15:00.483241 [actor]: No, neither of us earns that much. I make about £35,000 and my wife makes around £30,000 per year.

2026-01-26T15:15:02.557949 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Since you and your wife both earn less than £60,000 individually, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge. However, I should mention that if either of you had an income between £50,000 and £60,000, you would still be eligible but would need to pay back some of the benefit through tax.

Is your baby a UK resident? (This generally means they live in the UK)

2026-01-26T15:15:03.476196 [actor]: Yes, our baby was born here in the UK and we all live here.

2026-01-26T15:15:07.759541 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided:

1. You're responsible for a child under 16 (your 4-month-old baby)
2. Your child lives with you full-time
3. Neither you nor your wife have an income over £60,000 per year
4. Your baby is a UK resident

I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit.

Currently, Child Benefit is paid at £25.60 per week for your first child (or only child). This is typically paid every 4 weeks into your bank account.

Either you or your wife can claim it, but it might be beneficial for the person with the lower National Insurance contributions record to claim if one of you isn't working full-time, as claiming Child Benefit can help protect your State Pension.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:15:09.427933 [actor]: Yes, I'd like to know how to apply. Also, we've had our baby for 4 months now but we forgot to fill in the form until today. Have we lost the money for those 4 months?

2026-01-26T15:15:13.722131 [root_agent]: I'm happy to help with that information.

Regarding your application:
You can apply for Child Benefit by filling in the CH2 claim form. You can either:
1. Complete it online, print it and send it by post
2. Print the blank form and fill it in by hand
3. Call the Child Benefit Office and ask them to send you a form

You'll need to include your baby's birth certificate when you send the form. The original certificate will be returned to you.

As for the payments for the past 4 months:
Good news - Child Benefit can be backdated for up to 3 months from the date the Child Benefit Office receives your claim. So while you may not get the full 4 months retroactively, you should receive payments for approximately 3 months back from when your application is processed.

I would recommend applying as soon as possible to maximize the backdated amount you can receive.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about the Child Benefit application process?

2026-01-26T15:15:15.973066 [actor]: That's disappointing that we can't get the full 4 months back, but I'm glad we can at least get 3 months. We'll make sure to apply right away. Thank you for explaining this - we'll fill out the CH2 claim form today.

2026-01-26T15:15:18.004490 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility, payment amounts, and the 3-month backdating policy.
