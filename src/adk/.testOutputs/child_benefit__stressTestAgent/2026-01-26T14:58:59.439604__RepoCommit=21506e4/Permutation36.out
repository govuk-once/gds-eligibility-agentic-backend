2026-01-26T15:13:52.099264 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T15:13:53.454868 [actor]: Hi there. Yes, I have a daughter living with me. Her name is Kelly.

2026-01-26T15:13:54.184924 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. How old is Kelly?

2026-01-26T15:13:55.074672 [actor]: Kelly is 16 years old.

2026-01-26T15:13:56.273254 [root_agent]: Thank you. Is Kelly currently in full-time education (such as school or college) or approved training?

2026-01-26T15:13:58.153123 [actor]: Well, that's what I'm a bit worried about. Kelly finished her GCSEs in June, and she's been accepted to start her A-levels at college in September. But right now it's August, so she's not technically in school at the moment. Does that affect the benefit?

2026-01-26T15:14:01.163667 [root_agent]: I understand your concern. This is actually a good question.

For Child Benefit purposes, your daughter Kelly would still be considered to be in education during the short break between finishing her GCSEs and starting her A-levels. This period is treated as a normal school holiday. 

Child Benefit can continue to be paid for children under 20 who are in approved education or training. Since Kelly is 16 and will be starting her A-levels (which is approved education) in September, you would remain eligible during this summer break period.

May I ask if you're currently receiving Child Benefit for Kelly already, or are you applying for the first time?

2026-01-26T15:14:02.637218 [actor]: Yes, I'm already receiving Child Benefit for Kelly. I was just worried because of this gap between GCSEs and A-levels. So I'll continue to receive it during the summer break then?

2026-01-26T15:14:06.179281 [root_agent]: Yes, you will continue to receive Child Benefit for Kelly during the summer break between her GCSEs and A-levels. This gap is treated as a normal school holiday, and your eligibility isn't affected as long as Kelly does start her A-levels in September as planned.

Child Benefit continues for children in approved education until they turn 20 (or until they leave their course, whichever comes first). So as long as Kelly remains in her A-level studies, you'll continue to be eligible until she either completes her studies or turns 20.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit that you'd like to know?

2026-01-26T15:14:08.402527 [actor]: That's a relief to hear! No, that answers my question perfectly. I was just getting worried that I might have to stop receiving the benefit during the summer months. Thank you for clarifying that it will continue while she's between her GCSEs and A-levels.

2026-01-26T15:14:10.667427 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit continues during the normal school holiday period between GCSEs and A-levels, as long as the child will be starting approved education in September.
