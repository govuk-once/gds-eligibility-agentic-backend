2026-01-26T15:06:38.426120 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your situation.

Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T15:06:39.347257 [actor]: Yes, my son Sam lives with me. He's 10 years old.

2026-01-26T15:06:40.676007 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your son Sam. 

Are you responsible for raising Sam? By this I mean, do you provide for his day-to-day care and support?

2026-01-26T15:06:41.716912 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for raising Sam. I provide for all his day-to-day care and support since my divorce from my ex-wife Tina.

2026-01-26T15:06:42.814890 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is your son Sam a resident in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:06:43.666345 [actor]: Yes, Sam lives with me here in the UK.

2026-01-26T15:06:45.120422 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Sam lives with you in the UK.

Do you or your ex-wife Tina receive any other payments from the UK government or another country that would count as "equivalent" to Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:06:47.160789 [actor]: No, I don't receive any other payments from the UK government or another country that would be equivalent to Child Benefit. I can't speak with certainty about what Tina receives, but to my knowledge, she doesn't either - she would likely just be claiming Child Benefit for our daughter Ella who lives with her.

2026-01-26T15:06:48.282657 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is your annual individual income over £60,000?

2026-01-26T15:06:49.341430 [actor]: No, my annual income is below £60,000.

2026-01-26T15:06:50.231169 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your income level.

Is your annual individual income over £50,000?

2026-01-26T15:06:51.059664 [actor]: No, my income is below £50,000 as well.

2026-01-26T15:06:54.943949 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all this information. Based on what you've shared, I can now assess your eligibility for Child Benefit:

You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit because:
- You have a child (Sam) who is under 16 years old
- Sam lives with you and you're responsible for his day-to-day care
- Both you and Sam are UK residents
- Your income is below £50,000, so you wouldn't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge
- You don't receive any equivalent payments that would disqualify you

Since Sam lives with you and you're responsible for his care, you would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for him. Your ex-wife Tina would be eligible to claim for your daughter Ella who lives with her.

If you haven't already applied for Child Benefit, you can do so online through the UK government website or by completing and mailing a CH2 claim form.

2026-01-26T15:06:57.483676 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for Child Benefit for Sam. That's really helpful to know. I'll look into applying through the government website or getting that CH2 form. Just to be clear, since Sam is my only child living with me, I would get the higher "eldest child" rate for him, correct?

2026-01-26T15:07:00.114321 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility based on the scenario details - the user is eligible for Child Benefit for their 10-year-old son who lives with them, as they meet all the qualifying conditions.
