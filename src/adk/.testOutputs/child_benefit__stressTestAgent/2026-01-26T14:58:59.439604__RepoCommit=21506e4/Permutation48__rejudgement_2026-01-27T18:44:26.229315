2026-01-27T18:50:24.509457 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly determined the parent is eligible for Child Benefit. An HNC is a Level 4 qualification, which is considered "advanced education" (beyond A-Level standard), not "approved education." Child Benefit is only available for non-advanced education up to Level 3, so the correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
