2026-01-26T15:01:02.939215 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:01:04.279515 [actor]: Hello there! I'm looking into whether I'm eligible for Child Benefit. Yes, I'm responsible for my son Jack who is 14 years old.

2026-01-26T15:01:06.227601 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that you're responsible for your 14-year-old son Jack.

Next question: Is your son Jack living with you, or do you pay an equivalent amount to the Child Benefit rate toward their upkeep if they live with someone else?

2026-01-26T15:01:07.973029 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. Jack was actually placed in local authority care about 3 months ago. But he still comes home to stay with me every weekend - he arrives on Friday evening and leaves Sunday evening. So he's not living with me full-time anymore, but I do see him regularly on weekends.

2026-01-26T15:01:09.402338 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation. I understand that Jack is currently in local authority care but stays with you on weekends.

Next question: When Jack is in local authority care, are his accommodation and maintenance costs being fully met by the local authority?

2026-01-26T15:01:11.020314 [actor]: Yes, the local authority covers all his accommodation and maintenance costs during the weekdays when he's in their care. When he's with me on weekends, I take care of all his needs.

2026-01-26T15:01:15.640796 [root_agent]: I understand your situation better now. Thank you for explaining.

Based on the information you've shared, your eligibility for Child Benefit is affected by Jack being in local authority care. According to UK government guidelines, Child Benefit usually stops when a child goes into local authority care and the authority pays for their accommodation and maintenance. This is because the local authority is now providing for their main needs.

Since Jack has been in care for approximately 3 months with the local authority meeting his accommodation and maintenance costs during weekdays, you would likely not be eligible for the full Child Benefit payment.

However, since Jack regularly stays with you on weekends, you might be eligible for what's called a "weekly proportion" of Child Benefit for the days he stays with you (Friday evening to Sunday evening). This would need to be specifically requested and assessed.

Would you like me to ask more questions about your specific circumstances to provide more detailed information?

2026-01-26T15:01:17.698295 [actor]: So you're saying I wouldn't get the full Child Benefit payment, but I might get a portion for the weekends when Jack is with me? I thought since he stays with me for two nights in a row every weekend (Friday and Saturday nights), I might still be eligible for the full payment. Is that not the case?

2026-01-26T15:01:23.239910 [root_agent]: Thank you for your follow-up question. I need to clarify this important point.

When a child is in local authority care and their accommodation and maintenance are being fully covered by the local authority (as in Jack's case during weekdays), the full Child Benefit payment typically stops, regardless of regular weekend visits.

According to the UK government guidelines, you would not be eligible for the full Child Benefit payment in this situation. The system works on who has primary responsibility for the child, and when a child is in local authority care, they are considered the primary caregiver.

For weekend stays, you may be eligible for what's called a "weekly proportion" of Child Benefit only for the days Jack is with you. This would be approximately 2/7 of the full weekly rate (representing Friday and Saturday nights). This is not automatic - you would need to contact the Child Benefit Office to request this arrangement.

The regular weekend visits, even though consistent, don't qualify for full payment when the child is officially in local authority care for the majority of the week.

Would you like information about how to apply for this proportional payment or do you have other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-26T15:01:25.575510 [actor]: I understand now. So I'd need to contact the Child Benefit Office to request the partial payment for the weekends when Jack is with me. That makes sense. I appreciate you explaining this to me. I'll get in touch with them to sort out the proportional payment.

2026-01-26T15:01:28.500842 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent explained that when a child is in local authority care with costs covered by the authority (as in Jack's case), the parent is not eligible for full Child Benefit but may receive a proportional payment for weekend stays.
