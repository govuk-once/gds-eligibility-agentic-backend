2026-01-26T15:17:27.410080 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your eligibility according to UK government rules.

First question: Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:17:28.620693 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Leo. He's 12 years old.

2026-01-26T15:17:30.113723 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. It's helpful to know that you have a 12-year-old son named Leo.

Next question: Do you and Leo live in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:17:30.971880 [actor]: Yes, we live in the UK.

2026-01-26T15:17:32.250463 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: Are you raising Leo in your home? (This means you're responsible for his day-to-day care)

2026-01-26T15:17:33.769846 [actor]: Well, Leo is actually in local authority care. He comes home to visit me every Saturday at 10:00 AM and returns to the care home on Sunday at 11:00 AM.

2026-01-26T15:17:36.902409 [root_agent]: I see. Thank you for sharing this important information about Leo's living situation.

Since Leo is in local authority care, this affects your Child Benefit eligibility. Based on UK government rules, you generally cannot get Child Benefit for a child who is in local authority care. However, there are some exceptions for when a child visits home.

For a child in care, you may be able to get Child Benefit for the weeks when the child regularly spends at least 24 hours with you. In your case, since Leo stays with you from Saturday morning until Sunday morning, which appears to be about 24-25 hours each week, you might be eligible for Child Benefit for those weeks.

Next question: Has Leo been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks now?

2026-01-26T15:17:37.888838 [actor]: Yes, he's been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks now.

2026-01-26T15:17:40.871507 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared, since Leo has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, but regularly stays with you for at least 24 hours each week (from Saturday 10:00 AM to Sunday 11:00 AM), you may be eligible for Child Benefit, but only for the weeks when these visits occur.

According to UK government rules, when a child has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, Child Benefit can still be paid for weeks when the child regularly spends at least 24 hours with the person responsible for them.

Next question: Has anyone else (such as another parent or guardian) claimed Child Benefit for Leo?

2026-01-26T15:17:41.856193 [actor]: No, nobody else has claimed Child Benefit for Leo.

2026-01-26T15:17:44.869419 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else has claimed Child Benefit for Leo.

Based on all the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit, but only for the weeks when Leo regularly stays with you for at least 24 hours (your Saturday to Sunday visits). Since Leo has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, this partial eligibility applies.

To claim Child Benefit in this situation, you would need to:
1. Fill out a Child Benefit claim form (CH2)
2. Explain Leo's circumstances (being in local authority care but visiting you regularly)
3. Provide evidence of the regular visits if requested

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility or how to make a claim?

2026-01-26T15:17:47.431127 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know about my eligibility. I'm glad to hear I can receive Child Benefit for the weeks when Leo visits me. I'll make sure to fill out the CH2 form and explain our situation. Is there any specific documentation I should gather to prove that he visits me regularly? I want to make sure I have everything prepared when I submit my claim.

2026-01-26T15:17:50.068444 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that for a child in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, Child Benefit can still be paid for weeks when the child regularly spends at least 24 hours with the parent, which applies to the weekend visits.
