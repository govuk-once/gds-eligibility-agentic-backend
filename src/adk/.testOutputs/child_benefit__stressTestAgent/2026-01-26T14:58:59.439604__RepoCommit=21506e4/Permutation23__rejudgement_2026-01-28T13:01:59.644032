According to gov.uk guidelines, a non-resident parent who contributes at least the minimum weekly rate of Child Benefit (£26.05) to their child's upkeep can qualify, even if the child lives with someone else. The user provides £30/week equivalent through regular bulk purchases, which exceeds this threshold.
