2026-01-26T15:06:18.445600 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your situation.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T15:06:19.286707 [actor]: Yes, I have my granddaughter Lucia living with me. She's 14 years old.

2026-01-26T15:06:21.330329 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. So you have your 14-year-old granddaughter Lucia living with you. 

Are you the person who is mainly responsible for caring for Lucia? By this, I mean are you the person who has the main day-to-day responsibility for her care?

2026-01-26T15:06:22.861167 [actor]: Yes, I am the main person responsible for Lucia. She lives with me full-time, and I take care of all her day-to-day needs. I pay for everything she needs - food, clothing, school supplies, everything.

2026-01-26T15:06:24.022015 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Is Lucia's parent or parents also living in your household?

2026-01-26T15:06:25.182095 [actor]: No, her parents don't live with us. They're unable to care for her, which is why she lives with me. They don't contribute financially either.

2026-01-26T15:06:26.353875 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

May I ask, are you currently receiving any payments from a local authority (council) or other organization for looking after Lucia?

2026-01-26T15:06:27.898331 [actor]: No, I don't receive any payments from the council or any other organization. This is just an informal family arrangement. There's no official court order or fostering arrangement in place. I'm just her grandmother taking care of her because her parents can't.

2026-01-26T15:06:29.129009 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Is Lucia a UK citizen, or does she have the right to reside in the UK? And has she been living in the UK for the relevant period?

2026-01-26T15:06:30.038166 [actor]: Yes, Lucia is a UK citizen. She was born here and has lived here her whole life.

2026-01-26T15:06:32.942560 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Lucia is a UK citizen.

Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Lucia because:

1. You are the person mainly responsible for her care
2. She is under 16 years old (she's 14)
3. She lives with you full-time
4. You're not receiving any payments from a local authority for her care
5. She is a UK citizen living in the UK

You can claim Child Benefit even as a grandparent if you're the main person responsible for raising the child, which you've confirmed you are.

Would you like me to provide information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:06:34.754837 [actor]: Yes, that would be very helpful. Could you please tell me how to apply for Child Benefit? I didn't realize I could claim it since I'm her grandmother rather than her parent.

2026-01-26T15:06:37.335898 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that grandparents who are the main carers for their grandchildren are eligible for Child Benefit when the child lives with them full-time and they meet the other eligibility criteria.
