2026-01-27T18:50:39.613563 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent initially said the parent "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" before learning about the Universal Credit. According to gov.uk guidelines, a parent stops getting Child Benefit if their child starts receiving Universal Credit. The agent should have definitively stated the outcome as "Not Eligible" rather than suggesting to contact the Child Benefit Office for clarification.
