2026-01-26T15:19:40.092202 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you several questions one by one.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:19:42.075682 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user asking about Child Benefit eligibility.

I have a 17-year-old son named Tom. He's taking a computer coding course that his future employer is paying for. They're covering all his course fees as part of an agreement that he'll work for them after he completes the training. He doesn't get paid while he's on the course though.

2026-01-26T15:19:44.423131 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit for your 17-year-old son Tom, I need to understand more about his education situation.

Is Tom's computer coding course considered an "approved education" under UK guidelines? Typically, approved education includes A-levels, NVQs, or other courses that are at least 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience.

2026-01-26T15:19:46.627401 [actor]: I'm not really sure if it counts as "approved education" to be honest. It's a proper computer coding course and he spends about 30 hours a week on it. The company is paying for everything because they want him to join them afterward. It's like they're investing in him, you know? But he doesn't get paid while he's doing the training.

2026-01-26T15:19:49.825422 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining the situation with Tom's computer coding course. The fact that he spends about 30 hours per week on a structured course is important information.

For Child Benefit purposes, approved education typically includes courses that:
- Are full-time (more than 12 hours per week of supervised study)
- Provide a qualification recognized by employers or educational institutions
- Are not considered advanced education (like university degrees)

The fact that an employer is sponsoring the training suggests it's a formal, recognized course.

To be certain about your eligibility, I need to ask: Is Tom living with you at home while taking this course?

2026-01-26T15:19:51.166489 [actor]: Yes, Tom lives at home with me while he's doing this course. The course center is close enough that he can commute there each day. He's been living with me all along.

2026-01-26T15:19:54.559537 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Tom lives with you at home while taking his course.

Based on what you've told me, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Tom because:
1. He is under 20 years old
2. He lives with you
3. He is in what appears to be qualifying education (full-time structured training of 30 hours per week)
4. The training is not advanced education and he's not being paid for it

However, there's one more important factor I need to ask about: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:19:55.934310 [actor]: No, neither my partner nor I earn anything close to that amount. Our combined household income is about £45,000 per year.

2026-01-26T15:19:59.491619 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your household income.

Based on all the details you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit for your 17-year-old son Tom because:

1. Tom is under 20 years old
2. He's in what appears to be qualifying full-time education/training (30 hours per week structured course)
3. He lives with you
4. Neither you nor your partner have an individual income over £60,000 (which would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

Since your household income is well below the £60,000 threshold, you should be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit amount without any tax charge.

I would recommend that you apply for Child Benefit if you haven't already done so. If you're already receiving it for Tom, you should continue to be eligible while he remains on this course and under 20 years old.

2026-01-26T15:20:01.333357 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know! It's good to hear that I can still get Child Benefit while Tom is on his coding course. I'll make sure my application is up to date.

2026-01-26T15:20:03.721694 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent was incorrect about Tom's training being qualifying education - employer-sponsored training that leads directly to employment is not approved education for Child Benefit purposes.
