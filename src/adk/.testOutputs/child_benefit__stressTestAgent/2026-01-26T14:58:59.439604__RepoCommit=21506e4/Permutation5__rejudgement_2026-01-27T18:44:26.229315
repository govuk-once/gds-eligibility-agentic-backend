2026-01-27T18:50:28.030714 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent provided incorrect information about eligibility. According to gov.uk guidelines, a non-resident parent who contributes at least the Child Benefit amount to the child's upkeep can claim Child Benefit if the resident parent is not claiming it. Mark is eligible in this scenario since he contributes more than the benefit amount and Jenny isn't claiming.
