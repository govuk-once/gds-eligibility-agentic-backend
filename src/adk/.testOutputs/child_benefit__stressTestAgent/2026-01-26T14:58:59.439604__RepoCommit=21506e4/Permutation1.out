2026-01-26T14:59:01.499794 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:59:02.526926 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Leo who's 8 years old. He lives with me and my husband Tom in Manchester.

2026-01-26T14:59:03.991798 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your 8-year-old son Leo who lives with you and your husband in Manchester.

Does Leo normally live with you, or does he spend equal or more time living with someone else?

2026-01-26T14:59:05.164940 [actor]: Leo lives with us full-time. Our home is his permanent residence.

2026-01-26T14:59:06.262916 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is Leo in school or receiving some form of approved education?

2026-01-26T14:59:07.272057 [actor]: Yes, Leo is in primary school. He's in Year 3.

2026-01-26T14:59:08.441521 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Leo is in primary school.

Is either you or your husband earning over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T14:59:09.572618 [actor]: No, neither of us earns that much. My husband Tom works as a teacher earning £35,000 a year, and I work part-time earning £15,000.

2026-01-26T14:59:11.012816 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about your household income.

Do you or your husband have immigration status that would prevent you from claiming public funds in the UK? (This is sometimes called "no recourse to public funds" or NRPF)

2026-01-26T14:59:12.265823 [actor]: No, we don't have any restrictions. Both my husband and I are UK nationals living in Manchester.

2026-01-26T14:59:15.446508 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying your nationality and status.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit for your son Leo. You:

1. Have responsibility for a child under 16 (Leo, who is 8)
2. Leo lives with you full-time
3. He's in approved education (primary school)
4. Neither you nor your husband earn over the £60,000 threshold that would require repayment through tax
5. You have no immigration restrictions preventing you from claiming

You can claim Child Benefit as Leo's parent. The current rates are £25.60 per week for your first child (or only child in your case). 

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T14:59:16.913341 [actor]: Yes, that sounds great! I'd appreciate knowing how to apply for the Child Benefit.
