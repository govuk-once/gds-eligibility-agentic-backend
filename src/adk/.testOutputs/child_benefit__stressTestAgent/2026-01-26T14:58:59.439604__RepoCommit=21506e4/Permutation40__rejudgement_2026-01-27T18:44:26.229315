The agent correctly identified that Simon's placement in a psychiatric unit is treated like hospital care, and the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit during this period as they maintain regular contact and parental involvement, with eligibility continuing since it's within the 12-week timeframe for hospital/residential accommodation.
