2026-01-26T15:11:39.771087 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility correctly, I'll need to ask you some questions one by one.

First, are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:11:40.962339 [actor]: Hi there. Yes, I have a daughter named Emma who is 18 years old. She's just started university this year.

2026-01-26T15:11:43.168242 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your daughter Emma is 18 and has started university, I'll need to understand more about her education situation.

Is Emma in approved education or training? For Child Benefit purposes, approved education typically includes full-time education such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or similar approved courses, but generally doesn't include university or higher education courses.

2026-01-26T15:11:45.239423 [actor]: Emma just finished her A-levels at college a few months ago and has now started her first year of a 3-year Bachelor's degree at university. She still lives at home with me and commutes to the university every day. Does that affect the child benefit?

2026-01-26T15:11:49.604027 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on what you've shared, I need to inform you that you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Emma anymore.

Child Benefit can continue for children aged 16 to 19 if they are in what's considered "approved education." However, university education (such as a Bachelor's degree) is not classified as approved education for Child Benefit purposes. 

Approved education typically includes:
- A-levels or similar qualifications
- Scottish Highers
- NVQs up to level 3
- Home education (if it started before age 16)
- Other similar approved courses

Since Emma has finished her A-levels and has now moved on to university education, she no longer qualifies for Child Benefit purposes, even though she continues to live at home with you.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T15:11:52.033118 [actor]: I see, so I'm not eligible for Child Benefit now that Emma is at university. That's disappointing but thank you for explaining it clearly. Does it matter that she's still living at home with me? Or are there any other benefits I might be eligible for to help with her education costs?

2026-01-26T15:11:54.218682 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available for children attending university, regardless of whether they live at home, as university education is not considered "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes.
