2026-01-16T10:54:16.369709 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child, as eligibility is based on that relationship).

2026-01-16T10:54:17.074574 [actor]: Child benefit son studying

2026-01-16T10:54:18.035540 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying – so you're potentially claiming for a son who is studying.

To assess eligibility, let's start with your son. How old is your son?

2026-01-16T10:54:18.763450 [actor]: Dev 19 student

2026-01-16T10:54:20.169460 [root_agent]: Thanks! So your son, Dev, is 19 and a student. 

Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 18, but can continue if they are in approved education or training.

Is Dev studying a full-time course?

2026-01-16T10:54:20.977881 [actor]: A levels full time

2026-01-16T10:54:22.260117 [root_agent]: Great, that's helpful to know. So Dev is 19 and studying A-Levels full-time.

To confirm, are you Dev’s parent or legal guardian? (This is important as Child Benefit is usually paid to the parent or guardian).

2026-01-16T10:54:23.021912 [actor]: Father Raj 50

2026-01-16T10:54:24.557892 [root_agent]: Thank you, Raj. So you are Dev’s father and you are 50 years old.

Now, to clarify your National Insurance number situation (as this impacts eligibility), have you paid or been credited with National Insurance contributions for at least any one year? (Don't share your actual number, just a yes or no answer is fine).

2026-01-16T10:54:25.362530 [actor]: Yes contributions

2026-01-16T10:54:26.605521 [root_agent]: Excellent, that's good to know. You have paid National Insurance contributions.

Finally, is Dev living with you? This helps determine eligibility, as there are different rules if a young person is living elsewhere while studying.

2026-01-16T10:54:27.322483 [actor]: Lives with me

2026-01-16T10:54:31.394328 [root_agent]: Okay, Raj, that's very helpful. To summarise:

*   You are Dev's father and are 50 years old.
*   Dev is 19 years old and studying A-Levels full-time.
*   You have paid National Insurance contributions.
*   Dev lives with you.

Based on this information, it appears you *are* likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Dev. As he’s 19 and in full-time education, the benefit can continue beyond age 18, provided you meet the National Insurance requirements which you do, and he lives with you.

However, please keep in mind I am an AI and this is not definitive financial advice. You can find more detailed information on the government website: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-16T10:54:32.334778 [actor]: Birthday next week 20 years

2026-01-16T10:54:34.481844 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Raj. So Dev will be 20 years old next week.

That changes things slightly. Child Benefit usually stops when a young person turns 20, even if they are still in full-time education. There are very limited exceptions to this (for example, if they started their course before they turned 19).

Could you please confirm when Dev started his A-Level course? (Just the year is fine).

2026-01-16T10:54:35.473311 [actor]: Started last year

2026-01-16T10:54:38.217311 [root_agent]: Okay, so Dev started his A-Level course last year.

Given that Dev will turn 20 next week and started his A-Levels after his 19th birthday, it unfortunately means that Child Benefit will likely end when he turns 20.

I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. You can find more detailed information about this on the government website: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)

Is there anything else I can clarify for you, Raj? Perhaps information about other potential support available?

2026-01-16T10:54:41.721750 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed me that Child Benefit would stop when Dev turns 20, which is accurate since he started his A-Level course after turning 19.
