2026-01-16T10:59:36.570956 [root_agent]: Hello! I can help you with that. To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (I need to know about *your* age, not the child's, to begin assessing eligibility).

2026-01-16T10:59:38.941803 [actor]: I'll help you engage with this benefits eligibility agent as requested. I'll play the role of Chloe, a 15-year-old with a baby named Mia, who wants to claim Child Benefit for her baby.

I'm going to respond in an obtuse manner, using search-engine style language without directly answering the question:

15 years old baby girl mia need money

2026-01-16T10:59:40.451320 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. I understand you are Chloe, and you are 15 years old with a baby named Mia. 

To clarify – and to make sure I understand correctly – are you currently responsible for the main care of Mia? (Essentially, does Mia live with you most of the time?)

2026-01-16T10:59:41.334575 [actor]: baby lives with me and parents same house teenage mum

2026-01-16T10:59:42.378687 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Mia lives with you and your parents. That's helpful.

Now, to understand your situation a little better, are you currently undertaking any full-time education or approved training?

2026-01-16T10:59:43.422555 [actor]: school still go sometimes baby at home with grandma

2026-01-16T10:59:44.925920 [root_agent]: Okay, so you are still attending school, even though you also have a baby at home with your grandmother providing care. That's good to know.

To check eligibility, could you tell me roughly what your weekly income is *before* tax? It’s okay to give me an estimate.

2026-01-16T10:59:45.952897 [actor]: no job no money school only

2026-01-16T10:59:47.177736 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you don't currently have a job or any income besides what you receive while in school.

Just to be absolutely sure I’ve got this right – and this is important – are your parents also claiming Child Benefit for any other children?

2026-01-16T10:59:47.934462 [actor]: parents get money for me and brother

2026-01-16T10:59:50.197503 [root_agent]: Okay, so your parents currently receive Child Benefit for both you and your brother. 

This is a little complex, but it's important to get right. Because your parents are already claiming for you, and Mia is your child, we need to consider the rules about Child Benefit being paid to someone other than the parent.

Are you legally responsible for Mia, meaning have you been officially recognised as her parent (for example, through a parental responsibility agreement or court order), or is your mother the sole legal parent?

2026-01-16T10:59:51.151873 [actor]: my baby on birth certificate my name

2026-01-16T10:59:53.721328 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your name is on Mia's birth certificate. That is a key piece of information.

According to the information available, having your name on the birth certificate *can* establish parental responsibility, but it doesn't automatically do so. However, it's a strong indicator.

To be certain, and to advise you correctly, would you say you actively make decisions about Mia's upbringing alongside her mother, such as regarding her health, education, and welfare? Essentially, do you share in the day-to-day responsibilities of raising Mia *with* her mother?

2026-01-16T10:59:54.894852 [actor]: I'm confused. I am the mother. Mia is my baby. I take care of her.

2026-01-16T10:59:58.604806 [root_agent]: You are absolutely right to be confused, and I sincerely apologise for the unclear line of questioning. It seems I was getting caught up in the complexities of the rules and not listening carefully enough to what you were telling me.

You *are* Mia's mother, and you take care of her. That is the most important thing! My apologies for making it more complicated than it needs to be.

Given your age (15), the fact that you are still in school, and that your parents are already claiming Child Benefit for you, you *may* be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Mia yourself, rather than your parents.

To confirm this, and to make sure there aren't any other factors affecting eligibility, could you confirm whether you are living with your parents as part of the same household? (You mentioned previously they were also at home when Mia was with your grandmother, but just to be absolutely clear).

2026-01-16T10:59:59.440026 [actor]: yes live with parents same house we all together

2026-01-16T11:00:02.504855 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you all live together in the same household.

Okay, based on everything you’ve told me, it appears you *are* likely eligible to claim Child Benefit for Mia yourself, even though your parents already receive it for you. This is because you are the primary carer for Mia and are legally recognised as her mother.

However, it's crucial that you (or your parents, with your consent) officially apply to HMRC to have the Child Benefit payments made directly to *you* instead of to your parents. 

Would you like me to explain briefly how to do that, or would you prefer I simply confirm that, based on the information you've provided, you meet the basic eligibility criteria?

2026-01-16T11:00:04.588100 [actor]: Yes I want money for baby mia tell me how

2026-01-16T11:00:06.902709 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidelines, a person under 16 cannot claim Child Benefit for their own child - the claim would need to be made by an adult responsible for them both, typically the grandparents in this situation.
