2026-01-16T10:47:29.040584 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the person claiming for a child, or if you are the child yourself!).

2026-01-16T10:47:30.231148 [actor]: I'll assume the role of Mark in this situation and interact with the agent accordingly.

Mark 40 divorced son 10

2026-01-16T10:47:31.881280 [root_agent]: Okay, Mark, thank you for letting me know. That’s helpful.

Given you are 40 and have a 10-year-old son, the next question is: Do you share the primary care of your son with anyone else, such as your ex-partner? This will help me understand the living arrangements.

2026-01-16T10:47:32.875137 [actor]: Ex wife has son send money for food clothing

2026-01-16T10:47:34.120225 [root_agent]: Thanks, Mark. So your ex-wife provides financial support for your son, specifically for food and clothing.

To clarify the living arrangements, does your son live with you for the majority of the time? (More than half the week, on average?).

2026-01-16T10:47:34.999847 [actor]: Son lives with ex wife send £150 monthly for Lucas expenses

2026-01-16T10:47:37.224606 [root_agent]: Okay, Mark, thank you for clarifying. Your son lives primarily with his mother, and you contribute £150 per month towards his expenses.

Based on this information, and checking the guidance, it sounds like you may *not* be eligible to claim Child Benefit yourself. Generally, Child Benefit is paid to the person with main responsibility for the child. However, there are exceptions.

To be sure, could you tell me – does your ex-wife currently claim Child Benefit for your son?

2026-01-16T10:47:38.349581 [actor]: Jenny not claiming child benefit wants me to

2026-01-16T10:47:40.831879 [root_agent]: Thank you, Mark. So your ex-wife, Jenny, isn't currently claiming Child Benefit, but she would like you to do so.

In this situation, and according to the guidance, you *may* be able to claim, even though your son lives primarily with his mother. This is because the person responsible for the child can be the one who claims. 

To confirm, are you providing financial support *in addition to* the £150, such as paying for activities or school trips? Essentially, are you contributing significantly towards his overall upkeep?

2026-01-16T10:47:41.703780 [actor]: £150 monthly clothes food school things

2026-01-16T10:47:44.479883 [root_agent]: Okay, Mark, so the £150 each month covers clothes, food, and school-related expenses. That's helpful to know.

Given that your ex-wife isn't claiming and you are contributing significantly to your son’s expenses, it *is* likely you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit. However, there’s one final check I need to make.

Are you currently working, and if so, roughly what is your annual income? (This is because Child Benefit can be affected by your own income, although the threshold is quite high). You don’t need to be exact, just an approximate figure.

2026-01-16T10:47:45.305525 [actor]: Work as electrician £55000

2026-01-16T10:47:48.950819 [root_agent]: Thank you, Mark. An income of £55,000 as an electrician means your Child Benefit may be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge. 

Here's how it works: because your income is over £50,000, for every £100 you earn *above* £50,000, you’ll have to pay back 1% of the Child Benefit you receive.

So, in your case, as you earn £5,000 above the threshold, you would need to repay 1% of the total Child Benefit amount received each tax year.

Despite this charge, you *are* still eligible to claim. You would simply need to report the excess income on your Self Assessment tax return.

Would you like me to summarise the situation, and confirm your eligibility with the charge explained?

2026-01-16T10:47:52.749321 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated Mark was eligible to claim Child Benefit when the child lives primarily with the ex-wife who should be the one claiming, as Child Benefit is paid to the person who has main responsibility for the child.
