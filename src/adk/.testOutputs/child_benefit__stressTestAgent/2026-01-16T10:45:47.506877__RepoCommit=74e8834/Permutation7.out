2026-01-16T10:48:22.696261 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the person claiming for a child, or if you are the child yourself!).

2026-01-16T10:48:24.481772 [actor]: I'll help by engaging with the agent as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility, based on the specific scenario provided.

I'll play the role of David, a 55-year-old single father whose son Jack (14) is in local authority care but stays with him on weekends.

55 looking for child benefit my son in care

2026-01-16T10:48:26.422503 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, David. It's good to know you are 55 and your son, Jack, is 14. 

To clarify, you mentioned Jack is in local authority care but stays with you on weekends. Could you tell me, on average, how many nights a week does Jack stay with you? This is important as it affects eligibility when a child lives with someone other than their main carer.

2026-01-16T10:48:27.269735 [actor]: Stays Friday Saturday go back Sunday nights

2026-01-16T10:48:29.142712 [root_agent]: Thank you, David. So Jack stays with you for two nights a week – Friday and Saturday nights.

Now, just to be clear, is Jack’s main home considered to be with the local authority, or with you? This helps determine who is eligible to claim Child Benefit. If he spends more time with the local authority, they would likely be considered his main carer.





2026-01-16T10:48:30.245933 [actor]: Local authority care 3 months but home weekends

2026-01-16T10:48:32.313710 [root_agent]: Okay, David, thank you for confirming that Jack has been in local authority care for 3 months, but continues to come home to you on weekends.

To help me understand your situation fully, could you tell me if you are currently receiving any benefits in your own right, such as a pension or income support? This is because your income doesn’t usually affect your Child Benefit claim, but other benefits *can* sometimes have an impact.

2026-01-16T10:48:33.080493 [actor]: No benefits single father

2026-01-16T10:48:37.075232 [root_agent]: Thank you, David. It’s helpful to know you are a single father and not currently receiving any other benefits.

Based on the information you've provided so far – you are 55, your son Jack is 14 and in local authority care but stays with you two nights a week, and you receive no other benefits – it *sounds* like you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit. 

However, the rules around children in care can be complex. According to the information I have, you can claim Child Benefit if you have day-to-day care for a child, even if they are also being looked after by a local authority. The fact that Jack spends weekends with you suggests you have that day-to-day care.

Before I can be more certain, could you confirm that the local authority *doesn't* already claim Child Benefit for Jack? It's possible they are already receiving it, and only one person can claim.

2026-01-16T10:48:37.874886 [actor]: Don't know about local authority claim

2026-01-16T10:48:40.547608 [root_agent]: Okay, David, that's perfectly alright. It's understandable you wouldn't necessarily know if the local authority is already claiming.

In that case, the best course of action would be to check with the local authority to find out if they are currently claiming Child Benefit for Jack. You could ask their social worker or the team responsible for his care.

If they *are not* claiming, then you should be eligible to apply yourself. If they *are* claiming, you won’t be able to claim as well.

Would you like me to summarise the key points of our conversation and the next steps you should take?

2026-01-16T10:48:41.482245 [actor]: So am I eligible then yes or no

2026-01-16T10:48:44.633924 [root_agent]: David, I understand you'd like a definitive yes or no. Based on the information you've given me, it's *likely* you are eligible, **but with a crucial condition:**

**It depends on whether the local authority is already claiming Child Benefit for Jack.**

I cannot say definitively "yes" because we don't have that information. You need to check with the local authority to find out if they are claiming. If they aren't, then you can apply. If they are, then you cannot.

I apologise that I can’t give you a simple “yes” or “no” right now, but I want to be accurate and ensure you don’t apply unnecessarily. Does that make sense?

2026-01-16T10:48:47.093808 [actor]: I understand. Thank you for trying to help. Will check with social worker about local authority claim.

2026-01-16T10:48:48.724334 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that eligibility depends on whether the local authority is already claiming Child Benefit for Jack, which is correct since only one party can claim.
