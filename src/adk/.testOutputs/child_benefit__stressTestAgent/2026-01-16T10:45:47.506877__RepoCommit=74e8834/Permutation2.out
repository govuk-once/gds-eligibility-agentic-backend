2026-01-16T10:46:10.762648 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (Child Benefit is paid to people responsible for a child under 16).

2026-01-16T10:46:12.129500 [actor]: I'll role-play as a person inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility, based on the given scenario.

daughter school A-levels Priya 17 single dad London

2026-01-16T10:46:14.916931 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for the extra information. It's good to know you are a single dad and your daughter, Priya, is 17 and studying A-Levels in London.

Since Priya is 17, and still in full-time education (A-Levels qualify as full-time education), she *could* still be eligible for Child Benefit. However, eligibility continues until the end of the day of their 19th birthday, or the end of the day before they start work or training, whichever is earlier. 

To confirm, are you Priya’s primary caregiver? (Meaning, do you mainly look after her?)





2026-01-16T10:46:16.051870 [actor]: yes live with daughter at home in London raise her myself since 9 years old

2026-01-16T10:46:18.358455 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are Priya’s primary caregiver and have been raising her yourself since she was 9 years old. That’s helpful to know. 

Now, regarding your income, are you currently employed or self-employed? Child Benefit isn't affected by your income, but there's a related benefit called Guardian's Allowance which *is* income-dependent, and it might be something you could also be eligible for. So, knowing your employment status will help me assess that possibility too.

2026-01-16T10:46:19.512344 [actor]: work full time software company £40,000 salary no other income

2026-01-16T10:46:22.276360 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So you work full-time in a software company with a salary of £40,000, and have no other income.

Based on the information so far, you *appear* to be eligible for Child Benefit as Priya is under 19, in full-time education, and you are her primary caregiver. Your income doesn’t affect eligibility for Child Benefit itself.

However, with your salary, you might also be eligible for Guardian’s Allowance. To confirm this, could you please confirm whether Priya’s mother is also contributing to the costs of raising her? (Even if it's a small amount).

2026-01-16T10:46:23.191840 [actor]: daughter mother not in picture single parent household

2026-01-16T10:46:25.581960 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Priya’s mother isn’t involved and you’re in a single-parent household.

Based on everything you’ve told me – you’re the primary caregiver, Priya is 17 and in full-time education, your salary is £40,000, and you’re a single parent – you **are** likely eligible for both Child Benefit *and* Guardian’s Allowance. 

Would you like me to summarise the key points? Or would you like me to check anything further?





2026-01-16T10:46:26.457798 [actor]: eligible for child benefit then?

2026-01-16T10:46:28.587602 [root_agent]: Yes, based on the information you've provided, you are likely eligible for Child Benefit! 

To recap: Your daughter Priya is under 19 and in full-time education, you are her primary caregiver, and your income doesn’t affect your eligibility for Child Benefit. You are also likely eligible for Guardian’s Allowance due to being a single parent.



Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit or Guardian's Allowance today?

2026-01-16T10:46:32.571360 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent made a mistake about Guardian's Allowance eligibility, as this benefit is only available if one parent has died or is missing, not simply for being a single parent.
