2026-01-16T11:12:51.049933 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for the child, and your age can affect eligibility.)

2026-01-16T11:12:53.226660 [actor]: I need to play the role of someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. Based on the context provided, I should act as James who doesn't live with his child and pays £50 weekly for child maintenance due to a court order.

I'll respond as the character would, being deliberately obtuse and speaking like someone typing search terms:

child benefit not living with child court order payment

2026-01-16T11:12:55.193361 [root_agent]: Okay James, thanks for clarifying your situation. It sounds like you're not living with your child and are making regular child maintenance payments through a court order.

To understand your potential eligibility for Child Benefit, could you tell me - even though you don't live with your child - do you have *day-to-day responsibility* for them? This means things like making decisions about their education or healthcare.





2026-01-16T11:12:56.626513 [actor]: court order 50 pounds weekly no day to day care child lives with mother

2026-01-16T11:12:58.381315 [root_agent]: Okay, James, thank you for confirming that the court order is for £50 a week and that you don't have day-to-day care of your child, and they live with their mother.

Given this information, are you contributing financially to the upkeep of the child, *beyond* the court-ordered maintenance payments? For example, do you contribute towards things like school trips or clothes?

2026-01-16T11:12:59.709441 [actor]: only pay court mandated amount forced payment not voluntary should count?

2026-01-16T11:13:02.525508 [root_agent]: James, that's a very good point to raise - whether a forced payment should count. 

To clarify, the rules state that simply having a legal obligation to pay maintenance doesn’t automatically disqualify you. However, generally, to be eligible while *not* having day-to-day care, you need to be contributing financially *in addition* to any maintenance payments.

However, there are exceptions. Could you tell me - is there anything in the court order itself that specifies how *all* of the child’s expenses are to be met, and that the £50 a week is intended to cover everything?

2026-01-16T11:13:03.455053 [actor]: court order just says pay 50 pounds weekly for child support mother decides rest

2026-01-16T11:13:06.311242 [root_agent]: Okay, James, so the court order simply states £50 weekly for child support, and the mother decides how the rest of the child’s expenses are covered.

In this situation, based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you are *not* eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state that if you don’t have day-to-day care and your contributions are limited to a set, court-ordered amount where the other parent decides on the rest, you generally don't qualify.

However, I want to be completely sure. Just to double-check, are you, or have you ever been, responsible for claiming Child Benefit for this child?

2026-01-16T11:13:07.195824 [actor]: never claimed benefits before mother gets the money

2026-01-16T11:13:09.509782 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, James. So the mother currently receives the Child Benefit.

Given everything you've told me – that you don’t live with the child, you don’t have day-to-day care, you only pay the court-ordered maintenance, and the mother receives the Child Benefit – it is highly likely you are not eligible to claim it yourself. 

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding this, or any other aspect of Child Benefit that you'd like to ask about?

2026-01-16T11:13:11.450764 [actor]: No want nothing else

2026-01-16T11:13:13.344642 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that James is not eligible for Child Benefit as he doesn't have day-to-day care of the child and only makes court-ordered maintenance payments without additional financial contributions.
