2026-01-16T11:00:22.931211 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (This helps me determine if you are the parent or guardian claiming for a child, as Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for the child).

2026-01-16T11:00:23.904497 [actor]: Jordan finished GCSEs not in college no job

2026-01-16T11:00:25.302258 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that context. So Jordan has finished their GCSEs, isn't currently in college or have a job.

To clarify, are *you* Jordan's parent or legal guardian? Child Benefit is usually paid to the parent or guardian who is primarily responsible for the child.

2026-01-16T11:00:25.998077 [actor]: Steve Jordan father

2026-01-16T11:00:27.008007 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you are Steve Jordan, and therefore Jordan's father.

Now, to assess eligibility, could you please tell me how old Jordan is currently?

2026-01-16T11:00:27.834467 [actor]: 17 not working not studying

2026-01-16T11:00:30.025488 [root_agent]: Okay, so Jordan is 17 years old, not working, and not currently studying. 

According to the rules, Child Benefit can be paid until a child turns 18, *as long as they are continuing in approved education or training*. Since Jordan is not studying, we need to check a few more things.

Are you, or your partner (if you have one), working more than 16 hours a week on average? (This relates to the earnings limits for Child Benefit).

2026-01-16T11:00:31.058626 [actor]: No partner alone Jordan done with school

2026-01-16T11:00:32.843762 [root_agent]: Okay, so you are alone and Jordan has finished school. That's helpful.

Given that Jordan is 17 and no longer in education or training, and you don’t have a partner, we need to look at your income.

What is your annual income *before* tax? (I need to know this to see if it exceeds the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold).

2026-01-16T11:00:33.788540 [actor]: Full time mechanic 35000

2026-01-16T11:00:36.620785 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you work full-time as a mechanic and earn £35,000 per year before tax.

Because your income is above £50,000, you may have to pay a tax charge if you receive Child Benefit for Jordan. The amount of the charge depends on your income. 

Since Jordan is 17 and not in approved education or training, Child Benefit will stop on the last day of August - which is when they turn 18 - unless they resume education or training before then.

Do you understand this information, or would you like me to explain any part of it in more detail?





2026-01-16T11:00:37.808864 [actor]: No not £50,000 just £35,000 mechanic 

Also want to know jordan benefit eligible

2026-01-16T11:00:42.055298 [root_agent]: You are absolutely right to correct me! My apologies – I incorrectly stated the threshold as £50,000. The High Income Child Benefit Charge starts when income exceeds £50,000, and you earn £35,000, so that is *not* a concern. Thank you for pointing out my mistake.

Let’s get back to Jordan’s eligibility. You said Jordan is 17, not working, and not studying. This means, as it stands, Jordan is no longer eligible for Child Benefit as they are not in approved education or training. However, eligibility continues until the 31st of August following their 16th birthday *if* they were in approved education or training.

To be absolutely sure, and considering Jordan *has* recently finished their GCSEs, was Jordan in full-time education before finishing their GCSEs? (e.g., attending school regularly).

2026-01-16T11:00:42.947106 [actor]: GCSEs done last year not in anything now

2026-01-16T11:00:45.493698 [root_agent]: Okay, so Jordan finished their GCSEs last year and hasn’t been in any kind of education or training since then.

Based on the information you’ve provided, and referring to the guidelines, you are **not currently eligible** to receive Child Benefit for Jordan. Child Benefit generally continues until a child turns 18 if they are in approved education or training. Since Jordan finished their GCSEs last year and is not currently engaged in any education or training, the entitlement has ended.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or any other questions you might have?

2026-01-16T11:00:48.046205 [actor]: Thank you for clearing that up. Not eligible for benefit since Jordan finished school and not in training. Nothing more to ask.

2026-01-16T11:00:49.810003 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available for a 17-year-old who is not in approved education or training after finishing GCSEs.
