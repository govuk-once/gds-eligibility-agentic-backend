2026-01-16T10:55:10.639468 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (This helps determine if you are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T10:55:11.842843 [actor]: I'm Maria, 60 years old, raising my granddaughter.

2026-01-16T10:55:12.631674 [root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. That's helpful to know.

Now, is your granddaughter living with you *most of the time*?

2026-01-16T10:55:13.556711 [actor]: Lucia lives with me all the time. Parents not around.

2026-01-16T10:55:14.653524 [root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. That's good to know.

To confirm, are you Lucia’s legal guardian? (For example, do you have a Guardianship Order from a court?).

2026-01-16T10:55:15.717992 [actor]: No papers. Just family arrangement. I take care of her.

2026-01-16T10:55:16.536940 [root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. I understand.

Could you please tell me Lucia's date of birth? I need to know her age to assess eligibility.

2026-01-16T10:55:17.466027 [actor]: She's 14 now.

2026-01-16T10:55:18.965211 [root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. That's helpful.

And finally, are you working (even part-time) or do you have any income from self-employment? This is to understand if your income might affect the amount of Child Benefit you could receive. It doesn’t automatically disqualify you, but it is a factor.

2026-01-16T10:55:19.714051 [actor]: Retired. Small pension.

2026-01-16T10:55:24.454545 [root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. That's very helpful.

Based on the information you've provided:

*   You are over 16 and caring for your granddaughter.
*   Your granddaughter lives with you full-time.
*   You are not her parent, but are providing care as a family arrangement.
*   Your granddaughter is 14 years old (under 20).
*   You have a small pension as your income.

Based on this, it appears you *are* likely eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucia. The fact you aren't her parent isn’t a barrier, as long as you are her main carer and she lives with you. Your pension income will be taken into account, but you may still be eligible for the full amount.

Would you like me to summarise this information again, or are you happy with this initial assessment?



**Please note:** I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. This is an initial assessment based on the information you’ve given me, and it's always best to confirm this with the official government website or relevant authorities.

2026-01-16T10:55:25.585475 [actor]: Yes thank you.

2026-01-16T10:55:28.279852 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly assessed that Maria is eligible for Child Benefit as she is the main carer for her 14-year-old granddaughter who lives with her full-time, even though she is not the legal guardian and only has a family arrangement.
