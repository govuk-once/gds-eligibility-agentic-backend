2026-01-16T11:09:52.347435 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (This helps determine if you are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T11:09:53.239759 [actor]: I'm the mother of Leo who's 12

2026-01-16T11:09:54.177177 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that you are Leo's mother. That's helpful!

Now, are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-16T11:09:54.892856 [actor]: UK resident yes

2026-01-16T11:09:55.966492 [root_agent]: Great! That confirms you're a UK resident.

To assess your eligibility further, could you please tell me – do you have any other children who are also under 20?

2026-01-16T11:09:56.655226 [actor]: just Leo

2026-01-16T11:09:58.580937 [root_agent]: Okay, so Leo is your only child under 20. That's good to know.

Now, are you working, and if so, approximately how many hours per week do you work? (Even if it's a small number of hours, please let me know). This is important because your income and working hours can affect eligibility, particularly if you're claiming for a child aged 16 or over.

2026-01-16T11:09:59.347698 [actor]: work full time 40 hours

2026-01-16T11:10:00.837696 [root_agent]: Thank you. Working full-time at 40 hours a week is relevant information.

To help me understand your situation fully, could you please tell me your annual income *before* tax? (An approximate amount is fine for now). This is because there are income thresholds that can affect Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-16T11:10:01.646358 [actor]: £28000

2026-01-16T11:10:04.215756 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. An annual income of £28,000 is helpful information. 

As Leo is 12 years old, and you work over 16 hours a week, and your income is below £50,000, it looks like you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. However, there's a High Income Child Benefit Charge to be aware of.

To confirm, are you, or your partner (if you have one), a 'high earner'? That means does either of your individual incomes exceed £50,000 per year?

2026-01-16T11:10:05.036961 [actor]: no high earner

2026-01-16T11:10:07.524580 [root_agent]: Excellent! That’s good to know.

Given the information you’ve provided: you are the mother of a 12-year-old (Leo), you live in the UK, you work full-time (40 hours a week), your income is below £50,000, and neither you nor your partner (if applicable) are high earners, it appears you *are* eligible for Child Benefit.

Would you like me to summarise all the points we've covered? Or would you like to know more about making a claim?

2026-01-16T11:10:08.422771 [actor]: Leo in care home visits on weekends

2026-01-16T11:10:10.471391 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about Leo’s care home arrangement and your weekend visits. This changes things, and requires me to check some specific rules.

According to the guidance, Child Benefit can continue to be paid while a child is in full-time residential care, *but* there are specific conditions. It depends on why Leo is in the care home.

Could you please tell me – is Leo in the care home due to a disability?

2026-01-16T11:10:11.208018 [actor]: social services care

2026-01-16T11:10:13.089740 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Leo is in care under the arrangements of Social Services.

According to the guidance, if a child is in full-time residential care arranged by Social Services, Child Benefit *usually* stops after 12 weeks. However, there are exceptions.

To be certain, could you please confirm if Leo’s care is due to a disability? This is important as different rules apply in that circumstance.

2026-01-16T11:10:13.905824 [actor]: local authority care no disability

2026-01-16T11:10:16.667222 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that Leo is in local authority care and does not have a disability.

In this situation, as Leo is in full-time residential care arranged by the local authority and doesn’t have a disability, your Child Benefit will likely stop 12 weeks after he entered the care home.

I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. While you were initially eligible, the change in Leo’s living arrangements affects your entitlement.

Would you like me to summarise everything we’ve discussed, or would you like me to point you to the relevant information on the government website about Child Benefit and children in care?

2026-01-16T11:10:17.618812 [actor]: Leo comes home 10am Saturday return 11am Sunday

2026-01-16T11:10:21.038504 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that very important detail about Leo’s weekend visits home.

My apologies, I missed considering that. Leo is *not* in full-time residential care because he returns home for weekends. The rules state that Child Benefit can continue as long as the child isn’t living away from home for more than 28 days. Weekend visits clearly demonstrate he isn’t living away from home full-time.

Therefore, based on all the information you’ve provided – you *are* still eligible for Child Benefit. 

I sincerely apologise for the previous incorrect assessment. It's important to get all the details, and I appreciate you clarifying Leo's weekend visits.

Would you like me to summarise everything, or would you like information on how to claim (or ensure your claim is up to date)?

2026-01-16T11:10:22.149138 [actor]: every weekend comes home

2026-01-16T11:10:25.516709 [root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad we clarified the situation and that Leo comes home every weekend. That makes a significant difference to your eligibility.

To summarise:

*   You are Leo’s mother and a UK resident.
*   Leo is 12 years old.
*   You work 40 hours a week and earn £28,000 per year.
*   Leo lives in a care home but returns home every weekend, meaning he isn’t in full-time residential care.

Therefore, you *are* eligible for Child Benefit.

Would you like a link to the page on the gov.uk website where you can claim Child Benefit, or find out more about it? Alternatively, is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-16T11:10:26.381186 [actor]: since when

2026-01-16T11:10:29.502366 [root_agent]: That's a good question! The rules regarding weekend visits and Child Benefit entitlement haven't changed recently, but the guidance was updated to clarify the definition of 'full-time residential care'. 

As long as Leo has been consistently coming home every weekend, you should be eligible for Child Benefit from the date he started living in the care home. However, if there was a period where he didn't return for weekends, that could affect the dates of entitlement.

To be completely sure about backdating a claim, or if you're unsure when his care arrangements began, it's best to contact the Child Benefit helpline directly. They can look at your specific circumstances.

Would you like me to provide you with the contact information for the Child Benefit helpline?

2026-01-16T11:10:30.455334 [actor]: has been in care 3 years

2026-01-16T11:10:35.437518 [root_agent]: Okay, so Leo has been in care for 3 years, and consistently comes home every weekend. That's very helpful to know.

Given this long-term arrangement of weekend visits, and assuming it’s been consistent throughout those 3 years, you should be able to claim (or reclaim) Child Benefit for the entire period he's been in care, as he hasn't been living away from home full-time.

Here's the link to the gov.uk page about claiming Child Benefit: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/how-to-claim](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/how-to-claim)

And here's the contact information for the Child Benefit helpline, if you'd like to discuss your specific case or backdating a claim:

**Child Benefit helpline:**
*   **Telephone:** 0300 200 3100
*   **Textphone:** 0300 200 3101
*   **Opening hours:** Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm

2026-01-16T11:10:36.447937 [actor]: child benefit when child in care

2026-01-16T11:10:42.120253 [root_agent]: You're right to ask about Child Benefit specifically when a child is in care – it can be a bit complex!

Here’s a summary of the key points, based on our conversation:

*   **Not Full-Time Care:** If your child comes home for regular visits (like weekends), they are *not* considered to be in full-time residential care.
*   **Eligibility Continues:** As long as your child isn’t living away from home for more than 28 days, you can continue to claim Child Benefit.
*   **Leo’s Situation:** Because Leo comes home every weekend, you *are* eligible for Child Benefit.
*   **Backdating:** You may be able to claim backdated Child Benefit for the period he's been in care, provided the weekend visits have been consistent.
*   **Disability:** If the care is due to a disability, different rules apply.

Here's a direct link to the government page explaining Child Benefit and children in care, which might be helpful: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else)

I hope this clarifies things! Do you have any other questions about this, or anything else I can help you with?

2026-01-16T11:10:43.244082 [actor]: is 25 hours enough

2026-01-16T11:10:46.010070 [root_agent]: You’re asking if working 25 hours a week is enough to qualify for Child Benefit, correct?

Yes, working 25 hours a week *is* enough to potentially qualify for Child Benefit, especially as Leo is 12 years old. The key threshold is 16 hours a week. As long as you work 16 hours or more, your own income is generally not a factor in whether you can receive Child Benefit.

However, if your income (or your partner's) exceeds £50,000, you may have to pay a High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Does that answer your question?

2026-01-16T11:10:47.023996 [actor]: Leo home for 25 hours weekly

2026-01-16T11:10:50.125900 [root_agent]: You're clarifying that Leo is home for 25 hours each week - that's excellent information and confirms he isn't in full-time care!

As we've discussed, because Leo comes home for 25 hours weekly, he's not considered to be living away from home full-time. This means you *are* eligible for Child Benefit, provided you meet the other criteria (which you do - you're a UK resident, working over 16 hours, and your income is below the high-income threshold).

It sounds like you’re well within the eligibility requirements due to the amount of time Leo spends at home.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your Child Benefit claim?

2026-01-16T11:10:54.187047 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent was ultimately correct that I am eligible for Child Benefit since my child spends regular weekend time at home (25 hours weekly), meaning they are not considered to be in full-time residential care.
