2026-01-16T10:57:59.430305 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T10:58:00.548383 [actor]: I'll role-play as someone inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

son school residential 14 years old

2026-01-16T10:58:02.093677 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, you are the parent or guardian of a 14-year-old son who is currently attending a residential school? Is that correct?



I’m asking to ensure I understand the situation accurately, as eligibility can depend on where a child lives.

2026-01-16T10:58:03.025791 [actor]: son Tom residential school council pays behavior needs

2026-01-16T10:58:04.761050 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So your son, Tom, is at a residential school, and the local council pays for his placement due to his behavioural needs.

To confirm, is this a school that’s specifically for children with special educational needs, or is it a mainstream school with a residential element?



I’m checking as the reason for the residential placement can affect eligibility.

2026-01-16T10:58:05.610883 [actor]: special school behavior problems residential accommodation not in care

2026-01-16T10:58:07.536125 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Tom attends a special school with residential accommodation because of behavioural problems, and he is *not* currently in care.

Now, could you please tell me – do you, or your partner (if you have one), have an annual income of more than £50,000?



This is because Child Benefit starts to reduce if either parent's individual income is over this amount.

2026-01-16T10:58:08.493569 [actor]: income not that much single parent

2026-01-16T10:58:10.141176 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you are a single parent and your income is not more than £50,000. That's helpful!

Now, just to be certain – does anyone else contribute to the upkeep of Tom, or provide him with financial support?



I'm checking to ensure there aren’t other factors that might affect eligibility.

2026-01-16T10:58:10.850036 [actor]: nobody else pay for Tom

2026-01-16T10:58:13.563469 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that nobody else contributes financially to Tom's care.

Based on the information you've provided so far – that you are the parent of a 14-year-old son in a special residential school funded by the council due to behavioural needs, you are a single parent with an income under £50,000, and no one else financially supports Tom – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit.



However, just to be completely sure, could you confirm that Tom usually lives with you, even though he's currently at residential school?

2026-01-16T10:58:14.363862 [actor]: live with me when not school

2026-01-16T10:58:17.563667 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Tom lives with you when he is not at school.

Based on all the information you've provided, you **should be eligible** for Child Benefit. Your son is under 20, in full-time education, and usually lives with you. His residential school placement, funded by the council for his behavioural needs, doesn't appear to disqualify you. And your income is below the threshold for a reduction.

 
Would you like me to summarise everything we've discussed? Or perhaps you have any other questions?



*Please note:* While I can assess likely eligibility based on the information provided, I am not a legal advisor. This is not a definitive determination, and you may wish to double-check with the official government resources.

2026-01-16T10:58:18.367146 [actor]: how long Tom at school?

2026-01-16T10:58:19.795286 [root_agent]: That's a good question! The length of time Tom is at school *could* affect things.

Is Tom’s residential school placement intended to be long-term, or is it for a fixed period?



The rules regarding Child Benefit can change if a child is away from home for an extended period.

2026-01-16T10:58:20.567837 [actor]: 10 weeks now

2026-01-16T10:58:23.057628 [root_agent]: Okay, 10 weeks is helpful to know. As Tom is in a special residential school and the placement is currently 10 weeks long, this doesn’t immediately affect your eligibility for Child Benefit. The rules primarily focus on longer-term arrangements.

However, if the placement extends beyond a certain period (generally considered to be more than 52 weeks), it *could* potentially impact the benefit. 

For now, based on the information, you still appear eligible. Is it likely the placement will continue for more than 52 weeks?

2026-01-16T10:58:23.945994 [actor]: Residential accommodation not care placement

2026-01-16T10:58:26.163817 [root_agent]: Thank you for reiterating that this is not a care placement. That's an important distinction.

Just to be absolutely clear, and to confirm my understanding – the 10 weeks at the residential school is part of an ongoing arrangement to support Tom's behavioural needs, but it isn't a formal placement *by* social services or a local authority acting as his legal guardian?



I'm double-checking to ensure we're looking at the correct rules regarding education and residential placements.

2026-01-16T10:58:27.164133 [actor]: Council pays school residential accommodation special needs not care

2026-01-16T10:58:31.170978 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming again – the council funds the school and residential accommodation due to Tom’s special needs, and this is *not* a care placement. That's very helpful.

Based on *all* the information you’ve provided, you **are very likely eligible** to continue receiving Child Benefit for Tom. The key factors are that he's under 20, in full-time education, usually lives with you, and the residential placement is funded by the council for his special educational needs, not as a result of being in care. The 10-week duration doesn't currently change that assessment.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or any other questions you may have?



*Please remember:* I’m an AI and cannot provide definitive financial or legal advice. This is an assessment based on the details you've given me, and you may want to verify with official government resources.

2026-01-16T10:58:32.317819 [actor]: 12-week rule?

2026-01-16T10:58:36.375846 [root_agent]: You're right to ask about the 12-week rule! That's a very important point to consider.

The rules state that if a child is in residential care or hospital for more than 12 weeks, Child Benefit *may* be affected. However, because Tom is in a *special residential school* funded by the council due to his *special educational needs* and *not* in care, the 12-week rule doesn’t typically apply in the same way.

Essentially, the 12-week rule is more geared towards situations where a child is receiving long-term care from social services. Because Tom’s placement is education-focused and not initiated by social care, and the council is paying for it as part of his special needs provision, you should continue to be eligible even beyond 12 weeks.

However, it's good you asked! It shows you’re being thorough. Does that explanation make sense?

2026-01-16T10:58:37.532016 [actor]: still get benefit now since just 10 weeks?

2026-01-16T10:58:40.307129 [root_agent]: Yes, exactly! Since Tom has only been at the residential school for 10 weeks, well *under* the 12-week threshold, you should absolutely continue to receive Child Benefit now without any issues. 

And, as we've discussed, even if the placement continues beyond 12 weeks, because it's a special residential school placement funded by the council for educational needs – *not* a care placement – your eligibility shouldn’t be affected.



I'm glad you asked about the 12-week rule, it's good to be aware of it. Do you feel confident that you understand your likely eligibility now?

2026-01-16T10:58:44.738890 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly assessed that parents of children in special residential schools funded by the council for educational needs (not care) remain eligible for Child Benefit, and properly explained the 12-week rule doesn't typically impact this type of placement.
