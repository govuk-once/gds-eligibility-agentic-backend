2026-01-16T11:13:37.067023 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child, as Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for the child).

2026-01-16T11:13:38.420891 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility, following the guidelines to be obtuse and not directly answer questions.

Child benefit eligibility check 17 year old coding course

2026-01-16T11:13:40.479259 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for the context. I understand you'd like to explore Child Benefit eligibility and are currently a 17-year-old on a coding course. 

To clarify, are you asking whether *you* would be eligible to *claim* Child Benefit, or whether a child *you* care for might be eligible for Child Benefit? It's important to establish this first, as eligibility depends on your role (parent/guardian versus the child themselves).





2026-01-16T11:13:41.562305 [actor]: Coding course future job employer pays no money now

2026-01-16T11:13:43.140991 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. So, you are 17, currently on a coding course with the expectation of future employment, and the course is not currently providing you with any income.

To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me who is primarily responsible for your care? For example, are you living with a parent or guardian?

2026-01-16T11:13:44.143170 [actor]: Live with parents employer pays course fees join after finish

2026-01-16T11:13:45.907175 [root_agent]: Okay, so you live with your parents, your employer will pay the course fees after you finish the course, and you intend to join them as an employee then.

Given this information, it sounds like your parents are likely the ones who would be claiming Child Benefit for you. Is that correct? Or are you asking about your potential eligibility *after* you complete the course and start working?

2026-01-16T11:13:46.885173 [actor]: Parents want to know if they can claim while I'm doing coding course

2026-01-16T11:13:48.288158 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying! So, your parents are asking whether they can continue to claim Child Benefit while you are undertaking this coding course.

To assess this, could you please confirm how long the coding course is expected to last? Knowing the duration will help determine if the rules regarding continuing eligibility apply.

2026-01-16T11:13:49.149528 [actor]: Course 6 months then job starts

2026-01-16T11:13:51.052145 [root_agent]: Okay, the course is 6 months long, and a job will start immediately afterwards.

According to the information available, Child Benefit can continue to be paid while your child is undertaking approved education courses, up to the age of 20. A 6-month coding course would likely fall under this category.

However, to be certain, could you please tell me if this coding course is a full-time course?

2026-01-16T11:13:51.964140 [actor]: Full time coding training with employer paying

2026-01-16T11:13:54.272867 [root_agent]: Okay, so it's a full-time coding training course and the employer is paying for it. That's good information.

Based on what you've told me, your parents *should* be able to continue claiming Child Benefit for you during the 6-month full-time coding course, as it meets the criteria for "approved education."

Just to be absolutely sure, is this course at a university, college, or another type of training provider? Knowing this helps confirm it aligns with the guidelines.

2026-01-16T11:13:55.311260 [actor]: Not university employer training center agreement job after

2026-01-16T11:13:58.248239 [root_agent]: Right, so it’s an employer training centre with a job agreement afterwards, and not a university. That’s helpful to know.

Given that it’s a full-time course at an employer training centre with a guaranteed job afterwards, your parents should be able to continue claiming Child Benefit for the duration of the 6-month course. This is because it still qualifies as approved education.

To double-check, and to ensure I’ve understood everything correctly, is the training course accredited or recognised in any way? (e.g., by an industry body?). It doesn't necessarily *need* to be, but it can sometimes strengthen the case for eligibility.

2026-01-16T11:13:59.351054 [actor]: Coding course employer arranged future job guaranteed paid course fees

2026-01-16T11:14:02.210890 [root_agent]: Okay, so the coding course is arranged by the employer, guarantees a future job, and they are paying the course fees.

Based on all the information you've provided, your parents should be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for you during the 6-month full-time coding course. The fact that it’s employer-arranged and leads directly to a job doesn’t change the eligibility as long as it’s a recognised training course.

I would recommend your parents keep a record of the course details (name of the course, provider, dates) in case HMRC requests it.

Is there anything else I can help clarify regarding Child Benefit eligibility in this situation?

2026-01-16T11:14:03.077535 [actor]: Employer agreement course start job after

2026-01-16T11:14:05.471182 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. So the employer agreement leads directly into the course, and then a job after.

Just to summarise and ensure complete understanding: your parents can continue to claim Child Benefit for you while you undertake this 6-month, full-time coding course arranged by your future employer, as it qualifies as approved education. 

I believe I've covered everything based on the information provided. Do you have any further questions, or is there anything else I can assist with today?

2026-01-16T11:14:09.283296 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately concluded that parents can claim Child Benefit during an approved full-time education course for a 17-year-old, which aligns with government guidelines.
