2026-01-16T10:57:22.942095 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are potentially eligible as the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T10:57:24.478858 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility. I'll be deliberately obtuse and not answer questions directly as instructed.

child benefit eligibility check daughter

2026-01-16T10:57:25.746321 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. I understand you're interested in checking eligibility for Child Benefit, specifically concerning your daughter.

To begin, could you please tell me how old your daughter is? Knowing her age is the first step in determining eligibility.

2026-01-16T10:57:26.645514 [actor]: daughter 12 years old don't live together

2026-01-16T10:57:28.165311 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know your daughter is 12 years old.

You mentioned you don't live together. Could you clarify who doesn't live together – you and your daughter, or you and the other parent of your daughter? This will help me understand the living arrangements.





2026-01-16T10:57:29.122954 [actor]: me daughter apart buy groceries clothes every month

2026-01-16T10:57:30.210488 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you and your daughter live separately, and you financially support her by buying groceries and clothes each month.

To help me understand the situation better, are you and your daughter both resident in the UK?

2026-01-16T10:57:30.947396 [actor]: yes UK both

2026-01-16T10:57:31.982811 [root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful – both you and your daughter are resident in the UK.

Now, regarding your daughter's other parent, are they also resident in the UK?

2026-01-16T10:57:33.008650 [actor]: ex wife daughter UK

2026-01-16T10:57:33.990051 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your daughter's other parent is your ex-wife, and she is also resident in the UK.

To clarify, does your ex-wife also claim Child Benefit for your daughter?

2026-01-16T10:57:35.071652 [actor]: don't know ex wife claims send £120 every 4 weeks groceries clothes

2026-01-16T10:57:36.436718 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. You don’t know if your ex-wife claims Child Benefit, but you provide financial support of £120 every four weeks for groceries and clothes.

To help me assess eligibility, could you tell me if you are married or in a civil partnership?

2026-01-16T10:57:37.301069 [actor]: divorced 5 years

2026-01-16T10:57:38.296898 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You’ve been divorced for 5 years.

Now, are you currently employed or self-employed? Knowing your employment status helps determine eligibility based on your income.

2026-01-16T10:57:39.219712 [actor]: construction work 50 years old

2026-01-16T10:57:40.356822 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you do construction work and are 50 years old.

Approximately how much do you earn each week, before tax and any other deductions? A rough estimate is fine for now.

2026-01-16T10:57:41.200080 [actor]: £600 weekly sometimes more depends jobs

2026-01-16T10:57:42.404180 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So you earn around £600 a week, sometimes more depending on the jobs you have.

Finally, is there a court order in place regarding Child Benefit, stipulating who should claim it?

2026-01-16T10:57:43.155300 [actor]: no court order

2026-01-16T10:57:46.949329 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming there is no court order in place.

Okay, based on the information you've provided: your daughter is 12, you both live in the UK, her mother (your ex-wife) also lives in the UK, you financially support her, you are divorced, you work in construction earning approximately £600 per week, and there’s no court order regarding Child Benefit.

It *sounds* like you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your daughter, *however*, because your ex-wife is also resident in the UK, there's a possibility she is already claiming it. If she is, only one of you can receive it. 

To be certain, and to avoid any issues with HMRC, it would be best for you to contact HMRC directly to confirm whether a claim is already in place.

Would you like me to summarise the key points we've covered?

2026-01-16T10:57:47.784124 [actor]: no already claiming?

2026-01-16T10:57:49.982402 [root_agent]: You asked if you would still be eligible if your ex-wife is *already* claiming.

If your ex-wife is already claiming Child Benefit for your daughter, you **cannot** also claim it. Only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child.

However, if you are unsure whether she is claiming, the best course of action is to contact HMRC directly to check. They will be able to tell you definitively if a claim is already active. Would you like me to explain how to contact HMRC?

2026-01-16T10:57:50.794670 [actor]: but i pay for stuff

2026-01-16T10:57:53.694695 [root_agent]: I understand your frustration – you are contributing financially to your daughter’s needs, and it feels unfair if your ex-wife is receiving the benefit without acknowledging that.

Unfortunately, the rules around Child Benefit entitlement don’t solely depend on financial contributions. Because your ex-wife is also resident in the UK, she has the primary right to claim. Your contributions, while important, don't automatically entitle *you* to the benefit.

However, you could explore options like a family law arrangement to address financial contributions more formally. But regarding the Child Benefit itself, if she is already claiming, you are not eligible.

Would you like me to clarify anything further about this?

2026-01-16T10:57:56.426345 [actor]: The agent has told me I'm not eligible for Child Benefit if my ex-wife is already claiming it, despite my financial contributions. I've completed this conversation as instructed.

2026-01-16T10:57:58.101414 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Child Benefit can only be claimed by one person for a child, and if the ex-wife is already claiming, the father cannot also claim despite financial contributions.
