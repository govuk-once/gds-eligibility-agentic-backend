2026-01-16T11:06:20.707527 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T11:06:22.054611 [actor]: I need to adopt the role of a specific person who has adopted children with special needs.

Adoption siblings special needs allowance

2026-01-16T11:06:23.654972 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for the context. Knowing you've adopted children with special needs is helpful!

To begin assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (Again, this is to confirm you are the parent/guardian claiming *for* the children).

2026-01-16T11:06:24.519727 [actor]: Mid-40s husband wife adopted two children 6 and 8

2026-01-16T11:06:26.110159 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. So you are in your mid-40s, and you and your wife have adopted two children aged 6 and 8.

Next question: Are you working (or do you have a reason you aren’t working – such as being retired, in full-time education, or too ill to work)? This helps determine income limits.

2026-01-16T11:06:27.130508 [actor]: Local authority pays adoption allowance special needs children both working full time

2026-01-16T11:06:28.924571 [root_agent]: Thank you – that's very helpful information. You and your wife both work full time, and you receive an adoption allowance from the local authority because of the children's special needs.

Now, to clarify - does either you or your wife have an individual income of more than £50,000 per year? This is a key factor in whether Child Benefit is reduced or not.

2026-01-16T11:06:29.891297 [actor]: George earns 45K Helen 35K

2026-01-16T11:06:31.460337 [root_agent]: Okay, excellent. George earns £45,000 and Helen earns £35,000. As neither of your individual incomes exceed £50,000, this means your Child Benefit will likely *not* be reduced due to income.

My next question is: Do both children live with you for the majority of the time?

2026-01-16T11:06:32.321796 [actor]: Both living with us full time since adoption finalized last year

2026-01-16T11:06:34.526624 [root_agent]: That's good to know - both children have lived with you full-time since the adoption was finalised last year.

Considering all the information you’ve provided so far – your ages, that you both work, your incomes, and that the children live with you full-time – you are **likely eligible** to receive Child Benefit for both children. 

However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that you are the primary caregiver for both children? (While not strictly a requirement, it’s helpful for confirming eligibility).

2026-01-16T11:06:35.525198 [actor]: Yes we are their legal parents adoption certificate court order both primary caregivers

2026-01-16T11:06:37.144152 [root_agent]: Wonderful! You are their legal parents with a court order confirming the adoption, and you are both primary caregivers. 

Based on *all* the information you’ve provided, you **are eligible** to claim Child Benefit for both your children.

Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit, or would you like me to summarise the reasons for your eligibility?

2026-01-16T11:06:40.981485 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information, confirming eligibility for Child Benefit since both parents earn under £50,000 individually, they are the legal adoptive parents, and the children live with them full-time.
