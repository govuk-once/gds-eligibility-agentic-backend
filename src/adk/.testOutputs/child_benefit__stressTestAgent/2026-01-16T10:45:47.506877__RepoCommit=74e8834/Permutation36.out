2026-01-16T11:04:03.397341 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (Child Benefit eligibility depends on your age, and the age of any children you may have).

2026-01-16T11:04:05.321355 [actor]: I'll role-play as someone inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll be following the context about Kelly, who is 16 and finished her GCSEs with plans to start A-levels in September.

Kelly daughter sixteen summer break college September

2026-01-16T11:04:06.825294 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you're role-playing as Kelly, who is 16 and finishing her GCSEs. That’s very helpful!

Given that Kelly is 16, and about to start A-levels, Child Benefit might be affected. To clarify, is Kelly currently in full-time education?

2026-01-16T11:04:07.743710 [actor]: Kelly finished school June starting college September A levels

2026-01-16T11:04:11.084782 [root_agent]: Thanks for the clarification. So Kelly finished school in June and is starting A-Levels in September. This means she has a gap in her education.

According to the rules, Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 16, unless they are:

*   continuing in full-time education
*   starting an approved training course
*   in receipt of a disability-related benefit

Since Kelly has finished school and isn't *currently* in full-time education, but will be starting A-levels in September, does she have any plans to continue with some form of learning or training *between* finishing school in June and starting college in September? For example, is she taking a summer course, volunteering in a structured learning environment, or doing anything else that could be considered education or training?





2026-01-16T11:04:12.239702 [actor]: Just waiting at home no summer course just accepted into college starts September

2026-01-16T11:04:15.034340 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that Kelly is currently not in any form of education or training between finishing school and starting college in September.

Based on this information, and the rules for Child Benefit, it looks like Kelly *would* no longer be eligible for Child Benefit during this period. Child Benefit generally stops when a young person turns 16 and is no longer in full-time education or approved training.

However, eligibility will resume once she begins her A-Level course in September, as that will be considered full-time education again.

Would you like me to double-check anything, or perhaps explain this further?

2026-01-16T11:04:16.153266 [actor]: Is waiting for college to start means no benefit summer?

2026-01-16T11:04:18.560162 [root_agent]: You’ve hit on the key point! Yes, that’s correct. Waiting for college to start, with no education or approved training in between, means Child Benefit would not be paid for the summer period, from when she turned 16 (after finishing school in June) until her A-Levels start in September.

Essentially, Child Benefit is only paid if a young person is continuously in approved full-time education or training. A break in that continuity affects eligibility.



Is there anything else I can help clarify regarding this?

2026-01-16T11:04:20.004928 [actor]: Actually I just checked official gov.uk and Kelly IS eligible during summer gap period. Benefit continues if accepted into further education and during break between courses.

2026-01-16T11:04:23.714914 [root_agent]: You are absolutely right to check and to point that out to me! My apologies – I made an incorrect assessment.

You are correct; the guidance on gov.uk *does* state that Child Benefit can continue during a break in education if the young person has been accepted onto a further education course. I relied on a too-strict interpretation of the "full-time education" rule and didn’t fully account for that specific exception.

Thank you for catching my error and providing accurate information. It's important to always refer to the official guidance, and you’ve done exactly that.

So, to confirm, Kelly *is* eligible for Child Benefit during the summer gap, as she has been accepted into college to start in September.

I will be sure to review the guidance again to ensure I don’t make the same mistake in the future. Is there anything else I can help you with?

2026-01-16T11:04:27.272342 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent initially made an error, but then correctly acknowledged that Child Benefit does continue during the summer gap between school and college when a young person has been accepted into further education.
