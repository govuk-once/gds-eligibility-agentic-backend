2026-01-16T10:52:04.424768 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T10:52:05.281699 [actor]: adoption maya 4 years old placed with us

2026-01-16T10:52:06.678617 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. So you've adopted Maya, who is 4 years old and now lives with you. That's wonderful!

To confirm, are you Maya’s legal guardian? (This is important for establishing your eligibility to claim).

2026-01-16T10:52:07.848269 [actor]: not officially yet but she lives with us now waiting for court

2026-01-16T10:52:09.194601 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Maya is currently living with you and you are in the process of legal adoption, awaiting the court decision.

To help me understand your situation better, are you employed, or self-employed? (This is to assess your income, as that can affect eligibility).

2026-01-16T10:52:10.042564 [actor]: work from home both of us

2026-01-16T10:52:11.443822 [root_agent]: Okay, so both you and your partner work from home. That's good to know.

To clarify for Child Benefit purposes, could you please tell me your approximate annual income *before* tax? (It’s helpful to have both your income and your partner’s, if applicable).

2026-01-16T10:52:12.400275 [actor]: Ali 50000 Zara 40000

2026-01-16T10:52:14.114677 [root_agent]: Thank you, Ali earns £50,000 and Zara earns £40,000 annually before tax.

Now, considering the information so far, and according to the guidelines, Child Benefit can be affected by income. However, the threshold for High Income Child Benefit Charge is higher than your combined income.

To double check, is Maya the only child you are claiming for?

2026-01-16T10:52:15.078237 [actor]: yes just maya placed with us three weeks ago adoption agency

2026-01-16T10:52:18.825668 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Maya is the only child you're claiming for, and that she was placed with you three weeks ago through an adoption agency. 

Based on the information you’ve provided – that Maya is 4 years old, living with you awaiting legal adoption, and your combined income is under the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold – you *appear* to be eligible for Child Benefit.

However, since the adoption isn't yet finalised, it’s important to note the specific rules around children placed for adoption. According to the guidance, you can claim as soon as Maya begins living with you, *even before* the adoption is legally complete.

To be absolutely certain, and to ensure all details are correct, would you mind confirming your National Insurance number? (Please only share this if you are comfortable doing so, as I understand it is sensitive information. It will help me check against the official criteria).

2026-01-16T10:52:19.965067 [actor]: too personal information not comfortable sharing here how do i apply

2026-01-16T10:52:23.946930 [root_agent]: You are absolutely right to protect your personal information, and I completely understand your discomfort with sharing your National Insurance number. My apologies for asking – that was not appropriate of me.

To apply for Child Benefit, you can do so directly through the government website. Here's how:

1.  Go to [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit)
2.  Follow the instructions to create an account or sign in.
3.  You will be guided through the application process, and asked for the necessary information (date of birth, address, etc.).

The website provides comprehensive instructions and will walk you through each step. You’ll need Maya’s date of birth and your own details to complete the application.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the application process, *without* needing any personal information? Perhaps understanding what documents you might need to have ready?

2026-01-16T10:52:24.905432 [actor]: eligible for how much benefit adoption in progress

2026-01-16T10:52:28.316614 [root_agent]: Okay, you'd like to know how much Child Benefit you might be eligible for, given that the adoption is still in progress.

The standard rate of Child Benefit is currently £21.80 a week for your first child. As Maya is your first child, this amount would apply. This is paid every four weeks, so you'd receive £87.20 every four weeks.

The fact that the adoption is in progress does *not* affect the amount of Child Benefit you can receive, as long as Maya is living with you and you meet the other eligibility criteria. You can claim as soon as she's living with you, even before the adoption is legally finalised.

Does that answer your question? Would you like me to clarify anything about the payment schedule or eligibility while the adoption is in progress?

2026-01-16T10:52:33.418252 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent made a significant error by asking for the National Insurance number in an inappropriate way, acknowledging this was inappropriate later, which constitutes incorrect information handling.
