2026-01-16T10:54:43.097928 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (This helps me determine if you are the parent or guardian claiming for a child, rather than the child themselves).

2026-01-16T10:54:45.074688 [actor]: I need to roleplay as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility based on the provided scenario. I'll be obtuse, speak in search terms, and not provide clear information.

Holly daughter nine Pete Sue separated

2026-01-16T10:54:46.647993 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. It sounds like you have a daughter named Holly who is nine years old, and you're also mentioning Pete and Sue, and that you are separated from someone.

To clarify, are *you* Holly's parent or legal guardian? I need to understand your relationship to the child to assess eligibility.





2026-01-16T10:54:47.393677 [actor]: parent Holly

2026-01-16T10:54:48.672047 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming you are Holly's parent. 

Now, regarding your separation from Pete and Sue – are you currently living with Pete or Sue, or are you living separately from both of them? Knowing your living arrangements is important for determining eligibility.

2026-01-16T10:54:49.485795 [actor]: Holly lives me 3 days ex 4 days

2026-01-16T10:54:50.795756 [root_agent]: Okay, so Holly lives with you for 3 days a week and with her other parent (presumably Pete or Sue) for 4 days a week. 

To confirm, do *you* live with Holly's other parent at all? Or are you living at separate addresses?

2026-01-16T10:54:51.540613 [actor]: separate houses

2026-01-16T10:54:53.458890 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you live at separate houses.

Now, could you please tell me roughly what your annual income is? (It doesn’t need to be exact, just a general range is fine). This is because Child Benefit isn’t usually affected by your income, but there's a related benefit called Child Tax Credit which *is* income-dependent, and it’s good to be aware of all possibilities.

2026-01-16T10:54:54.423153 [actor]: both claiming child benefit HMRC

2026-01-16T10:54:55.776676 [root_agent]: Okay, it sounds like both you and Holly’s other parent are currently claiming Child Benefit through HMRC.

To clarify, has either of you previously had a Child Benefit claim *stopped*? If so, when did that happen? This is important because it can affect how things are assessed.

2026-01-16T10:54:57.223258 [actor]: both submitted claim HMRC decide

2026-01-16T10:54:58.599798 [root_agent]: Thank you. So, both you and the other parent submitted claims to HMRC, and HMRC will decide who is eligible to receive the benefit.

Just to be absolutely clear, are *you* currently receiving any Child Benefit payments for Holly? Or are you waiting for HMRC’s decision?

2026-01-16T10:54:59.392718 [actor]: waiting decision

2026-01-16T10:55:00.540663 [root_agent]: Okay, you are waiting for HMRC’s decision.

Finally, is either you or Holly's other parent receiving any other benefits related to Holly, such as Universal Credit or Guardian’s Allowance? Knowing this helps paint a complete picture.

2026-01-16T10:55:01.317105 [actor]: no other benefits

2026-01-16T10:55:05.420546 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for all the information.

Based on what you've told me – that you are Holly's parent, you live separately from Holly's other parent, Holly spends 3 days a week with you and 4 with the other parent, you are both waiting for HMRC to decide on your respective Child Benefit claims, and neither of you are receiving any other benefits related to Holly – it appears likely that one of you will be designated as the ‘main carer’ for Child Benefit purposes.

Since Holly is living with each of you for a substantial amount of time, HMRC will need to determine who is primarily responsible for her care. They will likely consider factors like who provides the majority of day-to-day care. 

As both of you have claimed, HMRC will make a decision. It’s unlikely both claims will be approved.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to summarise anything, or perhaps explain what HMRC might consider when determining the main carer?

2026-01-16T10:55:06.885247 [actor]: one person gets benefit live most days HMRC decides

2026-01-16T10:55:09.422810 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that when two separated parents both claim Child Benefit for the same child, HMRC will determine who gets it based on who has the child most days (4 vs 3 in this case).
