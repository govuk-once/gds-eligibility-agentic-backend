2026-01-16T11:02:52.627120 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for the child, and your age can be a factor in eligibility).

2026-01-16T11:02:53.452518 [actor]: Mark custody son benefit

2026-01-16T11:02:54.751157 [root_agent]: Thank you for the additional context. It sounds like you are asking about Child Benefit for a son with whom you share custody.

To clarify, are *you* the parent legally responsible for the child? (Even with shared custody, Child Benefit usually goes to the person with main responsibility).

2026-01-16T11:02:55.696301 [actor]: Mark son custody centre 15 years

2026-01-16T11:02:56.960718 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So your son is 15 years old and currently lives in a residential care centre. 

To help me understand your situation better, are you currently responsible for your son's care and financial support, despite him living in the care centre?

2026-01-16T11:02:57.782921 [actor]: Lisa mum mark young offender

2026-01-16T11:02:59.941742 [root_agent]: Thank you for the information. It sounds like Mark is your son, Lisa is his mother, and he is currently a young offender. He is also 15 years old and living in a residential care centre.

Given this information, and to assess eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please confirm whether you (or Lisa, his mother) are receiving any benefits or allowances specifically *for* Mark while he is in custody? For example, any allowances from the young offender institution?

2026-01-16T11:03:00.811078 [actor]: Lisa receives child benefit mark detained 10 weeks

2026-01-16T11:03:02.542277 [root_agent]: Okay, so Lisa (Mark's mother) is currently receiving Child Benefit, and Mark has been detained for 10 weeks.

Just to confirm, is Lisa still primarily responsible for Mark, even while he is detained? Or have care responsibilities shifted to you? (This is important as Child Benefit usually continues for the person who was responsible *before* the detention, but there are exceptions).

2026-01-16T11:03:03.416704 [actor]: Mark sentenced 6 months custody centre mother Lisa claimed benefit

2026-01-16T11:03:06.270355 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Mark has been sentenced to 6 months in a custody centre, and his mother, Lisa, is currently claiming Child Benefit.

According to the information available, Child Benefit can continue to be paid for a child in custody for up to 26 weeks. Since Mark has been detained for 10 weeks, Lisa is currently eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit. 

However, it's important to note that Lisa *must* inform HMRC (HM Revenue & Customs) about Mark’s detention, as this affects the continuation of the benefit. 

Do you want me to summarise the key points, or would you like me to check anything further?





2026-01-16T11:03:07.376682 [actor]: Child benefit after 8 weeks custody

2026-01-16T11:03:09.533215 [root_agent]: You're asking specifically about Child Benefit payments *after* 8 weeks of custody.

As we discussed, Child Benefit can continue to be paid for a child in custody for up to 26 weeks. So, yes, Child Benefit should continue to be paid after 8 weeks, *provided* Lisa (Mark’s mother) has informed HMRC about the detention. After 26 weeks, the payments will usually stop.

Is there anything else I can help clarify regarding this?

2026-01-16T11:03:10.265988 [actor]: Child benefit stops after 8 weeks custody

2026-01-16T11:03:13.178499 [root_agent]: You're asking if Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks of custody. That's a good question to double-check!

Actually, that's not quite right. Child Benefit *doesn't* automatically stop after 8 weeks. It can continue to be paid for up to 26 weeks while a child is in custody. 

However, it’s very important that Lisa (Mark's mother) informed HMRC when Mark was first detained. If she didn't, the payments *could* be stopped, even within the 26-week period.

Are you concerned that the payments have been stopped incorrectly? If so, Lisa should contact HMRC directly to investigate.

2026-01-16T11:03:14.015555 [actor]: Government website says child benefit stops after 8 weeks custody

2026-01-16T11:03:17.943090 [root_agent]: You are right to question me and check the government website! My apologies – you are absolutely correct to be cautious.

I have re-checked the guidance ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else)) and it *does* state that Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks if the child is in custody. 

I am still under development and learning to interpret information correctly. I incorrectly stated 26 weeks. I apologise for the misinformation.

It seems the key point is that Lisa *must* inform HMRC if there are changes to Mark's circumstances, including his detention. If she hasn't, the benefit will likely be stopped after 8 weeks.



Thank you for pointing out my error – it helps me learn! Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding this?

2026-01-16T11:03:19.089165 [actor]: So Lisa is not eligible for child benefit after 10 weeks?

2026-01-16T11:03:22.059060 [root_agent]: Based on the information we've discussed, and having re-checked the guidance, Lisa is *likely* not eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit after 8 weeks of Mark's custody, as the benefit generally stops at that point.

The fact that it’s been 10 weeks means the benefit *should* have already stopped, unless HMRC was informed and an extension was granted (which is unusual in this situation).

However, it's possible payments are still being made in error, or there was a delay in processing the information. Lisa should contact HMRC directly to confirm her entitlement and clarify the situation. Would you like me to provide the contact details for HMRC?

2026-01-16T11:03:23.393172 [actor]: So not eligible?

2026-01-16T11:03:25.060134 [root_agent]: Based on the information available and the rules surrounding Child Benefit and custody, Lisa is **not eligible** to continue receiving Child Benefit after 8 weeks of Mark's detention, and therefore not eligible now at 10 weeks.

I sincerely apologise for the earlier incorrect information I provided. I am still learning and striving to be accurate. It's good that you questioned my responses!

2026-01-16T11:03:34.351892 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent initially gave incorrect information about the 26-week period, but correctly revised their assessment when challenged, confirming that Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks of custody, which aligns with UK government guidelines.
