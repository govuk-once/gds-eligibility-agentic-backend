2026-01-16T10:58:46.255064 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child, as Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for the child).

2026-01-16T10:58:47.208846 [actor]: child 5 years old

2026-01-16T10:58:49.086301 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you have a 5-year-old child. That’s helpful!

Now, to assess your eligibility, could you please tell me – are you currently employed or self-employed, and if so, how many hours per week do you typically work? Don't worry about exact numbers, an estimate is fine. This is because your income and work status can affect eligibility.

2026-01-16T10:58:50.042744 [actor]: no job no money

2026-01-16T10:58:51.384247 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you currently don't have a job and have no income.

To clarify, are you responsible for the care of this 5-year-old child? In other words, do you provide the main financial support for them?





2026-01-16T10:58:52.278122 [actor]: leo in care 10 weeks

2026-01-16T10:58:53.646894 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Leo being in care for 10 weeks is important. 

Just to be absolutely sure I understand correctly, is Leo currently *still* in care, or has he returned home? Knowing this will help me determine how the rules apply.





2026-01-16T10:58:54.479575 [actor]: still care local authority

2026-01-16T10:58:56.577661 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that Leo is still in the care of the local authority.

According to the information available, Child Benefit usually stops when a child goes into full-time care (more than 28 days). However, there are exceptions.

To understand if you might *still* be eligible, could you please tell me - are you receiving any payments from the local authority toward the cost of Leo’s care? Or are they covering all costs themselves?





2026-01-16T10:58:57.708807 [actor]: husband pays £30 weekly for leo

2026-01-16T10:59:00.032530 [root_agent]: Thank you for that detail. Your husband paying £30 weekly towards Leo's care is relevant.

Considering Leo is in full-time care with the local authority, and your husband is contributing financially, it looks like you may still be eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state you can still claim if you’re contributing to the costs of the child even while they are in care.

However, to be certain, could you tell me - is your husband the other parent of Leo?

2026-01-16T10:59:00.859319 [actor]: stepfather live together

2026-01-16T10:59:04.427056 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your husband is Leo’s stepfather and you both live together. This is helpful.

Based on the information you've provided – Leo being in full-time care with the local authority, your husband (stepfather) contributing financially, and you both living together – it appears you *are* likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit. The fact that the stepfather is contributing financially supports the claim, even though Leo is in care.

However, I strongly recommend you double-check this information and formally claim through the government website to be certain. You can find the relevant information here: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility and https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





2026-01-16T10:59:08.013272 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed me that I am likely eligible for Child Benefit despite my child being in care, as my husband (stepfather) is contributing financially towards the child's care costs.
