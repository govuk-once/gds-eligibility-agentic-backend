2026-01-16T10:46:35.406389 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (Child Benefit eligibility depends on your age, as the parent or guardian claiming for the child).



**My thought process:**

I've started with a broad question to begin assessing eligibility. Age is a key factor according to the provided guidance – specifically, the person claiming must be responsible for the child. I need to establish this initial detail before proceeding. I have remembered to be polite, and only ask one question at a time, and only relate to the person I am talking *to*. I have not provided any links.





2026-01-16T10:46:36.547427 [actor]: child benefit son no college looking for job

2026-01-16T10:46:39.444662 [root_agent]: Thank you for the extra information. Just to clarify, are you the parent or legal guardian of the son you mentioned?



**My thought process:**

The user has provided context about their situation – their son is not in college and is looking for a job. This is useful information, as the rules state a child must be under 20 to be eligible, *and* must be in approved education or training. However, the initial question was about *my* eligibility, and I need to establish if the user *is* the parent before proceeding to ask questions about the son. I need to ensure I’m focusing on the person I’m speaking to first.

2026-01-16T10:46:40.425573 [actor]: Gary son Ben 17 left school two months ago

2026-01-16T10:46:42.936274 [root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. To clarify, are you responsible for Ben and living with him?



**My thought process:**

Okay, now I know the claimant's name is Gary and the child's name is Ben. Ben is 17 and recently left school. This is relevant, as children over 16 need to be in approved education or training to continue being eligible for Child Benefit. I need to confirm Gary’s parental responsibility and living arrangements to keep assessing eligibility accurately. I’m still focusing solely on Gary, the claimant, and building a clear picture of their situation.

2026-01-16T10:46:43.799940 [actor]: yes living together careers service looking for apprenticeship 

2026-01-16T10:46:46.537076 [root_agent]: That's good to know, Gary. Is Ben currently receiving any other benefits or financial support, such as Jobseeker's Allowance or Universal Credit?



**My thought process:**

Gary confirms he lives with Ben and that Ben is engaging with the careers service to find an apprenticeship. This is positive – actively seeking an apprenticeship *could* qualify as approved training. However, I need to check if Ben is already receiving benefits that might affect eligibility or interact with Child Benefit. It’s important to cover all bases. I’m continuing to ask one question at a time, relating to the claimant and the child's circumstances.

2026-01-16T10:46:47.384384 [actor]: no just registered with careers service

2026-01-16T10:46:51.057955 [root_agent]: Okay, Gary. And just to confirm, your National Insurance number is solely for your own records and doesn’t need to be shared with me.

To help me assess eligibility, could you tell me roughly what your annual income is before tax? (You don’t need to be exact, just a range is fine).



**My thought process:**

Good, Ben isn’t currently receiving other benefits. Now I need to assess Gary’s income. There’s a high income threshold that, if exceeded, would disqualify him from receiving Child Benefit. I've added a disclaimer about the National Insurance number to ensure I comply with data privacy. I've phrased the income question to request a range rather than a specific number to encourage a response while respecting privacy. I am still focused on Gary, the claimant.

2026-01-16T10:46:51.961478 [actor]: average income not high earner

2026-01-16T10:46:54.629160 [root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. To be a little more specific, would you say your annual income before tax is under £50,000?



**My thought process:**

“Average income, not a high earner” is very vague. The key threshold for Child Benefit is £50,000. I need to determine if Gary’s income falls below this level to continue assessing eligibility. This follow-up question narrows the scope and allows for a more definitive answer. I'm still asking one question at a time and focusing on Gary’s circumstances.

2026-01-16T10:46:55.460995 [actor]: yes under 50k

2026-01-16T10:47:01.040949 [root_agent]: Okay, Gary. Based on the information you've provided:

*   You are the parent/guardian of Ben.
*   Ben is 17 and left school two months ago.
*   Ben is actively seeking an apprenticeship with the careers service.
*   Ben is not currently receiving benefits.
*   Your annual income is under £50,000.

It *appears* you are likely eligible for Child Benefit. As Ben is 17, the crucial factor is his continued engagement with the careers service in seeking an apprenticeship. This counts as 'approved training'.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. I strongly recommend you double-check this information and formally apply through the government website to receive a final decision: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit)



**My thought process:**

I’ve summarised the information Gary has provided. Given this information and the guidance, it appears he meets the criteria for Child Benefit. Ben’s age and efforts to find an apprenticeship are key. I've explicitly stated I’m an AI and cannot provide financial advice, and I’ve directed him to the official government website for a final determination. I have included the link, having completed the assessment! I have ensured my response is polite and clear.

2026-01-16T10:47:05.205611 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent made an error by stating that "seeking an apprenticeship" counts as approved training - a child aged 16-19 must actually be in approved education or training, not merely seeking it. Looking for an apprenticeship with the careers service does not qualify as being in approved education or training under Child Benefit eligibility rules.
