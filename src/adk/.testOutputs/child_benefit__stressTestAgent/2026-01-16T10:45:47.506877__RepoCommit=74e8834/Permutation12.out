2026-01-16T10:51:27.787310 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T10:51:28.979751 [actor]: I'll play the role of Liam's mother, Jessica, who is seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Liam benefit son 18 still school

2026-01-16T10:51:30.559845 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you are Liam's mother, Jessica. That's very helpful!

You mentioned Liam is 18 and still in school. To confirm eligibility, could you please tell me what type of education Liam is currently in? Specifically, is he in full-time education? (e.g., A-levels, university, apprenticeship).





2026-01-16T10:51:31.491214 [actor]: A-levels still lives home

2026-01-16T10:51:33.442441 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know - Liam is 18, studying A-Levels, and still lives at home with you.

Now, just to be certain, are you working over 16 hours a week on average, or are you claiming certain benefits? (This relates to the income requirements for eligibility). Don't worry about giving exact amounts right now, just whether you work over 16 hours, or claim benefits.

2026-01-16T10:51:34.377852 [actor]: Work full time nurse not claiming benefits

2026-01-16T10:51:36.935879 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you work full-time as a nurse and aren’t currently claiming benefits.

Given the information so far – you are Liam’s mother, Liam is 18, studying A-Levels full-time, lives at home with you, and you work full-time – it *appears* you are likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Liam. 

However, to be absolutely sure, could you please confirm Liam's date of birth? This is just to double-check the eligibility cut-off point while he's in full-time education.

2026-01-16T10:51:37.934741 [actor]: Born June 2005

2026-01-16T10:51:39.924699 [root_agent]: Thank you. With Liam being born in June 2005, he *is* eligible for Child Benefit while he remains in full-time education, and as you confirmed he is studying A-Levels, that condition is met.

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, you *are* eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit for Liam.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or any other questions you may have?





2026-01-16T10:51:40.736700 [actor]: Money own receives Universal Credit

2026-01-16T10:51:42.647696 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you personally receive Universal Credit.

This changes things slightly. Receiving Universal Credit can affect Child Benefit eligibility, even if you work. Could you please tell me approximately how much Universal Credit you receive each month? (Just a rough amount is fine – for example, under £500, between £500 - £1000, or over £1000).





2026-01-16T10:51:44.236391 [actor]: No I don't get Universal Credit Liam gets Universal Credit himself

2026-01-16T10:51:46.662604 [root_agent]: My apologies for the misunderstanding! Thank you for clarifying that *Liam* receives Universal Credit, not you. That's important.

According to the guidance, if Liam is receiving Universal Credit himself, this *could* affect your Child Benefit entitlement. Specifically, the amount of Universal Credit he receives matters.

Could you please tell me approximately how much Universal Credit Liam receives each month? (Again, a rough amount is fine – for example, under £500, between £500 - £1000, or over £1000).

2026-01-16T10:51:47.842204 [actor]: Don't know exact amount he said about 300 pounds

2026-01-16T10:51:50.664943 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know Liam receives around £300 per month in Universal Credit.

Based on this information, and the rules surrounding Universal Credit and Child Benefit, it seems you *may* no longer be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam. The rules state that if a young person (18-20 and in full-time education) is receiving Universal Credit in their own right, Child Benefit usually stops.

However, there are exceptions. To be completely certain, could you confirm *why* Liam is receiving Universal Credit? Is it due to limited income or other specific circumstances? Knowing the reason for his claim will help determine if an exception applies.

2026-01-16T10:51:51.699241 [actor]: He's estranged from dad no income help living costs

2026-01-16T10:51:55.609359 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that Liam is estranged from his father and is receiving Universal Credit to help with his living costs as he has no income of his own.

This is a very important detail! Because Liam is receiving Universal Credit due to being financially independent and estranged from his father, you **are** likely still eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for him, *even though* he's 18 and receiving Universal Credit. The rules make provisions for this situation.

It's good you mentioned the estrangement, as that significantly changes the assessment.

To summarise, based on all the information you've provided: Liam is 18, in full-time education (A-Levels), lives at home, and receives Universal Credit due to being financially independent from his father - you *should* be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit.



Would you like me to recap all the information we've covered, or is there anything else I can assist you with?

2026-01-16T10:51:56.517758 [actor]: So am I eligible or not with Universal Credit?

2026-01-16T10:51:59.412873 [root_agent]: You are eligible for Child Benefit despite Liam receiving Universal Credit, *because* of the specific reason he's receiving it. 

Normally, Child Benefit stops when an 18-20 year old in full-time education claims Universal Credit themselves. However, there's an exception for cases where the young person is receiving Universal Credit because they are financially independent and estranged from a parent.

Since Liam is estranged from his father and receiving Universal Credit to cover his living costs due to having no income, you *are* still eligible to receive Child Benefit for him.

I understand it's a little complicated with Universal Credit involved, but hopefully, that clarifies things! Does that make sense?

2026-01-16T10:52:03.227057 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit can continue when a child is 18, in full-time education, and estranged from one parent, even while receiving Universal Credit.
