2026-01-16T13:14:45.188920 [root_agent]: Hello! I can help you with that. To assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask you a few questions. 

First, how old are you? (Child Benefit is paid to the person with main responsibility for a child.)

2026-01-16T13:14:46.108279 [actor]: My son john 17 lives with me

2026-01-16T13:14:47.492880 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. John is 17 and lives with you.

Now, is John in full-time non-advanced education or approved training? This is relevant as Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 16, unless they fall into these categories.

2026-01-16T13:14:48.298177 [actor]: college resit GCSEs

2026-01-16T13:14:50.080783 [root_agent]: Thank you. So John is 17, lives with you, and is in full-time education – specifically, he's at college resitting his GCSEs. This means he *may* still be eligible for Child Benefit.

Next question: What is your National Insurance number? (I understand you may not want to share this directly, but knowing if you *have* one is important for eligibility).

2026-01-16T13:14:50.997969 [actor]: no college only 6 hours a week game at home rest of time

2026-01-16T13:14:54.157315 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. John is 17, lives with you, and attends college for 6 hours a week to resit GCSEs, and otherwise spends his time gaming and resting at home.

According to the information available, 6 hours a week is *not* considered full-time education. Child Benefit generally stops when a young person turns 16 unless they are in full-time non-advanced education or approved training.

Therefore, based on this information, it is unlikely you are currently eligible for Child Benefit for John.

Before I confirm this, could you please confirm that the 6 hours a week at college is all the formal education or training John is currently undertaking? It’s important to be certain.





2026-01-16T13:14:55.307272 [actor]: just 6 hours resit gcse 6 hours total supervised at college gaming rest of week

2026-01-16T13:14:57.935256 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. So, John’s education consists of 6 hours a week of supervised GCSE resitting at college, with the rest of his week spent gaming.

Given that this is less than the threshold for full-time education, it appears you are **not** eligible for Child Benefit for John. Child Benefit usually ends when a young person turns 16 unless they are in approved full-time education, which typically involves at least 12 hours a week of supervised study.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Perhaps information on other benefits you might be eligible for?

2026-01-16T13:15:01.276310 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed the user they are not eligible for Child Benefit as their 17-year-old son only attends 6 hours of education per week, which doesn't qualify as full-time education required for Child Benefit eligibility beyond age 16.
