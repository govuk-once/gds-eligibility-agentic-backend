2026-01-16T13:22:34.077540 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child.)

2026-01-16T13:22:35.618697 [actor]: I'll play the role of Hans who's inquiring about child benefit eligibility while being deliberately obtuse and speaking like someone typing search queries.

30 years old benefit check

2026-01-16T13:22:37.225025 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming your age. So you are 30 years old. 

Now, to assess your eligibility, I need to understand your relationship to the child you'd be claiming for. Are you the child’s parent? (For example, mother, father, or adoptive parent). Or are you someone else, like a guardian?

2026-01-16T13:22:38.132803 [actor]: child parent money claim

2026-01-16T13:22:39.231908 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you *are* the child's parent.

Next, is the child under 16 years old? Or, are they 16 or 17 and in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T13:22:40.089851 [actor]: yes under 16 child

2026-01-16T13:22:41.012445 [root_agent]: Great. The child is under 16.

Now, thinking about where the child lives – does the child live with you for the majority of the time?

2026-01-16T13:22:42.062896 [actor]: live with me yes home same address

2026-01-16T13:22:43.433419 [root_agent]: Okay, good to know the child lives with you at the same address.

To clarify, are you working more than 16 hours a week on average? This includes paid and some unpaid work – like volunteering. Or, are you claiming certain benefits?

2026-01-16T13:22:44.379210 [actor]: not working jobseeker pre-settled status

2026-01-16T13:22:45.976963 [root_agent]: Okay, you're not currently working, and you're claiming Jobseeker's Allowance. You also have pre-settled status.

Just to be certain, can you confirm your immigration status? Specifically, have you been living in the UK for at least 26 weeks? This is a requirement even with pre-settled status.

2026-01-16T13:22:46.842748 [actor]: yes pre-settled status jobseeker 95 days in uk

2026-01-16T13:22:49.762223 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. 95 days in the UK isn't quite the 26 weeks required for Child Benefit eligibility with pre-settled status.

According to the information available, you need to have been legally resident in the UK for at least 26 weeks to qualify, even *with* pre-settled status. Unfortunately, 95 days doesn’t meet that requirement.

Therefore, based on the information you've provided, you are currently **not eligible** for Child Benefit.

Would you like me to explain any part of this further, or perhaps explore if your eligibility might change once you've been resident in the UK for the required 26 weeks?

2026-01-16T13:22:51.068506 [actor]: I understand I'm not eligible yet for Child Benefit.

2026-01-16T13:22:53.190520 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent was correct that with pre-settled status and only 95 days in the UK (less than the required 26 weeks), the person would not be eligible for Child Benefit.
