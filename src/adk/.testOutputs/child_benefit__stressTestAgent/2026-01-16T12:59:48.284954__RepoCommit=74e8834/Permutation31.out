2026-01-16T13:14:30.162818 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to confirm you are the parent or legal guardian claiming for the child, and therefore eligible yourself.)

2026-01-16T13:14:31.538794 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility, following the scenario about Sarah (45) with her daughter Emma (18) who has started university.

Daughter university student claim benefit

2026-01-16T13:14:32.707072 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for the context. So you are role-playing as Sarah, age 45, and your daughter Emma is 18 and has started university.

To clarify, is Emma studying a full-time course at university?

2026-01-16T13:14:34.254071 [actor]: Full time undergraduate degree yes

2026-01-16T13:14:35.862415 [root_agent]: Thank you. Because Emma is 18 and studying a full-time undergraduate degree, Child Benefit will continue to be paid to you for the first year of her course. 

However, Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 18. To confirm - is Emma studying a course that is expected to last at least three years?

2026-01-16T13:14:36.767405 [actor]: Bachelor degree three years living at home

2026-01-16T13:14:38.370612 [root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. As Emma is 18, studying a full-time Bachelor's degree expected to last three years, and is living at home, you *will* continue to receive Child Benefit for the duration of her course.

Just to be absolutely certain – are you Emma’s parent or legal guardian?

2026-01-16T13:14:39.225744 [actor]: Mother of Emma commutes to university

2026-01-16T13:14:41.156735 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming you are Emma’s mother. As she commutes to university, that doesn’t affect your eligibility either.

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, you *are* eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Emma while she studies her three-year Bachelor's degree.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or any other questions you have?

2026-01-16T13:14:44.053250 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit continues for a child who is 18 and in full-time education, which aligns with the gov.uk guidance.
