2026-01-16T13:11:00.634264 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are?



**My thought process:**

I need to begin gathering information to assess eligibility. The core eligibility criteria relate to the *parent's* circumstances, so asking the age of the person I'm speaking to is a logical first step. While age isn't a *direct* disqualifier, it helps me understand if they're likely to be a parent or guardian. I will refer to the provided links to confirm details as we go along. I am keeping the question focused solely on the person I am talking to, as per the instructions.


2026-01-16T13:11:01.621181 [actor]: child benefit my son special school residential accommodation 10 weeks

2026-01-16T13:11:02.995260 [root_agent]: Thank you for the extra information. Just to clarify, you're applying for Child Benefit relating to your son, and he is currently in special school residential accommodation for 10 weeks.

To help me understand your situation better, are you currently responsible for your son's care?

2026-01-16T13:11:03.976431 [actor]: I pay for clothes mum visit weekends he's 14

2026-01-16T13:11:04.971074 [root_agent]: Thank you. It sounds like you maintain a strong financial and personal connection with your son, even while he's at residential school.

To clarify, are you currently living with your son?

2026-01-16T13:11:06.157015 [actor]: no school accommodation local council pay because behavioral needs severe

2026-01-16T13:11:07.594447 [root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know. So the local council is paying for his accommodation due to his behavioural needs.

Are you employed, or self-employed? If so, roughly how many hours per week do you work? Don't worry about being exact, an estimate is fine.

2026-01-16T13:11:08.521604 [actor]: I work supermarket 20 hours weekly why ask

2026-01-16T13:11:10.251307 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you work 20 hours a week at a supermarket. I'm asking to determine if your income exceeds the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) threshold. Your income is a factor in determining eligibility for Child Benefit. 

To be absolutely sure, what is your annual income *before* tax? (Again, an estimate is fine).

2026-01-16T13:11:11.106210 [actor]: £15000 money tight

2026-01-16T13:11:12.888181 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. An annual income of £15,000 is below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Now, focusing on your son's situation, as he is in residential school, do you contribute towards the costs of his residential care *directly* to the school or local authority? (Aside from the clothes and visits you mentioned).

2026-01-16T13:11:13.762366 [actor]: council pays everything I visit school weekends

2026-01-16T13:11:15.040229 [root_agent]: Okay, so the council covers all costs associated with his residential care, and your contributions are limited to things like clothing and weekend visits. That's good to know.

Finally, is your son's residential school in the UK?

2026-01-16T13:11:15.964698 [actor]: yes west midlands 

2026-01-16T13:11:21.886339 [root_agent]: Great. Based on the information you’ve provided:

*   You are the parent of a 14-year-old son.
*   He is in a residential special school in the UK (West Midlands).
*   The local council pays for his accommodation due to his behavioural needs.
*   You contribute towards some of his expenses (clothing, visits).
*   Your annual income is less than £50,000.

It *appears* you **are** eligible for Child Benefit. The fact that your son is in residential care funded by the local authority doesn't automatically disqualify you, and your income is below the threshold.

However, I strongly recommend you double-check this information yourself using the official government website to ensure nothing has been overlooked, as I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. Here's the link again for your convenience: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)



**My thought process:**

I have gathered all the necessary information based on the rules and links provided. The key factors considered were: the child's age, residence, the parent's income, and the funding arrangement for the residential care. All indicators point to eligibility. I have reiterated the importance of the user verifying this with the official government website for accuracy and peace of mind, and provided the link once more.

2026-01-16T13:11:25.885751 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidelines, even when a child is in residential accommodation, if the parent maintains regular contact and financial responsibility (providing clothes, etc.) and the child spends time with them on weekends, they remain eligible for Child Benefit.
