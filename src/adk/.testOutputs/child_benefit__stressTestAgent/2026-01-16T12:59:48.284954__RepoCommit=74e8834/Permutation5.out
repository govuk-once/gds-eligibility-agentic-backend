2026-01-16T13:01:11.846038 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are eligible as the parent/carer claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T13:01:13.447717 [actor]: I need to play the role of a person named Mark who is seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll engage with the agent while following the rules to be obtuse and speak like I'm entering search terms.

40 years old divorced child benefit eligibility

2026-01-16T13:01:15.106974 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Being 40 years old certainly fits the age requirement for claiming Child Benefit!

Now, as you mentioned being divorced, could you tell me – do you have any children under 16? (Or under 20 if they are in full-time education or approved training?) This is a key part of the eligibility criteria.





2026-01-16T13:01:16.207237 [actor]: 10 son Lucas lives with ex-wife Jenny monthly payment £150 clothes food

2026-01-16T13:01:18.620577 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So, you have a 10-year-old son named Lucas.

You’ve also mentioned you make a monthly payment of £150 towards Lucas’s clothes and food, and that Lucas lives with your ex-wife, Jenny. 

To confirm my understanding, does Lucas live *primarily* with your ex-wife, Jenny? (Meaning, does he spend the majority of his time at her address?). This is important as it affects who can claim Child Benefit.

2026-01-16T13:01:19.707363 [actor]: yes Jenny's house full time custody ex-wife not claiming benefits though

2026-01-16T13:01:21.874901 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that Lucas lives full-time with your ex-wife, Jenny, and that she doesn’t currently claim any benefits.

Given this information, and according to the rules around Child Benefit, you may still be eligible to claim Child Benefit *even though* Lucas lives with his mother. This is because you are contributing financially to his upkeep.

To be certain, could you please confirm if you have legal responsibility for Lucas? (For example, through a Child Arrangements Order).





2026-01-16T13:01:22.801160 [actor]: no official papers just divorce agreement pay £150 monthly support

2026-01-16T13:01:26.005474 [root_agent]: Thank you for being upfront about that. So, there isn’t a formal Child Arrangements Order in place, but the divorce agreement details your £150 monthly contribution.

Okay, this changes things slightly. According to the guidance, having care of a child isn’t just about living with them. It’s about who has *main responsibility* for them. Since you don’t have a formal arrangement and are providing financial support, it sounds like your ex-wife likely has 'care' of Lucas for Child Benefit purposes. 

However, there is a possibility you could still claim if your ex-wife agrees to transfer the Child Benefit claim to you.

Would you like me to explain the process of transferring a Child Benefit claim?

2026-01-16T13:01:27.049761 [actor]: Jenny not claiming anything now can I claim direct

2026-01-16T13:01:29.387004 [root_agent]: Okay, so Jenny isn’t claiming Child Benefit *at all* currently. That simplifies things!

Yes, if Jenny isn't claiming, and you meet the other eligibility requirements, you *can* claim Child Benefit directly, even though Lucas lives with her.

To double-check, are you working more than 8 hours a week on average? (This relates to the earnings limits for Child Benefit – although those rules have changed recently, it's still good to confirm).

2026-01-16T13:01:30.402888 [actor]: work full time financial analyst UK resident

2026-01-16T13:01:33.472082 [root_agent]: Excellent. Working full-time as a financial analyst and being a UK resident means you meet those key requirements.

Based on everything you’ve told me – you are 40, Lucas is 10 and lives with his mother, Jenny isn’t claiming Child Benefit, and you work full-time – it appears you *are* likely eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas.

However, please remember that I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. I strongly recommend you review the official government guidance here: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility to ensure you fully understand all the criteria and to make a fully informed decision.

Would you like me to summarise the steps to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T13:01:36.277468 [actor]: Thank you for the information. So I can claim for Lucas even though he lives with Jenny. Will look at that website and apply.

2026-01-16T13:01:38.552742 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit is typically claimed by the person the child lives with. Since Lucas lives full-time with his ex-wife and Mark only provides financial support without any custody arrangement, Mark would not be eligible to claim directly unless Jenny agreed to sign over the claim to him.
