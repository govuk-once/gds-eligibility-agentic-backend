2026-01-16T13:06:14.682517 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T13:06:16.159929 [actor]: I need to role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the rules by being obtuse, using search-engine-like queries, and not directly answering questions.

child benefit eligibility me Sophie 28

2026-01-16T13:06:17.517218 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying you are Sophie, and you are 28 years old.

To assess your eligibility, let's start with the basics. Are you responsible for a child under 16?

2026-01-16T13:06:18.384251 [actor]: Noah 6 years old my son

2026-01-16T13:06:19.343059 [root_agent]: Thanks, that’s good to know! So you have a son, Noah, who is 6 years old.

Now, is Noah living with you?

2026-01-16T13:06:20.132176 [actor]: Noah grandmother currently staying recovery surgery

2026-01-16T13:06:21.238696 [root_agent]: Okay, so Noah is currently living with his grandmother while she recovers from surgery. 

To clarify – are *you* providing financial support towards Noah's upkeep while he is staying with his grandmother?

2026-01-16T13:06:22.558286 [actor]: I pay for Noah things grandmother helping temporarily six weeks after my surgery

2026-01-16T13:06:24.062269 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It sounds like you contribute financially to Noah's needs, even though he’s currently living with his grandmother for a temporary period following *your* surgery.

Is the arrangement with your mother (Noah’s grandmother) expected to be for longer than 12 weeks?





2026-01-16T13:06:24.802939 [actor]: No six weeks only

2026-01-16T13:06:25.618760 [root_agent]: Great, that's helpful to know. So the arrangement is expected to last only six weeks.

Are you married, or in a civil partnership?

2026-01-16T13:06:26.352936 [actor]: single parent

2026-01-16T13:06:27.296479 [root_agent]: Okay, understood – you are a single parent.

What is your income? (Please give me an approximate yearly amount before tax). This is to check if your income affects eligibility.

2026-01-16T13:06:28.092149 [actor]: normal income job waitress

2026-01-16T13:06:30.097706 [root_agent]: Thanks. While "normal income" is helpful as a general idea, Child Benefit has an income threshold. Could you give me a rough estimate of your yearly income before tax? Even a range would be useful – for example, between £10,000 and £20,000.



I need this information to accurately assess your eligibility, as your income could affect whether you receive the full amount, or any amount at all.

2026-01-16T13:06:31.048668 [actor]: 18000 pounds yearly

2026-01-16T13:06:31.971247 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Your yearly income is £18,000.

To confirm, are you a UK resident?

2026-01-16T13:06:32.777396 [actor]: yes UK

2026-01-16T13:06:33.788927 [root_agent]: Excellent. You are a UK resident.

Finally, is Noah’s father involved in Noah’s upbringing and contributing financially? (This helps determine if another person might also be eligible to claim).

2026-01-16T13:06:34.561117 [actor]: no contact father

2026-01-16T13:06:38.982999 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that there is no contact with Noah’s father.

Based on the information you’ve provided:

*   You are 28 years old and Noah’s mother.
*   Noah is 6 years old.
*   Noah is temporarily living with his grandmother for 6 weeks while you recover from surgery, but you are contributing financially to his care.
*   You are a single parent.
*   Your yearly income is £18,000.
*   You are a UK resident.
*   There is no contact with Noah’s father.

It appears you **are** likely eligible for Child Benefit. Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold, and Noah is your child. The temporary arrangement with your mother doesn't appear to affect eligibility as you are still financially supporting him.

However, you will need to officially claim it through the government website to confirm your eligibility and receive payments.



Would you like me to summarise the key points again, or is this helpful?

2026-01-16T13:06:40.634665 [actor]: Thanks that helps about me being eligible

2026-01-16T13:06:43.350572 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The assessment was accurate as the mother is eligible for Child Benefit even though the child is temporarily staying with grandmother, since the arrangement is under 8 weeks and she continues to financially support the child.
