2026-01-16T13:04:53.875008 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to confirm *you* are the potential claimant, not the child).

2026-01-16T13:04:55.207069 [actor]: I'll now role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility, following the character description provided.

I'm 44 Ryan apprenticeship

2026-01-16T13:04:56.550466 [root_agent]: Thank you, Ryan. Good to know you are 44. 

Now, to assess your eligibility, could you tell me – are you responsible for a child who is under 16? (This includes step-children, adopted children, and children you have formal care of).

2026-01-16T13:04:58.088627 [actor]: I'll continue role-playing as Karen, being deliberately obtuse in my responses.

My son Ryan not me Ryan 17 started apprenticeship government funded

2026-01-16T13:04:59.622047 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So, your son Ryan is 17 and has started a government-funded apprenticeship.

Just to be absolutely clear, are *you* currently responsible for your son Ryan, or is he living independently? (Even with an apprenticeship, parental responsibility and living arrangements are important for Child Benefit eligibility).





2026-01-16T13:05:01.049113 [actor]: Lives home me his mum Karen

2026-01-16T13:05:02.385895 [root_agent]: Thank you, Karen. That's helpful to know - Ryan lives at home with you.

Now, is Ryan in full-time non-advanced education? (An apprenticeship *can* count as non-advanced education, but I need to confirm).

2026-01-16T13:05:03.317627 [actor]: Intermediate apprenticeship England left school now

2026-01-16T13:05:04.823739 [root_agent]: Okay, an Intermediate Apprenticeship in England, and he's recently left school.

To clarify, an Intermediate Apprenticeship is generally considered advanced education. However, as he's recently left school, there's a specific rule. Is your son earning £120 or more a week from his apprenticeship?

2026-01-16T13:05:06.038988 [actor]: Not sure about pay they give him some money apprenticeship money

2026-01-16T13:05:08.392637 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand you're not sure about the exact amount he earns. 

To determine eligibility, we *do* need to know if his weekly earnings from the apprenticeship are £120 or more. If they are, unfortunately, you would no longer be eligible for Child Benefit now that he's 17. 

Could you find out roughly what his weekly earnings are, even an estimate would be helpful? Alternatively, do you have access to any documentation relating to his apprenticeship pay?

2026-01-16T13:05:09.573383 [actor]: Maybe less don't think 120 just started England apprenticeship program government

2026-01-16T13:05:12.533632 [root_agent]: Thank you, Karen. If his weekly earnings are likely less than £120, that's a positive sign for eligibility.

Given that he’s on a government-funded apprenticeship and still living at home, and presuming his earnings are under £120 per week, it *appears* you are likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for him until he turns 18.

However, to be absolutely certain, and for official confirmation, you should check the information on the government website: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or any other government support you might be eligible for?

2026-01-16T13:05:16.317424 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent gave incorrect information by stating that an Intermediate Apprenticeship is generally considered advanced education when, according to gov.uk guidance, approved apprenticeships count as approved education for Child Benefit eligibility up to age 19.
