2026-01-16T13:15:30.369392 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child.)

2026-01-16T13:15:32.093556 [actor]: I'll help you engage with this agent in the role of a person inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the instructions to be obtuse, answer indirectly, and speak like I'm entering search terms.

son Mark prison youth custody 15 years old

2026-01-16T13:15:33.724968 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. It sounds like you are inquiring about Child Benefit for your son, Mark, who is 15 years old and currently in youth custody. 

To clarify, is Mark living with you, or is he primarily residing elsewhere due to being in custody? I need to understand where he lives to assess eligibility.





2026-01-16T13:15:34.593195 [actor]: not living with me custody young offenders institution

2026-01-16T13:15:36.134368 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So, Mark is not living with you and is currently in a Young Offenders Institution.

Child Benefit *can* still potentially be paid in this situation. However, there are specific rules. To understand better, approximately how long is Mark’s current custody order for? Knowing the length of the sentence will help determine eligibility.

2026-01-16T13:15:37.098632 [actor]: six months sentence custody already been there 10 weeks

2026-01-16T13:15:39.252524 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So, Mark has a six-month sentence and has already served 10 weeks.

Given this information, Child Benefit *can* continue to be paid while Mark is in custody, as the sentence is less than 52 weeks long. However, to confirm eligibility, could you please confirm that you (or Mark’s other parent, if applicable) are responsible for him financially? Essentially, are you still providing financial support despite him being in custody?

2026-01-16T13:15:40.373347 [actor]: was claiming before custody mother still buy clothes visit regularly 

2026-01-16T13:15:42.937751 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It sounds like you were already claiming Child Benefit before Mark went into custody, and his mother continues to provide for him by buying clothes and visiting regularly.

This is helpful. As long as the claim was already in place *before* Mark went into custody, and he is still considered your responsibility financially, the Child Benefit should continue to be paid for the duration of his sentence, as it is less than 52 weeks.

To be absolutely certain, are you and Mark’s mother still jointly responsible for his financial wellbeing, even whilst he is in custody?

2026-01-16T13:15:43.940377 [actor]: I'm his mother Lisa was claiming before he went in

2026-01-16T13:15:46.425814 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Lisa. That’s very helpful. 

Since you were already claiming Child Benefit *before* Mark went into custody, and you are his mother and still financially responsible for him despite his current situation, then according to the information available, you *should* continue to be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him during his six-month sentence.

However, it’s important to inform HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) about Mark’s change in circumstances (i.e., his custody). Have you already notified them?

2026-01-16T13:15:47.305678 [actor]: hadn't told them yet about custody

2026-01-16T13:15:49.710993 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It’s very important to inform HMRC as soon as possible about Mark’s custody, even though you should continue to receive payments in the meantime. Not informing them could potentially lead to overpayments that you would need to repay later.

You can report the change of circumstances on the Gov.uk website. Would you like me to explain *how* to do that, or would you prefer to find the information yourself? I won’t provide a direct link, but I can tell you what search terms to use.

2026-01-16T13:15:50.661140 [actor]: when will payments stop for child benefit custody?

2026-01-16T13:15:53.379363 [root_agent]: That’s a good question. Child Benefit payments will stop when Mark is released from custody *or* when the six-month sentence ends, whichever comes first.

However, there's a specific rule regarding longer sentences. If, for any reason, the sentence was extended beyond 52 weeks, that would affect eligibility and payments would stop. Since his sentence is currently six months (which is less than 52 weeks) this doesn’t apply in your situation *at the moment*.

To be clear - you should continue to receive payments as long as the sentence remains under 52 weeks and you keep HMRC informed. Does that make sense?

2026-01-16T13:15:54.409890 [actor]: So I will still get payments for the whole time he's in custody?

2026-01-16T13:15:57.092682 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided – that you were already claiming Child Benefit before he entered custody, he is serving a sentence of six months (under 52 weeks), and you continue to be financially responsible for him – then yes, you *should* continue to receive payments for the whole time he is in custody.

However, it’s crucial you’ve informed HMRC of the change in circumstances. They may request further information, but as long as everything remains as you’ve described, your claim should continue uninterrupted.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or are you feeling confident about informing HMRC now?

2026-01-16T13:16:01.286981 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed that Child Benefit continues for a child in custody when the sentence is under 52 weeks (Mark's is 6 months) and the parent was claiming before custody and remains financially responsible.
