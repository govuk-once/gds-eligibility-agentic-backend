2026-01-16T12:59:50.446355 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (I need to understand if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child, not the age of the child initially).

2026-01-16T12:59:51.342508 [actor]: benefits eligibility uk child

2026-01-16T12:59:52.442015 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for the context. It confirms we're discussing UK Child Benefit eligibility. 

To clarify, are *you* the parent or legal guardian making the claim, or are you asking on behalf of someone else?

2026-01-16T12:59:53.458910 [actor]: sarah manchester child benefit

2026-01-16T12:59:54.521503 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you are Sarah Manchester, and you are asking about your eligibility for Child Benefit.

To begin assessing your eligibility, could you please tell me how many children you are claiming for?

2026-01-16T12:59:55.317178 [actor]: one child leo 8 years

2026-01-16T12:59:56.375956 [root_agent]: Okay, so you are Sarah Manchester and you have one child, Leo, who is 8 years old. 

Now, are you currently employed, self-employed, or not currently working?

2026-01-16T12:59:57.362851 [actor]: teacher husband teacher me part time

2026-01-16T12:59:58.694715 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you, Sarah Manchester, work part-time, and your husband is a teacher.

To clarify, approximately how much do you earn *per week* from your part-time work, before tax and other deductions? (An approximate figure is fine for now).

2026-01-16T12:59:59.694671 [actor]: 15000 yearly husband 35000 teacher

2026-01-16T13:00:01.841947 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So you earn approximately £15,000 per year, and your husband earns £35,000 per year as a teacher. That means your weekly income is roughly £288.46 and your husband's is approximately £673.08.

To check eligibility considering household income, does anyone else live in your household who contributes to the household finances? (For example, another adult family member).

2026-01-16T13:00:02.846056 [actor]: just me husband leo manchester uk citizens

2026-01-16T13:00:03.991455 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that it's just you, your husband, and Leo living in the household, and you are all UK citizens.

Now, is Leo living with you the majority of the time?

2026-01-16T13:00:04.835887 [actor]: leo lives with us all the time

2026-01-16T13:00:06.030536 [root_agent]: Great. Leo lives with you all the time.

Finally, to confirm, neither you nor your husband are receiving a taxable benefit (like Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, or Income Support) that covers the childcare costs for Leo?

2026-01-16T13:00:06.931065 [actor]: no benefits

2026-01-16T13:00:11.609337 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that you are not receiving any taxable benefits that cover childcare costs.

Based on the information you've provided:

*   You (Sarah Manchester) earn £15,000 per year.
*   Your husband earns £35,000 per year.
*   You have one child, Leo, who is 8 years old.
*   Leo lives with you full-time.
*   You do not receive any benefits that cover childcare costs.

Considering the earnings threshold (currently £50,000 per year for the higher earner, which your husband’s income exceeds), you *may* be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge. However, because your household income is below £60,000, you won’t have to pay the charge. 

Therefore, you **are likely eligible** to receive Child Benefit for Leo. However, the amount you receive may be reduced due to the High Income Child Benefit Charge applying to your husband’s earnings.

Would you like me to explain the High Income Child Benefit Charge in more detail?

2026-01-16T13:00:17.190175 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent made an error regarding the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold - the current threshold is £60,000 (not £50,000 as stated), and since the husband's income is £35,000, the family is fully eligible for Child Benefit without any reduction due to income.
