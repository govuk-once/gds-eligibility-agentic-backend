2026-01-16T13:05:58.123032 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for the child, and your age can affect eligibility).

2026-01-16T13:05:59.055156 [actor]: foster child Maya 4

2026-01-16T13:06:00.145946 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Just to confirm, you are the foster parent of Maya, who is 4 years old?

To assess eligibility accurately, could you please confirm whether you are employed or self-employed?

2026-01-16T13:06:01.132650 [actor]: adoption approved child living with us not final yet

2026-01-16T13:06:02.536063 [root_agent]: Thank you for the clarification. So, the adoption of the child, Maya (who is 4 years old) is approved but not yet legally finalised.

To help me understand your situation better, could you please tell me your annual income? (This is before tax and any other deductions).

2026-01-16T13:06:03.805515 [actor]: Don't need income information. Maya lives with us agency approved.

2026-01-16T13:06:06.408955 [root_agent]: You are right to point that out - my apologies! I got ahead of myself and asked about income unnecessarily, as the rules are different when a child is living with someone while arrangements are being made through an agency. 

According to the information provided by the government, Child Benefit *can* be paid to someone while a child is living with them through an agency, even before adoption is finalised.

However, to be absolutely sure, could you confirm that the agency has formally approved the placement of Maya with you? Essentially, that they agree she *is* living with you as her primary carer?

2026-01-16T13:06:07.389054 [actor]: yes agency approved Maya with us living in our home

2026-01-16T13:06:09.802643 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that Maya is 4 years old, living with you in your home, and the placement has been formally approved by an agency – you *are* likely eligible to claim Child Benefit.

However, it's important to note that the agency may also need to provide information as part of the claim process.

Would you like me to summarise the key points relating to claiming Child Benefit in this situation, as outlined on the government website? Or would you prefer I move on to another question?

2026-01-16T13:06:11.781797 [actor]: I want to claim now. When do I get the payment?

2026-01-16T13:06:13.457640 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that foster parents with agency-approved placement of a child (even when adoption is not yet final) are eligible for Child Benefit.
