2026-01-16T13:13:22.087586 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? Knowing your age will help me determine if you meet the basic age requirements for claiming.

2026-01-16T13:13:23.164286 [actor]: I'm 35 visiting UK with son 5 years old

2026-01-16T13:13:24.227130 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. That's helpful.

Now, to clarify – are you a British citizen, or do you have the right to reside in the UK? This is important for eligibility.

2026-01-16T13:13:25.192184 [actor]: US citizen tourist visa 6 months

2026-01-16T13:13:26.898262 [root_agent]: Thank you. As you are a US citizen visiting the UK on a 6-month tourist visa, Child Benefit eligibility is complex. Generally, Child Benefit is only available to people who are habitually resident in the UK.

To help me understand your situation better, is your son also a US citizen and also visiting on a tourist visa?

2026-01-16T13:13:28.003163 [actor]: yes both US son also tourist visa

2026-01-16T13:13:30.235293 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that.

Given that both you and your son are US citizens visiting the UK on a 6-month tourist visa, it is **highly unlikely** you would be eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit is generally only available to people who are legally resident in the UK, and a 6-month tourist visa doesn’t usually grant that right.

However, there are some exceptions. Are you working in the UK during these 6 months? Or, are you here to study?

2026-01-16T13:13:30.994424 [actor]: not working just visiting friends

2026-01-16T13:13:32.643292 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying.

As you are visiting friends and not working or studying, it confirms that you are likely not eligible for Child Benefit. The benefit is generally intended for people who are habitually resident in the UK, and a standard visitor visa doesn’t qualify as habitual residency. 

Just to be absolutely sure, are you receiving any benefits or income from a UK source?

2026-01-16T13:13:33.370173 [actor]: no usa savings

2026-01-16T13:13:35.777784 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that your income comes from US savings.

Based on the information you’ve provided – being a US citizen visiting the UK on a 6-month tourist visa with your son, not working or studying, and having income from US savings – it is **very unlikely** you would be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Child Benefit is primarily for those who are legally resident in the UK, and your current visa status doesn't meet those requirements.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on other support available to visitors?

2026-01-16T13:13:37.066567 [actor]: I understand I'm not eligible for Child Benefit while visiting the UK on a tourist visa. 

2026-01-16T13:13:39.369047 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent was correct to tell the tourist that they are not eligible for Child Benefit while visiting the UK on a tourist visa, as Child Benefit requires being habitually resident in the UK.
