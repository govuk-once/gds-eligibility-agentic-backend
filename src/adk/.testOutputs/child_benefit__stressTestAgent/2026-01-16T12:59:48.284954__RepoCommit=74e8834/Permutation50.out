2026-01-16T13:24:19.080198 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (Child Benefit eligibility depends on your age as the parent or guardian).

2026-01-16T13:24:20.514193 [actor]: I'll help you by roleplaying as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

benefit eligibility Scotland teenager Fiona

2026-01-16T13:24:22.103128 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for the context. So, you're asking about Child Benefit eligibility for a teenager named Fiona in Scotland. 

To clarify, are *you* Fiona’s parent or legal guardian? Child Benefit is usually paid to the person responsible for the child, not the child themselves.

2026-01-16T13:24:22.962527 [actor]: I'm her mum child payments support

2026-01-16T13:24:24.505748 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you are Fiona’s mum and are seeking information regarding child payments/support.

To assess eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old Fiona is? Knowing her age is key, as Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 20.

2026-01-16T13:24:25.256803 [actor]: sixteen left school now

2026-01-16T13:24:26.803314 [root_agent]: Okay, Fiona is 16 and has left school. That’s helpful to know.

Now, is Fiona in full-time non-advanced education (like college or training)? Or is she working, or both? This is because Child Benefit can be affected if a young person is no longer in full-time education.

2026-01-16T13:24:27.665187 [actor]: doing that No One Left Behind programme in Edinburgh

2026-01-16T13:24:29.114276 [root_agent]: Thank you. The "No One Left Behind" programme in Edinburgh is a good detail.

Just to be clear, is this programme a full-time course? It's important to determine if it qualifies as full-time education, as that impacts Child Benefit eligibility for someone over 16.

2026-01-16T13:24:30.116854 [actor]: it's training programme for young people Scottish government runs it

2026-01-16T13:24:31.350119 [root_agent]: Okay, a Scottish Government-run training programme for young people. According to the information I have, this *could* still count as full-time education for Child Benefit purposes.

To confirm, roughly how many hours per week does Fiona spend on this training programme?

2026-01-16T13:24:32.214777 [actor]: full time every weekday can't say exact hours

2026-01-16T13:24:34.192905 [root_agent]: Okay, "full-time" and every weekday is useful information. Since it's full-time and she's not in advanced education (like university), it sounds likely that Fiona *is* still eligible for Child Benefit.

Just one final quick check: Is Fiona earning more than £150 a week (before tax and National Insurance)? This is because earnings can affect eligibility once a child is 16.

2026-01-16T13:24:35.123640 [actor]: small allowance not real wages part of programme

2026-01-16T13:24:38.634131 [root_agent]: Okay, a small allowance that isn't a real wage as part of the programme. That’s good to know – it suggests her earnings are below the £150/week threshold.

Based on the information you've provided: Fiona is 16, has left school, is participating in a full-time Scottish Government training programme (No One Left Behind), and receives only a small allowance that isn't a wage.

It appears very likely that you *are* still eligible to receive Child Benefit for Fiona. However, I recommend you double-check the details on the Gov.uk website to be completely sure: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)

Would you like me to summarise the key points or anything else?

2026-01-16T13:24:42.078520 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information, confirming that a 16-year-old in a full-time government training programme with only a small allowance would still qualify for Child Benefit.
