2026-01-16T13:10:09.645796 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This will help determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T13:10:10.940214 [actor]: I'm looking into child benefit eligibility. I'm Jenny, 35 years old.

2026-01-16T13:10:11.682990 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you Jenny. That's helpful!

Now, do you have a child under 20 years old?

2026-01-16T13:10:12.609131 [actor]: yes have son Arthur 7

2026-01-16T13:10:13.187917 [root_agent]: Great, thank you! 

Is Arthur currently living with you?

2026-01-16T13:10:13.944989 [actor]: hospital stay not home

2026-01-16T13:10:14.680669 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know Arthur is in hospital. 

Is Arthur in hospital for more than 3 months?





2026-01-16T13:10:15.764326 [actor]: been hospital 10 weeks then home 2 weeks then back hospital 3 weeks more

2026-01-16T13:10:17.005523 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So, Arthur has been in hospital for a total of 13 weeks with a short period at home in between.

To confirm, is Arthur currently *in* hospital right now?

2026-01-16T13:10:17.782351 [actor]: yes in hospital now 3 weeks this time

2026-01-16T13:10:19.032581 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. That's good to know.

Are you (Jenny) working, and if so, how many hours per week do you work, on average? This includes paid and self-employed work.

2026-01-16T13:10:19.836247 [actor]: teacher work full time

2026-01-16T13:10:21.362488 [root_agent]: Thank you. Working full-time as a teacher is good to know.

Is your partner also working? If so, approximately how many hours do they work per week? (Even if they earn very little, it’s helpful to know). If you don’t have a partner, please just say so.

2026-01-16T13:10:22.048255 [actor]: single parent

2026-01-16T13:10:23.249693 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you are a single parent.

What is your annual income from all sources (employment, self-employment, pensions, benefits etc.) *before* tax? (An approximate amount is fine for now).

2026-01-16T13:10:24.085190 [actor]: 32000 pounds

2026-01-16T13:10:25.385578 [root_agent]: Thank you. An income of £32,000 is helpful to know.

To confirm, is Arthur’s other parent not involved in his upbringing or financially supporting him? (This helps determine if you are the only person responsible for him).

2026-01-16T13:10:26.281409 [actor]: no contact with father

2026-01-16T13:10:31.281420 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that there is no contact with Arthur’s father.

Based on the information you've provided:

*   You are over 16 and responsible for Arthur.
*   Arthur is under 20.
*   You are Arthur’s main carer, and he is currently in hospital.
*   You work full-time.
*   You are a single parent with no contact with Arthur's father.
*   Your income is £32,000.

It appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. As your income is under the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold, it won't affect your eligibility. The fact that Arthur is in hospital doesn’t change your entitlement, as he is still your child.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. I strongly recommend you double-check this information and formally apply through the government website: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit)

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-16T13:10:34.337459 [actor]: Important point - since Arthur has been in the hospital for over 12 weeks total (10 weeks initially, then home for 2 weeks, then back in hospital for 3 weeks now), and he returned to hospital within 28 days of leaving (after 15 days), the hospital stays are linked under the Child Benefit rules. Since the combined stays exceed 12 weeks, I may not be eligible for Child Benefit unless I can show I'm still incurring costs for his upkeep.

2026-01-16T13:10:37.151299 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent failed to recognize that hospital stays are linked if the child returns within 28 days, and Child Benefit typically stops after 12 weeks of continuous hospital care unless the parent is still incurring costs for the child's upkeep.
