2026-01-16T13:08:34.482765 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if you are the parent or legal guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T13:08:35.730648 [actor]: I'll engage with this agent as a user seeking Child Benefit information, following the "Aged Out" Student scenario.

son in college

2026-01-16T13:08:37.021513 [root_agent]: Thank you for the information. Just to clarify, when you say your son is in college, is he under 20 years old and in full-time education? This is important as Child Benefit can continue for those in approved education.

2026-01-16T13:08:39.891852 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So your son is currently studying for A-levels and will be turning 20 soon. 

To confirm, will he have completed his A-levels *before* his 20th birthday? Knowing this will help me determine eligibility, as Child Benefit usually ends when a child turns 20, unless they are in approved full-time education.

2026-01-16T13:08:43.863149 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So his 20th birthday is next week, and he'll still be in the middle of his A-level term when he turns 20.

According to the guidelines, Child Benefit will end when he turns 20, even if he is still studying. Unfortunately, continuing in A-levels *after* turning 20 doesn't qualify him for continued payments.

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you will no longer be eligible for Child Benefit after his 20th birthday.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or would you like me to double-check any specific aspect of the rules?

2026-01-16T13:08:45.049964 [actor]: No longer eligible? That's what I thought.

2026-01-16T13:08:47.056802 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Child Benefit ends when a child turns 20, even if they are still studying A-levels.
