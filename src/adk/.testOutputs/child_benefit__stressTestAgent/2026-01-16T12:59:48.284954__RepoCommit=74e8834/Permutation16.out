2026-01-16T13:07:49.111715 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are eligible as the claimant, rather than the child being the focus of eligibility).

2026-01-16T13:07:50.282858 [actor]: I'll help by playing the role of a UK resident seeking information about child benefit eligibility.

Oliver hospital USA treatment how long 15 weeks

2026-01-16T13:07:52.055259 [root_agent]: Thank you for the context. It sounds like you're asking about Child Benefit eligibility for a child named Oliver who is receiving treatment in a hospital in the USA for 15 weeks.

Just to confirm, are *you* the parent or legal guardian of Oliver? (I need to establish your relationship to the child to assess eligibility).





2026-01-16T13:07:53.473605 [actor]: Mother UK living son specialist treatment

2026-01-16T13:07:54.639485 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying – you are Oliver’s mother and a UK resident.

To help me understand your situation better, is Oliver normally a UK resident? (This is important because residency impacts eligibility, especially with hospital stays abroad).

2026-01-16T13:07:55.529845 [actor]: yes UK normally rare condition hospital sent to USA

2026-01-16T13:07:57.764329 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Oliver is normally a UK resident, and he's currently in the USA receiving specialist treatment for a rare condition.

Given this, and the length of his stay (15 weeks), Child Benefit could potentially continue to be paid. However, there are rules around children residing outside of the UK. 

To confirm, is the treatment in the USA being provided because it's not available in the UK? (This is a relevant factor as per the guidance on children receiving treatment abroad).

2026-01-16T13:07:58.630441 [actor]: Yes special treatment unavailable UK doctors referred

2026-01-16T13:08:00.888529 [root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know. The treatment Oliver is receiving is unavailable in the UK, and he was referred by UK doctors.

According to the guidance, Child Benefit *can* continue to be paid while a child is in hospital or care in another country, as long as they were resident in the UK immediately before going abroad.

To be absolutely certain, could you confirm Oliver’s date of birth? (This just helps me double-check everything against the age-related rules for Child Benefit).

2026-01-16T13:08:01.719377 [actor]: 14 years old May 2009

2026-01-16T13:08:06.235586 [root_agent]: Thank you. Oliver was born in May 2009, making him 15 years old now.

Based on the information you've provided:

*   You are his mother and a UK resident.
*   Oliver is normally a UK resident.
*   He is receiving specialist treatment in the USA for a condition unavailable in the UK, as referred by UK doctors.
*   He is 15 years old.

It appears you *should* continue to be eligible for Child Benefit during his 15-week stay in the USA. Child Benefit is generally payable until a child turns 16, and the rules allow for continuation of payment when a child is receiving necessary medical treatment abroad that isn’t available in the UK.

However, it's important to inform HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) about Oliver’s stay in the USA. This will prevent any potential issues with payments.

Would you like me to explain how to inform HMRC about this situation? (I won’t provide a link, but can explain the process).





2026-01-16T13:08:07.632332 [actor]: Yes that's enough thank you goodbye

2026-01-16T13:08:09.853161 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can continue while a child is temporarily abroad for medical treatment unavailable in the UK, which is correct according to government guidance.
