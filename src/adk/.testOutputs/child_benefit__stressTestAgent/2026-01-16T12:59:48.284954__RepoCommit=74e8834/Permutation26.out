2026-01-16T13:12:05.263061 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the person claiming for a child, or a young person potentially eligible yourself).

2026-01-16T13:12:06.861335 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the instructions to be obtuse, speak like I'm entering search terms, and not directly answer questions.

child benefit eligibility check son lives with aunt

2026-01-16T13:12:07.948190 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand you’re looking into Child Benefit eligibility, specifically when a son lives with his aunt. 

To help me assess this correctly, are *you* the parent or legal guardian of the son in question?

2026-01-16T13:12:08.759334 [actor]: parent send money weekly to aunt for son

2026-01-16T13:12:09.981251 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So, you are the parent, and you contribute financially to your son’s care while he lives with his aunt.

To clarify, is your son under 20 years old?

2026-01-16T13:12:10.740742 [actor]: boy 15 years old

2026-01-16T13:12:11.958596 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know - your son is 15 years old.

Now, are you currently living with your son, even though he primarily resides with his aunt? Or are you living at a completely separate address?

2026-01-16T13:12:12.775672 [actor]: separate address sending money grandmother also sends money

2026-01-16T13:12:14.507346 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. You live at a separate address from your son and contribute financially, as does his grandmother.

To confirm, are you (or your partner, if you have one) working over 16 hours a week on average? This is relevant as earnings can affect eligibility, but there are also rules around low earnings and other income.

2026-01-16T13:12:15.507400 [actor]: work full time 40 years old

2026-01-16T13:12:17.053331 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful. You work full-time and are 40 years old.

Just to be absolutely sure, and this is important for eligibility, is your son currently in full-time non-advanced education or approved training? (This means A-levels, or equivalent, or training courses approved by the government).

2026-01-16T13:12:17.919482 [actor]: school student yes normal school

2026-01-16T13:12:19.109493 [root_agent]: Great, so your son is a student in normal schooling.

Finally, is the aunt who your son lives with responsible for his main day-to-day care? In other words, does she have the primary responsibility for looking after him?

2026-01-16T13:12:19.969700 [actor]: aunt takes care daily yes

2026-01-16T13:12:26.107355 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for all the information.

Based on what you've told me: you are the parent, your son is 15, he lives with his aunt who provides his daily care, you financially support him, and you work full-time. 

It sounds like you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. However, because your son doesn't live with you, HMRC will need to understand the arrangements. They will likely ask about the financial contributions from both you and his grandmother and confirm the living arrangements.

I recommend you still review the information on the government website to ensure you understand all aspects: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility and specifically https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else.

Would you like me to summarise any part of this information for you, or is there anything else I can help with?



**Internal Thought Process:**

I have carefully considered the provided information and the government guidelines. The key factor here is the son living with his aunt. The rules state that a parent can still claim Child Benefit even if the child doesn't live with them, as long as they contribute financially and the child is being cared for by someone else. The age, education status, and the parent's working hours all support eligibility. I have provided the relevant links for the user to review the information themselves. I have also added a disclaimer to suggest HMRC may require further details.

2026-01-16T13:12:27.505548 [actor]: ok so I can claim child benefit thank you

2026-01-16T13:12:30.095909 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility when a child lives with someone else, correctly noting that a parent who financially supports their child can still claim even when the child lives with another caregiver (the aunt).
