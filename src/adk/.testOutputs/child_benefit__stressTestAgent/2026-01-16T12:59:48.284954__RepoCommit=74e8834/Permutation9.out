2026-01-16T13:03:38.374243 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for the child, and your age can affect eligibility.)

2026-01-16T13:03:39.408574 [actor]: child benefit for Hans he's 5 I'm from Germany

2026-01-16T13:03:40.618789 [root_agent]: Thank you for the extra information. So you are applying for Child Benefit for Hans, who is 5 years old, and you are from Germany.

To help me assess eligibility, could you please confirm if you are currently living in the UK?

2026-01-16T13:03:41.487380 [actor]: yes living uk now pre settled status

2026-01-16T13:03:42.533749 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. You are living in the UK with pre-settled status and are claiming for Hans, who is 5.

To clarify, are you Hans’ parent or legal guardian?

2026-01-16T13:03:43.375648 [actor]: hans is my son

2026-01-16T13:03:44.693566 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. So Hans is your son.

Now, roughly, what is your annual income? (This helps determine if your income affects your eligibility, particularly if you or your partner earn over £50,000). An approximate figure is fine at this stage.

2026-01-16T13:03:45.548654 [actor]: no job looking for work

2026-01-16T13:03:46.913987 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. You are currently looking for work and have no current income.

To confirm, are you the main person responsible for Hans? (For example, do you provide the most care for him?)

2026-01-16T13:03:47.720012 [actor]: yes i am responsible father

2026-01-16T13:03:48.525436 [root_agent]: Okay, excellent. You are Hans' responsible father.

Finally, is Hans living with you in the UK?

2026-01-16T13:03:49.552174 [actor]: yes lives with me

2026-01-16T13:03:53.249920 [root_agent]: Wonderful. Hans lives with you in the UK, you are his responsible father, you have pre-settled status, he is 5 years old, and you are currently looking for work.

Based on this information, you *should* be eligible for Child Benefit. Your pre-settled status doesn’t automatically disqualify you, and Hans’ age meets the criteria. Your current lack of income also doesn’t prevent you from claiming. 

However, please be aware that HMRC will need to verify your identity and immigration status as part of the claim process.

Would you like me to summarise the key points, or do you have any other questions?

2026-01-16T13:03:54.466896 [actor]: yes eligible good

2026-01-16T13:03:56.636542 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that someone with pre-settled status living in the UK with their 5-year-old child would be eligible for Child Benefit, which aligns with official gov.uk guidance.
