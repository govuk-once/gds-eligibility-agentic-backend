2026-01-16T13:20:32.346345 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (We need to confirm you are the parent or legal guardian claiming for the child).



**My thought process:**

I need to establish if the person asking the question is the one who would be claiming the benefit - the parent or legal guardian. The eligibility criteria revolve around *their* circumstances, not the child's initially. This is the most logical first question. I will refer back to the provided links as needed throughout the conversation to ensure accuracy.

2026-01-16T13:20:33.898242 [actor]: I'll play the role of Callum's father living in Glasgow, Scotland, as described in the situation.

glasgow dad 45 years old have son callum apprentice

2026-01-16T13:20:34.591013 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. That's helpful!

Now, is Callum currently living with you?

2026-01-16T13:20:35.463831 [actor]: yes live with callum glasgow flat

2026-01-16T13:20:36.616533 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Next question: Are you working (or have you recently stopped working) at least 8 hours a week on average? This includes paid jobs, self-employment, and some unpaid work.

2026-01-16T13:20:37.611908 [actor]: plumber 35 hours week

2026-01-16T13:20:38.671612 [root_agent]: Excellent. That means you are working over 8 hours a week.

To clarify, are you married or in a civil partnership with Callum’s other parent? If so, do they also live with you?

2026-01-16T13:20:39.652777 [actor]: divorced 5 years no contact with ex

2026-01-16T13:20:40.677474 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Just to be certain, your total gross weekly income (before tax and other deductions) is less than £50,000?

2026-01-16T13:20:41.824047 [actor]: earn £32000 year

2026-01-16T13:20:42.883901 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful. £32,000 a year is well below the £50,000 threshold.

Finally, is Callum under 20 years old?

2026-01-16T13:20:43.699352 [actor]: callum 17 birthday march

2026-01-16T13:20:48.596301 [root_agent]: Okay, Callum is 17 and will turn 18 in March.

Based on the information you've provided:

*   You are over 16 and responsible for Callum.
*   Callum lives with you.
*   You work more than 8 hours a week.
*   Your income is below £50,000.
*   Callum is under 20.

It appears you *are* eligible for Child Benefit. However, as Callum is 17, the benefit will stop when he turns 18, unless he meets certain conditions such as being in full-time education.

Would you like me to briefly explain those conditions, or would you prefer I just confirm the general eligibility for now?



**My thought process:**

I have gathered all the core information needed based on the government guidelines. I have cross-referenced each answer with the eligibility criteria in the provided links. Because Callum is nearing 18, I’ve added a caveat about the benefit ending and offered further information on exceptions. I want to avoid giving incomplete information.

2026-01-16T13:20:49.401232 [actor]: modern apprentice callum now

2026-01-16T13:20:52.848301 [root_agent]: That’s very important information!

Because Callum is a modern apprentice, he's considered to be in approved training, which means you *can* continue to receive Child Benefit after he turns 18, as long as his training continues.

So, yes, you are eligible for Child Benefit, and it should continue past his 18th birthday while he remains in his modern apprenticeship.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit or anything else?



**My thought process:**

The “modern apprentice” detail is crucial. I immediately checked the eligibility rules (specifically referencing the links provided) regarding 16-19 year olds in education or approved training. A modern apprenticeship *does* qualify for continued benefit beyond 18. I have updated my response to reflect this and provided a clear confirmation.

2026-01-16T13:20:53.981042 [actor]: I understand now thank you

2026-01-16T13:20:56.417514 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a parent with a 17-year-old apprentice son, including correctly noting that benefits can continue after the child turns 18 if they remain in approved training like a modern apprenticeship.
