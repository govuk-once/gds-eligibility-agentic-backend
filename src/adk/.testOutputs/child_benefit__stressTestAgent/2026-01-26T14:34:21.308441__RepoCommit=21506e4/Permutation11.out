2026-01-26T14:38:38.990612 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one by one.

First question: Are you responsible for raising a child under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T14:38:40.876409 [actor]: I'll help you find out if you're eligible for Child Benefit by answering the agent's questions. Let me respond as Karen in this situation.

Hello there. Yes, I'm responsible for my son Ryan who is 17 years old. He lives with me at home.

2026-01-26T14:38:42.254763 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Karen. I understand you're responsible for your 17-year-old son Ryan who lives with you.

Since Ryan is over 16 but under 20, I need to ask: Is Ryan currently in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:38:43.469376 [actor]: Yes, Ryan has actually just left school and started a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England. He's been doing it for a few weeks now.

2026-01-26T14:38:44.855382 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To confirm about Ryan's apprenticeship: Is this a paid apprenticeship? And could you tell me approximately how many hours per week he works and how much he earns?

2026-01-26T14:38:46.368605 [actor]: Yes, it is a paid apprenticeship. Ryan works about 35 hours a week and earns the apprentice minimum wage, so that's around £5.28 per hour. It works out to about £185 per week before tax.

2026-01-26T14:38:47.800391 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details about Ryan's apprenticeship.

I need to check one more thing about your situation: Do either you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T14:38:48.989204 [actor]: No, I'm a single parent and my income is well below that. I make about £32,000 per year.

2026-01-26T14:38:52.946469 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on what you've told me, Karen, you are eligible for Child Benefit for your son Ryan. This is because:

1. You are responsible for raising Ryan who is 17 years old
2. Ryan is under 20 and in approved education/training (an Intermediate Apprenticeship)
3. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold (at which point Child Benefit starts to be gradually reduced)

Since you're a single parent with an income of around £32,000, you should be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount. 

If you haven't already applied, you can make a claim for Child Benefit through the UK government website, or by contacting the Child Benefit Office.

Would you like to know how much Child Benefit you may be entitled to receive?

2026-01-26T14:38:55.251898 [actor]: Oh, that's good news that I'm eligible! Yes, I would like to know how much Child Benefit I might receive for Ryan. 

Actually, I'm a bit confused though - I thought apprenticeships might affect the eligibility. Is it definitely okay that he's doing a paid apprenticeship rather than being in school or college?

2026-01-26T14:39:00.047211 [root_agent]: That's a very good question about the apprenticeship, Karen.

You're still eligible for Child Benefit because Ryan is under 20 and his apprenticeship counts as "approved training." In the UK, approved education or training includes:
- A-levels or similar qualifications
- T levels
- International Baccalaureate
- NVQs up to level 3
- Traineeships
- And importantly in Ryan's case, government-funded apprenticeships

The fact that Ryan receives payment for his apprenticeship doesn't affect your Child Benefit eligibility. The key factor is that he's in approved training and under 20 years old.

As for the amount, currently Child Benefit pays:
- £24.00 per week for your eldest or only child (which would be Ryan)
- £15.90 per week for any additional children (if you had any)

This means you would receive approximately £96.00 per month for Ryan (paid every 4 weeks).

2026-01-26T14:39:02.262398 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you! I'm relieved to hear that Ryan's apprenticeship still counts as approved training even though he's getting paid for it. The £96.00 every 4 weeks will definitely help with our household expenses.

2026-01-26T14:39:05.130736 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a 17-year-old in a government-funded apprenticeship, correctly explaining that approved training includes apprenticeships and that the payment Ryan receives doesn't affect eligibility.
