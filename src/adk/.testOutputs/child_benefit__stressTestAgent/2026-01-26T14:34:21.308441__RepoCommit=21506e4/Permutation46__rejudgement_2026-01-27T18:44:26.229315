2026-01-27T18:51:28.532080 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that the person "appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit" when the expected outcome should be "Not Eligible (Expired)" since the jobseeker status expired after 91 days and the person has been unemployed for 95 days with no job prospects.
