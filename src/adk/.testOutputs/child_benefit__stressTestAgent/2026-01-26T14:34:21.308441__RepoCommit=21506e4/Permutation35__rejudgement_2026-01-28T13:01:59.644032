2026-01-28T13:08:51.610279 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly stated the user was not eligible for Child Benefit. According to the expected outcome, the user should be eligible via exception since Rashid lives with his parents and depends on them. The agent failed to identify that an exception applies when the child lives with the claimant and the claimant is not financially supporting the spouse (or the spouse is also in education/dependent).
