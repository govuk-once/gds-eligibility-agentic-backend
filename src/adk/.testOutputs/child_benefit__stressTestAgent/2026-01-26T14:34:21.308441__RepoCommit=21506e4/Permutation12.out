2026-01-26T14:39:06.626807 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:39:07.840354 [actor]: Yes, I have responsibility for my son Liam. He's 18 years old and currently studying for his A-levels.

2026-01-26T14:39:09.634832 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Liam is 18 and studying for his A-levels, he falls within the age range for potential eligibility.

Is Liam in approved education, such as A-levels at a school or college, or other approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:39:10.834610 [actor]: Yes, he is studying for his A-levels at the local sixth form college. It's an approved educational institution.

2026-01-26T14:39:11.878071 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Liam is studying A-levels at an approved educational institution.

Do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:39:12.886602 [actor]: Yes, we live in the UK. I've lived here all my life and so has Liam.

2026-01-26T14:39:14.163763 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Does Liam live with you or are you the person who is mainly responsible for him?

2026-01-26T14:39:15.554568 [actor]: Yes, Liam lives with me in our home. I'm his mother, Jessica. He's estranged from his father, so I'm the one mainly responsible for him.

2026-01-26T14:39:16.978243 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Jessica. 

Is your individual income (or your partner's if you have one) over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T14:39:18.208963 [actor]: No, my income is nowhere near that amount. I make about £32,000 per year, and I'm a single parent.

2026-01-26T14:39:21.225984 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have responsibility for Liam, who is 18 years old and in approved education (A-levels at sixth form college)
2. You normally live in the UK
3. Liam lives with you, and you're mainly responsible for him
4. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold (at which point the High Income Child Benefit Charge would gradually reduce your benefit)

As a single parent with an income of £32,000, you should be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit amount. You can claim Child Benefit for Liam until he finishes his approved education course.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit or any other specific information about this benefit?

2026-01-26T14:39:23.108202 [actor]: Actually, I should mention that Liam receives Universal Credit in his own right. He was able to successfully claim it due to his specific circumstances to help with his personal living costs. Does this affect my eligibility for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T14:39:26.858536 [root_agent]: That's an important detail, thank you for mentioning it.

No, Liam receiving Universal Credit in his own right does not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit. You can still claim Child Benefit for Liam while he receives Universal Credit.

Child Benefit and Universal Credit are separate benefits with different eligibility criteria. Even though Liam receives Universal Credit independently, as long as he's under 20, in approved education, and you're responsible for him, you can continue to claim Child Benefit.

This is particularly important because claiming Child Benefit for Liam can help protect your National Insurance record, which may be beneficial for your future State Pension entitlement.

2026-01-26T14:39:28.657434 [actor]: I'm sorry, but I think there might be some confusion. From what I understand, if my child starts receiving Universal Credit in their own right, I would no longer be eligible for Child Benefit for them. Liam is 18 and claiming Universal Credit independently. Doesn't this mean I can't claim Child Benefit for him anymore?

2026-01-26T14:39:31.797483 [root_agent]: I need to correct my previous response. You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion.

You're correct that if Liam (who is 18) is claiming Universal Credit in his own right, you would no longer be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him.

According to the eligibility rules, Child Benefit stops when a young person aged 16 to 19 starts claiming certain benefits in their own right, including Universal Credit. Since Liam is claiming Universal Credit independently, he would be considered as supporting himself, and therefore you would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for him.

Thank you for pointing this out, and I apologize for my error in my previous response.

2026-01-26T14:39:33.605017 [actor]: That's what I thought. It's disappointing but I understand. Thank you for confirming that I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit since Liam is claiming Universal Credit in his own right. 

2026-01-26T14:39:36.145632 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent initially gave incorrect information but corrected themselves when challenged, confirming that Child Benefit is not available when a young person aged 16-19 claims Universal Credit in their own right.
