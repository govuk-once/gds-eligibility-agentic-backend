2026-01-26T14:42:33.457699 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your situation properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T14:42:35.296858 [actor]: Hello there! I'm Maria, I'm 60 years old and I look after my granddaughter Lucia who is 14. She lives with me full-time as her parents aren't able to take care of her. I was wondering if I might be eligible for Child Benefit to help with her expenses.

2026-01-26T14:42:37.573361 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Maria. I understand you're caring for your 14-year-old granddaughter Lucia who lives with you full-time.

Based on what you've shared, it seems you may be eligible for Child Benefit as you're responsible for raising a child who lives with you. However, I need to ask a few more questions to confirm your eligibility.

Is Lucia's residence with you considered permanent? In other words, is she living with you as her main home?

2026-01-26T14:42:39.043684 [actor]: Yes, Lucia lives with me permanently. This is her main home. Her parents can't take care of her, so she's been living with me for a while now. I'm the one who takes care of all her needs - school, clothes, food, everything really.

2026-01-26T14:42:40.670677 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Maria. It's clear you're taking full responsibility for Lucia's care and your home is her main residence.

Next question: Do you have any formal legal arrangement regarding Lucia's care, such as a court order, special guardianship, or any other formal custody arrangement?

2026-01-26T14:42:42.403555 [actor]: No, there's no formal legal arrangement. It's just an informal family arrangement we made. Her parents agreed that she should live with me since they can't care for her properly. There's no court order or special guardianship or anything like that. I just stepped in to help out the family, you know?

2026-01-26T14:42:43.972432 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that, Maria. An informal family arrangement can still qualify for Child Benefit as long as you're the person mainly responsible for the child.

Next question: Is anyone else currently receiving Child Benefit for Lucia? For example, either of her parents?

2026-01-26T14:42:45.613041 [actor]: No, nobody else is receiving Child Benefit for Lucia. Her parents aren't claiming it or any other benefits for her. They don't contribute financially at all to her upkeep. I'm covering all of Lucia's expenses myself.

2026-01-26T14:42:46.745856 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Maria. That's helpful to know.

Next question: Are you currently receiving any benefits for Lucia already, such as Guardian's Allowance or anything similar?

2026-01-26T14:42:48.628278 [actor]: No, I'm not receiving any benefits for Lucia at all. Not Guardian's Allowance or anything else. I've been managing on my own without any financial support. That's why I'm asking about Child Benefit now, as it's getting a bit difficult financially to provide everything she needs.

2026-01-26T14:42:50.005965 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Maria. I understand you've been managing without financial support until now.

Next question: Is Lucia in full-time education? This is important for Child Benefit eligibility for children her age.

2026-01-26T14:42:51.339695 [actor]: Yes, Lucia is in full-time education. She's in secondary school and doing well despite everything. She attends regularly and I make sure she has everything she needs for her studies.

2026-01-26T14:42:52.676671 [root_agent]: That's good to hear that Lucia is doing well in school, Maria.

Next question: Are both you and Lucia legally residing in the UK? And do you have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:42:53.952032 [actor]: Yes, both Lucia and I are legally residing in the UK. We're both British citizens and have always lived here. We definitely have the right to reside in the UK.

2026-01-26T14:42:57.182691 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Maria. That's an important eligibility factor.

Based on all the information you've provided, I can now assess your eligibility for Child Benefit:

Good news - it appears you should be eligible for Child Benefit for Lucia. You meet the key criteria:
- You're responsible for raising Lucia who lives with you permanently
- She's under 16 and in full-time education
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
- You both legally reside in the UK
- You're the person primarily caring for her, even though it's an informal arrangement

You can apply for Child Benefit even with an informal family arrangement, as you're the person who has taken on the responsibility of caring for Lucia.

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T14:42:59.125421 [actor]: That's wonderful news! Yes, I would appreciate information on how to apply for Child Benefit. It will really help with Lucia's expenses. Thank you for letting me know I'm eligible.

2026-01-26T14:43:01.419159 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that a grandparent with an informal family arrangement can claim Child Benefit for a grandchild living with them permanently, as long as they are the person mainly responsible for the child.
