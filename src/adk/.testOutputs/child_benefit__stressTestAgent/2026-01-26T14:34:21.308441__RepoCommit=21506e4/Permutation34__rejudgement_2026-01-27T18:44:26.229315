2026-01-27T18:51:21.129929 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that Child Benefit stops immediately upon custody, when in fact it continues for the first 8 weeks of custody and then stops. Since Mark has been detained for 10 weeks (beyond the 8-week threshold), the mother is indeed not eligible currently, but the agent provided incorrect information about when the benefit stops.
