2026-01-26T14:43:02.757211 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility correctly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T14:43:04.156899 [actor]: Yes, I have one child living with me. My son Sam who is 10 years old lives with me. My daughter Ella (8) lives with her mother, as we've recently divorced.

2026-01-26T14:43:05.707660 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that your 10-year-old son Sam lives with you, and your 8-year-old daughter Ella lives with her mother following your divorce.

Let me ask about your residency status. Are you living in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:43:06.646373 [actor]: Yes, I'm living in the UK. I've been here all my life.

2026-01-26T14:43:08.140549 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

For your son Sam who lives with you, is anyone else (such as another parent or guardian) already claiming Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-26T14:43:09.697370 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Sam. My ex-wife Tina and I have separate arrangements - she claims for our daughter Ella who lives with her, and I'm looking to claim for Sam who lives with me.

2026-01-26T14:43:11.138420 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. That makes sense for your arrangement.

Is Sam attending education or approved training? For a child of his age (10), this would typically mean he's attending school.

2026-01-26T14:43:12.152820 [actor]: Yes, Sam attends the local primary school. He's in Year 5 now.

2026-01-26T14:43:13.386834 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Sam is in school.

Are there any immigration or residence restrictions on you that might affect your right to claim benefits in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:43:14.675983 [actor]: No, there aren't any immigration or residence restrictions on me. As I mentioned, I've lived in the UK all my life. I'm a British citizen.

2026-01-26T14:43:15.834847 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your citizenship and residence status.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) earn over £50,000 per year individually?

2026-01-26T14:43:17.004982 [actor]: No, I don't earn over £50,000 per year. I work as a teacher and my salary is well below that threshold.

2026-01-26T14:43:20.288309 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about your income.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit for your son Sam who lives with you. Here's why:

1. You have a child (Sam) living with you
2. You are a UK resident with no immigration restrictions
3. Your child is in education (primary school)
4. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Sam
5. Your income is below the £50,000 threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would start to apply

For your daughter Ella who lives with her mother, your ex-wife would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit for her, which you mentioned she already does.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T14:43:22.541442 [actor]: Yes, that's great news! I would like information about how to apply for Child Benefit for Sam. Also, just to confirm - since Sam is my eldest child living with me, would I receive the higher "eldest child" rate even though Ella (who is younger) lives with her mother?

2026-01-26T14:43:25.038509 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that the user would be eligible for Child Benefit for Sam who lives with them, accurately applying the eligibility criteria regarding UK residency, child living arrangements, education status, and income thresholds.
