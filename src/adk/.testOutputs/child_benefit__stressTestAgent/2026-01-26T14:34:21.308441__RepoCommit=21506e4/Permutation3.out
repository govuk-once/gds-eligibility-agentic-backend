2026-01-26T14:35:11.384472 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To make this assessment, I'll need to ask you a series of questions, one at a time.

First, are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:35:12.769889 [actor]: I'll role-play as a person seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Yes, I'm responsible for my son Ben who lives with me. He's 17 and we live together in the UK.

2026-01-26T14:35:14.675256 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's a good start for determining your eligibility.

How old is your son Ben exactly? Is he 17 years and how many months? I need to understand whether he falls within the age requirements for Child Benefit.

2026-01-26T14:35:15.981818 [actor]: Yes, Ben is 17. He turned 17 about three months ago. We live together in our home here in the UK.

2026-01-26T14:35:17.793582 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming Ben's age. Since Ben is 17, we need to understand his current education or training situation.

Is Ben in approved education, such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:35:19.613851 [actor]: No, Ben actually left school in June after finishing his GCSEs. He didn't go on to college, but he has registered with our local youth careers service and is actively looking for an apprenticeship. He's been applying for positions for about two months now.

2026-01-26T14:35:23.479229 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Ben is 17, has left school after his GCSEs, and is not currently in approved education or training, this affects his eligibility for Child Benefit.

Based on the UK government guidelines, Child Benefit can be paid for children under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training. Since Ben is 17 and not currently in approved education or training, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for him at this time.

If Ben does start an approved education or training program (like an apprenticeship) before he turns 20, you could become eligible again and should apply or inform Child Benefit if you were previously receiving it.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T14:35:25.447552 [actor]: Actually, I think there might be some special extension or something? Ben only left school in June, and he's registered with the careers service and actively looking for an apprenticeship. It's only been about two months since he left education. I thought there was some kind of grace period for teenagers in this situation?

2026-01-26T14:35:29.823502 [root_agent]: You're asking about an important point. Let me clarify this for you.

You're correct that there is an extension period. Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after a child leaves approved education or training if they're registered with a careers service, Connexions, local authority support service, or similar organization. This is sometimes called the "extension period" or "child benefit extension period."

Since Ben left school in June and has been registered with your local youth careers service while looking for an apprenticeship for about two months now, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit under this extension period, as it hasn't yet been 20 weeks since he left education.

To maintain this eligibility during the extension period, Ben needs to remain registered with the careers service and be actively seeking work or training.

Have you been receiving Child Benefit for Ben previously?

2026-01-26T14:35:31.953877 [actor]: Yes, I've been receiving Child Benefit for Ben since he was born. So based on what you're saying, I should still be eligible to receive it for a few more months while he's looking for an apprenticeship? That's good news. I wasn't sure if I needed to inform the Child Benefit office about his change in circumstances.

2026-01-26T14:35:37.188297 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. Since you've been receiving Child Benefit for Ben, and he left school less than 20 weeks ago and is registered with a careers service while actively seeking an apprenticeship, you should continue to be eligible for up to 20 weeks from when he left education in June.

However, you should inform the Child Benefit office about this change in his circumstances. While you remain eligible during this extension period, it's important to notify them that he has left approved education but is registered with a careers service and looking for work or training. This ensures your payments continue correctly during the extension period.

You can report this change through your online Child Benefit account, by phone, or by writing to the Child Benefit Office. When reporting the change, be sure to mention that he's registered with the careers service and actively looking for an apprenticeship.

Would you like me to provide more details about how to notify the Child Benefit office about this change?

2026-01-26T14:35:40.877222 [actor]: Thank you for clarifying that. Yes, I'm still eligible during this extension period of 20 weeks since Ben left school in June, as he's registered with the careers service and looking for an apprenticeship. I'll make sure to inform the Child Benefit office about his change in circumstances right away. I can handle that through my online Child Benefit account. That's really helpful information.

2026-01-26T14:35:43.029891 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the person remains eligible for Child Benefit during a 20-week extension period after their 17-year-old left school, since the child is registered with a careers service and actively looking for an apprenticeship.
