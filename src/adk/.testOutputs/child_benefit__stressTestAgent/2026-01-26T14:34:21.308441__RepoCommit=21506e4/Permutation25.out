2026-01-26T14:44:29.156739 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:44:30.615252 [actor]: I need to play the role of someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. Let me engage with you as that person.

Yes, I have a child named Leo who is 5 years old, but he's currently in local authority care and has been for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-26T14:44:35.764890 [root_agent]: #internal_monologue
This is important information. The person has a child who is 5 years old but is currently in local authority care. I need to check the eligibility criteria for this specific situation using the approved sources.

From the gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital or care (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), if a child is in local authority care, this affects Child Benefit eligibility. 

The rules state that a person cannot get Child Benefit if their child is in care for more than 8 weeks. Since the child has been in local authority care for about 10 weeks, this exceeds the 8-week threshold, which would typically mean they're not eligible.

I should ask follow-up questions to confirm all details and understand the full situation.
#end_internal_monologue

Thank you for sharing that information. Since Leo has been in local authority care for about 10 weeks, which is longer than 8 weeks, you're generally not eligible to receive Child Benefit during this period.

May I ask if Leo comes to stay with you for any regular periods, such as weekends or holidays?

2026-01-26T14:44:38.201716 [actor]: No, Leo doesn't come to stay with us regularly at the moment. The situation is quite difficult. I don't have any income myself so I can't contribute to Leo's care, but my husband (Leo's stepfather) does send £30 every week to help with Leo's upkeep. We're still very much involved in his life even though he's in care right now.

2026-01-26T14:44:44.315022 [root_agent]: #internal_monologue
Let me consider this additional information carefully:
- Leo has been in local authority care for 10 weeks
- Leo doesn't come to stay with them regularly
- The parent doesn't have income but the stepfather contributes £30 weekly for Leo's upkeep
- They remain involved in Leo's life

According to the guidance on gov.uk for children in care:
1. Child Benefit generally stops after a child has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks
2. Financial contributions toward the child's maintenance don't affect this rule
3. There are no exceptions mentioned for continued involvement in the child's life if they don't have regular stays with the parent

Based on this information, it appears the parent is not currently eligible for Child Benefit while Leo remains in care beyond the 8-week period. However, I should inform them about what happens when/if Leo returns to their care.
#end_internal_monologue

I understand this is a difficult situation. Based on the information you've provided, you're currently not eligible to receive Child Benefit for Leo because:

1. Child Benefit typically stops when a child has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks (Leo has been in care for 10 weeks)
2. While it's commendable that your husband contributes to Leo's upkeep, financial contributions don't maintain eligibility for Child Benefit while a child is in care

If Leo returns to live with you in the future, you would be able to claim Child Benefit again. Would you like me to explain what you would need to do in that situation?

2026-01-26T14:44:46.145045 [actor]: Are you sure about that? I thought I read somewhere that if we're paying money toward his upkeep - which my husband is doing regularly - we'd still be eligible for Child Benefit even though Leo is in care. Is that not correct?

2026-01-26T14:44:52.743059 [root_agent]: #internal_monologue
I need to carefully check the information about financial contributions and eligibility for Child Benefit when a child is in care.

Looking at the official guidance on gov.uk (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), the rules state:

- Child Benefit stops if a child goes into care for more than 8 weeks
- There is no specific exception mentioned for parents who make financial contributions toward the child's upkeep

The key factor appears to be whether the child is being "looked after" by the local authority, not whether the parents contribute financially.

I need to be absolutely certain about this as the person believes they may still be eligible due to their financial contributions. Let me ensure I'm providing accurate information based only on the official sources.
#end_internal_monologue

I understand your question, and I want to make sure I'm giving you the correct information.

According to the official UK government guidance, Child Benefit generally stops if a child has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, regardless of whether you're making financial contributions toward their upkeep.

The key factor determining eligibility is that the child is being "looked after" by the local authority, not living with you. The financial contributions, while important for Leo's wellbeing, don't change the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

If you previously received different information, I recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly at 0300 200 3100 to discuss your specific circumstances, as they can provide personalized advice about your situation.

Would you like me to explain what would happen with Child Benefit if Leo returns to your care in the future?

2026-01-26T14:44:55.917507 [actor]: I'm confused because I thought my husband's contributions would count for something. He pays £30 per week specifically for Leo's upkeep, and we're still legally his parents even if he's temporarily in care. 

Is there really no exception for parents who are financially contributing to their child's care? That doesn't seem right to me.

2026-01-26T14:45:02.804974 [root_agent]: #internal_monologue
I understand the person's confusion and frustration. Let me carefully review the official guidance again to make sure I'm providing accurate information.

From the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit for children in hospital or care (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), the rules are clear that Child Benefit stops if a child is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks.

The guidance doesn't mention any exceptions based on:
1. Parents making financial contributions
2. Parents retaining legal parenthood
3. The temporary nature of the care arrangement

The key factor determining eligibility is whether the child is being "looked after" by the local authority rather than living with the claimant.

I should acknowledge their concerns while providing accurate information based solely on the official guidance.
#end_internal_monologue

I understand your confusion and frustration. It does seem counterintuitive, especially when you and your husband remain involved and are financially contributing to Leo's care.

However, based on the official UK government guidance, there isn't an exception to the Child Benefit rules for parents who make financial contributions while their child is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks. The key factor for eligibility is whether Leo is being "looked after" by the local authority rather than living with you, regardless of your continued financial support or legal parental status.

This is specifically stated in the government guidance, which indicates that Child Benefit stops after a child has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks.

Given your unique circumstances, I would recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly at 0300 200 3100. They can review your specific situation and provide definitive guidance, as there may be nuances to your case that general guidelines don't address.

2026-01-26T14:45:05.513080 [actor]: This doesn't make sense. The money my husband is sending is specifically to contribute to Leo's upkeep. I thought that if we're financially supporting him, even if he's in care, we should still get Child Benefit. Can you please double check this information? My husband and I are married and living together, and he's paying £30 per week for Leo. Surely that counts for something?

2026-01-26T14:45:13.899063 [root_agent]: #internal_monologue
I understand the person feels strongly about this. Let me carefully re-examine the official guidance once more to ensure I'm providing accurate information.

From reviewing the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, the rules state:

"You cannot get Child Benefit if your child:
- has been in care (looked after by the local authority) for more than 8 weeks in a row"

There is no mention of exceptions for:
- Parents who make regular financial contributions
- Stepparents who contribute financially
- The marital status of the parents
- The temporary nature of the care arrangement

The guidance is quite clear that when a child is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, Child Benefit stops, regardless of other factors including financial contributions.

Let me also check the other resources to be absolutely certain there are no exceptions I've missed.
#end_internal_monologue

I understand your frustration and have double-checked the official government guidance carefully.

The UK government rules on Child Benefit are specific: when a child has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, Child Benefit payments stop. This applies regardless of:
- Financial contributions you or your husband make toward Leo's upkeep
- Your continued legal parental rights
- The fact that you're married and living together
- The temporary nature of the care arrangement

I appreciate that this may seem unfair, especially when you're continuing to financially support Leo. However, according to the official guidance, the £30 weekly contribution, while important for Leo's wellbeing, doesn't affect Child Benefit eligibility while he's in care.

Given your concerns, I strongly recommend:
1. Contacting the Child Benefit Office directly at 0300 200 3100
2. Speaking with a welfare rights advisor who might be able to suggest other forms of support you might be eligible for

Would that be helpful?

2026-01-26T14:45:18.031700 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops after a child has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, regardless of financial contributions from parents.
