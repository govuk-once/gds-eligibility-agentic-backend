2026-01-28T13:08:54.241182 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the user appears eligible for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is "Not Eligible (Expired)". While the agent later discussed potential risk to eligibility after learning about the 95-day jobseeker status (exceeding the 91-day limit), they never clearly stated that the user is now ineligible.
