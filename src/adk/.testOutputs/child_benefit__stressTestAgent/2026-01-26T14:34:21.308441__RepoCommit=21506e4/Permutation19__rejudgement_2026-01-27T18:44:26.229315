2026-01-27T18:50:56.454527 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ The agent failed to provide a clear verdict on eligibility. The expected outcome was "Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible" but the agent only explained that HMRC would decide without explicitly stating that Sue would likely be eligible based on having Holly 4 days vs Pete's 3 days.
