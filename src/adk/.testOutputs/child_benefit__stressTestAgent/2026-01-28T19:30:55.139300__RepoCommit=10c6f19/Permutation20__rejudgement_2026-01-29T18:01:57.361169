**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Maria is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key assessment points:**

1. **Criteria 1 (Responsibility):** The agent correctly identified that Maria is responsible for her granddaughter Lucia, who lives with her and for whom she provides day-to-day care and financial support.

2. **Criteria 2 (Relationship):** The agent appropriately recognized that Maria does not need to be the parent to claim Child Benefit. The guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility confirms that you can claim if you're responsible for a child, even under informal arrangements with friends or relatives, provided the local council isn't paying for accommodation.

3. **Other eligibility factors:** The agent verified:
   - Child is under 16 (Lucia is 14) ✓
   - Lives in UK ✓
   - UK citizen ✓
   - No one else claiming ✓

4. **Communication:** The agent clearly communicated the eligibility outcome and provided helpful next steps for applying.

The agent's assessment matches the expected outcome that Maria is eligible for Child Benefit under the informal guardian scenario, despite the previous judge's notation (✓) being somewhat brief. The agent's reasoning was sound and comprehensive.
