**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly assessed the eligibility outcome. Here's why:

**Expected Outcome:** Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Eligible

**Key Error:** The agent failed to apply the "linking rule" for hospital stays. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital, when a child returns to hospital within 28 days of leaving, the stays are treated as one continuous period and count cumulatively toward the 12-week limit.

**Facts of the case:**
- First hospital stay: 10 weeks
- Time at home: 2 weeks (14 days - well within the 28-day linking period)
- Second hospital stay: 3 weeks
- **Cumulative total: 13 weeks**

Since Arthur returned to hospital within 28 days (he returned after only 14 days), the two stays must be linked together. The cumulative total of 13 weeks exceeds the 12-week eligibility limit, meaning Jenny (the parent) would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit after the 12th cumulative week.

The agent incorrectly stated "As long as each individual hospital stay doesn't exceed 12 weeks, you should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit" - this demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the linking rule and results in communicating the wrong eligibility outcome.
