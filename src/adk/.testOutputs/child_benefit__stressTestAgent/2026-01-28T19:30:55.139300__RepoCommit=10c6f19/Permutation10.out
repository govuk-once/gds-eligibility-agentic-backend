2026-01-28T19:36:09.990768 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child (or children) who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T19:36:11.826780 [actor]: child in my care 12 yrs old fosster kid council pays me

2026-01-28T19:36:14.825603 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 12-year-old foster child in your care, and the council pays you for fostering them.

Let me ask you an important question to assess your eligibility:

**Is this child placed with you by the local authority as a formal foster care arrangement, or do you have an informal private fostering arrangement?**

In other words, are you a registered foster carer working through the local authority fostering system?

2026-01-28T19:36:16.399847 [actor]: local authority placed liam with me yes registerd foster carer get allowence from council

2026-01-28T19:36:19.022199 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. You're a registered foster carer and Liam was placed with you by the local authority, and you receive a fostering allowance from the council.

This is an important distinction for Child Benefit eligibility. Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you considered to be Liam's "main carer" - meaning you're responsible for his day-to-day care and he lives with you full-time?**

2026-01-28T19:36:20.434865 [actor]: yes liam lives with me im responsble for him

2026-01-28T19:36:23.606586 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. You are Liam's main carer and he lives with you full-time.

Now, here's an important question regarding your specific situation as a foster carer:

**Does the local authority contribute at least the same amount towards Liam's care as the current Child Benefit rate (which is £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, or £16.95 per week for additional children)?**

In other words, is the fostering allowance you receive from the council at least £25.60 per week?

2026-01-28T19:36:25.234333 [actor]: council pays for liams accommodation and maintenance full allowence

2026-01-28T19:36:28.120455 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since the council pays you a full fostering allowance for Liam's accommodation and maintenance, this is a key factor.

Let me ask you this:

**Do you know approximately how much per week the council pays you for Liam's care? Is it more than £25.60 per week?**

This will help me determine your Child Benefit eligibility, as foster carers who receive certain amounts from the local authority may not be eligible for Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T19:36:29.907631 [actor]: not sure exact amount but council covers everything for him

2026-01-28T19:36:33.799614 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me explain your situation regarding Child Benefit eligibility.

Based on what you've told me, since you are a registered foster carer receiving a full fostering allowance from the local authority that covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance, **you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam**.

This is because when a local authority pays towards a child's accommodation or maintenance (which they do through fostering allowances), the foster carer cannot claim Child Benefit for that child. The fostering allowance you receive from the council is instead of Child Benefit.

However, let me ask one more question to ensure I've given you complete information:

**Do you have any other children living with you (either your own biological children or adopted children who are not looked-after by the local authority)?**

If you do have other children, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit for them.

2026-01-28T19:36:36.945188 [actor]: no just liam thanks for info

2026-01-28T19:36:39.064566 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that as a registered foster carer receiving a full fostering allowance from the local authority that covers the child's accommodation and maintenance, I am not eligible for Child Benefit for the foster child, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
