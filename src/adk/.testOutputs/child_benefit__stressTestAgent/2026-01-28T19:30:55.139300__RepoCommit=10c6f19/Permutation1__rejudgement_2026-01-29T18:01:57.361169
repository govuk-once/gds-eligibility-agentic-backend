**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis of the conversation:**

1. **Criteria 1 (Responsibility):** ✓ Confirmed - the user is responsible for an 8-year-old child
2. **Criteria 2 (Child's Age):** ✓ Confirmed - child is 8 years old (under 16)
3. **Criteria 3 (Residency/Immigration):** ✓ Confirmed - family is British and lives in Manchester
4. **Criteria 4 (Living Arrangements):** ✓ Confirmed - child lives with the applicant
5. **Criteria 5 (State Support):** ✓ Not applicable - child lives at home
6. **Criteria 6 (High Income Charge):** ✓ Confirmed - highest individual income is £35,000 (below £50,000 threshold)

The agent systematically gathered all necessary information, correctly assessed each criterion, and arrived at the accurate conclusion that the applicant is eligible for Child Benefit. The agent also helpfully clarified that there would be no High Income Child Benefit Charge due to both incomes being below the threshold.

The expected outcome states "Eligible" and the agent communicated "You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" - these outcomes agree.
