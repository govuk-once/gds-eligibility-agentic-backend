2026-01-29T18:22:22.315204 [confirmation_judge]: Looking at this transcript, I need to assess whether the agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome.

**Expected Outcome:** Not Eligible

**Agent's Communication:**
The agent correctly identified the critical issue - that a standard 6-month tourist visa does not provide "right to reside" for benefits purposes. The agent explicitly stated: "Child Benefit eligibility requires that you have the right to reside in the UK. A tourist visa (visitor visa) typically does not give you the 'right to reside' for benefits purposes."

However, the conversation was cut off before the agent delivered a final eligibility determination. The agent was still gathering information (asking about UK nationality or other connections) and had not yet explicitly stated "you are not eligible for Child Benefit."

**Analysis:**
While the agent was clearly moving toward the correct conclusion and had identified the disqualifying factor (lack of right to reside), they did not complete the conversation with a definitive statement of ineligibility. The agent's direction was correct, but the outcome was not formally communicated.

Given the transcript ends mid-conversation without a clear final eligibility determination being stated, and the task requires assessing whether "the agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome," I must conclude that no definitive outcome was actually communicated yet.

**Judgement:** 👎 - The agent was on the right track but did not complete the eligibility determination before the conversation ended.
