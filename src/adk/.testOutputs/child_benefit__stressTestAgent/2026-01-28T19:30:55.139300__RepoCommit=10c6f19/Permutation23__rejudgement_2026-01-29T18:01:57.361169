**Justification:**

The agent determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome is that the user should be **eligible**.

According to the scenario details and official guidance (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else), a parent who does not live with their child may still be eligible for Child Benefit if they contribute to the child's upbringing at a rate that equals or exceeds the Child Benefit amount.

**Key facts from the transcript:**
- The user contributes £120 every 4 weeks (monthly) for groceries and clothes
- This averages to £30 per week (£120 ÷ 4 weeks)
- The Child Benefit threshold is £26.05 per week
- £30/week exceeds the threshold

**The agent's error:**
The agent failed to recognize that regular financial contributions at or above the Child Benefit rate can establish eligibility even when the child lives elsewhere. The agent incorrectly concluded that because the child lives full-time with the mother, the user cannot be eligible. This overlooks the provision for non-resident parents who make sufficient regular contributions.

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent (not eligible) **does not agree** with the expected outcome (eligible).
