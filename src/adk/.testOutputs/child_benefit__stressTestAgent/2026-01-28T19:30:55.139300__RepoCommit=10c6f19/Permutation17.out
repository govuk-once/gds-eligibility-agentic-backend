2026-01-28T19:41:03.289341 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T19:41:04.606409 [actor]: child benefit army germany

2026-01-28T19:41:06.913938 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. It sounds like there may be a connection to the military and Germany.

Let me ask: Are you a member of the UK Armed Forces currently stationed in Germany, and do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T19:41:08.357496 [actor]: yes stationed germany kids 8 and 10

2026-01-28T19:41:11.013004 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you're stationed in Germany with the UK Armed Forces and have children aged 8 and 10.

Now I need to ask: Are you responsible for these children? By this I mean, do they normally live with you, or are you the main person looking after them and paying towards their upbringing?

2026-01-28T19:41:12.495956 [actor]: kids live with me on base

2026-01-28T19:41:14.851924 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful information - your children aged 8 and 10 live with you on the military base in Germany.

Let me ask: Are you or your partner (if you have one) currently receiving Child Benefit for these children from another country, such as Germany or any other nation?

2026-01-28T19:41:16.491115 [actor]: no not receiving from germany

2026-01-28T19:41:18.358641 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now I need to ask: Are you ordinarily resident in the UK, or treated as ordinarily resident for tax purposes? In other words, is the UK your main home where you normally live, even though you're currently stationed in Germany?

2026-01-28T19:41:19.860531 [actor]: uk home posted germany military

2026-01-28T19:41:21.919831 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So the UK is your home and you're posted to Germany for military service.

One more important question: Do you or your partner earn over £50,000 per year? This doesn't affect your eligibility to claim Child Benefit, but it may affect whether you need to pay a tax charge.

2026-01-28T19:41:23.518602 [actor]: wife and kids with me base

2026-01-28T19:41:25.711204 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information - so your wife and children are with you on the base.

Let me ask about income: Do you or your wife earn over £50,000 per year? Again, this doesn't affect whether you can claim Child Benefit, but it's important to know as it may mean you need to pay a High Income Child Benefit Charge through your tax return.

2026-01-28T19:41:27.113125 [actor]: wife stays home i work military

2026-01-28T19:41:30.011211 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information - so your wife stays at home with the children and you work in the military.

Just to clarify the income question: Does your military income (including any allowances) exceed £50,000 per year? This is important because if your income is between £50,000 and £60,000, you'll need to pay back some of the Child Benefit through tax, and if it's over £60,000, you'll need to pay it all back - though you can still claim it to protect your wife's National Insurance credits.

2026-01-28T19:41:31.996676 [actor]: dont know exact salary just need to know eligble or not

2026-01-28T19:41:36.825822 [root_agent]: That's absolutely fine. Let me focus on your eligibility.

Based on what you've told me:

- You're a UK Armed Forces member stationed in Germany
- The UK is your main home
- You have two children aged 8 and 10 who live with you
- You're responsible for them
- You're not receiving child benefit from Germany or another country

**You are eligible for Child Benefit.**

As a member of the UK Armed Forces, even though you're stationed abroad in Germany, you're treated as ordinarily resident in the UK for Child Benefit purposes. Your children are under 16 and live with you, so you meet all the eligibility criteria.

You can claim Child Benefit for both of your children. 

Regarding the income question I asked earlier - you don't need to know your exact salary to claim, but once you do claim, if either you or your wife earns over £50,000, the higher earner will need to pay some or all of it back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge. However, it's still worth claiming as it protects your wife's National Insurance record for her future State Pension.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:41:41.921302 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that as a UK Armed Forces member stationed in Germany with two children aged 8 and 10 living with them, and not receiving benefits from another country, the user is eligible for Child Benefit, correctly noting that Armed Forces members are treated as ordinarily resident in the UK even when stationed abroad.
