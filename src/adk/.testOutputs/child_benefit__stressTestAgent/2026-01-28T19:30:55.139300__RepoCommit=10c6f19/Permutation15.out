2026-01-28T19:40:01.135563 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:40:02.626093 [actor]: child benefit eligable daughter 12 years old

2026-01-28T19:40:04.530326 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 12-year-old daughter, which means she meets the age requirement.

Next question: **Does your daughter normally live with you?**

2026-01-28T19:40:06.261435 [actor]: no she livs with her mum i send money for food every week

2026-01-28T19:40:09.600806 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since your daughter doesn't live with you, let me ask:

**Do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards the cost of looking after your daughter?**

(For context, Child Benefit is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, and £16.95 per week for additional children)

2026-01-28T19:40:11.100551 [actor]: i send 10 pounds week to her mum for food costs

2026-01-28T19:40:13.560616 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're contributing £10 per week, which is less than the Child Benefit rate of £25.60 per week for an eldest or only child, this is an important factor.

Let me ask another question: **Does your daughter's mother currently claim Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-28T19:40:15.280433 [actor]: no she dosnt claim it

2026-01-28T19:40:17.754553 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you this:

**Do you contribute towards your daughter's upbringing in any other ways beyond the £10 per week for food? For example, do you pay for clothing, school items, activities, or other costs for her care?**

2026-01-28T19:40:19.295640 [actor]: send birthday present once a year thats it

2026-01-28T19:40:21.443332 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me ask one more important question:

**Do you have regular contact with your daughter, and is she part of your household in any way (for example, does she stay with you for periods of time, such as weekends or school holidays)?**

2026-01-28T19:40:22.794738 [actor]: no regular contact just the birthday present

2026-01-28T19:40:27.228294 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, I need to give you an assessment of your eligibility.

**Unfortunately, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.** Here's why:

1. **Your daughter doesn't live with you** - She lives with her mother, so you're not the primary carer.

2. **Your financial contribution is below the Child Benefit threshold** - You contribute £10 per week, but Child Benefit pays £25.60 per week for an eldest/only child. To be eligible when a child lives elsewhere, you generally need to contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay.

3. **Limited involvement in her care** - You have no regular contact beyond sending a birthday present annually, which suggests you're not actively involved in her day-to-day upbringing.

**The person who would likely be eligible is your daughter's mother**, as she is the one who has your daughter living with her and is responsible for her day-to-day care. She should consider claiming Child Benefit if she hasn't already.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:40:32.351818 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter doesn't live with me, my financial contribution (£10/week) is below the Child Benefit threshold (£25.60/week), and I have limited involvement in her care with no regular contact.
