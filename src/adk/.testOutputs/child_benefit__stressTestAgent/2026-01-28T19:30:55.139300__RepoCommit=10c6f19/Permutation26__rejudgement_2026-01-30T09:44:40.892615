**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user (Mo) is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Child's age:** Zahid is 15 years old (under 16) ✓

2. **Relationship:** Mo is Zahid's father ✓

3. **Living arrangements:** Zahid lives with his aunt who only provides housing, not financial support ✓

4. **Financial contributions:** Mo and his mother each contribute £15/week (totaling £30/week), which exceeds the Child Benefit threshold of £26.05 ✓

5. **No competing claim:** The aunt doesn't claim Child Benefit ✓

6. **Aggregated contributions:** The agent correctly recognized that combined contributions from Mo and his mother can be counted together to meet the threshold, which aligns with the guidance that "contributions still count if more than one person is contributing, as long as the total contributions are worth at least as much as the Child Benefit"

7. **Agreement requirement:** The agent appropriately noted that Mo and his mother need to agree on who claims (since only one person can claim), and Mo confirmed agreement

The agent's conclusion that Mo "could be eligible" and can claim Child Benefit (provided agreement with his mother) is accurate and matches the expected eligible outcome.
