**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and the official guidance, the user **should be eligible**.

**Why the agent was incorrect:**

1. **The "contributing to upkeep" exception applies**: According to [gov.uk guidance](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), you can claim Child Benefit if you're responsible for a child, even if they don't live with you, provided you contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount to their upkeep.

2. **Mark meets this exception**: Mark contributes £150 per month (approximately £34.62/week), which exceeds the Child Benefit rate of approximately £26.05/week for the eldest/only child.

3. **No concurrent claim exists**: Jenny is not claiming Child Benefit. If she were claiming, she would have priority as the person the child lives with. But since she isn't, Mark can claim based on his financial contribution.

4. **The agent's error**: The agent repeatedly stated that only the person the child lives with can claim, and failed to recognize or apply the exception for non-resident parents who contribute to their child's upkeep at or above the Child Benefit rate.

**Conclusion**: The agent's determination that Mark is "not eligible" contradicts the expected outcome that Mark is "Eligible" under the contributing parent exception.
