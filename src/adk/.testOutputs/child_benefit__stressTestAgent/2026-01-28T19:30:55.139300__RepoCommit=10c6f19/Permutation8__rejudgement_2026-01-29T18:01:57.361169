**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit but subject to a tax charge** (the High Income Child Benefit Charge). This aligns perfectly with the expected outcome.

**Key evidence:**

1. The agent explicitly stated: "✓ **You are eligible for Child Benefit for Ruby.**"

2. The agent clearly explained the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies because Fiona earns £75,000 (over the £60,000 threshold)

3. The agent accurately calculated that approximately 75% of the benefit would need to be paid back through tax (1% for every £200 over £60,000)

4. The agent provided both options: claim and pay the charge, or opt out of payments while still registering

5. The user's final response ("ok so eligible then need to pay back some got it") confirms they understood they are eligible but with a tax obligation

The agent's communication was accurate, comprehensive, and matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)" for someone earning between £60,000 and £80,000.
