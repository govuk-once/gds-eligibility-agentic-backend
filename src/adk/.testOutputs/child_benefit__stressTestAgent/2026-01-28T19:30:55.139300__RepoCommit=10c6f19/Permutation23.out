2026-01-28T19:44:38.089144 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:44:39.850933 [actor]: child benefit groceries 120 pounds daughter

2026-01-28T19:44:41.505762 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I can see you have a daughter and are thinking about Child Benefit.

To help assess your eligibility, let me ask:

**How old is your daughter?**

2026-01-28T19:44:43.319223 [actor]: shes 12 live with her mum not me

2026-01-28T19:44:45.877514 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Since your daughter is 12 and lives with her mum rather than with you, this is an important factor.

Let me ask you:

**Do you contribute towards your daughter's upbringing, for example by paying maintenance or regularly helping with her costs?**

(I'm asking because there are specific rules about Child Benefit when a child doesn't live with you)

2026-01-28T19:44:47.257186 [actor]: groceries clothes every month 120 pounds

2026-01-28T19:44:49.327932 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you're contributing £120 per month towards groceries and clothes for your daughter who lives with her mum.

Let me ask an important question:

**Is your daughter's mum currently claiming Child Benefit for your daughter?**

(This is important because generally only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child)

2026-01-28T19:44:50.886451 [actor]: dont know if she claims maybe

2026-01-28T19:44:53.079125 [root_agent]: I understand - you're not sure if your daughter's mum is claiming Child Benefit.

Here's an important follow-up question:

**Are you the main person responsible for your daughter, or is her mum the main person responsible for her day-to-day care?**

(Since your daughter lives with her mum, I need to understand who has the primary responsibility for her care and upbringing)

2026-01-28T19:44:54.666313 [actor]: she lives with mum I send grocerys

2026-01-28T19:44:57.327335 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on what you've told me, your daughter lives with her mum, and you support by sending £120 monthly for groceries and clothes.

Let me ask one more important question to complete the assessment:

**Does your daughter live with her mum full-time, or does she spend significant time living with you as well (for example, does she stay with you regularly or part of the week)?**

2026-01-28T19:44:58.875935 [actor]: full time with mum I dont live with her

2026-01-28T19:45:02.810383 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me:

**Based on your circumstances, you would NOT be eligible to claim Child Benefit** for your daughter. Here's why:

1. **Your daughter lives full-time with her mum** - Child Benefit is normally paid to the person the child lives with and who is responsible for them on a day-to-day basis.

2. **Only one person can claim** - Child Benefit can only be claimed by one person for the same child. Since your daughter lives with her mum, her mum would be the person eligible to claim.

3. **Your contributions** - While it's great that you're contributing £120 monthly towards groceries and clothes, this doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit when the child doesn't live with you.

**Important note:** Your daughter's mum should check if she's claiming Child Benefit, as she would likely be eligible since your daughter lives with her full-time.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T19:45:07.660462 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter lives full-time with her mother, who would be the eligible claimant as the primary caregiver, and only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child.
