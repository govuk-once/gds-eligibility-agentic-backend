**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct Assessment of Living Arrangement:** The agent properly identified that the daughter does not live with the applicant (Mike), but with her mother.

2. **Accurate Application of Contribution Threshold:** The agent correctly applied the key eligibility criterion for non-resident parents - that contributions must be at least equal to the Child Benefit rate (£25.60/week in the agent's statement, close to the £26.05/week mentioned in the scenario). The agent accurately determined that Mike's £10/week contribution falls significantly short of this threshold.

3. **Consideration of Overall Responsibility:** The agent appropriately assessed that Mike has limited involvement in his daughter's care (only sending a birthday present once a year with no regular contact), which further supports the conclusion that he does not meet the "responsibility" criterion.

4. **Clear Communication:** The agent provided a well-structured explanation with three clear reasons why Mike is not eligible, making the outcome easy to understand.

5. **Helpful Additional Information:** The agent appropriately suggested that the mother would likely be eligible, which is accurate given she has the daughter living with her and provides day-to-day care.

The agent's determination aligns perfectly with the expected outcome that Mike is **Not Eligible** due to insufficient contribution to the child's upkeep.
