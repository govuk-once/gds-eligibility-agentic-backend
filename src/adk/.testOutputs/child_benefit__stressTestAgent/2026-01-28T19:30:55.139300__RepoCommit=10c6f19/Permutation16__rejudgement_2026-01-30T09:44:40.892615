2026-01-30T10:06:01.016729 [confirmation_judge]: ## Analysis

The agent concluded that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit.

### Expected Outcome
**Eligible** - The child went abroad specifically for hospital treatment, which is an exception to the standard 12-week hospital rule under international circumstances.

### Agent's Assessment
The agent correctly identified that:
- The user is responsible for Oliver (14 years old, under 16) ✓
- They normally live together in the UK ✓
- Oliver is only temporarily abroad for hospital treatment ✓
- The user continues to pay for his costs ✓
- He is expected to return after treatment ✓

The agent appropriately applied the rule that Child Benefit can continue when a child is temporarily in hospital abroad for treatment, recognizing this as a temporary absence that doesn't affect eligibility.

### Comparison with Expected Outcome
The agent's determination of **eligible** matches the expected outcome of **eligible**. The agent correctly understood that when a child goes abroad specifically for hospital treatment (rather than falling ill while already abroad), and the parent remains responsible and continues to support them financially, Child Benefit eligibility continues despite the hospital stay exceeding 12 weeks.

### Verdict
The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome.
