2026-01-28T19:31:51.683967 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or young person who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:31:53.275027 [actor]: son lives with me 17 years old left scool in june

2026-01-28T19:31:56.017791 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old son who lives with you and left school in June.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Is your son currently in approved education or training?**

(For example, this could include things like A-levels, T-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved training courses.)

2026-01-28T19:31:57.894012 [actor]: no education registred with careers service looking for apprenticship

2026-01-28T19:32:00.511264 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son is 17, left school in June, is not in approved education or training, but is registered with the careers service and looking for an apprenticeship.

Let me ask you this: **When exactly did your son leave school - what was the specific date, or at least which week in June?**

This is important because the rules around Child Benefit eligibility change depending on when a young person leaves education.

2026-01-28T19:32:02.439195 [actor]: left scool end of june when term finsihed

2026-01-28T19:32:06.878874 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your son left school at the end of June when the term finished.

Based on the rules for Child Benefit eligibility, let me explain your situation:

**You are eligible for Child Benefit until the end of August** (the 31st of August to be precise) following the date your son left school.

This is because when a young person aged under 20 leaves approved education or training, you can continue to receive Child Benefit until the 31st August following their leaving date, as long as they left after their 16th birthday.

Since your son is 17 and left school at the end of June, your Child Benefit entitlement will continue until the end of August. After that date, your entitlement will stop unless he enrolls in approved education or training.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?**

2026-01-28T19:32:08.665441 [actor]: but hes registred with careers service doesnt that count for somthing

2026-01-28T19:32:12.958990 [root_agent]: That's a good question, and I understand why you're asking.

Let me clarify: **Registration with the careers service alone does not extend your Child Benefit entitlement beyond the 31st August.**

To continue receiving Child Benefit after 31st August for a young person aged 16-19, they must be enrolled in **approved education or training**. This includes things like:
- A-levels, Scottish Highers, or similar qualifications
- T-levels
- NVQs up to level 3
- Home education (if it started before they turned 16)
- Certain approved training courses

Simply being registered with the careers service and looking for an apprenticeship, unfortunately, doesn't count as being "in approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.

**However**, if your son does find and start an approved apprenticeship or enrolls in other approved education or training, you may become eligible again at that point.

**Do you have any other questions about this?**

2026-01-28T19:32:14.667681 [actor]: so not eligible after august even tho registred with youth careers service and actively looking?

2026-01-28T19:32:18.914144 [root_agent]: That's correct, I'm afraid. **You will not be eligible for Child Benefit after 31st August**, even though your son is registered with the youth careers service and actively looking for an apprenticeship.

The rules are clear that to qualify for Child Benefit for a young person aged 16-19, they must actually be **enrolled in and undertaking** approved education or training - not just registered with a careers service or looking for opportunities.

I understand this may seem unfair when your son is actively trying to find an apprenticeship, but unfortunately the eligibility rules don't make allowances for young people who are registered with careers services but not yet in education or training.

**The good news is:** If your son does secure an apprenticeship or enrolls in approved training in the future, you can make a new claim for Child Benefit at that point, and your eligibility could restart.

**Is there anything else about Child Benefit that you'd like me to clarify?**

2026-01-28T19:32:20.649872 [actor]: ok thanks for info

2026-01-28T19:32:23.103209 [root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you.

Just to summarize: you remain eligible until 31st August, and if your son finds an apprenticeship or approved training after that, you can claim again.

I hope your son finds a great apprenticeship soon. Take care!

2026-01-28T19:32:29.163240 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, young people aged 16-19 who have left education and are registered with the careers service or Connexions for work, training or an apprenticeship can qualify for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks. The agent failed to recognize this extension period and incorrectly stated that eligibility ends on 31st August.
