**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user (Robert) is **eligible for Child Benefit for Sam**. 

According to the expected outcome, in a split family situation where siblings are separated between divorced parents:
- Robert has Sam (10) living with him and is responsible for Sam's care
- Tina has Ella (8) living with her

The guidance confirms that **both parents are eligible** - each receiving the higher "Eldest Child" rate (£26.05) for the eldest child in their respective household.

The agent's assessment aligns with this:
- Robert is eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam (the child living with him)
- The agent confirmed no one else is claiming for Sam
- All eligibility criteria were properly verified (age, residence, responsibility, UK residency, citizenship)

While the agent didn't explicitly mention that Tina would also be eligible for the higher rate for Ella, the agent's scope was correctly limited to assessing Robert's eligibility for Sam. The agent accurately determined Robert's eligibility status, which matches the expected outcome that both parents in this split family scenario are eligible.
