**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct assessment of child's status:** The agent properly identified that Sofia (18 years old) is not in approved education or training, having left school 2 years ago to work as a receptionist.

2. **Accurate application of eligibility rules:** The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit stops at age 16 unless the child continues in approved education or training (up to age 20). Since Sofia is working and not in education/training, the eligibility criteria are not met.

3. **Clear communication:** The agent clearly stated "You are not eligible for Child Benefit" and provided a well-reasoned explanation based on the specific circumstances.

4. **Verification against official criteria:** According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit eligibility for children aged 16-20 requires they be in approved education or training and not working 24+ hours per week. Sofia fails both conditions (not in education, working 30 hours/week).

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**, and the reasoning provided is sound and accurate.
