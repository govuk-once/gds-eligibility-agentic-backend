2026-01-28T19:35:29.884942 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T19:35:31.395067 [actor]: child benfit yes i have son

2026-01-28T19:35:33.210263 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you have a son.

To help assess your eligibility, could you tell me how old your son is?

2026-01-28T19:35:34.891344 [actor]: 5 years old boy looking for work registered jobcenter

2026-01-28T19:35:37.026015 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your 5-year-old son would meet the age requirement for Child Benefit (which covers children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training).

Now, an important question: Does your son live with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-28T19:35:38.417383 [actor]: son lives with me pre settled status german

2026-01-28T19:35:40.408328 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your son lives with you and that you have pre-settled status as a German national.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for your son? By this I mean, do you provide for his day-to-day care and financial support?

2026-01-28T19:35:42.094094 [actor]: yes look after him everyday cook food unemployed now

2026-01-28T19:35:44.281875 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you look after your son every day and are responsible for him.

One more important question: Are you currently living in the UK? And if so, have you been living in the UK for a continuous period?

2026-01-28T19:35:45.849281 [actor]: moved uk recently registred jobseeker genuine prospect work

2026-01-28T19:35:47.724020 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is an important detail for your eligibility.

Could you tell me approximately how long you have been living in the UK? For example, have you been here for a few weeks, a few months, or longer?

2026-01-28T19:35:49.297798 [actor]: few months now activly looking for jobs

2026-01-28T19:35:51.124209 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

One more question to help assess your eligibility: Before moving to the UK a few months ago, were you working in another EU country, or what was your situation before coming here?

2026-01-28T19:35:52.595941 [actor]: was in germany before came here for work opportunities

2026-01-28T19:35:54.394577 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you were in Germany before coming to the UK.

One final important question: While you were in Germany, were you working there, or what were you doing before you moved to the UK?

2026-01-28T19:35:55.920224 [actor]: worked in germany before moving uk now jobseeker

2026-01-28T19:36:02.457687 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all this information. Let me assess your eligibility for Child Benefit based on what you've told me.

**Based on your circumstances:**

You meet several of the basic criteria:
- You have a child under 16 (your 5-year-old son)
- Your son lives with you
- You are responsible for him

**However, there is an important eligibility issue:**

As a German national with pre-settled status who has recently moved to the UK (a few months ago) and is currently a jobseeker, your eligibility for Child Benefit depends on your "right to reside" in the UK.

For Child Benefit purposes, being a jobseeker alone may not provide you with a qualifying right to reside. The UK government requires that you have a right to reside that goes beyond just being a jobseeker. Since you were working in Germany before coming to the UK and are now actively looking for work here, your situation is complex.

**My assessment:** You may **not be currently eligible** for Child Benefit as a jobseeker with pre-settled status who has only recently arrived in the UK. However, if you find work and become employed, this would likely establish a qualifying right to reside, making you eligible for Child Benefit.

I recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly to discuss your specific situation, as they can provide definitive guidance based on all the details of your case.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:36:04.282864 [actor]: ok so not eligble now then understand thanks

2026-01-28T19:36:07.856836 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, EU citizens with pre-settled status who were working in an EU country before coming to the UK and are now registered jobseekers with a genuine prospect of work have a qualifying right to reside for Child Benefit purposes, making them eligible.
