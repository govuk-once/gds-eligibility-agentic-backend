2026-01-29T11:30:20.241780 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T11:30:22.641888 [actor]: I have a son who's 17, and he's just started a Modern Apprenticeship here in Glasgow.

2026-01-29T11:30:25.099733 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. A Modern Apprenticeship is generally considered approved training, which is positive for your eligibility.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you responsible for your son? This means do you live with him and are you responsible for his day-to-day care and upbringing?**

2026-01-29T11:30:26.788695 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me here in Glasgow. I'm his father and I'm responsible for his day-to-day care.

2026-01-29T11:30:28.458819 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Now, let me ask:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:30:29.831215 [actor]: Yes, I live in Glasgow, Scotland.

2026-01-29T11:30:31.889834 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

One more important question:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your son?** (For example, the child's other parent or another person responsible for him?)

2026-01-29T11:30:33.725933 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for him. It's just me looking after him.

2026-01-29T11:30:37.090186 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You have a son who is 17 years old
2. ✓ He is in a Modern Apprenticeship, which counts as approved training
3. ✓ You are responsible for him and he lives with you
4. ✓ You live in the UK (Glasgow, Scotland)
5. ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

You can claim Child Benefit for your son until he turns 20, as long as he remains in approved education or training.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, such as how to make a claim?**

2026-01-29T11:30:42.651167 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland are paid training programs where the apprentice is employed and earning a wage, which means they do not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes - only unpaid education or training courses qualify.
