2026-01-29T11:31:50.754497 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T11:31:52.121684 [actor]: Yes, I do have a child I'm responsible for.

2026-01-29T11:31:54.160337 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

How old is your child?

2026-01-29T11:31:55.370127 [actor]: My child is 8 years old.

2026-01-29T11:31:56.945104 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful information.

Does your child normally live with you?

2026-01-29T11:31:58.438346 [actor]: Yes, my child lives with me.

2026-01-29T11:32:00.125514 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for that information.

Are you responsible for paying for things for your child, such as food, clothes, or housing?

2026-01-29T11:32:01.867070 [actor]: Yes, I am. I pay for all of those things for my child.

2026-01-29T11:32:03.167228 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-29T11:32:04.542615 [actor]: Yes, I'm living in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:32:06.241151 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful.

Is your child currently in hospital or in care (such as local authority care or a care home)?

2026-01-29T11:32:07.694611 [actor]: No, my child is not in hospital or in care.

2026-01-29T11:32:11.448993 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all those questions.

Based on the information you've provided, you appear to meet the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your child is 8 years old)
✓ Your child lives with you
✓ You're responsible for your child's costs (food, clothes, housing)
✓ You're living in the UK
✓ Your child is not in hospital or care

You should be eligible to claim Child Benefit. 

However, there is one additional important consideration: if you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 a year, you may have to pay a tax charge on some or all of the Child Benefit (known as the High Income Child Benefit Charge).

Would you like me to explain more about that, or do you have any other questions about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:32:13.544885 [actor]: Wait, I should mention - I have Pre-Settled Status. I've been unemployed and looking for work for about 95 days now. Does that affect my eligibility?

2026-01-29T11:32:16.048546 [root_agent]: Thank you for mentioning that - this is important information that could affect your eligibility.

Your immigration status and current circumstances may impact whether you qualify for Child Benefit. Let me ask a few more questions to assess this properly.

First, when did you arrive in the UK, and have you been living here continuously since you got your Pre-Settled Status?

2026-01-29T11:32:17.675346 [actor]: I've been living in the UK continuously since I got my Pre-Settled Status. I've been here for about two years now.

2026-01-29T11:32:19.628816 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

During the time you've been in the UK over these two years, have you been working? And if so, for how long were you working before you became unemployed 95 days ago?

2026-01-29T11:32:21.343481 [actor]: I was working before, yes. But I've been unemployed for the last 95 days, just looking for work during that time.

2026-01-29T11:32:23.329934 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

One more important question: Are you actively looking for work, and do you have a genuine chance of being engaged in work? In other words, are you genuinely seeking employment and available to work?

2026-01-29T11:32:25.396921 [actor]: Yes, I'm actively looking for work and available to work. But I don't have a job offer yet or anything like that - just searching and applying for jobs.

2026-01-29T11:32:28.574622 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. This is an important situation that affects your eligibility.

With Pre-Settled Status and being unemployed for 95 days while actively seeking work, there are specific rules that apply to you. The eligibility for Child Benefit can depend on your "right to reside" in the UK, which is connected to your immigration status and circumstances.

Let me ask one more clarifying question: Before you became unemployed 95 days ago, how long had you been working in the UK?

2026-01-29T11:32:30.080070 [actor]: I had been working for about a year and a half before I became unemployed.

2026-01-29T11:32:35.881071 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information - this is very helpful.

Based on what you've told me, here's the situation regarding your eligibility:

With Pre-Settled Status, your right to reside in the UK (which affects Child Benefit eligibility) can depend on your circumstances. Since you:
- Worked for about a year and a half
- Have been unemployed and job-seeking for 95 days
- Are actively looking for work

There's an important time limit you should be aware of: generally, if you're relying on being a jobseeker to maintain your right to reside, this status typically lasts for up to **91 days** (approximately 3 months) of unemployment.

Since you mentioned you've been unemployed for about 95 days, this means you may have exceeded that timeframe, which could potentially affect your right to reside and therefore your eligibility for Child Benefit.

However, immigration and benefit rules can be complex and there may be other factors that could affect your situation.

Given the complexity of your circumstances with Pre-Settled Status and the length of unemployment, I would strongly recommend that you seek specialist advice about your specific situation before applying. You may want to contact:
- Citizens Advice
- An immigration adviser
- HMRC directly about Child Benefit eligibility

Do you have any other questions about what I've explained?

2026-01-29T11:32:37.906266 [actor]: No, I understand. So basically because I've been unemployed for 95 days and the limit is 91 days, I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore?

2026-01-29T11:32:42.849630 [root_agent]: I need to be careful here because immigration and benefit eligibility rules are very complex, and I want to make sure I'm giving you accurate information.

What I can say is that the 91-day limit for jobseekers with Pre-Settled Status is a factor that **may** affect your right to reside, which in turn **may** affect your Child Benefit eligibility. However, I cannot definitively say whether you are or aren't eligible because:

1. There may be other factors in your situation that I haven't asked about
2. The rules around right to reside and Pre-Settled Status interact with benefit eligibility in complex ways
3. There may be exceptions or other circumstances that could apply to you

Being potentially over the 91-day limit is a concern, but it doesn't automatically mean you're definitely ineligible - it means your situation requires expert assessment.

This is why I strongly recommend you get specialist advice from Citizens Advice, an immigration adviser, or contact HMRC directly about your specific circumstances. They can look at your complete situation and give you a definitive answer about your eligibility.

Does that make sense? Is there anything else you'd like to ask about what I've explained?

2026-01-29T11:32:44.769631 [actor]: No, that makes sense. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T11:32:49.670436 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent appropriately identified that the user has been unemployed for 95 days which exceeds the 91-day limit for jobseekers with Pre-Settled Status, correctly noted this affects their right to reside and therefore Child Benefit eligibility, and properly recommended seeking specialist advice rather than making a definitive determination on a complex immigration-related matter.
