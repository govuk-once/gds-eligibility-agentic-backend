2026-01-29T11:30:44.848619 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:30:46.537604 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Leo, who's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T11:30:48.301407 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now I need to ask: **Do you live with Leo, or is he living with someone else?**

2026-01-29T11:30:50.813989 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. Leo is actually in local authority care at the moment, but he comes home to visit me every week. He comes on Saturday mornings at 10 AM and goes back to the care home on Sunday at 11 AM.

2026-01-29T11:30:53.460026 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that situation. I need to understand this a bit more clearly.

**When Leo is not visiting you at weekends, where exactly is he staying? Is he in a children's home, with foster carers, or in some other type of care arrangement?**

2026-01-29T11:30:54.928061 [actor]: He's staying in a children's home run by the local authority.

2026-01-29T11:30:57.344939 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is helpful information.

Now I need to ask: **Are you still paying towards Leo's upkeep? For example, are you contributing at least the amount of Child Benefit you would receive (which is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child) towards his costs?**

2026-01-29T11:30:59.088721 [actor]: No, I'm not paying towards his upkeep. The local authority is covering all his costs while he's in the children's home.

2026-01-29T11:31:01.128750 [root_agent]: Thank you for being clear about that.

I have one more important question: **Is the local authority paying the full cost of Leo's accommodation and maintenance while he's in the children's home, or are you expected to contribute anything at all towards these costs?**

2026-01-29T11:31:02.705846 [actor]: The local authority is paying the full cost - I'm not expected to contribute anything towards his accommodation or maintenance.

2026-01-29T11:31:07.366430 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, I can now assess your eligibility.

**Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Leo in this situation.**

Here's why: When a child is in local authority care and the local authority is paying the full cost of their accommodation and maintenance, Child Benefit cannot be claimed - even if the child visits you regularly at weekends. The key factor is that Leo's care costs are being fully covered by the local authority.

However, your situation could change. If any of the following happen in the future, you might become eligible:

- Leo comes back to live with you full-time
- You start contributing at least the amount of Child Benefit (£25.60 per week) towards his upkeep while he's in care

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T11:31:13.573715 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in care, you can still claim Child Benefit if your child is in local authority care but comes to stay with you for at least one night per week (or regularly stays for at least 4 nights in a 13-week period). Since Leo visits every weekend from Saturday 10 AM to Sunday 11 AM, this constitutes overnight stays, making the parent eligible for Child Benefit despite the local authority covering Leo's care costs.
