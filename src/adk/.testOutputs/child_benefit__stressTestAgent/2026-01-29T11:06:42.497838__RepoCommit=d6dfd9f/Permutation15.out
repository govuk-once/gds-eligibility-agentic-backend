2026-01-29T11:14:27.267734 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or children under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:14:28.921467 [actor]: I have a daughter, Emma. She's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T11:14:30.848563 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now I need to ask: **Is Emma living with you, or does she live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T11:14:32.593464 [actor]: No, she doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother.

2026-01-29T11:14:34.654920 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that.

Since Emma doesn't live with you, I need to ask: **Do you contribute towards Emma's upbringing by paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit would provide, or an equivalent amount towards her care?**

2026-01-29T11:14:36.317654 [actor]: I send £10 a week to her mother for food, and I send Emma a birthday present once a year.

2026-01-29T11:14:38.087662 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me ask another important question: **Does Emma's mother (or whoever she lives with) currently claim Child Benefit for Emma?**

2026-01-29T11:14:39.498458 [actor]: No, her mother doesn't claim Child Benefit.

2026-01-29T11:14:41.630206 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now I need to ask: **Are you responsible for Emma in any other way, such as having regular contact with her, being involved in decisions about her upbringing, or providing other forms of support beyond the financial contributions you mentioned?**

2026-01-29T11:14:43.475779 [actor]: Well, I see her occasionally, but it's mainly just the £10 a week I send and the birthday present. That's about it really.

2026-01-29T11:14:48.129314 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, **I'm afraid you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.

Here's why:

- Child Benefit is normally paid to the person the child lives with, as they have the main responsibility for the child's day-to-day care.

- When a child doesn't live with you, you can only claim Child Benefit if you contribute at least the equivalent of what Child Benefit would pay toward the child's upbringing.

- The current Child Benefit rate is approximately £24 per week for the eldest or only child, and your contribution of £10 per week plus an annual birthday present falls short of this amount.

Since Emma's mother doesn't currently claim Child Benefit, she would be the person who could potentially claim it, as Emma lives with her and she has the main day-to-day responsibility for Emma's care.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T11:14:54.219296 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because the child lives with the mother, the user's financial contribution (£10/week) is below the Child Benefit threshold (approximately £24/week for the eldest child), and provided correct reasoning based on the eligibility criteria that the person the child lives with has priority for claiming.
