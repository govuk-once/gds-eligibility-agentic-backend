2026-01-29T11:33:53.572956 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T11:33:55.467340 [actor]: Hello! Yes, I have a son who's 17 years old. He's doing a computer coding course at the moment.

2026-01-29T11:33:58.282365 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful - your 17-year-old son doing a computer coding course may qualify.

Next question: **Is your son's computer coding course an approved form of education or training? For example, is it a full-time course (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience), or an approved training programme like an apprenticeship?**

2026-01-29T11:34:00.496454 [actor]: Well, it's a bit of a specific arrangement actually. His future employer is paying for the course fees - they've got an agreement that Tom will join them after he finishes the course. He's not being paid to do the course itself, but they're covering all the costs.

2026-01-29T11:34:02.854615 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that arrangement. Let me ask a follow-up question to understand this better:

**How many hours per week does Tom spend on this computer coding course, including supervised study and any course-related work?**

This will help me determine if it counts as full-time education for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-29T11:34:05.295100 [actor]: It's a full-time course - he's doing well over 12 hours a week of supervised study. But like I said, it's specifically arranged with his future employer who's paying the fees, and he's committed to joining them once he completes it.

2026-01-29T11:34:07.427544 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that it's over 12 hours a week of supervised study - that's an important detail.

Now, let me ask: **Do you live in the UK, or are you a Crown servant (like a civil servant or member of the armed forces) posted overseas?**

2026-01-29T11:34:08.887547 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:34:11.140670 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Now an important question about your living arrangements:

**Does Tom normally live with you? By this I mean, is your home his main residence where he usually lives?**

2026-01-29T11:34:12.710475 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me - this is his home.

2026-01-29T11:34:15.114064 [root_agent]: Excellent. Now I need to ask about any other financial arrangements:

**Does anyone else receive Child Benefit for Tom, or claim him as part of their household for benefits purposes?**

2026-01-29T11:34:16.789117 [actor]: No, no one else receives Child Benefit for him or claims him for any benefits.

2026-01-29T11:34:20.078620 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now I need to ask about your income situation:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year? This is important because it affects whether you need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge.**

(Note: You can still claim Child Benefit even if your income is over this amount, but you may need to pay some or all of it back through tax if you or your partner earn over £60,000.)

2026-01-29T11:34:21.711309 [actor]: My income is below £60,000, so that shouldn't be an issue.

2026-01-29T11:34:24.562677 [root_agent]: Perfect. Let me ask one final clarifying question about Tom's course:

**Is Tom's computer coding course recognized by an official body - for example, is it provided by a college, training provider, or through an official apprenticeship scheme? Or do you know if it's been approved as qualifying education or training?**

This is important because for Child Benefit purposes after age 16, the education or training needs to be "approved" by the relevant authorities.

2026-01-29T11:34:26.876121 [actor]: It's provided through a proper training provider, yes. But as I mentioned, the key thing is that his future employer has an agreement with him - they're paying for the course fees on the condition that he joins them afterwards. That's the arrangement we have.

2026-01-29T11:34:32.476487 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me think through your situation carefully.

Based on what you've told me:
- Tom is 17 years old (under 20) ✓
- He's doing a full-time course (over 12 hours supervised study per week) ✓
- It's provided by a proper training provider ✓
- He lives with you in the UK ✓
- No one else claims Child Benefit for him ✓
- Your income is below £60,000 ✓

However, there's an important consideration about the **nature of Tom's arrangement**. The fact that his employer is paying the course fees with an agreement that he'll join them afterwards could potentially mean this is classified as **employed training** or a **sponsored arrangement** rather than purely approved education.

**One more question: Is Tom receiving any wages, salary, or other payment from this employer during the course itself (not just that they're paying fees), or is he formally employed by them in any way while doing the course?**

This distinction is crucial because Child Benefit typically doesn't apply if a young person is in paid work or certain types of employment-based training, even if they're also studying.

2026-01-29T11:34:34.591401 [actor]: No, he's not receiving any wages or salary from them. He's not employed by them yet - that comes after he finishes the course. They're just paying the course fees as part of the agreement that he'll work for them once it's done.

2026-01-29T11:34:40.043472 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that - it's helpful to know he's not currently employed or receiving wages.

Based on all the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ Tom is under 20 years old (he's 17)
✓ He's in full-time education (over 12 hours per week of supervised study)
✓ The course is provided by a proper training provider
✓ He normally lives with you in the UK
✓ You're responsible for him
✓ No one else claims Child Benefit for him
✓ Your income is below £60,000
✓ He's not currently employed or receiving wages

The arrangement where his future employer is paying the course fees shouldn't disqualify you, as Tom is not yet employed and is attending approved education. This is similar to a scholarship or sponsorship arrangement.

**You can claim Child Benefit and should continue to receive it as long as:**
- Tom remains in approved full-time education or training (until he turns 20)
- He continues to live with you
- The circumstances don't change (such as him starting paid employment)

Would you like any further clarification about Child Benefit or how to make a claim?

2026-01-29T11:34:43.286274 [actor]: Thank you so much for your help! That's very clear. I appreciate you taking the time to go through all the details with me.

2026-01-29T11:34:46.059406 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, young people aged 16-19 in full-time non-advanced education qualify for Child Benefit, but this excludes those who have a contract of employment with an employer who is sponsoring their education. Tom has an agreement with his future employer who is paying his course fees with a commitment to join them afterwards - this is a sponsored arrangement that disqualifies him from Child Benefit eligibility.
