2026-01-29T11:23:52.638004 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T11:23:54.875956 [actor]: Yes, I do. My daughter Bella is 16 and she's just started a training course to become a travel agent. It's through a local travel agency that's employing her - they're paying for the whole course.

2026-01-29T11:23:57.151538 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know about Bella's training course.

To clarify further: Is Bella's training course an approved education or training programme? Specifically, is it unpaid and leading to a qualification, or is she receiving a wage as part of her employment with the travel agency?

2026-01-29T11:23:59.117024 [actor]: She's receiving a wage - the travel agency has employed her and they're paying for her training course. It's not like a college course or anything, it's through her job with them.

2026-01-29T11:24:02.139894 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Since Bella is 16 and receiving a wage through her employment, she would not be considered in approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes. Approved education or training typically refers to full-time non-advanced education (like A-levels or similar) or approved unpaid training, not paid employment with training.

However, let me ask you another question: Do you have any other children under the age of 16 that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T11:24:03.760963 [actor]: No, Bella is my only child.

2026-01-29T11:24:07.376709 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you've provided, I'm afraid you would not be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.

The reason is that Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved full-time non-advanced education or approved unpaid training. Since Bella is 16 and in paid employment (even though she's doing training through her job), she doesn't meet the criteria for the extended age range.

If Bella were to start full-time education at college or sixth form in the future (such as A-levels or similar qualifications), you could potentially become eligible again at that point, as long as she remains under 20.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit that you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T11:24:12.995290 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that paid employment training does not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes, and correctly concluded that a 16-year-old in paid work is not eligible, as the extended age criteria (16-20) only applies to those in full-time non-advanced education or unpaid approved training.
