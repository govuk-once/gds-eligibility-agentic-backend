2026-01-29T11:20:39.807481 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you are responsible for?

2026-01-29T11:20:41.556408 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Zahid. He's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T11:20:43.348079 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Zahid live with you?

2026-01-29T11:20:44.767885 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me. He lives with his aunt.

2026-01-29T11:20:47.653632 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is an important detail.

Do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards Zahid's upkeep? (This would currently be at least £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child.)

2026-01-29T11:20:49.444563 [actor]: I send £15 a week to the aunt for Zahid. But his grandmother - my mother - also sends £15 a week to the aunt for him. So together that's £30 a week.

2026-01-29T11:20:51.364395 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

To clarify: are you and your mother sending this money jointly, or are these separate contributions that you each make individually?

2026-01-29T11:20:53.365782 [actor]: We send them separately. I send £15 on my own, and my mother sends her £15 on her own. They're separate contributions, but they're both for Zahid's upkeep.

2026-01-29T11:20:55.387409 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now, does Zahid's aunt receive Child Benefit for him, or has she applied for it?

2026-01-29T11:20:56.989132 [actor]: No, the aunt doesn't claim Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-29T11:20:58.897030 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question: Are you or your mother the person who has the main responsibility for Zahid's day-to-day care and upbringing, or does that responsibility lie with his aunt?

2026-01-29T11:21:00.611175 [actor]: That responsibility lies with his aunt. She's the one looking after him day-to-day since he lives with her.

2026-01-29T11:21:05.795320 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me explain the situation regarding your Child Benefit eligibility.

Based on what you've told me, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** for Zahid. Here's why:

The general rule is that Child Benefit goes to the person who is responsible for the child and who the child lives with. Since Zahid lives with his aunt and she has main responsibility for his day-to-day care, she would be the person eligible to claim.

However, there is an exception: if a child doesn't live with you, you can still claim Child Benefit if you contribute at least the amount that Child Benefit would pay towards the child's upkeep. 

In your case, while you and your mother together contribute £30 per week (which exceeds the Child Benefit amount of £25.60), **you individually only contribute £15 per week**, which is below the threshold. Your contribution and your mother's contribution are counted separately since they are made individually.

This means that neither you nor your mother would qualify under this exception. The aunt, who has day-to-day responsibility and who Zahid lives with, would be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit for him.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:21:11.508734 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, when a child lives with someone else, you can still get Child Benefit if you contribute at least the Child Benefit rate towards the child's upkeep - the combined contributions (£30/week from both the user and grandmother together) should count toward this threshold, not just individual contributions, making the user eligible.
