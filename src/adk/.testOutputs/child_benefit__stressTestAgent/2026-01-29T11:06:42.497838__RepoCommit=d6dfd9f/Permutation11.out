2026-01-29T11:11:52.231574 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T11:11:54.103674 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who's 17. He's just started an apprenticeship - an Intermediate Apprenticeship actually. He still lives at home with me.

2026-01-29T11:11:56.497507 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To clarify whether your son's apprenticeship qualifies as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes, I need to ask:

Is your son's Intermediate Apprenticeship an approved apprenticeship in England, and does it include both on-the-job training and study toward a qualification?

2026-01-29T11:11:58.627451 [actor]: Yes, that's right. It's a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England. He does on-the-job training and he's studying for a qualification as part of it. He just left school to start it.

2026-01-29T11:12:01.033098 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. An approved apprenticeship like the one your son is doing can count as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Now, let me ask you: Are you the person responsible for your son? In other words, does he live with you and are you responsible for his care and upbringing?

2026-01-29T11:12:02.842938 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me and I'm responsible for him. It's just the two of us at home.

2026-01-29T11:12:04.966544 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: Are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-29T11:12:06.387935 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:12:08.398774 [root_agent]: Thank you. One more important question:

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-29T11:12:10.032183 [actor]: No, I don't have a partner and my income is under £50,000.

2026-01-29T11:12:13.882305 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be **eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:
- You have a child (your son) who is 17 years old
- He is in an approved Intermediate Apprenticeship in England, which counts as approved education or training
- He lives with you and you're responsible for him
- You live in the UK
- Your individual income is under £50,000 (so you wouldn't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

You meet the key criteria for Child Benefit eligibility. If you haven't already claimed, you can apply for Child Benefit. If your son stops his apprenticeship or turns 20, you would need to inform the Child Benefit Office as your eligibility would change.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:12:17.240348 [actor]: Thank you, that's very helpful. I'll look into applying for it then.

2026-01-29T11:12:19.600576 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, approved apprenticeships do NOT count as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes - Child Benefit stops when a young person starts an apprenticeship, even if they are under 20.
