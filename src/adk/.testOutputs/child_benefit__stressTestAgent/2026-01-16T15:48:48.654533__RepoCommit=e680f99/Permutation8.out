2026-01-16T15:52:06.526174 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To make this assessment, I'll need to ask you some questions one by one.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T15:52:07.345641 [actor]: child benefit daughter 4 years old

2026-01-16T15:52:08.441823 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand your situation better.

Is your 4-year-old daughter living with you?

2026-01-16T15:52:09.343228 [actor]: yes Ruby lives with me and James

2026-01-16T15:52:10.506125 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Ruby lives with you and James. 

Are you the main person responsible for Ruby's care?

2026-01-16T15:52:11.269959 [actor]: i take care of her yes

2026-01-16T15:52:12.736967 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you take care of Ruby. 

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask: Are you or James claiming any similar payments from another country?

2026-01-16T15:52:13.743164 [actor]: no other payments uk only

2026-01-16T15:52:15.131941 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Are you, or is James, a UK national or do you have the right to reside in the UK? This includes having settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme.

2026-01-16T15:52:15.779473 [actor]: yes british citizens

2026-01-16T15:52:16.812710 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're British citizens.

Do either you or James have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-16T15:52:17.783034 [actor]: i earn 75000 james earns 20000

2026-01-16T15:52:22.447336 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your income information. Since you earn £75,000 per year, this affects your Child Benefit situation.

You are still eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ruby, but because your individual income is over £60,000 per year, you'll have to pay back the full amount of Child Benefit through a tax charge called the 'High Income Child Benefit Charge' if you choose to receive it.

You have two options:

1. You can claim and receive Child Benefit payments but will need to pay back the full amount through self-assessment tax return.

2. You can claim Child Benefit but choose not to receive the payments (known as a "nil award"). This helps you avoid the tax charge while still building up National Insurance credits that may help with your State Pension.

Would you like me to explain more about either of these options?

2026-01-16T15:52:26.290035 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that while the user is eligible for Child Benefit for their 4-year-old daughter Ruby, they would need to pay back the full amount through the High Income Child Benefit Charge due to their income being £75,000, which exceeds the £60,000 threshold.
