2026-01-16T16:09:48.405908 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have any children living with you who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:09:49.469676 [actor]: I need to roleplay as a UK resident asking about child benefit eligibility. Let me take on this role.

child benefit eligibility court order

2026-01-16T16:09:50.968972 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in a situation involving a court order. 

Are you asking about a child who is subject to a court order? If so, could you tell me if you're responsible for caring for the child?

2026-01-16T16:09:51.839959 [actor]: not living with my child pay £50 weekly court order says must pay

2026-01-16T16:09:54.941398 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you're not living with your child and are paying £50 weekly as ordered by the court.

Based on UK guidelines, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who is primarily responsible for caring for the child - usually the person the child lives with.

Since the child is not living with you, you would generally not be eligible to receive Child Benefit for this child. The person who has the child living with them would typically be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.

The court-ordered payments you're making are separate from Child Benefit and don't affect eligibility for it.

Is there anything specific about your situation with the court order that you think might affect Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-16T16:09:56.061960 [actor]: forced to pay not voluntary why cant i get benefit paying money for child

2026-01-16T16:10:00.562832 [root_agent]: I understand your frustration. Let me clarify how Child Benefit works in this situation:

Child Benefit is designed to be paid to the person who has the main day-to-day responsibility for caring for the child - typically the parent the child lives with. This is because it's meant to support the costs of raising a child in the household where they reside.

Even though you are making court-ordered child maintenance payments of £50 weekly, which is indeed supporting your child financially, these payments and Child Benefit operate as separate systems:

- Your maintenance payments go directly to support your child's upbringing
- Child Benefit goes to the person with whom the child primarily lives

The payments you're making are fulfilling your financial responsibility toward your child, but Child Benefit eligibility is specifically tied to who the child lives with and who provides their day-to-day care, rather than who provides financial support.

This distinction exists because the person caring for the child day-to-day typically incurs additional costs beyond direct financial support.

Is there anything else about your specific situation you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-16T16:10:02.539945 [actor]: My child lives with ex dont think right still paying money

2026-01-16T16:10:04.160312 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is paid to the person who has day-to-day responsibility for the child (the person the child lives with), not to the non-resident parent who pays child maintenance, even if court-ordered.
