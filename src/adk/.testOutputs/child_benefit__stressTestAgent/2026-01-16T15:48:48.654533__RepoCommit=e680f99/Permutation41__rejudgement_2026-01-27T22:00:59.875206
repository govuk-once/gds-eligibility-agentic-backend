2026-01-27T22:05:06.345468 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed to recognize the specific exception case where HMRC allows unequal splitting of child maintenance payments across children, which would make Martin eligible for Child Benefit for Ben (the first child) at full rate. The expected outcome was "Eligible for Ben (Full Rate), Not Eligible for Jerry," but the agent incorrectly stated Martin was not eligible at all.
