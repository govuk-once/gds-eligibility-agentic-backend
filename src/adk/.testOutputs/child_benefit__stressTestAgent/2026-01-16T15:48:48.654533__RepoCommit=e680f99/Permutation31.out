2026-01-16T16:01:49.868658 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:01:51.210113 [actor]: I'll help by roleplaying as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the rules by being obtuse, not answering directly, and speaking like I'm using search queries.

daughter Emma university student lives home

2026-01-16T16:01:52.447686 [root_agent]: I notice you've provided some information about your daughter Emma who is a university student living at home.

To better understand your situation, may I ask how old is your daughter Emma?

2026-01-16T16:01:53.257716 [actor]: Emma 18 years old started university this year

2026-01-16T16:01:55.161639 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, your daughter Emma is 18 years old and has started university this year.

For Child Benefit purposes, I need to understand if Emma is in approved education or training. Is Emma studying full-time (more than an average of 12 hours a week) in a course that's considered approved education?

2026-01-16T16:01:56.110169 [actor]: bachelor degree three years commuting from home daily full time study

2026-01-16T16:01:58.742530 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Since Emma is 18 years old and studying full-time for a bachelor's degree (which is considered approved education), you may be eligible for Child Benefit.

Child Benefit can continue for children in approved education until they turn 20, so Emma's age and student status currently meet the criteria.

May I ask if you're responsible for Emma? By this I mean, do you provide for her financially and/or make major decisions about her care?

2026-01-16T16:01:59.726803 [actor]: pay bills food university fees parental responsibility since birth

2026-01-16T16:02:01.492808 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

It sounds like you have parental responsibility for Emma and you financially support her by paying for her bills, food, and university fees. This meets the requirement of being responsible for the child.

Now, I need to ask about your income. Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-16T16:02:02.279140 [actor]: salary 40000 single parent no partner

2026-01-16T16:02:05.072428 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Since you're a single parent with an annual salary of £40,000, which is below the £50,000 threshold, you would not be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on all the information you've provided:
- Your daughter Emma is 18 and in full-time approved education (bachelor's degree)
- She lives at home with you
- You have parental responsibility and financially support her
- Your income is below the £50,000 threshold

I can confirm that you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Emma until she turns 20 or finishes her approved education, whichever comes first.

Would you like to know how to claim Child Benefit or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-16T16:02:07.362011 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know I can get Child Benefit until Emma turns 20 or finishes education. How apply online form download?
