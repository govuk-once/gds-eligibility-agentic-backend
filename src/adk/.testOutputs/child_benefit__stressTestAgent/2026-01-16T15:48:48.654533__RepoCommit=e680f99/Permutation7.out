2026-01-16T15:51:14.305022 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:51:15.226470 [actor]: child son jack custody weekend visits

2026-01-16T15:51:18.779473 [root_agent]: #thinking
I need to understand the situation regarding custody and responsibility for the child. Based on the context provided, it seems the person has a son named Jack and may have custody arrangements with weekend visits only. This is relevant to Child Benefit eligibility since it's typically paid to the person who has main responsibility for the child.

According to the eligibility criteria, Child Benefit can be claimed by someone who has responsibility for a child, but there are specific rules about shared care situations. I need to get more details about the custody arrangement to properly assess eligibility.

Thank you for that information. I understand you have a son named Jack and you have him for weekend visits. 

To clarify your situation better, is Jack primarily living with someone else, and you have custody only during weekends?

2026-01-16T15:51:19.774441 [actor]: jack care 3 months weekends stays home friday to sunday

2026-01-16T15:51:25.788282 [root_agent]: #thinking
From this information, I understand that:
- The person has care of their son Jack for weekends (Friday to Sunday)
- This arrangement has been in place for 3 months
- Jack primarily lives elsewhere during the week

According to the eligibility guidance at gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else:
- Child Benefit is usually paid to the person the child lives with most of the time
- If care is shared, only one person can get Child Benefit, usually the main caregiver
- The main caregiver is typically the person the child lives with most of the time

Since Jack primarily lives elsewhere during the week and the person only has him on weekends, they likely wouldn't be considered the main caregiver for Child Benefit purposes.
#thinking

Thank you for that additional information. I understand that Jack stays with you on weekends (Friday to Sunday) and this arrangement has been in place for 3 months.

Based on UK Child Benefit rules, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who has main responsibility for the child - usually the person the child lives with most of the time.

Since Jack appears to be living primarily with someone else during weekdays, and you have him only on weekends, you would likely not be considered the main caregiver for Child Benefit purposes.

May I ask if the other person who cares for Jack during weekdays is currently claiming Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-16T15:51:26.606182 [actor]: jack local authority care 3 months comes home weekends

2026-01-16T15:51:32.673103 [root_agent]: #thinking
This is an important new piece of information. Jack is in local authority care for 3 months and comes home on weekends. This significantly changes the assessment.

According to the guidance at gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care:
- Child Benefit may continue for a limited period when a child goes into care
- If a child is being looked after by a local authority, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks
- However, if the child regularly returns home, Child Benefit may continue to be paid

Since Jack comes home on weekends, this might be considered a regular return home situation. The person might be eligible for continued Child Benefit if they were receiving it before Jack went into care, or potentially eligible if they haven't claimed yet but have this regular care arrangement.
#thinking

Thank you for clarifying that Jack is in local authority care and comes home to you on weekends. This is an important detail for determining Child Benefit eligibility.

Based on UK government rules for children in care:

If your child is being looked after by a local authority, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks. However, since Jack regularly returns home to you on weekends, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit.

Were you receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into local authority care? If so, you should have informed the Child Benefit Office about the change in circumstances.

2026-01-16T15:51:33.841726 [actor]: jack 14 years old comes home friday evening sunday evening

2026-01-16T15:51:39.401743 [root_agent]: #thinking
I now have additional details about Jack:
- He is 14 years old (so within the age limit for Child Benefit which is under 16)
- He comes home from Friday evening to Sunday evening
- He is in local authority care the rest of the week
- This arrangement has been in place for 3 months

According to the guidance:
- For a child in local authority care, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks
- However, there are exceptions if the child regularly returns home
- Given that Jack returns home every weekend for approximately 2 days each week, this might qualify as regular returns home

I still need to understand if the person was previously claiming Child Benefit before Jack went into care, or if they're looking to make a new claim.
#thinking

Thank you for that additional information. I understand that Jack is 14 years old and comes home regularly from Friday evening to Sunday evening each week.

For a child in local authority care who regularly returns home (as in your case), you may still be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To better understand your situation, could you tell me whether you were claiming Child Benefit for Jack before he went into local authority care, or are you looking to make a new claim?

2026-01-16T15:51:40.433754 [actor]: single father david 55 son jack care 3 months

2026-01-16T15:51:46.408890 [root_agent]: #thinking
I now have more details about the situation:
- The person is David, a 55-year-old single father
- His son Jack has been in local authority care for 3 months
- Jack is 14 years old
- Jack comes home on weekends (Friday evening to Sunday evening)

I still don't have confirmation whether David was claiming Child Benefit before Jack went into care or if he's looking to make a new claim. This is important because the rules may apply differently.

Based on the guidance at gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care:
- If a child goes into local authority care, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks
- However, if the child regularly returns home (which Jack does every weekend), Child Benefit may continue to be paid
- If David was already claiming before Jack went into care, he would need to have informed the Child Benefit Office about the change in circumstances
#thinking

Thank you, David. I understand you're a 55-year-old single father whose 14-year-old son Jack has been in local authority care for 3 months, with weekend visits home.

Regarding your Child Benefit eligibility:

For children in local authority care, Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks. However, since Jack regularly returns home to you on weekends, you may still qualify for continued or partial Child Benefit.

Were you receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into local authority care? This information would help me provide you with more specific guidance about your situation.

2026-01-16T15:51:47.429450 [actor]: jack stays friday saturday night home then back sunday

2026-01-16T15:51:53.374201 [root_agent]: #thinking
I'm getting more specific details about Jack's visits:
- Jack stays at David's home on Friday and Saturday nights
- He goes back to the local authority care on Sunday
- Jack is 14 years old
- He's been in local authority care for 3 months
- David is a 55-year-old single father

I still need to know if David was previously claiming Child Benefit before Jack went into care. This is important because:

1. If David was receiving Child Benefit before Jack went into care, then the rules for continuing benefit would apply
2. If David never claimed before, the rules for new claims would be relevant

According to the guidance, when a child is in local authority care, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks. However, regular returns home (which is happening here) may allow for continued payment depending on the specific circumstances and previous claim status.
#thinking

Thank you for clarifying that Jack stays with you Friday and Saturday nights before returning to care on Sunday.

Based on UK government rules, when a child is in local authority care but regularly returns home (as in your case), your eligibility for Child Benefit depends on several factors.

To provide you with the most accurate information about your specific situation, could you please tell me whether you were receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into local authority care 3 months ago?

2026-01-16T15:51:54.897238 [actor]: care more than 8 weeks

2026-01-16T15:52:01.301159 [root_agent]: #thinking
The person has confirmed that Jack has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks (specifically 3 months as mentioned earlier).

According to the eligibility criteria at gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care:
- Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks when a child goes into local authority care
- However, if the child regularly returns home, the benefit might continue to be paid

In this case:
- Jack has been in care for more than 8 weeks (3 months)
- Jack regularly returns home on weekends (Friday and Saturday nights)

I still don't know if David was claiming Child Benefit before Jack went into care, which would help determine if he needs to report a change in circumstances or make a new claim.

Given the regular weekend visits, there might be a possibility of continuing or claiming Child Benefit, but I need to understand the previous claiming status to give accurate advice.
#thinking

Yes, I understand Jack has been in care for more than 8 weeks (3 months now). 

Typically, Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks when a child is in local authority care. However, since Jack regularly returns to your home on weekends (Friday and Saturday nights), you might still be eligible for some Child Benefit payment.

To help me determine your specific eligibility, could you please tell me whether you were receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into local authority care? This information is important because it affects whether you'd be continuing an existing claim or making a new one.

2026-01-16T15:52:05.260061 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent appropriately explained that Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks when a child is in local authority care, but since Jack regularly returns home on weekends, the parent might still be eligible for some Child Benefit payment.
