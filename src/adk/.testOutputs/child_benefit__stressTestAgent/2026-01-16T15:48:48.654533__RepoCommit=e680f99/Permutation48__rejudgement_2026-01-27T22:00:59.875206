2026-01-27T22:05:23.444108 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent initially incorrectly told the user they were eligible for Child Benefit, stating that the HNC course qualified as "approved education." Only when the user corrected the agent with accurate information about HNCs being "advanced education" (making them ineligible) did the conversation reach the correct outcome. The agent made a significant error in their initial assessment.
