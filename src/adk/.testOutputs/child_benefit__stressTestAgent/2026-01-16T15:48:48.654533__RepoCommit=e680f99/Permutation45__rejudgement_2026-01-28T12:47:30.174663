According to the guidelines, if a child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks AND the parent is not regularly spending money on the child's upkeep (which the user confirmed they are not doing), they are not eligible for Child Benefit. Daily visits alone without financial contribution do not satisfy the exception requirement after the 12-week period.
