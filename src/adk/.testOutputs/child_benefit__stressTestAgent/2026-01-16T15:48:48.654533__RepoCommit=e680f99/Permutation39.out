2026-01-16T16:05:24.811239 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one by one.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-16T16:05:25.941671 [actor]: adoption allowance special needs siblings 6 and 8

2026-01-16T16:05:27.936021 [root_agent]: I understand you're caring for siblings who are 6 and 8 years old with special needs, and there may be an adoption allowance involved. Thank you for sharing that context.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you clarify if you are legally responsible for these children? For example, are you their parent, have you adopted them, or do you have another form of legal guardianship?

2026-01-16T16:05:28.758977 [actor]: George Helen adopted sibling pair special needs local authority pays adoption allowance

2026-01-16T16:05:30.021915 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you've adopted George and Helen, a sibling pair with special needs, and you receive an adoption allowance from the local authority.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask if you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:05:30.881657 [actor]: we adopted them not george and helen are us 

2026-01-16T16:05:32.502753 [root_agent]: I apologize for the misunderstanding. Thank you for the clarification that you and your partner adopted the siblings (not that George and Helen are their names).

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask if you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:05:33.392926 [actor]: UK resident

2026-01-16T16:05:35.040278 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you're a UK resident. 

My next question is about your immigration status. Do you have the right to reside in the UK? This could be because you're a British citizen, have settled or pre-settled status, or have another immigration status that gives you the right to live in the UK.

2026-01-16T16:05:35.738015 [actor]: british citizen

2026-01-16T16:05:37.400572 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you're a British citizen.

Now, regarding your income situation - is either you or your partner's individual income over £60,000 per year? (This is relevant because of the High Income Child Benefit Charge).

2026-01-16T16:05:38.085954 [actor]: both under 60000

2026-01-16T16:05:41.824541 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both you and your partner have individual incomes under £60,000.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have responsibility for children aged 6 and 8 (under 16)
2. You are their adoptive parent
3. You are a UK resident with the right to reside (British citizen)
4. Neither you nor your partner has an individual income over £60,000

As adoptive parents, you have the same entitlement to Child Benefit as biological parents. The fact that you receive an adoption allowance from the local authority does not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit - these are separate support systems.

You can claim Child Benefit for both children. Currently, the rate is £25.60 per week for your first child and £16.95 per week for each additional child.

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:05:43.325035 [actor]: I understand I'm eligible for Child Benefit for both adopted children. Thank you for confirming this.

2026-01-16T16:05:45.434706 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that as adoptive parents of children under 16, who are UK residents and British citizens with incomes under £60,000, they qualify for Child Benefit, and that adoption allowance doesn't affect eligibility.
