2026-01-16T16:08:32.590434 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions one by one.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-16T16:08:33.559898 [actor]: daughter hospital how long get benefit

2026-01-16T16:08:36.801634 [root_agent]: I understand your daughter is in the hospital and you're wondering how this affects your Child Benefit.

If your child is temporarily in hospital, you can usually continue to receive Child Benefit as normal. The length of time your child spends in hospital generally doesn't affect your eligibility, provided you're still responsible for them and contributing to their care.

For a child in hospital, Child Benefit can continue to be paid as long as:
- You're still responsible for the child
- You continue to contribute to their cost of providing for them
- The child is expected to return to live with you

May I ask if you are still visiting your daughter and contributing to her care while she's in hospital?

2026-01-16T16:08:37.536437 [actor]: daughter hospital 14 weeks visit every day

2026-01-16T16:08:40.550030 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're visiting your daughter every day during her 14-week hospital stay and presumably still maintaining responsibility for her care, you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit during this period.

The UK government rules state that Child Benefit continues when your child is temporarily away from home, including when they're in hospital. Your regular visits demonstrate that you're maintaining your parental responsibility and contributing to her care.

You don't need to notify the Child Benefit Office about temporary hospital stays, as this doesn't affect your eligibility or payments.

Is there anything specific about your Child Benefit payments during this difficult time that you'd like me to clarify further?

2026-01-16T16:08:41.279920 [actor]: no spending money hospital provides everything

2026-01-16T16:08:45.383077 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Even though the hospital is currently providing for your daughter's immediate needs and you're not spending money directly on her care at this moment, you should still remain eligible for Child Benefit during her hospital stay.

The key factor is that you're maintaining parental responsibility by visiting her daily, and this temporary hospital arrangement doesn't change your status as her parent/guardian. The Child Benefit rules recognize that hospital stays are temporary situations, and that you'll resume financial responsibility when she returns home.

If her hospital stay becomes very prolonged (beyond 12 weeks) and she begins receiving care under the NHS, it might be worth checking with the Child Benefit Office directly about your specific situation, but for a 14-week stay where you're actively involved in her care through daily visits, your eligibility should continue.

Would you like me to explain anything else about Child Benefit during your daughter's hospital stay?

2026-01-16T16:08:46.357199 [actor]: will i still get paid she's been in 14 weeks

2026-01-16T16:08:50.659247 [root_agent]: Since your daughter has now been in the hospital for 14 weeks, I should provide you with more specific information about Child Benefit continuation.

For a child who has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks (or expected to be in hospital for more than 12 weeks), special rules may apply if they're receiving care or treatment through the NHS.

Based on UK government guidance, you can generally continue receiving Child Benefit if:
- You're still considered responsible for the child
- You're regularly visiting your child (which you are, every day)
- You're maintaining contact with your child

The fact that you visit your daughter daily demonstrates you're maintaining your parental relationship, which is an important factor in continuing eligibility.

I would recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly to inform them of your specific situation since the stay has extended beyond 12 weeks. They can confirm your continued eligibility based on your exact circumstances.

Would you like me to provide you with the contact information for the Child Benefit Office?

2026-01-16T16:08:51.623759 [actor]: Am I eligible or not? daughter hospital 14 weeks no spend money

2026-01-16T16:08:55.336831 [root_agent]: I understand you want a clear answer about your eligibility for Child Benefit given your daughter's 14-week hospital stay.

Based on the UK government guidelines, you should still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit despite your daughter being in hospital for 14 weeks, even though you're not currently spending money on her care.

The key factors supporting your continued eligibility are:
- You're maintaining responsibility for your daughter
- You're demonstrating this by visiting her every day
- The hospital stay is considered a temporary situation

However, since the stay has extended beyond 12 weeks, I would strongly recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office to inform them of your specific circumstances. They may need to confirm your continued eligibility based on the exact nature of your daughter's care arrangement.

The final determination would come from the Child Benefit Office, but based on the information you've provided, you should remain eligible as long as you continue to maintain parental responsibility through your regular visits.

2026-01-16T16:08:59.209172 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed that Child Benefit should continue during the 14-week hospital stay as long as the parent maintains responsibility and visits regularly, which aligns with government guidance for children temporarily in hospital.
