2026-01-16T15:52:52.484404 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:52:53.535480 [actor]: Foster child Liam 12 years

2026-01-16T15:52:55.171004 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you have a 12-year-old foster child named Liam.

For Child Benefit eligibility with foster children, I need to understand your specific arrangement. Are you receiving payments from your local council or health and social services for fostering Liam?

2026-01-16T15:52:55.931865 [actor]: Yes council pays fostering allowance for him

2026-01-16T15:52:58.543511 [root_agent]: I understand that you receive a fostering allowance from the council for Liam. 

Based on this information, I need to inform you that you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam. According to UK government rules, Child Benefit is not available for foster children if you receive payments from your local council or health and social services for fostering them.

The fostering allowance you receive is designed to cover the costs of caring for Liam, which is why Child Benefit isn't provided in addition to this allowance.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation or any other children you might have responsibility for?

2026-01-16T15:53:00.115961 [actor]: I understand now. I won't be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam since I receive a fostering allowance from the council that covers his accommodation and maintenance. Thank you for explaining this to me.

2026-01-16T15:53:02.378940 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that foster carers receiving payments from a local council for looking after a foster child are not eligible for Child Benefit for that child.
