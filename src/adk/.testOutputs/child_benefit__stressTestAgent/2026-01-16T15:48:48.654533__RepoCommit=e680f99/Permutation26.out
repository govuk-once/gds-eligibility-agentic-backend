2026-01-16T15:59:57.395840 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. To do this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:59:58.831708 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a user trying to find out about child benefit eligibility, following the guidelines to be obtuse and speak like I'm entering search terms.

child zahid 15 living with aunt

2026-01-16T16:00:00.848884 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you're asking about Child Benefit for a 15-year-old named Zahid who is living with their aunt.

To properly assess eligibility for Child Benefit in this situation, I need to understand more about your relationship to Zahid.

Could you please clarify your relationship to Zahid? Are you Zahid's aunt who they are living with, or are you someone else?

2026-01-16T16:00:01.908935 [actor]: I'm mo father zahid 15 not living with me aunt looking after him

2026-01-16T16:00:03.866590 [root_agent]: I understand that you are Mo, Zahid's father, and Zahid (who is 15) is currently living with your sister (Zahid's aunt) who is looking after him.

In this situation, I need to understand the arrangement you have with the aunt. Is this a formal arrangement where the aunt has been given responsibility for Zahid, or is it a temporary/informal arrangement?

2026-01-16T16:00:04.973844 [actor]: no papers just sending money every week to aunt for zahid

2026-01-16T16:00:07.745219 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that you're sending money weekly to support Zahid, but there's no formal paperwork regarding the arrangement with the aunt.

For Child Benefit purposes, the person who has the child living with them and is responsible for their day-to-day care is typically the person eligible to claim Child Benefit.

Since Zahid is living with his aunt and she's providing his day-to-day care, she would generally be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, even though you're providing financial support.

May I ask if the aunt is currently claiming Child Benefit for Zahid?

2026-01-16T16:00:08.869350 [actor]: aunt not claiming money I send £15 weekly grandmother sends £15 too

2026-01-16T16:00:11.853941 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. I understand that the aunt is not currently claiming Child Benefit for Zahid, and that both you and the grandmother are providing financial support (£15 each per week).

Since Zahid is living with his aunt who is responsible for his day-to-day care, she would generally be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for him. 

However, in this situation, you as the father could potentially claim Child Benefit if you can show that you're still taking responsibility for Zahid through your financial contributions. That said, typically the person the child lives with (in this case the aunt) would have the stronger claim.

Would you be interested in knowing more about how the aunt could claim Child Benefit for Zahid, or would you prefer to explore whether you might be eligible to claim?

2026-01-16T16:00:12.589475 [actor]: me eligible? how much money needed?

2026-01-16T16:00:16.718015 [root_agent]: I understand you want to know if you're eligible and how much financial support is required for eligibility.

For Child Benefit eligibility, there isn't a specific amount of money you need to contribute. Rather, eligibility is generally based on who has responsibility for the child.

In your situation, since Zahid is living with his aunt and she's providing day-to-day care, she would typically be considered the person with main responsibility for him, even though you're providing financial support.

However, you as the father might still claim Child Benefit if you can demonstrate that you're making regular, substantial contributions to Zahid's upkeep and are involved in decisions about his care and welfare.

The current amount of Child Benefit is £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, and £16.95 per week for each additional child. This would be more than the £15 you're currently sending weekly.

Would you like me to explain the steps you would need to take if you wanted to apply for Child Benefit for Zahid?

2026-01-16T16:00:17.738683 [actor]: grandmother and me together send £30 every week is that enough?

2026-01-16T16:00:21.320928 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. You and the grandmother together are sending £30 per week for Zahid's care.

There isn't a specific minimum amount you need to contribute to be eligible for Child Benefit. Eligibility is primarily based on who has responsibility for the child's day-to-day care, rather than just financial contributions.

Since Zahid is living with his aunt who is providing his daily care, she would typically be considered to have primary responsibility and would generally be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit, regardless of the amount you contribute financially.

However, if you want to claim Child Benefit as the parent, you would need to show that you're maintaining regular contact with Zahid and are involved in decisions about his care, education, and welfare - not just providing financial support.

Would you like me to explain what steps you could take if you wanted to apply for Child Benefit, or would you prefer information about how the aunt could claim?

2026-01-16T16:00:22.419139 [actor]: me eligible if £30 weekly? child benefit rules amount?

2026-01-16T16:00:26.663402 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking specifically about a financial threshold for Child Benefit eligibility.

To clarify: There is no specific amount like £30 weekly that automatically makes you eligible for Child Benefit. The eligibility rules don't work based on a set financial contribution.

The primary factor for Child Benefit eligibility is who has responsibility for raising the child - which typically means who the child lives with and who provides day-to-day care.

Since Zahid lives with his aunt and she provides his day-to-day care, she would generally be considered the person eligible to claim Child Benefit, regardless of your financial contribution amount.

The current Child Benefit rates are:
- £25.60 per week for an eldest or only child
- £16.95 per week for each additional child

If you believe you should be the one to receive Child Benefit despite Zahid living with his aunt, you would need to contact HMRC to discuss your specific situation and why you believe you have primary responsibility for Zahid.

Would you like information on how to contact HMRC about this matter?

2026-01-16T16:00:30.502739 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that for Child Benefit eligibility, the person responsible for the child's day-to-day care (the aunt in this case) would typically be eligible to claim, not necessarily the parent who provides financial support regardless of amount.
