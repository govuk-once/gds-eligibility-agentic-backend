2026-01-27T22:05:07.987762 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that the parent would be eligible for Child Benefit when Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland do not qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
