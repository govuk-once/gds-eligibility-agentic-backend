2026-01-28T12:52:00.516374 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that Karen is eligible for Child Benefit when she is not. According to gov.uk guidelines, a paid apprenticeship in England is a disqualifying event for Child Benefit, regardless of the pay amount. The agent should have informed Karen that she must stop her claim.
