2026-01-27T22:05:44.190555 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment that the agent failed. The agent incorrectly stated that a non-resident parent could claim Child Benefit if they contributed at least the same amount as the Child Benefit payment (£26.05/week), which is not accurate according to official UK guidelines. This contradicts the expected outcome of "Not Eligible" that should have been provided to the user.
