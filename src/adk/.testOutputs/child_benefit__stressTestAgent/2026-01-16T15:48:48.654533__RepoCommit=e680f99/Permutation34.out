2026-01-16T16:03:08.559129 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:03:09.434932 [actor]: Mark 15 youth custody 10 weeks

2026-01-16T16:03:10.844701 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. To clarify, are you asking about eligibility for Child Benefit for a 15-year-old named Mark who is currently in youth custody for 10 weeks? I want to make sure I understand your situation correctly.

2026-01-16T16:03:11.826255 [actor]: yes Mark my son been in custody

2026-01-16T16:03:15.151742 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that Mark is your 15-year-old son who has been in youth custody for 10 weeks.

Regarding Child Benefit eligibility in this situation, if your child is in custody (either sentenced or on remand), Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks of them being in custody. Since Mark has been in custody for 10 weeks, Child Benefit payments would typically have stopped.

However, once Mark is released and returns to your care, you can claim Child Benefit again. You should inform the Child Benefit Office about Mark's situation as soon as possible if you haven't already done so.

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit eligibility or how to restart payments when Mark returns home?

2026-01-16T16:03:16.061528 [actor]: I was getting child benefit before will it automatically start again

2026-01-16T16:03:19.218586 [root_agent]: When Mark is released from custody and returns to your care, Child Benefit will not automatically restart. 

You'll need to contact the Child Benefit Office to let them know that Mark has returned home. You can do this by:
- Calling the Child Benefit helpline
- Writing to the Child Benefit Office

It's best to inform them as soon as possible after Mark returns home. When you contact them, be prepared to provide details about when Mark was released and that he's back in your care.

Since Mark is 15 and was previously eligible, you should be able to receive Child Benefit again once you've notified them of his return, assuming all other eligibility criteria are still met.

Would you like to know anything else about restarting your Child Benefit payments?

2026-01-16T16:03:21.242851 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining that I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit while Mark is in custody beyond 8 weeks, and that I'll need to contact the Child Benefit Office to restart payments when he returns home.

2026-01-16T16:03:23.430671 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks of a child being in custody (which applies in this case as Mark has been in custody for 10 weeks), and that the benefit would not automatically restart upon Mark's release.
