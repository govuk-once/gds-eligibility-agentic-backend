2026-01-16T15:57:41.373001 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. Let me ask you questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First question: Are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you in the UK?

2026-01-16T15:57:42.577093 [actor]: Child benefit divorced two children Sam Ella living Robert Tina separately Sam with Robert Ella with Tina

2026-01-16T15:57:45.657859 [root_agent]: I notice there's some confusion in your message. Let me clarify what I understand - it seems you're asking about Child Benefit in a situation involving divorce where two children (Sam and Ella) are living separately with different parents (Robert and Tina).

To properly assess eligibility in this situation, I need to understand which person you are in this scenario. 

Are you Robert (living with Sam) or Tina (living with Ella), or someone else involved in this situation?

2026-01-16T15:57:46.529875 [actor]: Robert Sam lives with me 10 years old

2026-01-16T15:57:47.765992 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you are Robert, and Sam who is 10 years old lives with you.

Is Sam your child, and are you responsible for raising Sam?

2026-01-16T15:57:48.569672 [actor]: yes Sam my son raising him after divorce

2026-01-16T15:57:50.031562 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Sam is your son, he's 10 years old, lives with you, and you're responsible for raising him after a divorce.

Is Sam normally living with you in the United Kingdom?

2026-01-16T15:57:50.859542 [actor]: yes UK Sam lives with me full time

2026-01-16T15:57:52.122879 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Sam lives with you full-time in the UK.

Is Sam in full-time education? (This would typically be the case for a 10-year-old child attending school)

2026-01-16T15:57:52.976020 [actor]: school yes primary school

2026-01-16T15:57:54.122738 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Sam attends primary school.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income of over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-16T15:57:54.865022 [actor]: no income less than that amount

2026-01-16T15:57:55.924685 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your income is below £60,000 per year.

Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Sam (such as his other parent)?

2026-01-16T15:57:56.850014 [actor]: no just me claiming for Sam ex-wife claiming for Ella

2026-01-16T15:58:00.966349 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information. Based on what you've shared with me:

- You are Robert, and you have your son Sam (10 years old) living with you full-time in the UK
- Sam attends primary school
- Your income is below £60,000 per year
- Only you are claiming Child Benefit for Sam, while your ex-wife claims for Ella

Based on these facts, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Sam. You meet the key criteria:
- You're responsible for a child under 16 who lives with you
- The child is in eligible education (primary school)
- Your income is below the threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would fully reduce your benefit
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for the same child

You can receive Child Benefit until Sam turns 16, or until 20 if he remains in approved education or training.

2026-01-16T15:58:02.375701 [actor]: I understand. Thank you for confirming I'm eligible for Child Benefit for my son Sam.

2026-01-16T15:58:04.948150 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly assessed that Robert is eligible for Child Benefit for Sam who lives with him full-time in the UK, is under 16 (10 years old), attends primary school, and no one else claims for him.
