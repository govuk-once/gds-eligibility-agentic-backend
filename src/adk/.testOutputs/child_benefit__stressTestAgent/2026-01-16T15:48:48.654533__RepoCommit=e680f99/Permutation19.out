2026-01-16T15:56:51.525524 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:56:52.400167 [actor]: child benefit holly 9 years old

2026-01-16T15:56:54.247282 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you're asking about Child Benefit for Holly, who is 9 years old.

To determine your eligibility, I need to confirm: Are you responsible for Holly's care (meaning she lives with you or you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit rates toward looking after her)?

2026-01-16T15:56:55.402149 [actor]: separation pete sue daughter lives both

2026-01-16T15:56:57.708578 [root_agent]: I understand your situation involves a separation between you and your partner (Pete and Sue), and your daughter Holly lives with both of you.

For Child Benefit eligibility in separated families, I need to understand the living arrangement more clearly. How is Holly's time divided between both households? Does she spend equal time with both parents, or does she primarily live with one parent?

2026-01-16T15:56:58.649461 [actor]: holly stay pete 3 day sue 4 day

2026-01-16T15:57:02.865755 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that Holly stays with Pete for 3 days and with Sue for 4 days each week.

In separated families where a child splits time between parents, typically only one person can receive Child Benefit for the child. When parents share care, as in your situation, the Child Benefit would normally go to the parent that the child lives with for the majority of the time.

Since Holly spends 4 days with Sue and 3 days with Pete, Sue would typically be considered the main carer and would be eligible to claim Child Benefit. However, if you're Pete in this scenario, you and Sue could decide between yourselves who will claim, though the official guidance would suggest it should be the person Holly stays with most (Sue in this case).

May I ask if you are Pete or Sue in this situation?

2026-01-16T15:57:03.660317 [actor]: both buy clothes food both claim hmrc

2026-01-16T15:57:08.412635 [root_agent]: I understand that both you and your ex-partner contribute to Holly's expenses such as clothes and food. 

Regarding Child Benefit, even though you both support Holly financially, only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child. When parents are separated, HMRC typically awards the benefit to the person the child lives with most of the time - in this case, that appears to be Sue since Holly stays with her for 4 days compared to Pete's 3 days.

If both of you have made a claim to HMRC, they will determine who receives the Child Benefit based on their assessment of who has the main responsibility for the child. They may consider factors like:
- Who the child lives with most of the time (in this case, Sue)
- Who handles most day-to-day caring responsibilities
- Who pays for most of the child's expenses

If you're both claiming, HMRC will likely contact both parties to resolve this situation. They would generally award the benefit to Sue based on the information you've provided about the living arrangements.

Is there anything specific about your Child Benefit claims with HMRC that you'd like me to address?

2026-01-16T15:57:11.839378 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that since Holly spends more time with Sue (4 days vs 3 days with Pete), Sue would be the one eligible to receive Child Benefit as the main carer.
