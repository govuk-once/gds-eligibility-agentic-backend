2026-01-16T15:59:14.113548 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:59:15.051292 [actor]: child benefit residential school son paid by council 10 weeks

2026-01-16T15:59:16.878976 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about Child Benefit for your son who is at a residential school that's paid for by the council for 10 weeks.

To understand your situation better: Is your son under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:59:17.818635 [actor]: son 14 years old residential school

2026-01-16T15:59:19.451208 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son is 14 years old and attends a residential school.

My next question: Is your son's residential school placement considered to be in "approved education"? (This generally includes schools, colleges, or home education that the local education authority approves)

2026-01-16T15:59:20.173800 [actor]: residential school severe behavioral needs council pays

2026-01-16T15:59:21.647605 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son attends a residential school for severe behavioral needs, and the council pays for this placement.

Next question: Even though your son is in residential school, do you still maintain regular contact with him, such as visits, weekends at home, or school holidays spent with you?

2026-01-16T15:59:22.459013 [actor]: still parent son comes home sometimes

2026-01-16T15:59:23.962150 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since your son comes home sometimes and you're still his parent, that helps with determining eligibility.

Next question: How many nights per week does your son typically spend at the residential school? And does he come home regularly for weekends or holidays?

2026-01-16T15:59:24.921982 [actor]: full time residential 10 weeks school behavioral needs

2026-01-16T15:59:26.344996 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son attends a full-time residential school for 10 weeks due to behavioral needs.

Next question: When your son is not at the residential school (during breaks or holidays), does he live with you? And do you pay for his daily living costs when he's with you?

2026-01-16T15:59:27.074570 [actor]: yes parent responsible costs holidays

2026-01-16T15:59:31.116732 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son lives with you during holidays and that you're responsible for his costs during these periods.

Based on the information you've provided:

You may still be eligible for Child Benefit even though your son is in a residential school paid for by the council. This is because:

1. Your son is under 16 years old (14)
2. He attends a residential school for children with special needs
3. You maintain parental responsibility
4. He returns home to you during holidays
5. You're responsible for his costs when he's with you

The UK government allows Child Benefit to continue in cases where a child is in residential education but returns home regularly, and where the parent maintains responsibility for the child.

I would recommend that you apply for or maintain your Child Benefit claim. If you're already receiving it, you should inform the Child Benefit Office about your son's residential school arrangement if you haven't already done so.

Is there anything specific about Child Benefit eligibility that you'd like me to explain further?

2026-01-16T15:59:34.456219 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a child in residential education, correctly noting that the parent remains eligible when they maintain parental responsibility and the child returns home during holidays.
