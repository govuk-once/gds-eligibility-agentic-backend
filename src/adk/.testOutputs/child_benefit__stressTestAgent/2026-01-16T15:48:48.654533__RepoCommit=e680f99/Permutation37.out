2026-01-16T16:04:31.533893 [root_agent]: I'll help you assess your eligibility for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to determine this.

Do you have any children who live with you?

2026-01-16T16:04:32.649654 [actor]: I need to role-play as a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. Let me do that now.

caring for my friend's daughter

2026-01-16T16:04:34.217110 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I'd like to understand your situation better regarding caring for your friend's daughter.

Are you responsible for raising this child on a day-to-day basis (meaning the child lives with you and you're primarily responsible for their care)?

2026-01-16T16:04:35.160472 [actor]: yes she lives with me now her mother sick

2026-01-16T16:04:36.453161 [root_agent]: I understand that the child is living with you because her mother is sick. 

How long has the child been living with you, or how long do you expect her to be living with you?

2026-01-16T16:04:37.504912 [actor]: been months now doctor says mother recovery long time

2026-01-16T16:04:39.038738 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since the child has been living with you for months and the mother's recovery is expected to take a long time, this could be relevant to your Child Benefit claim.

Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for this child, such as her mother?

2026-01-16T16:04:39.751276 [actor]: don't know mother benefit situation

2026-01-16T16:04:40.951822 [root_agent]: I understand you're not sure about the mother's benefit situation. 

Are you a UK resident? (This is important as Child Benefit eligibility typically requires you to live in the UK)

2026-01-16T16:04:41.658634 [actor]: yes UK resident bradford

2026-01-16T16:04:42.708476 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you're a UK resident living in Bradford.

How old is the child you're caring for?

2026-01-16T16:04:43.420467 [actor]: nina 10 years old

2026-01-16T16:04:44.767049 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Nina is 10 years old.

Do you have any legal arrangement in place regarding your care of Nina, such as a court order, formal fostering arrangement, or any written agreement with her mother?

2026-01-16T16:04:45.798749 [actor]: private arrangement friend mother knows council aware no money from them

2026-01-16T16:04:47.596254 [root_agent]: I understand this is a private arrangement with your friend, Nina's mother is aware, and the council knows about the situation but you're not receiving financial support from them.

Are you solely responsible for Nina's day-to-day care currently? This would mean providing her with a home, food, clothing, and looking after her needs.

2026-01-16T16:04:48.574627 [actor]: yes care for nina completely mother cannot now

2026-01-16T16:04:53.253405 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are completely caring for Nina while her mother cannot.

Based on the information you've provided, you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Nina because:

1. You are a UK resident
2. You are responsible for a child under 16 (Nina is 10)
3. You are providing day-to-day care for Nina
4. This appears to be a long-term arrangement while her mother is ill

Even in informal arrangements where you're caring for someone else's child, you can claim Child Benefit if you're primarily responsible for the child.

I would recommend that you:

1. Apply for Child Benefit using form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office
2. Explain your specific situation in the application
3. If Nina's mother is currently receiving Child Benefit for her, only one person can receive it, so there would need to be an arrangement to transfer the claim to you

Would you like me to provide more information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:04:55.883845 [actor]: I understand I'm eligible for Child Benefit because Nina lives with me, I'm UK resident, I'm caring for her completely, and it's a private arrangement. Will apply online form CH2.

2026-01-16T16:04:57.406046 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly assessed that someone caring for a friend's child on a long-term basis while the mother is ill can claim Child Benefit as they are providing full day-to-day care.
