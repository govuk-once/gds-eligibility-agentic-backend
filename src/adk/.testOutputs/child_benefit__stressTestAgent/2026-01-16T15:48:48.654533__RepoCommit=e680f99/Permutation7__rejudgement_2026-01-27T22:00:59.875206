The agent correctly explained that while Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks of local authority care, there's an exception when the child regularly spends weekends at home (Friday and Saturday nights - meeting the "2 nights in a row" exception criteria), making the father potentially eligible for Child Benefit despite Jack being in care longer than 8 weeks.
