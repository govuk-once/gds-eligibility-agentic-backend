2026-01-16T15:48:50.109309 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T15:48:50.823629 [actor]: Child benefit UK

2026-01-16T15:48:52.168052 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I'd like to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:48:53.049180 [actor]: I have son Leo he's 8

2026-01-16T15:48:54.076493 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Having an 8-year-old son named Leo could qualify you for Child Benefit.

Is Leo living with you?

2026-01-16T15:48:54.910817 [actor]: yes lives with us manchester

2026-01-16T15:48:56.576275 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Leo lives with you in Manchester. 

Is Leo in the UK and are you responsible for raising him? By responsible, I mean providing for his needs, such as food, clothes, and a home.

2026-01-16T15:48:57.267281 [actor]: teacher job primary school

2026-01-16T15:48:58.804190 [root_agent]: I understand you work as a teacher at a primary school. Thank you for sharing that.

To continue assessing your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to confirm: are you responsible for raising Leo in the UK? This means you're the person primarily providing for his needs.

2026-01-16T15:48:59.558065 [actor]: UK citizens me and husband

2026-01-16T15:49:00.914877 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that you and your husband are UK citizens.

To continue with your Child Benefit eligibility assessment, could you confirm that you are responsible for raising Leo in the UK? I'm asking to verify that you provide for his day-to-day needs.

2026-01-16T15:49:01.809309 [actor]: yes we look after him

2026-01-16T15:49:03.257919 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you and your husband look after Leo.

Is your or your husband's individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-16T15:49:04.116378 [actor]: teacher salary 35000 part time job 15000

2026-01-16T15:49:05.845371 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your income details. Based on what you've told me, your teacher salary is £35,000 and you have an additional part-time job income of £15,000, totaling £50,000.

What about your husband's income? Could you tell me his approximate annual income?

2026-01-16T15:49:06.682775 [actor]: husband teacher me part time

2026-01-16T15:49:08.588152 [root_agent]: I understand now. You're a part-time teacher with an income of £35,000 plus an additional £15,000 from another part-time job, and your husband is a teacher. 

Could you please tell me your husband's approximate annual income? I need this information to determine if the High Income Child Benefit Charge might apply to your situation.

2026-01-16T15:49:09.496042 [actor]: husband teacher 35000 I work part time 15000

2026-01-16T15:49:13.169533 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that your husband is a teacher earning £35,000 per year, and you work part-time earning £15,000 per year. So your combined household income is £50,000.

Based on the information you've provided:

1. You have responsibility for your 8-year-old son Leo who lives with you
2. You and your husband are UK citizens
3. Your individual income is £15,000 and your husband's is £35,000

You are eligible for Child Benefit. Since neither you nor your husband earn over £50,000 individually, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

You can claim the full Child Benefit amount which is currently £25.60 per week for your first or only child.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T15:49:15.267444 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know I'm eligible for Child Benefit. Getting £25.60 weekly will help with Leo's expenses.

2026-01-16T15:49:17.153722 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that a parent with an 8-year-old child who lives with them is eligible for Child Benefit, and correctly identified that the High Income Child Benefit Charge doesn't apply since neither parent earns over £50,000 individually.
