2026-01-16T16:10:36.895611 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one by one to determine your eligibility.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:10:38.363338 [actor]: I'll take on the role of a person in the described situation and interact with the agent who's asking about Child Benefit eligibility.

tom son 17 computing course

2026-01-16T16:10:39.344308 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify, is Tom your 17-year-old son who is on a computing course?

2026-01-16T16:10:40.390701 [actor]: yes tom 17 my son computer coding paid by future employer

2026-01-16T16:10:41.098574 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Is Tom living with you at home?

2026-01-16T16:10:41.977302 [actor]: lives with me yes home address

2026-01-16T16:10:43.616027 [root_agent]: Thank you. Since Tom is 17 and on a computing course, I need to understand more about his education situation. Is his computing/coding course considered approved education, such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other similar qualifying education?

2026-01-16T16:10:44.616910 [actor]: employer pays course fees join them after finish not paid during course

2026-01-16T16:10:46.723700 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to understand if Tom's course qualifies as approved education under Child Benefit rules.

Is Tom's computing course one of the following:
- A full-time education course (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study)
- A course that leads to a qualification (like A-levels, NVQs, or similar)
- Part of an apprenticeship program

2026-01-16T16:10:47.596321 [actor]: coding course future job specific company pays fees not school college

2026-01-16T16:10:49.112252 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I need to understand a bit more about this course. 

How many hours per week does Tom spend on this coding course? And is this his only current educational activity, or is he also enrolled in any school or college?

2026-01-16T16:10:50.022377 [actor]: 20 hours weekly only education not school employer training program

2026-01-16T16:10:52.817848 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared, I need to determine if this employer training program qualifies as approved education for Child Benefit purposes.

Since Tom is 17, for Child Benefit eligibility, he would need to be in what the government considers "approved education" which typically includes:
- Schools and colleges
- Government-funded traineeships
- Certain approved training courses

Could you tell me if Tom's training program is recognized as an approved education or training course by the education authorities or Department for Education?

2026-01-16T16:10:53.675310 [actor]: not approved education employer agreement for future job

2026-01-16T16:10:57.532588 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that information. Based on what you've shared, I need to make an assessment about your Child Benefit eligibility.

Since Tom is 17 and not in what would be classified as "approved education" (such as school, college, or a government-approved training course), but rather in an employer-specific training program that isn't formally recognized as approved education, he would not meet the Child Benefit eligibility requirements.

For Child Benefit to continue for a child aged 16 or over, they must be under 20 and in approved education or training. From what you've described, this employer-specific coding course, while valuable for Tom's future employment, doesn't appear to meet the government's definition of approved education for Child Benefit purposes.

Is there anything else about Tom's situation that might be relevant to his education status that I should consider?

2026-01-16T16:11:01.259031 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit isn't available when a 17-year-old is in employer-specific training rather than "approved education" as defined by government criteria.
