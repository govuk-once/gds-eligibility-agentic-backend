2026-01-16T16:04:17.795393 [root_agent]: I understand you're helping me assess Kelly's eligibility for Child Benefit. Let me ask you questions one at a time about Kelly's situation.

Is Kelly currently 16 years old?

2026-01-16T16:04:18.898635 [actor]: Yes 16 birthday March

2026-01-16T16:04:20.159665 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Kelly is 16 years old with a birthday in March.

Is Kelly planning to start A-levels or another form of approved education or training in September?

2026-01-16T16:04:21.079360 [actor]: College A-levels September already accepted offer

2026-01-16T16:04:22.365768 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Has Kelly finished her GCSEs in June and is currently in the period between finishing GCSEs and starting A-levels?

2026-01-16T16:04:23.189912 [actor]: GCSEs June finished waiting September college now August

2026-01-16T16:04:27.482053 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Kelly finished her GCSEs in June and is currently waiting to start college for A-levels in September, and it's now August.

Based on the information you've provided, Kelly would be eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit continues for children under 20 who are in approved education or training, which includes A-levels at college.

Since Kelly is 16 and has been accepted for A-levels starting in September, she is considered to be in the gap between approved education courses. This gap between leaving school after GCSEs and starting A-levels in September is covered by Child Benefit provisions, as she has an accepted offer and will be continuing her education.

The person responsible for Kelly would continue to receive Child Benefit during this period between education courses, as long as Kelly has been accepted into the course starting in September.

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit for Kelly's situation?

2026-01-16T16:04:30.559176 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit continues during the gap between finishing GCSEs in June and starting A-levels in September when the child has been accepted for the course.
