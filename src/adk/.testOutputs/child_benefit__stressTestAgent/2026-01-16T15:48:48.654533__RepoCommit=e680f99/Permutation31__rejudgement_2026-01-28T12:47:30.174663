2026-01-28T12:50:37.526434 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly told the user they were eligible for Child Benefit when university education (bachelor's degree) is considered "advanced education" not "approved education," making the child ineligible. Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education like a university degree.
