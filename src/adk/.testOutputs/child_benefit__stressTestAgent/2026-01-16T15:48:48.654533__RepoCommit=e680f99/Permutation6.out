2026-01-16T15:50:39.268246 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

To begin with, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T15:50:40.035344 [actor]: Child benefit hospital daughter

2026-01-16T15:50:42.227323 [root_agent]: I'll help determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit in your situation with your daughter in hospital.

When a child is in hospital, you can usually still get Child Benefit if you're responsible for them. 

May I ask if you're normally responsible for your daughter (providing care and financial support) when she's not in hospital?

2026-01-16T15:50:43.139814 [actor]: Chloe 6 in hospital long time me visit every day

2026-01-16T15:50:46.257497 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that your 6-year-old daughter Chloe is in the hospital for an extended period, and you visit her every day.

Since you visit her every day and appear to maintain responsibility for her care, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit while she's in hospital. There's no time limit for how long you can continue receiving Child Benefit when your child is in hospital.

Could you tell me if you're normally responsible for Chloe when she's not in hospital (providing her home, care, and financial support)?

2026-01-16T15:50:47.099198 [actor]: yes she my daughter at home with me always before hospital

2026-01-16T15:50:48.986509 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Chloe is your daughter and normally lives with you when not in hospital.

Since you are her parent and normally responsible for her care, you should remain eligible for Child Benefit while she's in hospital, regardless of how long her hospital stay lasts.

May I ask if you are currently receiving Child Benefit for Chloe, or are you looking to make a new claim?

2026-01-16T15:50:50.057828 [actor]: not getting it now want to know if can get

2026-01-16T15:50:54.422958 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on what you've shared, you should be eligible to apply for Child Benefit for your daughter Chloe. 

Since you are her parent, she normally lives with you when not in hospital, and you continue to be responsible for her care (as evidenced by your daily visits), you meet the basic eligibility requirements. The fact that she's currently in hospital doesn't affect your eligibility.

To apply for Child Benefit, you'll need to complete form CH2, which you can get online through the GOV.UK website or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

As of 2023/2024, the weekly rate for your first child is £24.00 and for additional children it's £15.90 each.

Would you like to know anything else about applying for Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T15:50:55.585052 [actor]: How long she stay in hospital before I don't get benefit

2026-01-16T15:50:58.802874 [root_agent]: You can continue to receive Child Benefit for your daughter for the entire duration of her hospital stay, no matter how long it lasts. There is no time limit that would stop your Child Benefit while Chloe is in hospital.

As long as you remain responsible for her (which you clearly are by visiting her daily) and would normally be caring for her at home, you remain eligible for Child Benefit throughout her hospital treatment.

The UK government specifically allows for continued Child Benefit payments when a child is temporarily away from home due to being in hospital.

2026-01-16T15:51:00.022033 [actor]: Hospital 14 weeks already spend money books pajamas food £30 every week

2026-01-16T15:51:03.452753 [root_agent]: I understand that Chloe has been in the hospital for 14 weeks already, and you're spending about £30 per week on items for her like books, pajamas, and food.

This confirms that you are continuing to financially support her while she's in hospital, which further demonstrates your ongoing responsibility for her care. These expenses you're covering are exactly the kind of costs Child Benefit is designed to help with.

The duration of her hospital stay (14 weeks so far) has no impact on your eligibility for Child Benefit. You remain eligible to receive it throughout her entire hospital stay, regardless of how long it continues.

If you apply for Child Benefit now, you may be able to get some payments backdated, though there are limitations on how far back payments can go.

2026-01-16T15:51:04.440475 [actor]: So can I get the benefit even after 14 weeks hospital?

2026-01-16T15:51:07.975839 [root_agent]: Yes, absolutely. You can get Child Benefit for Chloe even after she has been in the hospital for 14 weeks. There is no time limit on how long your child can be in hospital while you continue to receive Child Benefit.

As long as you:
- Would normally care for her at home (which you confirmed you did before hospitalization)
- Continue to be responsible for her (which you are demonstrating by visiting daily and spending money on her needs)

You remain eligible for Child Benefit throughout her entire hospital stay, regardless of its duration. The 14 weeks she has already been in hospital has no impact on your eligibility, and this will continue to be true even if her stay extends much longer.

2026-01-16T15:51:12.374330 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately informed that Child Benefit can continue for the entire duration of a child's hospital stay with no time limit, which is correct according to UK government guidelines.
