2026-01-16T15:49:39.274646 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. Let me ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-16T15:49:40.221145 [actor]: child benefit eligibility son not in school

2026-01-16T15:49:41.253507 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. Let me ask about your situation more specifically.

How old is your son who is not in school?

2026-01-16T15:49:42.098771 [actor]: Ben 17 left school June

2026-01-16T15:49:43.620482 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Ben is 17 and left school in June, I need to understand his current situation to determine Child Benefit eligibility.

What is Ben doing now since leaving school? For example, is he in any form of education, training, or employment?

2026-01-16T15:49:44.412345 [actor]: careers service looking apprenticeship

2026-01-16T15:49:45.838905 [root_agent]: I understand that Ben is 17, left school in June, and is now working with the careers service to find an apprenticeship.

Is Ben currently registered with a careers service, government agency, or education institution for work or training placement searches?

2026-01-16T15:49:46.489565 [actor]: local youth careers registered

2026-01-16T15:49:47.719930 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Ben is registered with the local youth careers service.

How long has it been since Ben left school in June? Has it been more than 20 weeks?

2026-01-16T15:49:48.440798 [actor]: August now

2026-01-16T15:49:51.957892 [root_agent]: I understand it's now August, and Ben left school in June. That means it's been less than 20 weeks since he left school.

Based on the information you've provided:

1. Your son Ben is 17 years old
2. He left school in June (less than 20 weeks ago as it's now August)
3. He is registered with the local youth careers service looking for an apprenticeship

You are likely still eligible for Child Benefit for Ben. Child Benefit can continue for a young person under 20 who has left education but is registered with a careers service, Connexions, local authority support service, or similar organization while they look for work or training. This extension applies for up to 20 weeks after leaving education.

Would you like me to explain anything else about Child Benefit eligibility or how to maintain your claim?

2026-01-16T15:49:54.898701 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after leaving education when the young person is registered with a careers service while looking for work or training.
