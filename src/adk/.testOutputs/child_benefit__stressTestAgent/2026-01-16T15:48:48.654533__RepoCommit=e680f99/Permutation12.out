2026-01-16T15:53:27.128434 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:53:28.193300 [actor]: I'll need to play the role of a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. Let me engage with the agent as requested.

son education teenager

2026-01-16T15:53:29.607498 [root_agent]: I notice you mentioned "son education teenager," but I need a bit more specific information to help determine your eligibility.

Could you please confirm if you're responsible for a child who is under 16, or a young person under 20 who is in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:53:30.580129 [actor]: Liam A-levels study still lives at home

2026-01-16T15:53:32.013838 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify, it sounds like you have a son named Liam who is studying A-levels and still lives at home with you.

May I ask how old Liam is currently?

2026-01-16T15:53:32.761893 [actor]: 18 years

2026-01-16T15:53:34.710866 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Liam is 18 years old.

Since Liam is between 16 and 20 years old and studying A-levels (which is considered approved education), this meets one of the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

Do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-16T15:53:35.426097 [actor]: yes UK resident

2026-01-16T15:53:36.441383 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are a UK resident.

Is Liam a UK citizen, or does he have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-16T15:53:37.189673 [actor]: born here

2026-01-16T15:53:38.685242 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Liam was born in the UK.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-16T15:53:39.518186 [actor]: no income not high single parent

2026-01-16T15:53:41.170305 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're a single parent with an income that's not over £60,000 per year, you wouldn't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Is Liam your biological or adopted child, or is he under your legal guardianship in some way?

2026-01-16T15:53:41.993931 [actor]: my son father left years ago

2026-01-16T15:53:43.541339 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand Liam is your biological son and you're raising him as a single parent.

Is Liam currently living with you most of the time? (You mentioned he lives at home, but I just want to confirm.)

2026-01-16T15:53:44.441681 [actor]: lives with me full time

2026-01-16T15:53:49.338942 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Liam lives with you full time.

Based on the information you've provided:

1. You are responsible for Liam, who is 18 years old
2. Liam is studying A-levels (approved education)
3. You are both UK residents
4. Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold
5. Liam is your biological son
6. Liam lives with you full time

You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. As Liam is over 16 and in approved education, you can continue to receive Child Benefit until he completes his A-levels or reaches age 20, whichever comes first.

If you haven't already applied for Child Benefit, you would need to fill out a CH2 form. If you're already receiving it for Liam, it should continue automatically as long as you've informed HMRC that he's staying in approved education.

Is there anything specific about Child Benefit you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-16T15:53:50.216873 [actor]: he gets universal credit money

2026-01-16T15:53:53.901001 [root_agent]: Thank you for mentioning that Liam receives Universal Credit.

This is an important point to consider. If Liam is receiving Universal Credit in his own right, this may affect the Child Benefit situation.

When a young person aged 16-19 receives certain benefits in their own name, including Universal Credit, you generally cannot continue to receive Child Benefit for them, even if they are in education.

Since Liam is 18 and receiving Universal Credit himself, you likely would not be eligible to receive or continue receiving Child Benefit for him. The Universal Credit payment he receives is considered to replace the support that would otherwise be provided through Child Benefit to you as his parent.

Have you been receiving Child Benefit for Liam up until now?

2026-01-16T15:53:57.545899 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the parent would not be eligible for Child Benefit when their 18-year-old son receives Universal Credit in his own right, even though he's studying A-levels.
