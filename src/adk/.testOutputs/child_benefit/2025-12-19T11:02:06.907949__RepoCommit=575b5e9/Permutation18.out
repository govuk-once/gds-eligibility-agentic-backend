[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Raj and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Raj, I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are claiming for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm claiming for my son, Dev. He's 19 years old right now, but he'll be turning 20 next month.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Raj. 

Is Dev currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's studying full-time for his A-levels right now.

[root_agent]: Thanks. And to confirm, is Dev living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he lives with me at home.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Raj.

Just to be clear, when Dev turns 20 next month, will he still be studying for his A-levels, or will he have finished his course by then?

[evaluation_judge]: He'll still be studying for his A-levels when he turns 20. He's mid-way through the term when his birthday happens.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Raj.

Based on the information you've provided, Dev will no longer be eligible for Child Benefit once he turns 20, even though he is still studying for his A-levels. Eligibility ceases on his 20th birthday. 

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or perhaps explore eligibility for any other benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: So you're telling me that I will no longer be able to claim Child Benefit for Dev once he turns 20 next month, even though he's still studying for his A-levels? I was hoping the benefit would continue until he finishes his studies. Could you just confirm that's definitely the case?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to ask me to confirm, Raj. It's understandable you were hoping it would continue until he finishes his studies.

Yes, that is definitely the case. According to the rules for Child Benefit, even if Dev is still in full-time education, eligibility stops when a child turns 20. There isn’t an extension for finishing a course after that age. 

I’m sorry I don’t have better news for you. Would you like me to double-check anything else, or explore if there are any other benefits Dev might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's okay. I appreciate you explaining the situation clearly. It's disappointing, but at least now I know where I stand with the Child Benefit once Dev turns 20. Thank you for your help.

✓ The agent correctly determined that Dev would not be eligible for Child Benefit once he turns 20, even though he is still in full-time education. This matches the expected outcome that eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday.
