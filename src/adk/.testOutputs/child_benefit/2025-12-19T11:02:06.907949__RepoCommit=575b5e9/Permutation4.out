[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Elena, a parent of a working teenager, to evaluate the agent's benefits guidance.

Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Elena, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand which benefits you might be eligible for. 

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Sofia is 18 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Elena. And is Sofia currently in any form of full-time education, such as school, college, or university? Or perhaps an apprenticeship?

[evaluation_judge]: No, she's not in education. Sofia left school two years ago and she's been working as a receptionist since then.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Elena. Roughly how many hours a week does Sofia work?

[evaluation_judge]: She works about 30 hours a week as a receptionist.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And just to clarify, is Sofia living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she lives with me in our home.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Elena. Based on the information you've provided – Sofia is 18, not in education, works 30 hours a week, and lives with you – it appears you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit. 

This is because Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 16, or if they are 16 or 17 and not in approved education or training. Working over 24 hours a week also affects eligibility, even if they *were* in education.

Would you like me to explain any of this in more detail, or explore if you might be eligible for any other types of support?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining that. So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because Sofia is 18, working, and not in education. That makes sense. I was just wondering if I could still get some support, but now I understand the rules. I don't think I need any other information right now.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit, explaining that eligibility stops when a child turns 16 (unless in approved education) and that Sofia's 30-hour work week would disqualify her anyway. This matches the expected outcome.
