[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Beatrice and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Beatrice, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible, could you please tell me how old you are?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 30 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Do you have any children?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a son named Leo. He's 5 years old.

[root_agent]: That's lovely to hear. Is Leo currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Leo is currently in local authority care. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Are you currently receiving any income, or are you able to contribute financially towards Leo's upkeep?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have any income myself, so I can't contribute financially to Leo's upkeep. But my husband, who is Leo's stepfather and lives with me, sends £30 per week to the carer for Leo.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To confirm, are you and your husband married or in a civil partnership?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, we are married.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Just one final question for now – does your husband live at the same address as you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my husband and I live at the same address together.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Beatrice. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may be eligible for Child Benefit, even though Leo is in local authority care and you aren't directly contributing financially. Your husband’s contribution counts as your contribution, as you are married and live together.

Would you like me to explain this in a bit more detail, or perhaps discuss other potential benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would appreciate if you could explain this in more detail. So I can still get Child Benefit even though Leo is in care?

[root_agent]: Yes, you can still potentially receive Child Benefit even though Leo is in local authority care. Generally, Child Benefit stops when a child stops living with you. However, there are exceptions, and one of those exceptions applies in your situation.

Because Leo has been in care for more than 8 weeks, and your husband is contributing financially to his upkeep – even though *you* aren’t directly paying – you may still be eligible. This is because the rules state that contributions from a spouse or civil partner who lives with you count towards meeting the financial contribution requirement. 

Essentially, as long as someone is contributing financially to Leo’s care, and you meet the other eligibility requirements, you can continue to claim. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So even though Leo is in care, because my husband contributes £30 a week towards his upkeep, I can still claim Child Benefit. And that's because we're married and live together, so his contribution counts as mine. Thank you for explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Beatrice! You’ve understood it perfectly. Yes, that’s exactly right. Your husband’s contribution satisfies the financial requirement because of your marital status and living arrangement.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, or would you like information on how to actually apply for Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit. They accurately explained that even though my child has been in care for over 8 weeks, my husband's contribution of £30/week counts as my contribution since we are married and living together, making me eligible.
