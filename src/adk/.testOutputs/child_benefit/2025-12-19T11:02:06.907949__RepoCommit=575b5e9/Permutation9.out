[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you role-play this scenario to test the agent. I'll take on the role of Lars, a German citizen with Pre-Settled Status who is looking for work in the UK.

Hi, i'm Lars and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lars, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand which benefits you might be eligible for. 

To start, could you tell me how old your child is?





[evaluation_judge]: I have a 5-year-old son, Hans. I'm trying to find out if I can claim Child Benefit for him.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Lars. That's helpful.

Are you currently responsible for Hans financially?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am fully responsible for my son Hans financially.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you.

As you've recently moved to the UK, could you please tell me about your current immigration status? For example, do you have Settled or Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme?

[evaluation_judge]: I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme. I moved to the UK from Germany recently.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Lars. And just to clarify, are you currently employed?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm currently unemployed, but I'm actively looking for work. I've registered as a jobseeker.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lars. That’s very helpful. 

Based on the information you’ve provided, it sounds like you *may* be eligible for Child Benefit. However, to be certain, could you confirm that you are actively looking for work and have registered as a jobseeker with the relevant authorities?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am definitely actively looking for work and I have officially registered as a jobseeker with the relevant authorities.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Based on everything you've told me – that you have Pre-Settled Status, you are responsible for a 5-year-old son, and you are an actively seeking work and registered as a jobseeker – it appears you **are eligible** for Child Benefit.



Is there anything else I can help you with today, Lars?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit based on having Pre-Settled Status, being responsible for my 5-year-old son, and being a registered jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work.
