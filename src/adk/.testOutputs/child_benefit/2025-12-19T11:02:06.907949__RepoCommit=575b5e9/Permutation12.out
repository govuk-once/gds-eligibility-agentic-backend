[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of Liam's mother Jessica who is inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Jessica and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Jessica, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are inquiring about?

[evaluation_judge]: My son Liam is 18 years old. He lives with me and is currently studying for his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. And is Liam currently receiving Universal Credit, or any other benefits in his own right?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Liam has been approved for Universal Credit. He receives it to help with his personal living costs since he has no income and is estranged from his father.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Just to be absolutely clear, is Liam receiving Universal Credit specifically *because of his own needs* and not as part of a joint claim with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Liam receives Universal Credit for his own needs and has his own claim. It's not part of a joint claim with me. He applied and was approved based on his specific circumstances.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you've provided, because Liam is 18 years old and receiving Universal Credit in his own right, you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit for him. 

The rules state that Child Benefit stops when a child turns 18 and starts getting certain benefits themselves, such as Universal Credit.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for the information.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since my son is 18 and receives Universal Credit in his own right, which matches the expected outcome.
