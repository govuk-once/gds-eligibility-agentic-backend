[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Simon and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Simon, I'm happy to help. To start, could you tell me how old you are?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 15 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently living at home with your parents, or are you living somewhere else at the moment?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not living at home right now. I've been placed in a secure psychiatric unit under the Mental Health Act. I've been here for 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just to clarify, is this unit a hospital or a custody setting?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a secure psychiatric unit in a hospital. I'm here under the Mental Health Act for treatment, not in custody like prison or anything.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. As you're receiving medical treatment in a hospital setting under the Mental Health Act, the rules around Child Benefit are a little different.

To help me understand your situation fully, could you confirm whether your parents are still responsible for your care while you are in the unit?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my parents are still responsible for my care. They visit me regularly and I'll be going back home after my treatment.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Since you are under 16, and your parents are responsible for your care while you are in the unit for treatment, and it has been less than 12 weeks since you entered the unit, it sounds like you may still be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Just to be absolutely sure, are you receiving any other benefits currently?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not receiving any other benefits that I know of. My parents normally get the Child Benefit for me.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. It sounds like your parents should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit for you while you are in the unit, as you are receiving medical treatment and it’s been less than 12 weeks. 

To confirm, are your parents aware of your current situation and have they contacted the Child Benefit office to let them know?

[evaluation_judge]: I think my parents know about the Child Benefit, but I'm not sure if they've contacted the Child Benefit office about my situation here in the unit. Should they have done that?

[root_agent]: Yes, ideally they should inform the Child Benefit office about your stay in the unit. While benefit should continue automatically for up to 12 weeks, it’s best to let them know to avoid any potential issues with payments. 

Would you like me to explain how your parents can contact the Child Benefit office, or would you prefer I stick to just assessing eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: I think it would be helpful to know how they can contact the Child Benefit office, just so I can pass that information along to them when they visit next.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Your parents can contact HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) who handle Child Benefit. Here’s how:

*   **By phone:** 0300 200 3100 (open Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm)
*   **Via their online account:** If your parents have an online HMRC account, they can sign in and update their details there.
*   **By post:** Child Benefit Office, HMRC, PO Box 1985, Nottingham, NG91 1ZL

They will likely need to have your date of birth and National Insurance number (if you have one) available when they contact them.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really helpful, thank you. Just to make sure I understand correctly - since I've been in the psychiatric unit for 10 weeks, my parents are still eligible to receive Child Benefit for me, and they will continue to be eligible until I've been here for 12 weeks. Is that right?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly! Yes, that is correct. Since you’ve been in the psychiatric unit for 10 weeks, and it’s considered a hospital stay under the Mental Health Act, your parents are still eligible to receive Child Benefit for you, and this will continue until you’ve been in the unit for 12 weeks.

I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. Is there anything else at all I can assist with?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.

✓ The agent correctly determined I would be eligible for Child Benefit as I've been detained in a psychiatric unit (treated as hospital/residential accommodation) for 10 weeks, which is less than the 12-week threshold that applies in my case.
