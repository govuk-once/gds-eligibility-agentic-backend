[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Callum and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Callum, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand whether you might be eligible, could you tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks! And are you currently in education or training?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I just started a Modern Apprenticeship here in Glasgow.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. Is this Modern Apprenticeship an approved training scheme?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure what you mean by "approved training scheme." It's just a regular Modern Apprenticeship program here in Scotland. I get paid while I learn on the job.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Generally, in Scotland, Child Benefit isn't usually payable if you're doing an apprenticeship. But to be certain, I just want to confirm - are you earning over £184 per week from your apprenticeship?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm earning about £150 per week from my apprenticeship at the moment.

[root_agent]: Thanks. Just to confirm, you are 17 years old and undertaking a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, earning £150 per week. 

Based on this information, unfortunately, you wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit. This is because Child Benefit generally isn’t paid if someone is undertaking an apprenticeship in Scotland.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly focused on earnings rather than the type of training. Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland are not approved training for Child Benefit purposes regardless of earnings amount, as stated in the guidance. The agent eventually reached the correct conclusion that I'm not eligible, but appeared to suggest that earnings were a determining factor when they aren't relevant to this specific scenario.
