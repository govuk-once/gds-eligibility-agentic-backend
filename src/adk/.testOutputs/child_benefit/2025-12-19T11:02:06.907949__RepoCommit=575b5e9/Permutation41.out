[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Martin and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Martin, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me how old your children are?





[evaluation_judge]: I have two children, Ben who is 10 and Jerry who is 8. They live with my ex-partner, but I contribute money toward their care.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Martin. That's helpful to know. Roughly how much do you contribute towards the care of Ben and Jerry each week? It's okay to give me an approximate amount.

[evaluation_judge]: I contribute £40 per week towards their care.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Martin. And just to clarify, is that £40 split equally between Ben and Jerry, or do you contribute different amounts for each child?

[evaluation_judge]: It's just a single payment of £40 that I make. I haven't specifically allocated different amounts to each child.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that, Martin. Do you know if HMRC currently considers your £40 contribution to be split equally between Ben and Jerry - so £20 each?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure how HMRC is currently splitting it. I assumed it would be split equally, but I don't know for certain if that's how they're treating it.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's perfectly alright. HMRC generally defaults to splitting contributions equally. Knowing this, are you aware you can ask HMRC to consider an unequal split of your £40 contribution between Ben and Jerry? This could potentially affect your Child Benefit entitlement.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that option. How would an unequal split affect my Child Benefit entitlement? Would that be better for me?

[root_agent]: That's a good question, Martin. The Child Benefit rate for a child aged 10 is £26.05 per week, and for a child aged 8 it’s £17.25 per week. If HMRC splits your £40 equally (£20 each), Ben wouldn't receive the full £26.05 he's eligible for, and you might lose some entitlement.

However, you can request HMRC to allocate £26.05 of your £40 contribution to Ben, and the remaining £13.95 to Jerry. Would you like me to explain how that might affect your eligibility for each child, if you were to request this unequal split?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain how that would affect my eligibility for each child if I requested that unequal split.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Martin. If you request the unequal split – allocating £26.05 to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry – you would be eligible for the full Child Benefit rate for Ben, as your contribution would fully cover his entitlement.

However, Jerry needs £17.25 per week, and you'd only be contributing £13.95 towards him. Therefore, you wouldn’t be eligible for Child Benefit for Jerry in that scenario. 

Essentially, requesting the unequal split would mean you receive the full amount for Ben, but you wouldn’t receive any Child Benefit for Jerry. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So if I stick with the equal split of £20 each, would I get any benefit at all? Or would I be better off with the unequal split you suggested?

[root_agent]: That's a really important question, Martin. With the equal split of £20 each, Ben needs £26.05 and Jerry needs £17.25. Because you’re contributing less than Ben’s entitlement, you likely wouldn’t receive any Child Benefit for either child with the equal split. 

Therefore, you *would* be better off with the unequal split, as you’d at least receive the full Child Benefit for Ben. It's a case of getting *something* rather than nothing at all. Would you like me to explain how to request this unequal split with HMRC?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain how I would request this unequal split with HMRC. I'd definitely prefer to get some benefit rather than none at all.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. To request an unequal split, you’ll need to contact HMRC directly. Unfortunately, you can’t do it online. You’ll need to call them. 

The number to call is 0300 200 3100. When you call, explain that you want to specify how your maintenance payments are allocated between your children, Ben and Jerry, and that you want £26.05 allocated to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry. 

They may ask for details about your contributions and your children’s arrangements. It’s a good idea to have the children’s dates of birth and your National Insurance number handy when you call.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, Martin?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's very helpful. I'll call that number and request the unequal split as you suggested. Thank you for explaining this to me - I had no idea I could do this or that it would make such a difference to my entitlement.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Martin! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It's great that you're taking steps to ensure you receive the benefits you're entitled to. 

If you have any further questions in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that with an unequal split (£26.05 for Ben, £13.95 for Jerry), I would be eligible for Child Benefit for Ben but not for Jerry, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
