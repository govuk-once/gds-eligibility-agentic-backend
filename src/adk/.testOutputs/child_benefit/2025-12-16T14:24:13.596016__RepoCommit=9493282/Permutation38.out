[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Tom or Jerry in this scenario, seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility after delaying their application for 4 months.

Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Tom, it’s good to speak with you. To start, was the child eligible for Child Benefit during the past 4 months?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my wife and I had our baby 4 months ago. We've just been so overwhelmed with being new parents that we completely forgot to apply for Child Benefit until now. Our baby has been living with us the whole time, but we're worried we might have missed out on payments for those first few months.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. To help me assess your eligibility, how far back can a new claim go for Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure how far back a claim can go. That's part of what I'm trying to find out. We had our baby 4 months ago but only just realized we should have applied for Child Benefit straight away. I'm hoping we haven't lost out on all those payments from the past 4 months.

[root_agent]: Child Benefit can be backdated up to 3 months. Would you say the child has been living with you for the entire past 3 months?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, our baby has been living with us the entire time since birth, so definitely for the past 3 months. So does that mean we can still get payments for 3 months out of the 4 months since our baby was born?

[root_agent]: That’s correct. Because the child has been living with you for the past 3 months, you would be eligible for Child Benefit payments covering those 3 months. However, you would unfortunately lose the payments from the first month your child lived with you. Is there anything else you’d like to ask about this situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. That's a bit disappointing that we lose that first month, but I'm glad we can still get the payments for the last 3 months. So when we apply now, we just need to make sure we mention that the baby has been with us since birth, and they'll backdate the payments for those 3 months?

[root_agent]: Exactly! Just to confirm, you’ll need to state that the child has been living with you from birth when you submit your application. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this or any other benefits today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that covers everything I needed to know. Thank you for clarifying the backdating rules. We'll make sure to apply right away so we don't miss out on any more payments. Thanks for your help!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Tom! I’m glad I could help. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that Child Benefit can only be backdated up to 3 months, meaning I would lose the payment from the first month but still be eligible for the last 3 months, which matches the expected outcome.
