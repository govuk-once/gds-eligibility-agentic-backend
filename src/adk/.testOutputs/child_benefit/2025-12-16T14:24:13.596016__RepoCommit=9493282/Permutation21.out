[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Robert and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Robert, I’m happy to help you with that.

To start, can you tell me, are you responsible for a child?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am responsible for my 10-year-old son Sam. He lives with me full-time since my ex-wife Tina and I recently divorced. Our daughter Ella lives with her mother.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. 

Just to clarify, you’re claiming for Sam, who is 10 years old, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right, I'm claiming for my son Sam who is 10 years old and lives with me full-time. My daughter Ella lives with my ex-wife Tina.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Now, since your family situation involves a split – with Sam living with you and Ella living with your ex-wife – would you agree that both you and Tina are responsible for a child?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm responsible for Sam who lives with me, and Tina is responsible for Ella who lives with her.

[root_agent]: Okay, Robert. Given that you and Tina are each responsible for one child living in different households, are you and Tina entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for the eldest child in each of your respective households?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe so, but I'm not entirely sure how that works when parents are separated. Is Sam considered the eldest child in my household? And would Tina receive a different rate for Ella?

[root_agent]: That’s a great question, Robert. Yes, Sam is considered the eldest child in your household because he’s 10 years old and Ella is 8. 

The guidance states that if families split up and children are divided between parents, each parent is entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for the eldest child in their specific household. They do not have to settle for the lower “additional child” rate for the younger sibling. 

Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So I would receive the full £26.05 weekly rate for Sam since he's the eldest (and only) child in my household. And Tina would also receive the full £26.05 weekly rate for Ella since she's the eldest (and only) child in her household. That's good to know, thank you.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Robert! I’m glad that clears things up for you. It sounds like you are indeed eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all I needed to know. Thank you very much for explaining how the Child Benefit works in our situation with the split household. It's good to know that I'll receive the full rate for Sam.

[root_agent]: You’re most welcome, Robert! I’m delighted I could assist you. Have a wonderful day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that in a split family situation where children live in separate households, both parents are eligible to receive the full "eldest child" rate (£26.05) for the child living with them, which matches the expected outcome.
