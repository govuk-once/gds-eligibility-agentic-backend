[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Maria, a US citizen on a tourist visa in the UK, and interact with the agent to test their ability to determine my eligibility for child benefits.

Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Maria, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you confirm if you are currently physically in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently in the UK with my son. We arrived about a month ago.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Now, regarding your immigration status – do you have a “Right to Reside” for benefit purposes?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm here on a 6-month tourist visa from the United States. My 5-year-old son is with me as well. We're just visiting for now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on that information, it sounds like you don't currently have a “Right to Reside” for benefit purposes, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. I just have the standard tourist visa. I'm not working or anything while I'm here, just visiting.

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria. Thank you for providing that information. It seems clear that, due to your current visa status and lack of a “Right to Reside,” you are unlikely to be eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So because of my tourist visa, I can't get Child Benefit while I'm here with my son?

[root_agent]: That’s correct, Maria. Because you’re here on a tourist visa and don’t have a “Right to Reside,” the rules for Child Benefit generally don’t apply to you.

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. Thank you for explaining that to me.

✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit due to my tourist visa status and lack of Right to Reside, which matches the expected outcome.
