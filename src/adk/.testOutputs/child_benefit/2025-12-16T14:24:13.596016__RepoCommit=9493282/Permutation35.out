[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Rashid's father and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello. I’m here to help you figure out if you’re eligible for a benefit.

To start, could you tell me if Rashid is currently in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Rashid is currently in full-time education. He's doing his A-Levels at the moment.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know.

Now, I need to ask – is Rashid married or in a civil partnership?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Rashid recently got married to his girlfriend. She's 17 as well and has moved into our house to live with us.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Could you tell me if Rashid lives with you and depends on you financially?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Rashid still lives with us in our family home along with his new wife. He's dependent on us financially as he's still studying full-time.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for clarifying that.

Just to be absolutely clear, are you – as the claimant – financially supporting Rashid’s spouse as well?

[evaluation_judge]: We are providing housing for both of them since they live with us, but we're not fully supporting his wife financially. She doesn't have a job yet, but she's also not fully dependent on us.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail.

Given this information, it seems there might be an exception that applies. Would you agree that Rashid lives with you and you are not financially supporting his wife?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Rashid does live with us and while we provide housing for them both, we're not fully financially supporting his wife. They live in our home, but we're mainly supporting Rashid as our son who is still in education.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you *are* eligible for the benefit.

To confirm, Rashid is in approved education, he lives with you and depends on you financially, and you aren’t fully supporting his wife – all of which meet the criteria for the exception. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's all correct. Rashid is studying A-Levels, he lives with us and depends on us financially, and we aren't fully supporting his wife financially.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for confirming that information.

I’m glad we could determine your eligibility. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know about my eligibility for child benefit for Rashid. Thank you for your help.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for child benefit via the exception for married children who still live with and depend on their parents, matching the expected outcome.
