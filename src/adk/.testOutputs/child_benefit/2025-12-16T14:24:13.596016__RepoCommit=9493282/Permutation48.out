[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a UK resident seeking information about benefit eligibility based on the scenario provided.

Hi, i'm Emily and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Emily, it’s nice to meet you. To help me determine if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you tell me if you are under 18?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm 18. I've just finished my A-Levels over the summer and started a course at my local college this autumn.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Since you’re 18 and attending a college course, let’s talk about the course itself. Is the course “Approved” or “Advanced”?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm doing a Higher National Certificate course - it's an HNC in business studies. I think it's considered level 4.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. A Level 4 course is considered ‘advanced’ education. Could you tell me, are you living with your parents or guardians?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm still living with my parents while I attend the local college.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, to confirm, you are 18 years old, living with your parents, and studying an ‘Advanced’ Level 4 course – a Higher National Certificate in Business Studies. Just to be absolutely clear, are there any children living with you who might be eligible for Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh no, I don't have any children. I'm just asking about my own eligibility. My parents were wondering if they could still claim Child Benefit for me now that I'm 18 and doing this HNC course.

[root_agent]: I understand. Thank you for clarifying that. Let me check the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit in this situation. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you are 18, living with your parents, and studying an ‘Advanced’ Level 4 course – you are not eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why I'm not eligible.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Child Benefit rules state that it’s generally only available to people with dependent children. As you mentioned, you don’t have any children living with you. Additionally, as you’re studying an ‘Advanced’ Level 4 course, which is considered higher education, Child Benefit isn’t available for that type of study. 

Do you want me to point you to the specific links on the government website that outline these criteria if you’d like to review them yourself?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful to share those links about why my parents can't claim for me anymore.

[root_agent]: Okay, absolutely. Here are the links you requested:

*   **Child Benefit Eligibility:** [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)
*   **Child Benefit - Children Living with Someone Else:** [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else)
*   **Child Benefit for Children in Hospital or Care:** [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care)

I hope these links are helpful! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit as I am 18 and enrolled in an advanced education course (HNC), which aligns with the expected outcome.
