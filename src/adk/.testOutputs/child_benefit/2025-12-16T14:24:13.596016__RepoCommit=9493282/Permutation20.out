[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit. I'm looking after my granddaughter Lucia who's 14 years old. Her parents aren't able to care for her right now, and she's been living with me for a while. It's just an informal family arrangement - there's no court order or anything official like that. I pay for everything she needs. Would I be eligible for any financial help?

[root_agent]: Hello Maria, thank you for reaching out. I understand you're looking into whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you tell me, are you responsible for Lucia?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm responsible for Lucia. She lives with me full-time, and I take care of all her needs - food, clothing, school expenses, everything really. Her parents aren't involved at all right now and don't help financially.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that.

Just to be sure, do you have to be Lucia’s parent to be eligible for Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I'm not her parent, I'm her grandmother. Is that going to be a problem for getting Child Benefit? Like I said, it's just an informal arrangement between family members. Her parents aren't in a position to care for her right now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. The guidelines state that you *can* get Child Benefit if you have an informal arrangement to look after a friend or relative’s child, provided the local council isn’t paying for their accommodation.

To help me assess your situation further, could you tell me, do you pay for all of Lucia’s needs, such as her accommodation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I pay for absolutely everything. The local council isn't involved at all - they don't pay for her accommodation or anything else. I cover her rent as part of my household, all her food, clothing, school supplies, transport, everything. It's entirely on me financially.

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria. Thank you for providing that detailed information.

Based on what you’ve told me – that you’re responsible for Lucia, you have an informal arrangement with her parents, and you cover all of her expenses without any local council support – it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit.

Would you like me to explain the next steps involved in applying?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please! That would be very helpful. I didn't realize I might be eligible since I'm not her parent. What do I need to do to apply?

[root_agent]: Certainly. To apply for Child Benefit, you’ll need to fill out a claim form. You can do this online at [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit).

You'll need Lucia’s date of birth and your National Insurance number to complete the form. You’ll also need to provide information about your income and savings, as this can affect the amount of Child Benefit you receive.

Do you have your Lucia’s date of birth and your National Insurance number handy, or would you like me to guide you through finding them?

[evaluation_judge]: I have Lucia's date of birth and my National Insurance number ready. But I'm a bit concerned about the income part you mentioned. Does my income affect whether I can get Child Benefit at all? I'm retired, but I do have a small pension.

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Maria. It’s understandable to be concerned about that.

The guidelines state that if your partner is looking after the child, any income they have can affect the amount of Child Benefit you receive. However, since you’re the only one looking after Lucia, your pension income shouldn’t affect your eligibility. 

To be absolutely sure, could you tell me, do you currently live with a partner?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't live with a partner. It's just me and Lucia in the house. I'm a widow and have been for several years now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Maria.

Since you don’t live with a partner and you’re the only one responsible for Lucia’s care, your pension income shouldn’t affect your eligibility for Child Benefit.

Based on the information you’ve provided, you *are* likely eligible. Would you like me to reiterate the steps involved in applying, or would you like me to provide a link to the online application form as I mentioned earlier? [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit)

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit as a grandparent with an informal guardianship arrangement, where I'm fully responsible for my granddaughter without local council support.
