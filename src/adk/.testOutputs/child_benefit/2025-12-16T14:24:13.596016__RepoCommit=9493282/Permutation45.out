[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Maria, it’s good to speak with you.

To start, has the child been in hospital for longer than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my daughter has been in the hospital for 14 weeks now. She's 8 years old and I've been going to see her every day since she was admitted.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that.

Now, does the parent regularly spend money on the child’s upkeep?

[evaluation_judge]: I visit her every single day for hours to keep her company, but I don't really spend money on her upkeep. The hospital provides everything she needs - her food, clothes, and medical care. They take care of all that, so I haven't needed to buy anything for her while she's been there.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Just to be clear, you haven't bought any food, clothes, or gifts for her while she’s been in the hospital, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. I haven't bought any food, clothes, or gifts for her during her hospital stay. The hospital provides all her meals and has everything she needs, and I've just been focusing on spending time with her rather than bringing things.

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria. Thank you for providing all of this information. Based on what you’ve told me, it appears you are not eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: Not eligible? That's disappointing to hear. Could you explain why I'm not eligible? I thought since I'm her mother and I visit her every day that I would still qualify for some support.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Maria. Let me explain. Child Benefit eligibility has specific criteria, and one key element is whether the parent is regularly spending money on the child's upkeep.

As you’ve explained, you haven’t purchased any food, clothes, or gifts for your daughter during her hospital stay. The hospital is providing everything she needs. Because you aren't spending money on her upkeep, you don’t meet the criteria for the expenditure exception that applies after 12 weeks in hospital.

Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So even though I'm there with her every day, because I'm not financially contributing to her care or buying things for her, I don't qualify after the 12-week period. That's frustrating because I'm still very much involved in her care, just not financially. But I understand now, thank you for explaining the rules to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Maria. I’m glad I could clarify the rules for you. It’s completely understandable to feel frustrated when the system doesn’t align with your situation. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. I appreciate your time explaining this to me. I'll try to find out if there are any other types of support I might be eligible for as a parent with a child in long-term hospital care.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent, Maria. I wish you and your daughter all the best, and I hope you find the additional support you’re looking for. If you do have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for your kind words. Goodbye for now.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks and I don't regularly spend money on her upkeep, which matches the expected outcome.
