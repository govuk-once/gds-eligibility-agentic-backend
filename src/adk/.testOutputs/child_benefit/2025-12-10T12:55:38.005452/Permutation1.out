[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "I'm looking for some advice about Child Benefit. My husband Tom and I have an 8-year-old son, Leo, and I'm not sure if we're eligible to claim Child Benefit for him.", "we_are_done_here": "false"}

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s start with the first question.

Could you tell me, is the applicant responsible for Leo?

[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "Yes, Leo lives with us full-time. My husband and I are his parents and we're responsible for him.", "we_are_done_here": "false"}

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that.

Now, could you please tell me, is the child under 16, or under 20 and in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "Yes, Leo is 8 years old and he's in primary school.", "we_are_done_here": "false"}

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let’s move on to the next criteria. Does the applicant meet UK residency and immigration rules?

[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "Yes, both my husband and I are UK nationals. We've always lived in Manchester.", "we_are_done_here": "false"}

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know.

Could you please tell me, does the child live with the applicant, or does the applicant contribute sufficient upkeep?
