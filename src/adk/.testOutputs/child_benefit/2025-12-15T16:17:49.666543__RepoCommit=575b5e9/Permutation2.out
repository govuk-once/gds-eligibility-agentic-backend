[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a UK resident seeking benefit eligibility information based on the scenario provided.

Hi, i'm Amit and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Amit, it's good to speak with you. I'm here to help you understand which benefits you might be eligible for. 

To start, could you please confirm how old your child is?

[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Priya is 17 years old. She lives with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful. And is Priya currently in education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she's studying full-time for her A-levels at a local sixth-form college. She finished her GCSEs and now she's continuing her education.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. And roughly, what is your annual income? Please give me an approximate figure.

[evaluation_judge]: I earn about £40,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Finally, just to confirm, does Priya live with you full-time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Priya lives with me full-time. I'm a single father raising her on my own.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Amit. Based on what you've told me – your daughter is 17, in full-time education, you earn £40,000 a year, and she lives with you – it appears you **are** eligible for Child Benefit. 

Would you like me to explain anything further about Child Benefit, or perhaps explore any other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit. This matches the expected outcome from the scenario, as Amit has a child under 20 in approved education, meets all other eligibility criteria, and his income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
