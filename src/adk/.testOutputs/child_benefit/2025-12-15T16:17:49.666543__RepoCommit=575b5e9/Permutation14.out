[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sophie and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sophie, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me how old you are?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 28 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And do you have any children?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a son named Noah who's 6 years old.

[root_agent]: That's lovely to hear. Currently, where is Noah living? Is he living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, that's actually why I'm calling. I recently had surgery and I'm still recovering, so Noah has been staying with my mother - his grandmother - for the past 6 weeks. It's a temporary arrangement until I'm well enough to take care of him properly again.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that, Sophie. Is anyone currently claiming Child Benefit for Noah while he is staying with your mother?

[evaluation_judge]: No, nobody is claiming Child Benefit for him. My mother isn't claiming anything - she's just helping out by looking after him while I recover.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Has Noah been living with his grandmother for more than 8 weeks now?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's been 6 weeks so far. He'll probably be with her for another week or two until I'm fully recovered.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Just to confirm, you are Noah's mother, and you were claiming Child Benefit *before* he went to live with his grandmother?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm his mother and I've been claiming Child Benefit for him before he went to stay with my mother temporarily.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming all of that, Sophie. Based on the information you’ve provided, it sounds like you are likely still eligible for Child Benefit. Because Noah is living with his grandmother temporarily, for less than 8 weeks, and no one else is claiming for him, your benefit should continue uninterrupted. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's a relief to hear! So I can keep getting the Child Benefit even while he's staying with my mum during my recovery? I wasn't sure if I needed to let someone know about the temporary change or if it would affect my payments.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sophie! Yes, you can continue to receive Child Benefit as long as the conditions we discussed remain the same – that Noah is living with his grandmother temporarily (under 8 weeks) and no one else is claiming for him. 

You don't need to *actively* notify anyone about the temporary arrangement, as long as it remains under 8 weeks. However, if his stay with your mother were to extend beyond 8 weeks, it's important to inform the Child Benefit office. Would you like me to explain what happens if the arrangement *does* go over 8 weeks, just for your information?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I'd like to know what happens if it goes over 8 weeks, just in case my recovery takes longer than expected.

[root_agent]: Certainly. If Noah were to live with his grandmother for more than 8 weeks, and you are still the primary carer, your Child Benefit would usually continue without interruption. However, you *would* need to inform the Child Benefit office about the change in living arrangements. 

They might ask for more information to confirm you are still the main person responsible for Noah. If you don’t tell them, and someone else *does* claim for him, your payments will stop.

Does that make sense? It’s really about keeping them informed if the situation changes beyond that initial 8-week period.





[evaluation_judge]: That makes perfect sense, thank you! So I'll continue to receive the benefit during these 6 weeks, but if it goes beyond 8 weeks, I should contact the Child Benefit office to let them know. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sophie! I'm glad I could help. You've understood everything perfectly. 

Just to reiterate, you're doing the right thing by being aware of the rules. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions down the line. I wish you a speedy recovery! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know today. Thank you for your help and good wishes for my recovery.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for Child Benefit during my child's temporary absence since it's less than 8 weeks and no one else is claiming the benefit, which matches the expected outcome.
