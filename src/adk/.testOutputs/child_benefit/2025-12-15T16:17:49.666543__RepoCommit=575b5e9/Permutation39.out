[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by roleplaying a UK resident seeking benefits information to test the agent.

Hi, i'm George and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi George, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand which benefits you might be eligible for. 

To start, could you tell me how old you are?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, thanks for helping me today. I'm 42 years old. My wife Helen and I recently adopted two children, and I'm trying to find out if we're eligible for Child Benefit.

[root_agent]: That's wonderful news about the adoption, George! Congratulations to you and Helen.

To confirm, are these children your only children, or do you have other children living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you! Yes, these are our only children. We adopted a sibling pair - they're 6 and 8 years old. We're really happy to have them in our family.

[root_agent]: That’s lovely to hear, George. It sounds like a very happy family!

Do you, or Helen, currently receive any other form of social security benefit or pension credit?





[evaluation_judge]: No, neither of us receives any social security benefits or pension credit. The only support we get is an Adoption Allowance from our Local Authority because the children have some special needs. This helps us with some of the additional costs involved in their care.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about the Adoption Allowance. That’s helpful. 

Just to be clear, does the Adoption Allowance *fully* cover the children’s accommodation and maintenance costs? Or is it a contribution towards those costs?

[evaluation_judge]: It's definitely not covering all costs - it's just a contribution. The Local Authority provides it as additional support because of the children's special needs, but we're still responsible for the majority of their accommodation, maintenance, and other expenses.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, George. That's good to know.

Are you and Helen the primary carers for these children, and do they normally live with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Helen and I are their adoptive parents and primary carers. The children live with us full-time - they're permanently part of our family now since the adoption was finalized.

[root_agent]: That’s wonderful, George. It sounds like you meet the main criteria for Child Benefit. 

Just one final question: are you, or Helen, non-UK residents?

[evaluation_judge]: No, we're both UK residents. We've been living here our whole lives.

[root_agent]: Great! Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you *are* eligible for Child Benefit for both children. 

You are responsible for them, they live with you, you don’t receive any disqualifying benefits (like a full fostering allowance), and you are both UK residents. The Adoption Allowance you receive doesn’t affect your eligibility.

Would you like me to summarise this for you, or perhaps provide information on how to claim?

[evaluation_judge]: That's good to hear! Yes, could you please summarize our eligibility and tell me how we would go about claiming Child Benefit? I'd appreciate knowing what the process is.

[root_agent]: Absolutely, George. Here's a summary of your eligibility:

You and Helen are eligible for Child Benefit for your adopted children (aged 6 and 8) because:

*   You are both UK residents.
*   You are the primary carers for the children, and they live with you full-time.
*   You do not receive any benefits that would disqualify you, such as a full fostering allowance.
*   The Adoption Allowance you receive does not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit.

**To claim Child Benefit, you can do the following:**

1.  **Online:** The quickest way is to apply online through the government website.
2.  **By Post:** You can also claim by filling in a CH2 form - you can find this form on the government website and request a copy to be sent to you.

You will need the following information:

*   Your National Insurance number.
*   Helen’s National Insurance number.
*   The children’s dates of birth.
*   Your bank details (if you want to receive payments directly into your bank account).

I hope this helps! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm eligible for Child Benefit while receiving an Adoption Allowance, matching the expected outcome.
