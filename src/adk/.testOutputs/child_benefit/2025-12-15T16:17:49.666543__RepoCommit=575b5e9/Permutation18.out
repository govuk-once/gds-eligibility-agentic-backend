[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Raj, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me the age of the child you are claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm claiming for my son Dev. He's currently 19 years old and in full-time education.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that’s helpful to know. Is Dev in approved full-time education? (For example, A-Levels, or equivalent)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's studying for his A-levels full-time.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. Just to confirm, has Dev turned 20 yet?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's 19 right now, but he will be turning 20 in the middle of this term.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Just so I understand correctly, Dev will turn 20 *during* his current A-level course?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. He's currently 19 and studying his A-levels, but he'll be turning 20 mid-way through this term.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. As Dev will be turning 20 during his A-level course, it’s important to know that Child Benefit eligibility usually ends on a child’s 20th birthday, even if they are still in full-time education. 

Do you have any other children you are claiming for?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Dev is my only child. So are you saying I'll lose the Child Benefit once he turns 20, even though he's still completing his A-levels?

[root_agent]: Yes, that's right. According to the rules for Child Benefit, eligibility ceases when a child turns 20, even if they remain in full-time education. Unfortunately, continuing to study A-levels doesn’t extend eligibility past their 20th birthday.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, Raj?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining that to me.

✓ The agent correctly stated that I would no longer be eligible for Child Benefit once Dev turns 20, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)."
