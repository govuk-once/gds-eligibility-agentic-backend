[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Emily and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Emily, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me your age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 18 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Are you currently in education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I just started a Higher National Certificate course at my local college after finishing my A-Levels.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Is the course you are taking considered an "Approved" course, or is it an "Advanced" level course?



You can find more information about what these terms mean here: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility

[evaluation_judge]: It's an Advanced level course. I know it's a level 4 qualification, which is higher than A-Levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Just to be certain, is this course at a university, or at a college?

[evaluation_judge]: It's at a college, not a university.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for all of that information. Based on what you’ve told me – that you are 18, in advanced education (a Level 4 HNC at a college), it appears you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit. 

This is because Child Benefit generally continues only while a young person is in non-advanced education, such as A-Levels, or approved training.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining that to me.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit as I am in advanced education (Level 4 HNC) which exceeds the non-advanced education requirement for Child Benefit eligibility.
