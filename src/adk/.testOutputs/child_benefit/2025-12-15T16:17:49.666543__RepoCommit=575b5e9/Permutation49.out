[evaluation_judge]: I'll now role-play as a user based on the scenario provided, to test another agent's ability to determine Child Benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Tom, it's good to speak with you. I can certainly help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me your current age, please?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm doing a computer coding course right now. My future employer is paying for the course fees as part of an agreement that I'll join their company after I complete it. I'm not getting paid while studying, just having the course funded.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Tom. Is this course an approved education course, such as A-Levels or a university degree?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's not A-Levels or a university degree. It's a specific computer coding course that my future employer has arranged for me. They're paying for it as part of our agreement that I'll work for them when I finish.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So, the course is being funded by your future employer as part of a job agreement. Is the course a requirement *of* employment, or is it something you chose to do independently, even though your employer is funding it?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a requirement of my employment agreement. My future employer is funding this specific coding course because they want me trained in their particular systems before I start working for them. We have an agreement that I'll join them after I complete this training.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tom. Just to be clear, your employer is paying for the course *because* you have an agreement to join them afterwards, and completing the course is a condition of that employment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. They're paying for the course because we have an agreement that I'll join them afterwards. Completing the course is part of the employment agreement we have in place.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Tom. Based on the information you've provided, it appears your course falls under the category of being funded with an employer’s agreement as preparation for a job. 

Unfortunately, this means you wouldn’t currently be eligible for Child Benefit. Is that ok with you, or would you like me to double-check anything?

[evaluation_judge]: So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because of the nature of my course? Can you explain why that is?

[root_agent]: You are correct, Tom. You are not eligible for Child Benefit because of the nature of your course. According to the guidelines, education that is funded by an employer as part of an agreement for future employment is not considered eligible education for Child Benefit purposes. It's seen as training *for* a job, rather than education in its own right. 

Would you like me to explain any part of that in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's clear now. Thank you for explaining. I understand that since my course is employer-agreed training for a job rather than standard education, I'm not eligible for Child Benefit.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Tom. I'm glad I could clarify things for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my education is excluded under the "employer's agreement" exception, which matches the expected outcome.
