[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Hans and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Hans, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me how long you have been actively looking for work?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been looking for work for about 95 days now. I've been claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker during this time. I have Pre-Settled Status in the UK, but I don't have any job offers coming up at the moment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hans. Just to confirm, you mentioned you have Pre-Settled Status. Are you aware that there's a time limit for claiming benefits as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware there was a time limit. Could you explain that to me? I've just been focused on trying to find work while receiving the Child Benefit for my family.

[root_agent]: Certainly. With Pre-Settled Status, you can generally claim as a jobseeker for up to 91 days. As you've been looking for work for 95 days, and don't currently have a job offer, it appears that time limit has passed. 

To be absolutely sure, could you confirm the date you first started claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker? This will help me check against the 91-day limit.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I started claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker exactly 95 days ago when I lost my previous job. I've been actively looking for work since then, but haven't had any success yet. Does this mean I'm no longer eligible for the benefit?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Hans. Yes, unfortunately, based on the information you've provided – having been actively seeking work for 95 days with Pre-Settled Status, and not having a current job offer – it does appear you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit as a jobseeker. The eligibility period is 91 days in this circumstance.

I understand this may be disappointing. Would you like me to provide you with information about other potential benefits you might be eligible for, or resources that could assist with your job search?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that is disappointing news. I didn't realize there was such a strict time limit. Yes, please provide me with information about other benefits I might be eligible for or any resources that could help with my job search. I really need to find something soon to support my family.

[root_agent]: I understand, Hans, and I'm sorry to deliver disappointing news. Let's explore some options. 

First, regarding benefits, your Pre-Settled Status might allow you to claim Universal Credit, depending on your circumstances and income. However, eligibility can be complex. Would you be comfortable with me asking a few questions to see if you might meet the criteria for Universal Credit? This would involve asking about your savings, income (if any), and housing costs.



Alternatively, I can share resources for job searching first, if you'd prefer.

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined that I was not eligible for Child Benefit. The scenario states I've been "claiming Child Benefit as a Jobseeker" - but Child Benefit eligibility is not tied to jobseeker status or the 91-day limit. The agent confused Child Benefit with other benefits that do have the 91-day jobseeker limitation.
