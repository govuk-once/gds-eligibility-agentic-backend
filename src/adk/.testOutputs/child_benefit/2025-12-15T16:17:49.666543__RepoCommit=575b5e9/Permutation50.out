[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Fiona, a 16-year-old from Edinburgh who has left school and joined the "No One Left Behind" programme, seeking information about benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Fiona and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Fiona, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you please tell me if you are currently under 20 years old and in approved education or training?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm 16 years old. I've recently left school and I've joined the "No One Left Behind" programme in Edinburgh. I'm trying to figure out if my parents can still get Child Benefit for me now that I'm on this programme.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you've joined the "No One Left Behind" programme, Fiona. That's a really positive step!

To clarify, are you living at home with your parents while participating in this programme?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm still living at home with my parents in Edinburgh while I'm doing the "No One Left Behind" programme.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Fiona. 

Just to be absolutely sure, is the "No One Left Behind" programme a full-time course or training?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a full-time training programme. I'm doing it five days a week during normal working hours.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Fiona. This is helpful.

Do you receive any other benefits or allowances specifically related to your participation in the "No One Left Behind" programme, aside from it being a training course? For example, a training allowance or bursary?

[evaluation_judge]: I get a small training allowance as part of the programme, but it's not very much - just enough to cover my lunch and transportation costs to get to the training centre.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Fiona. 

Finally, to confirm, is your training course expected to last for at least 30 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the "No One Left Behind" programme I'm on is scheduled to last for about 40 weeks, so it's definitely over 30 weeks.

[root_agent]: Excellent, Fiona. Based on the information you've provided – that you are 16, living at home with your parents, participating in the full-time "No One Left Behind" programme in Scotland, receiving a small training allowance for expenses, and the programme lasting over 30 weeks – it appears your parents *should* still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for you.

The "No One Left Behind" programme is specifically recognised as an approved training course for Child Benefit eligibility.

Would you like me to summarise this for you, or perhaps point you to the official government website for further information?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please summarize it for me and maybe let me know if there's anything my parents need to do to make sure they keep getting the Child Benefit?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Fiona. Here’s a summary:

You are 16 years old, live at home, and are undertaking the full-time "No One Left Behind" programme in Scotland, which lasts over 30 weeks. Because this programme is an approved training course, your parents should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit. The small training allowance you receive just covers your expenses and doesn’t affect eligibility.

Regarding what your parents need to do, they generally don’t need to *do* anything proactively as long as your training continues to meet the criteria. However, it’s important they inform HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) if your training ever stops, or if you start receiving other benefits that might affect eligibility.

HMRC are usually notified automatically by education providers, but it’s always best to be sure. Your parents can check their Child Benefit claim details and update them if necessary on the government website – but I'm not able to provide a direct link. 

Does that make sense, and is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes perfect sense, thank you! I'll let my parents know they should still be receiving Child Benefit while I'm on this programme, and that they should contact HMRC if anything changes with my training. You've been really helpful.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Fiona! I'm so glad I could help. It's wonderful to hear you'll be sharing this information with your parents. 

I wish you all the very best with the "No One Left Behind" programme – it sounds like a fantastic opportunity. If you have any other questions in the future, don’t hesitate to ask.



Have a lovely day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am eligible for Child Benefit while on the "No One Left Behind" programme in Scotland. They accurately recognized that this specific Scottish program is an approved training course for Child Benefit eligibility, which matches the expected outcome.
