[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Sian, it's lovely to speak with you. I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently in education or training?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've just started a Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government in Cardiff. I left school to do this.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know. Just to clarify, is this Foundation Apprenticeship your only activity, or are you also employed at the same time?

[evaluation_judge]: It's my only activity. It's a Foundation Apprenticeship program funded by the Welsh Government. I'm not employed elsewhere.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. And who do you currently live with? Is it your mother, or someone else?

[evaluation_judge]: I live with my mother in Cardiff.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. Finally, is your mother responsible for providing the majority of your financial support?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my mother is responsible for providing the majority of my financial support.

[root_agent]: Thank you for answering my questions, Sian. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you are 17, currently undertaking a Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales, live with your mother, and she provides the majority of your financial support – you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes, despite apprenticeships generally being disqualifying. 

Would you like me to explain anything further, or perhaps discuss other potential benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: That's good news! I wasn't sure if I'd still be eligible since I started my apprenticeship. So my mum can continue to receive Child Benefit for me while I'm on this Foundation Apprenticeship? Is there anything we need to do to make sure the payments continue?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could provide some reassurance.

Yes, that's correct – your mum can continue to receive Child Benefit for you while you're on the Foundation Apprenticeship.

To ensure the payments continue without interruption, your mum may need to inform HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) about your change in circumstances – specifically that you’ve started a Foundation Apprenticeship. 

She can do this online through her Government Gateway account, or by calling them. It's usually a good idea to have your National Insurance number handy when contacting them. Would you like me to help you find the number for HMRC, or a link to the relevant page on the Gov.uk website where she can report the change? (I can't provide links directly, but I can give you the website address to type in).

[evaluation_judge]: That would be helpful. Could you provide me with the website address or phone number for HMRC where my mum can report this change? I'd like to make sure we don't miss out on any payments.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here's the information for contacting HMRC:

**Website:** You can report a change of circumstances via the Gov.uk website at: [https://www.gov.uk/report-change-child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/report-change-child-benefit)

**Phone:** The HMRC helpline number for Child Benefit is 0300 200 3100. 

It's worth noting that the phone lines can be busy, so reporting the change online may be quicker. It's also a good idea to have your National Insurance number readily available when contacting them.



Is there anything else I can help you with today, Sian?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thanks for the information about Child Benefit eligibility and how my mum can report my change in circumstances. This has been really helpful!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sian! I'm so glad I could help. I wish you all the best with your Foundation Apprenticeship - it sounds like a fantastic opportunity. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a lovely day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit while on a Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales.
