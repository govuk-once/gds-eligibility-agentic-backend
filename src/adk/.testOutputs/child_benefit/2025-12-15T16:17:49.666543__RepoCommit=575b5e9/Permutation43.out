[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Callum and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Callum, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a particular benefit, could you tell me your age?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And where in the UK do you live?

[evaluation_judge]: I live in Glasgow, Scotland with my father.

[root_agent]: Thanks. Are you currently in full-time non-advanced education? (For example, A-levels or equivalent)

[evaluation_judge]: No, I've actually just started a Modern Apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. Is this apprenticeship an approved training scheme?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure what you mean by "approved training scheme." It's just a regular Modern Apprenticeship program in Scotland. I get paid while I work and learn.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Generally, in Scotland, you can't receive Child Benefit while undertaking a Modern Apprenticeship. I understand you're 17 and living with your father - this rule applies regardless of whether you're paid.

Therefore, based on the information you've given me, it appears you are **not eligible** for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense. Thank you for letting me know. No other questions from me right now.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit as a 17-year-old on a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, which aligns with the expected outcome.
