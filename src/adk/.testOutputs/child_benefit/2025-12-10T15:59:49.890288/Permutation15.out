[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay a UK resident in the described situation to test the benefits eligibility agent. I'll take on Mike's persona who lives apart from his 12-year-old daughter and contributes £10/week to her upkeep.

[root_agent]: Okay, Mike. Thanks for explaining your situation. To help me understand your circumstances better, could you tell me – is the applicant (that’s you) responsible for Emma?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe I am responsible for her. I send her a birthday present every year and I transfer £10 a week to her mother to help with food costs. Her mother doesn't claim Child Benefit for Emma, so I was hoping I could claim it since I do contribute financially.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you feel you are responsible for Emma. I appreciate you explaining the financial contributions you make.

Just to be completely sure, could you tell me – how old is Emma?

[evaluation_judge]: Emma is 12 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, Emma is 12 years old. Thank you.

To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me, does Emma live with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Emma doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother, but as I mentioned, I send £10 a week to help with food costs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Emma doesn’t live with you. 

Just to double-check, is Emma currently receiving any other form of financial support from anyone else, such as from her mother or another family member?

[evaluation_judge]: As far as I know, Emma's mother supports her financially as her primary caregiver, but she doesn't claim Child Benefit for Emma. That's why I was wondering if I could claim it instead.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for providing that information.

To help me determine your eligibility, could you tell me – do you currently work or receive any regular income?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do work. I have a full-time job, which is how I'm able to send the £10 per week to help with Emma's food costs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your full-time job. That’s helpful.

Now, I need to ask you a direct question about your contributions. To be considered "responsible" when the child doesn’t live with you, you must contribute to their upkeep by *at least* the same amount as the Child Benefit payment – which is currently £26.05 per week.

Considering your current contribution of £10 per week, would you agree that it’s below the required minimum?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's true. My contribution is £10 per week, which is below the £26.05 amount you mentioned. I didn't realize there was a minimum contribution requirement to be considered responsible when the child lives elsewhere.

[root_agent]: Thank you for acknowledging that.

Based on the information we’ve discussed, and particularly the requirement to contribute at least £26.05 per week to be considered responsible for Emma when she doesn’t live with you, I need to let you know that you are currently not eligible for Child Benefit.

Do you have any questions about this decision?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. So to be eligible for Child Benefit when the child doesn't live with me, I would need to contribute at least £26.05 per week to Emma's upkeep, which is the same as the Child Benefit payment amount. Since I'm only sending £10 weekly, I don't qualify. 

Do you know if I were to increase my weekly contribution to at least £26.05, would I then become eligible to claim Child Benefit?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Mike.

Yes, if you were to increase your weekly contribution to at least £26.05, you *would* then become eligible to claim Child Benefit, provided you meet all other eligibility criteria – such as residency requirements and not claiming benefits that would affect your entitlement.

Would you like me to point you to the official government website that outlines all the Child Benefit eligibility requirements, just for reference?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful. If you could point me to the official government website with all the Child Benefit eligibility requirements, I'd appreciate that. I might consider increasing my contributions to Emma if it would make me eligible.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here’s the link to the official government website outlining the Child Benefit eligibility requirements: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)

I hope this helps! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit. The agent accurately explained that to be considered "responsible" when the child doesn't live with me, I must contribute at least £26.05/week (the Child Benefit amount), and since I only contribute £10/week, I don't qualify.
