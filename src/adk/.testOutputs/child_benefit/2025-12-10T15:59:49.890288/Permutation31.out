[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Sarah, a 45-year-old mother whose 18-year-old daughter Emma has just started university. I'll interact with the benefits advisor agent to test whether they correctly determine my eligibility for Child Benefit.

I'll begin the conversation and then evaluate whether the agent correctly identifies that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since my daughter has started advanced education (university degree).

Hello, I'm Sarah. I wanted to check if I can continue claiming Child Benefit for my daughter Emma. She's 18 and has just started her first year at university, studying for a Bachelor's degree. She's still living at home with me and commutes to classes.

[root_agent]: Okay, Sarah. Thank you for contacting me. To start, could you tell me, is the child under 20?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Emma is 18 years old. She just turned 18 a few months ago.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And to confirm, is the education she’s receiving “Approved Education” or “Advanced Education”?

[evaluation_judge]: She's started a Bachelor's degree at university. She just began her first year of a 3-year program.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So, she’s undertaking “Advanced Education” – a university degree. Just to be clear, does Emma live with you at home?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Emma still lives at home with me. She commutes to the university each day rather than living in student accommodation.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for confirming that. Based on this information, I’m afraid I need to inform you that you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit ceases when a child starts ‘advanced’ education, such as a university degree.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So I can't get Child Benefit anymore because Emma has started university? I wasn't aware that it would stop once she began her degree.

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct. The rules state that Child Benefit stops when a child begins “advanced” education – which includes university degrees. I understand this might be unexpected. Would you like me to point you to the official guidance on the Child Benefit website, just so you can see the specific criteria?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter has started advanced education (university degree), which matches the expected outcome.
