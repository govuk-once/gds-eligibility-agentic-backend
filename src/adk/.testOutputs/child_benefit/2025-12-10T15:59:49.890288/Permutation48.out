[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a user to test the benefits eligibility agent based on this scenario about Emily, an 18-year-old who has finished A-Levels and is now studying for a Higher National Certificate (HNC) at a local college. I'll determine if the agent correctly identifies that she is not eligible for Child Benefit due to pursuing advanced education.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s start with the first question.

Could you tell me if Emily is under 16 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Emily is 18 years old. She's just finished her A-Levels and has started a Higher National Certificate course at our local college.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now, to confirm, is she currently studying at a university?

[evaluation_judge]: No, she's not at a university. She's studying at our local college for her Higher National Certificate.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful.

Let’s move on to the next question. Is the HNC course considered ‘advanced’ education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the HNC is considered advanced education. It's a level 4 qualification, above A-Level standard.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Just one more question for now – could you tell me if Emily is in paid employment?

[evaluation_judge]: She's just focusing on her studies right now. She doesn't have any paid employment at the moment.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that Emily is 18, not at university, studying an ‘advanced’ course, and not in paid employment – it appears she is not eligible for Child Benefit. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Based on the information you've provided, Emily is not eligible for Child Benefit because she is studying an advanced course (HNC is considered advanced education as it's a Level 4 qualification). Child Benefit is only available for children under 16 or young people under 20 who are in approved, non-advanced education (up to Level 3/A-Level standard).

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. I’m glad we were able to determine her eligibility based on the information provided.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that Emily is not eligible for Child Benefit because she is pursuing an advanced education course (HNC/Level 4), which exceeds the requirement that education be non-advanced (up to Level 3) to qualify for Child Benefit for someone over 16.
