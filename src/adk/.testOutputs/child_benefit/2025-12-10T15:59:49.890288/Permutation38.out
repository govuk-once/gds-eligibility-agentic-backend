[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Tom, a new parent who just had a baby 4 months ago, and I'll interact with the agent who's providing information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll specifically be concerned about whether we can receive Child Benefit for all 4 months since birth.

Let me wait for the agent to respond, and I'll engage in conversation until they provide an eligibility outcome. Then I'll evaluate whether their response matches the expected outcome that we're eligible but can only receive payments backdated for 3 months (losing the first month's payment).

[root_agent]: Hello Tom, it’s good to speak with you. To help me determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you tell me – was the child eligible for Child Benefit during the past 4 months?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, our baby was born 4 months ago, so they've been eligible since birth. My wife Jerry and I just haven't had the chance to fill out the Child Benefit form until now with all the chaos of being new parents. We're wondering if we've lost any money by not applying right away.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that the child was eligible from birth. Just to confirm, how far back can a new claim go for Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: That's actually what I'm asking you about. We had our baby 4 months ago but only getting around to applying now. We'd like to know if we can still get Child Benefit for all those 4 months we've missed, or if we've lost some of that money by not applying right away.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Child Benefit can be backdated up to 3 months.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh I see. So does that mean we can get payments for 3 out of the 4 months since our baby was born? Have we lost the money for that first month?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct. Child Benefit can be backdated up to 3 months. So, you would be eligible for payments for the last three months since your child’s birth, but you would unfortunately lose the money for that first month.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So we'll get payments for the most recent 3 months but not for that first month after our baby was born. That's disappointing, but at least we'll get most of it. Thank you for clarifying.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed that Child Benefit can only be backdated up to 3 months, meaning we're eligible for the last three months but lose the payment for the first month since birth. This matches the expected outcome.
