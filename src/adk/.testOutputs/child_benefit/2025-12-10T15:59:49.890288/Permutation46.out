[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Hans, a 30-year-old with Pre-Settled Status who has been claiming Child Benefit as a "Jobseeker" for 95 days with no imminent job offer.

Hello, I'm Hans. I've been in the UK for a while now with Pre-Settled Status. I've been unemployed and claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker for about 95 days. I'm still looking for work but don't have any concrete job offers yet. I just wanted to check if my Child Benefit is still valid in my current situation.

[root_agent]: Hello Hans, thank you for reaching out. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me, are Pre-Settled Status holders allowed to claim Child Benefit as a jobseeker?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe so. That's why I've been claiming Child Benefit for the past 95 days as a jobseeker with my Pre-Settled Status. I'm actively looking for work, but it's been difficult to find something so far. I just want to make sure I'm still eligible to continue receiving this benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. To clarify, you’ve been claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker for 95 days with Pre-Settled Status. Just to be absolutely certain, is there a limit to how long you can claim in this jobseeker status?

[evaluation_judge]: To be honest, I'm not entirely sure if there's a limit. That's partly why I'm checking with you now. I've been claiming for 95 days while looking for work, but nobody has mentioned any time limits to me before. Is there some kind of restriction I should know about?

[root_agent]: You’re right to ask. Yes, there is a limit. You can claim as a jobseeker for 91 days. After that, unless you have a genuine prospect of work – meaning a job offer – or other resources, your right to reside for benefit purposes often expires.

Do you currently have a job offer, or any other resources to support you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, unfortunately I don't have a job offer at the moment. I've been applying to various positions but haven't received any concrete offers yet. And no, I don't have other significant resources to support myself - that's why the Child Benefit has been important for me. So I've already passed the 91-day limit by 4 days now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Since you’ve now exceeded the 91-day jobseeker limit and don't have a job offer or other resources, it appears you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit as a jobseeker.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit since I've passed the 91-day limit as a jobseeker. That's disappointing but I understand. Is there anything I should do about this situation? Do I need to inform someone officially or will the benefit just stop automatically?

[root_agent]: That’s a good question. Generally, the Child Benefit will stop automatically after you’ve exceeded the 91-day jobseeker limit without a job offer. However, it’s always best to inform the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) about your situation. They can confirm the cessation date and explain any further steps you might need to take.

Do you currently have an account with the DWP, or would you like me to provide you with information on how to contact them?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have an account with the DWP from when I first applied for the benefits. I'll make sure to contact them and let them know about my situation. One last question - if I do get a job offer in the near future, would I be able to reapply for Child Benefit, or would I need to wait for some period of time?

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear that you have an existing account with the DWP. Yes, if you were to receive a job offer, you would typically be able to reapply for Child Benefit. However, you’d likely need to demonstrate that you are no longer actively seeking employment. 

Generally, you can apply for Child Benefit again once you’ve been employed for a certain period – usually 3 months. Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official guidance on re-applying for Child Benefit after employment?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit as I've exceeded the 91-day limit as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status and have no job offer or other resources.
