[evaluation_judge]: I'll assume the role of a UK resident named Hannah with a son who is receiving treatment abroad. I'll interact with the benefits agent to see if they correctly determine my Child Benefit eligibility in this specific situation.

I'll wait for the other agent to start the conversation, and then engage with them about my situation with my son Oliver who is receiving hospital treatment in the USA. After our conversation concludes, I'll evaluate whether they correctly identified that I remain eligible for Child Benefit despite Oliver being hospitalized abroad for more than 12 weeks, since he went abroad specifically for treatment and I continue to provide financial support.

[root_agent]: Hello Hannah, it’s good to speak with you. I understand your son, Oliver, is receiving treatment in the USA. To start, can you confirm whether Oliver has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Oliver has been in a specialist hospital in the USA for 15 weeks now. It's been difficult with him being so far away, but they have specialists there who can treat his rare condition.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Hannah. I appreciate you sharing that information. Now, I need to ask – did Oliver go specifically to the USA for this hospital treatment, or did he travel there incidentally?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he was specifically sent to the USA for this hospital treatment. His condition is quite rare, and his NHS doctors referred him to specialists at this hospital in America because they have more experience with his condition. He wouldn't be there otherwise - we only went abroad for this specific treatment.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that, Hannah. That’s very helpful. Just to be clear, you’re confirming that Oliver travelled to the USA solely for this hospital treatment, and wouldn’t be there if not for this specific medical need?

[evaluation_judge]: That's exactly right. Oliver was referred specifically to this hospital in the USA because they specialize in his rare condition. The only reason he's in America is for this treatment. He wouldn't be there otherwise.

[root_agent]: Alright, Hannah. Thank you for confirming that so clearly. Based on what you've told me – that Oliver travelled to the USA specifically for hospital treatment due to his rare condition, and you’re continuing to provide financial support – it seems you remain eligible for Child Benefit. Is there anything else regarding your situation that you’d like to discuss?

[evaluation_judge]: That's a relief to hear that I remain eligible. I was worried that because he's been away for more than 12 weeks, I might lose the benefit. It's been challenging financially to cover his incidental costs and my visits to the USA, so the Child Benefit really helps. I don't have any other questions about this at the moment. Thank you for clarifying my eligibility status.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Hannah. I’m glad I could clarify that for you. It sounds like Child Benefit is a significant support for you both. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know today. I'm just relieved to hear that I can continue receiving Child Benefit while Oliver is getting his treatment abroad. Thank you for your help.

[root_agent]: You’re most welcome, Hannah. I’m happy I could help. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I remain eligible for Child Benefit despite my son being hospitalized abroad for more than 12 weeks. They properly applied the international exception rule which states that eligibility continues when a child goes abroad specifically for hospital treatment and the parent continues to provide financial support.
