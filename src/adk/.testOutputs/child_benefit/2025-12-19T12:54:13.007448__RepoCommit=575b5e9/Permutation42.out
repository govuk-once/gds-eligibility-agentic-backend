[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sian, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And where in the UK do you live?

[evaluation_judge]: I live in Cardiff, Wales with my mother.

[root_agent]: Thanks Sian. Are you currently in full-time non-advanced education? (For example, A-levels or equivalent)?

[evaluation_judge]: I've actually left school and I've started a Foundation Apprenticeship that's funded by the Welsh Government.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Could you tell me if this Foundation Apprenticeship is your only source of income currently?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the apprenticeship is my only source of income right now.

[root_agent]: Thank you. To clarify, is this Foundation Apprenticeship a requirement of you staying in education, or is it a work-based learning programme?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a work-based learning programme funded by the Welsh Government. I've left school to do this apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Just to confirm, does your mother provide you with financial support?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I still live with my mother and she supports me financially alongside what I earn from my apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know. Finally, is anyone else financially responsible for you, besides your mother?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's just my mother who is financially responsible for me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for answering all of my questions, Sian. Based on the information you've provided – being 17, living in Wales, completing a Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government, and being financially supported by your mother – you are likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes, despite generally apprenticeships disqualifying someone from receiving it.



Do you have any other questions for me?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! So my mother can continue to receive Child Benefit for me while I'm doing this Welsh Foundation Apprenticeship? I was a bit worried because I know apprenticeships sometimes affect benefits.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome! Yes, that's correct. Your mother can continue to receive Child Benefit for you while you're doing your Welsh Foundation Apprenticeship. You were right to check, as apprenticeships *can* affect benefits, but the Welsh Government-funded Foundation Apprenticeships are specifically an exception to that rule.

I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining it so clearly!

✓ The agent provided the correct outcome that I am eligible for Child Benefit because Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes, unlike regular apprenticeships which would typically disqualify someone.
