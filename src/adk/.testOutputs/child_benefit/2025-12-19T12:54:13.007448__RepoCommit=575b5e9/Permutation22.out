[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jenny and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Jenny, I'm happy to help! To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?

[evaluation_judge]: My son Arthur is 7 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Jenny. And is Arthur currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, Arthur is actually in the hospital right now. He was in the hospital for 10 weeks, then came home for about 2 weeks, but then fell ill again and had to go back to the hospital. He's been back in hospital for 3 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Jenny. Has Arthur been in hospital continuously for more than 12 weeks in total, including both stays?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, if you add up both hospital stays, it's been 13 weeks total - 10 weeks for the first stay and 3 weeks for the current stay.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that, Jenny. And to clarify, when Arthur was discharged from the hospital the first time, did he return to the hospital within 28 days?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he was only home for 15 days before he had to go back to the hospital.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Jenny. Just to be clear, are you currently paying for Arthur's daily living costs while he is in hospital, such as food or clothing?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the hospital is providing everything he needs right now.

[root_agent]: Okay, Jenny. Based on the information you've provided – Arthur being in hospital for a cumulative total of 13 weeks, returning to hospital within 28 days of his first discharge, and the hospital covering his daily living costs – it appears you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. This is due to the rules around a child being in hospital for more than 12 weeks and the 'linking rule' applying when a child is readmitted within 28 days.

I hope this information is helpful, even if it's not the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit because Arthur has been in the hospital for more than 12 weeks in total and he went back within that 28-day period. That's disappointing but thank you for explaining it to me.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit based on the hospital "linking rule" since my child has been in hospital for a cumulative 13 weeks (exceeding the 12-week limit) and was readmitted within 28 days.
