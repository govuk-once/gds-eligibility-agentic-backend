[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jessica and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Jessica, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm trying to find out if I'm eligible for Child Benefit for my son Liam, who's 18 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that's helpful. Is Liam currently in approved full-time education or an approved apprenticeship?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's currently studying for his A-levels at sixth form college.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Is Liam financially dependent on you, or does he have an income of his own?

[evaluation_judge]: He is financially dependent on me in terms of housing and many expenses, but he has recently started receiving Universal Credit in his own right to help with his personal living costs. He's estranged from his father.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, the Universal Credit Liam is receiving is claimed *by him*, in his own right, and not as part of a joint claim with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Liam claims the Universal Credit himself, in his own right. It's his own separate claim, not part of any joint claim with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided, as Liam is 18 years old, in full-time education, and receiving Universal Credit in his own right, you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit. Receiving Universal Credit typically stops Child Benefit payments.



I hope this information is helpful, despite the outcome. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my son Liam receives Universal Credit in his own right, which disqualifies him from Child Benefit eligibility even though he is in approved education and I am responsible for him.
