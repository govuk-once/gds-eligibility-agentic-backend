Hi, i'm Gary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Gary, it's good to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 50 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. And could you tell me if you have any children who live with you?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a son named Ben who lives with me. He's 17.

[root_agent]: Thanks Gary. Is Ben currently in any form of education, such as school, college, or an apprenticeship?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he left school in June and hasn't gone to college. He's registered with the local youth careers service and is actively looking for an apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Gary. Just to confirm, is Ben still within 20 weeks of having left school?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's currently August, so it's only been a couple of months since he left school in June.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know. Are you responsible for Ben financially?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm fully responsible for him. He lives with me and I support him financially.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. Finally, to help me assess your eligibility, could you confirm you normally live in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, we live in the UK permanently.

[root_agent]: Thank you for answering my questions, Gary. Based on the information you've provided, you are likely eligible for Child Benefit for Ben, but this would be for a limited period.

Because Ben is 17 and has left education, but is registered with the youth careers service and actively seeking an apprenticeship, you may be able to continue receiving Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks after he left school. 

Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this in more detail. I'd like to understand exactly how this works.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Gary. Normally, Child Benefit stops when a child turns 16. However, there's an extension to this if the child is aged 16 or 17 and has been in approved education or training.

Because Ben left school in June and is actively seeking an apprenticeship – and importantly, is registered with a qualifying careers service – you can continue to claim Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when he left school. As it is currently August, you are still within that 20-week period.

After this 20-week extension, the Child Benefit will stop, unless Ben returns to approved education or training.

Does that make things a bit clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense now. So I can continue to claim Child Benefit for Ben during this transition period while he's looking for an apprenticeship, but only for up to 20 weeks from when he left school in June. And if he doesn't start an apprenticeship or other education by then, the benefit will stop. Is that right?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Gary! Yes, that's exactly right. You can claim Child Benefit for Ben for up to 20 weeks from when he left school in June, while he's actively looking for an apprenticeship. If he doesn't start an apprenticeship or other approved education or training within those 20 weeks, the benefit will unfortunately stop.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on where to find more details, or other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks due to Ben being 17, having left education, and being registered with a qualifying careers service during the extension period.
