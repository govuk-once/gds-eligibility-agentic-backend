[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your eligibility, could you please tell me how old your child is?

[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Emma is 18 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sarah. And is Emma currently in education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she is. She just started a 3-year Bachelor's degree at university. She still lives at home with me and commutes to the university.

[root_agent]: Thanks for that information, Sarah. To clarify, would you describe Emma's education as "Approved Education" (like A-Levels or NVQ Level 3) or "Advanced Education" (like a university degree or BTEC Higher National)?

[evaluation_judge]: She's in Advanced Education - she's doing a Bachelor's degree at university.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Sarah. Based on the information you’ve provided, as Emma is over 16 and undertaking advanced education (a university degree), you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit. 

Child Benefit typically stops when a child starts advanced education. I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So I can't get Child Benefit anymore now that Emma's at university? Is there any other financial help I could look into?

[root_agent]: You are correct, Sarah. Child Benefit would no longer be payable while Emma is in advanced education like a university degree.

While I can only assess eligibility for Child Benefit, there are other forms of financial support you might be able to explore. However, these are separate from Child Benefit and I'm not equipped to advise on them directly. You could look into options like:

* **Student Finance:** Emma may be eligible for student loans and grants to help with her university costs.
* **Universal Credit:** Depending on your income and circumstances, you might be able to claim Universal Credit.
* **Support for Parents:** There are some schemes offering help with childcare costs, though these usually apply if Emma were still in approved education.

I recommend visiting the gov.uk website and searching for "financial help for families" or contacting Citizens Advice for more tailored guidance. Would you like me to confirm any of the details we've discussed today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's okay. Thank you for explaining about the Child Benefit. I'll look into those other options you mentioned.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah. I'm glad I could clarify the situation with Child Benefit. I hope you find some helpful support through the other options available. 

If you have any other questions in the future, don’t hesitate to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter is pursuing advanced education (university degree) even though she is 18 and lives at home. This aligns with the expected outcome in the scenario.
