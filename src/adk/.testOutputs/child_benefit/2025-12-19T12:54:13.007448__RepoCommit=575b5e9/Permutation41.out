[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Martin and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Martin, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me how old your children are?

[evaluation_judge]: I have two children, Ben who is 10 and Jerry who is 8. They live with my ex-partner, but I contribute £40 per week toward their care.

[root_agent]: Thanks for that information, Martin. Do you have sole responsibility for your children, or do you share that responsibility with your ex-partner?

[evaluation_judge]: I share responsibility with my ex-partner. The children live with her, but I contribute financially and see them regularly.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know. Roughly what percentage of the time do the children spend living with you, compared to your ex-partner? (An estimate is fine).

[evaluation_judge]: They primarily live with my ex-partner. I'd say they're with me maybe 2-3 weekends a month, so probably around 20-25% of the time.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Martin. Are you currently receiving any Child Benefit payments for Ben and Jerry?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not receiving any Child Benefit payments at the moment. My ex-partner receives the Child Benefit for them.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Just to confirm, your ex-partner is currently claiming Child Benefit for both Ben and Jerry?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. She claims Child Benefit for both of them.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Martin. And you mentioned you contribute £40 per week towards their care. Is this £40 split equally between Ben and Jerry, or do you contribute different amounts for each child?

[evaluation_judge]: I just contribute £40 total each week. I haven't specifically designated how much is for each child - I just pay that amount to my ex-partner for their care.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that clarification. Would you be interested in exploring whether you could claim any Child Benefit yourself, even though your ex-partner is already claiming it for the children? It might involve requesting HMRC to consider an unequal split of your contribution.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly what I'm interested in. I'd like to know if I can claim any Child Benefit even though my ex-partner already receives it. I didn't know there was an option for an unequal split of my contribution.

[root_agent]: Great. HMRC usually splits contributions equally when assessing eligibility. However, you can ask them to consider an unequal split. If we were to request that £26.05 of your £40 weekly contribution be allocated to Ben, and the remaining £13.95 to Jerry, would that accurately reflect how you intend your contributions to be used?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that sounds like a good approach. I'm happy to request that £26.05 of my contribution be allocated to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry if that would help with my eligibility for Child Benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, Martin. Based on that allocation, it looks like you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ben, as your contribution of £26.05 would meet the weekly amount. However, with £13.95 allocated to Jerry, you wouldn't currently meet the eligibility requirements for him. 

Does this sound like an acceptable outcome for you, claiming for Ben but not Jerry, or would you like me to explore other scenarios?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that sounds like an acceptable outcome to me. Being able to claim for Ben would be better than not being able to claim for either of them. How do I go about setting up this unequal split and making the claim?

[root_agent]: That's good to hear, Martin. To set up the unequal split and make the claim, you'll need to contact HMRC directly. Unfortunately, I’m not able to make the claim *for* you, or provide a direct link to the form, but I can explain the process. 

You will need to explain to HMRC that you contribute financially to the children's care and request that they consider allocating £26.05 of your £40 weekly contribution to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry. They may ask for evidence of your payments.

The best way to contact HMRC is through their general enquiries helpline. Do you need me to find the phone number for that for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please provide me with the HMRC general enquiries helpline number? That would be helpful. And just to confirm, I should specifically request that my contributions be split unequally when I call them, correct?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Martin. The HMRC general enquiries helpline number is 0300 200 3300.

And yes, absolutely correct. When you call, be sure to specifically request that they consider an unequal split of your contribution – £26.05 for Ben and £13.95 for Jerry – and explain that this reflects how you intend your payments to be allocated. This is key to potentially being eligible for Child Benefit for Ben.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great, thank you. I'll give them a call at that number and request the unequal split as you've suggested. I think that covers everything I needed to know. I appreciate your help in explaining my options.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Martin! I'm glad I could help clarify your options. I wish you the best of luck with your call to HMRC. If you have any further questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I could be eligible for Child Benefit for Ben (but not Jerry) by requesting HMRC consider an unequal split of my £40 contribution (£26.05 to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry), which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
