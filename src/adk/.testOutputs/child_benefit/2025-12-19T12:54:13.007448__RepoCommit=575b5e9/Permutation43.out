[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Callum and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Callum, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation and whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks. And are you currently in full-time non-advanced education? (For example, A-levels or equivalent)

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not in full-time education. I've recently started a Modern Apprenticeship in Glasgow.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Is this a formally approved training scheme?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland - it's a government-recognized program where I work and learn at the same time. I get paid while working towards a qualification.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information available, apprenticeships in Scotland generally mean you wouldn’t be eligible for Child Benefit. However, to confirm, could you tell me if you are receiving any wages for this apprenticeship?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do receive wages from my apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Unfortunately, as you are 17 years old and undertaking a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland while receiving wages, you are not eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit as a 17-year-old on a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, which aligns with the expected outcome.
