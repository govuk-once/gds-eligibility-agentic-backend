[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a user named Raj who is checking eligibility for Child Benefit for his son who has just turned 20 while studying A-levels.

Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Raj, thank you for reaching out. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me the age of the child you are claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi, yes I'm claiming for my son Dev. He just had his birthday last week - he's 20 years old now. He's currently studying full-time for his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Raj.

Is Dev in approved full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's in approved full-time education. He's studying for his A-levels at the local college. He's in his final year now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Raj. 

Just to clarify, when Dev turned 20, was he *already* in approved full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. He was already studying for his A-levels when he turned 20 last week. He's been in this course since the beginning of the academic year - he's mid-way through the term now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for the clarification, Raj.

Based on the information you’ve provided, unfortunately, Dev is no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Eligibility ceases when a child turns 20, even if they are still in full-time education.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. So even though he's still studying, the fact that he's turned 20 means I can't claim Child Benefit for him anymore. That's disappointing but I understand. No further questions for now, thank you for explaining it to me.

✓ The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit eligibility ceases when a child turns 20, even if they are still in approved education. This matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible" as stated in the scenario.
