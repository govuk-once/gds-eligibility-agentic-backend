[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a user seeking benefits information based on this scenario.

Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Tom, I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tom. And are you currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm taking a computer coding course right now. My future employer is paying for the course fees as part of an agreement that I'll join them after I complete it. I'm not getting paid while I study though.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Tom. Is this computer coding course an approved educational course?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure what you mean by "approved." It's a computer coding course that my future employer is paying for. They've agreed to hire me once I complete it. It's part of our arrangement.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. To be clear, is this course being funded by your employer as part of a training agreement for a future job? In other words, is it a course "with an employer’s agreement - for example, to get a job"?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. My future employer is funding the course as part of our agreement that I'll work for them after I complete it. They're paying the course fees, and I'll join their company once I finish the training.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Tom. Based on the information you've provided, and the rules around education eligibility for benefits, it appears that your course wouldn't be considered approved education for the purposes of eligibility. 

To be absolutely sure, are you receiving any form of payment during this course, even if it’s not a regular wage?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not receiving any form of payment during the course. They're just covering the course fees, but I'm not getting any wages or other payments while I'm studying.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Tom. Based on the information you’ve given me – that you are 17, in full-time education on a course funded by a future employer as part of a job agreement, and not receiving any payment – it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit. They recognized that education with an employer's agreement to get a job is not considered approved education for benefit purposes, which matches the expected outcome.
