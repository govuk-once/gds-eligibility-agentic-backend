[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to speak with you. I can certainly help you with that.

To start, could you please tell me if you are responsible for a child?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am responsible for my son Leo. He's 8 years old and lives with me and my husband Tom.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know, thank you. 

Next, is Leo currently under 16 years old, or under 20 and in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Leo is 8 years old. He's in primary school.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Are you and your husband ordinarily resident in the UK, and do you both meet UK residency and immigration rules?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, we're both UK nationals living in Manchester. We've always lived in the UK.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And to confirm, does Leo live with you and your husband?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Leo lives with us full time in our home.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming.

Is Leo currently in hospital or in care for a period of more than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Leo isn't in hospital or care. He's living at home with us.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know. Finally, just to clarify, does either you or your husband have an individual adjusted net income over £60,000 per year?

[evaluation_judge]: No, neither of us earns that much. My husband Tom works as a teacher and earns about £35,000 per year, and I work part-time earning about £15,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Sarah. 

Based on everything you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why I'm eligible.

[root_agent]: Certainly. You're eligible for Child Benefit because:

*   You are responsible for Leo, your son.
*   Leo is under 16 years old.
*   You and your husband are UK nationals and ordinarily resident in the UK.
*   Leo lives with you.
*   Leo is not in hospital or care for a disqualifying period.
*   Neither you nor your husband’s individual income exceeds £60,000.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining my eligibility for Child Benefit.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit and accurately explained all the qualifying criteria that make me eligible.
