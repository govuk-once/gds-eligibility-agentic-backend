[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you evaluate this agent by role-playing as a person seeking benefit information.

Hi, i'm David and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi David, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?





[evaluation_judge]: My son Jack is 14 years old. I'm a single father and I'm trying to figure out if I'm still eligible for Child Benefit.

[root_agent]: Thank you, David. That's helpful to know.

Is your child currently living with you full-time?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Jack was placed in local authority care about 3 months ago, but he comes home to stay with me every weekend. He arrives Friday evening and stays until Sunday evening.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, David. That's important information.

Has Jack been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's been about 3 months now since he was placed in care.

[root_agent]: Thank you, David. And just to clarify, does Jack spend at least two nights in a row with you each week, or does he spend a total of 24 hours or more with you each week?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Jack spends every Friday and Saturday night with me each week. He arrives Friday evening and stays until Sunday evening, so that's definitely two nights in a row each week.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, David. 

Based on the information you've provided, despite Jack being in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, because he spends two nights in a row with you each week, you *are* likely still eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's good news. I wasn't sure if I'd still be eligible since he's been in care. So I can continue to receive the Child Benefit because he stays with me regularly on weekends?

[root_agent]: Yes, David, that's correct. Because Jack stays with you for two nights in a row each week – Friday and Saturday – this meets the exception to the usual rules regarding Child Benefit and children in care. You should be able to continue receiving it.

I'm glad I could provide some clarity for you. Is there anything else at all I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for the information about my Child Benefit eligibility.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit despite my son being in care for more than 8 weeks, because he spends two consecutive nights with me each weekend, which meets the exception criteria.
