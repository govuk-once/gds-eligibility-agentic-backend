[evaluation_judge]: I'll now role-play as Sophie, a 28-year-old single mother whose 6-year-old son Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother while Sophie recovers from surgery. I'll interact with the benefits agent to determine my Child Benefit eligibility.

Hello, I'm Sophie. I'm currently recovering from surgery, and my 6-year-old son Noah has been staying with my mother (his grandmother) for the past few weeks. I'm wondering if I'm still eligible to receive Child Benefit while he's temporarily away from home?

[root_agent]: Hello Sophie, thank you for reaching out. I understand you’re concerned about your Child Benefit while Noah is staying with your mother.

To start, could you tell me, does the child live with the applicant?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, that's what I'm concerned about. Right now, Noah is staying with my mother while I recover from surgery. He's been there for about 6 weeks now. Normally he lives with me - I'm a single mother and he's always in my care, but this is a temporary situation because of my health. My mother isn't claiming any benefits for him - she's just helping out until I'm back on my feet.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Sophie.

Now, could you tell me, has the child been living elsewhere for more than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's only been about 6 weeks so far. He went to stay with my mother when I had my surgery, and the recovery has taken longer than I expected. But it hasn't been 8 weeks yet.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that.

Just to be clear, you mentioned he’s been living with your mother for approximately 6 weeks, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Noah has been staying with my mother for about 6 weeks now while I recover from surgery. It's a temporary arrangement.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming.

I want to double-check something. Do you live with Noah, as his primary caregiver?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am Noah's primary caregiver. I'm a single mother and he normally lives with me full-time. This current arrangement with my mother is just temporary while I recover from my surgery. As soon as I'm well enough, he'll be back home with me.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you’ve told me, you are Noah’s primary caregiver and he has been living with your mother for approximately 6 weeks.

Could you confirm whether your mother is claiming any benefits on Noah’s behalf?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my mother isn't claiming any benefits for Noah. She's just taking care of him temporarily as a favor to help me through my recovery. She hasn't applied for any benefits related to him.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

It seems we have all the necessary information. Based on the circumstances – you are Noah’s primary caregiver, he’s been living with your mother for less than 8 weeks, and your mother isn’t claiming any benefits – you are eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming that I'm still eligible for Child Benefit. That's a relief to hear. I was worried that since Noah isn't physically staying with me right now, I might have lost eligibility. I'm glad to know that the temporary arrangement with my mother won't affect my benefits, especially since it's been less than 8 weeks. This is very helpful information. I don't have any other questions right now.

[evaluation_judge]: The agent correctly determined that Sophie remains eligible for Child Benefit. The agent properly identified that:

1. Sophie is Noah's primary caregiver under normal circumstances
2. The current separation is temporary (less than 8 weeks)
3. Noah's grandmother is not claiming any benefits for him

This aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible" based on the UK Child Benefit rules that allow continued payments for up to 8 weeks when a child temporarily lives elsewhere, provided no one else makes a claim. The agent asked appropriate clarifying questions and arrived at the correct conclusion.
