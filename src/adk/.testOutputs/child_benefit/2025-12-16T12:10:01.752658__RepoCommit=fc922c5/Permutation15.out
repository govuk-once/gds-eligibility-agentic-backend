[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mike and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Mike, thank you for letting me know you're interested in exploring Child Benefit.

To start, can you tell me, are you currently the main carer for Emma?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my daughter Emma lives with her mother. She's 12 years old. I live separately from them.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that Emma lives with her mother and you live separately.

Just to be clear, you’re wanting to claim Child Benefit for Emma, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Her mother doesn't claim Child Benefit for her, and I was wondering if I could claim it instead.

[root_agent]: Okay, Mike. To help me determine your eligibility, could you tell me, are you responsible for Emma’s upkeep?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I send Emma a birthday present every year, and I transfer £10 a week to her mother to help with food and things Emma needs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. It’s good to know you’re contributing to Emma’s well-being.

Considering the Child Benefit criteria, to be considered “responsible” when the child doesn’t live with you, you must contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit payment, which is £26.05 per week. 

As you currently contribute £10 per week, would you say that £10 per week is enough to cover Emma’s needs?

[evaluation_judge]: I didn't realize there was a specific amount I needed to contribute. The £10 per week is what I can afford right now, and it's what her mother and I agreed on. Is that not enough to qualify for the Child Benefit?

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that, Mike. I understand you’ve established an agreement with Emma’s mother.

Based on the Child Benefit criteria, contributing at least £26.05 per week is necessary to be considered responsible for the child’s upkeep. Since your current contribution of £10 per week is less than this amount, I have to conclude that you are not eligible for Child Benefit at this time.

Do you have any questions about this decision, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So I would need to contribute at least £26.05 per week to be eligible? That's helpful to know. No other questions for now, thank you for explaining the eligibility requirements to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Mike! I’m glad I could clarify the requirements for you. If you have any other questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit because my contribution of £10/week falls below the required minimum of £26.05/week to be considered responsible for a child who doesn't live with you.
