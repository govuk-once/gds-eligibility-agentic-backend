[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Sarah, I understand you’re looking into Child Benefit.

To start, could you confirm for me, is Emma under 20 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Emma is 18 years old. She's just started university after finishing college.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that Emma is 18.

Now, I need to check the education criteria. Is Emma’s current education considered “Approved Education” or “Advanced Education”?

[evaluation_judge]: Emma has just started a 3-year Bachelor's degree at the university. She commutes there from home each day.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Given that Emma is pursuing a Bachelor’s degree at university, that falls under “Advanced Education”.

Based on this information, I can confirm that you are not eligible for Child Benefit. It stops when a child starts advanced education, such as a university degree. 

Do you have any other benefits you’d like to explore?

[evaluation_judge]: So you're saying I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore now that Emma has started university? I was receiving it while she was in college. Is there nothing available to help with her education costs now?

[root_agent]: You’re absolutely right to ask about that – it can be a significant change. Yes, Child Benefit does stop when a child starts advanced education like a university degree. 

I understand you’re concerned about Emma’s education costs. While I can’t advise on specific financial assistance, let’s explore some potential avenues. Would you like me to ask you about whether you’re entitled to Student Finance, or perhaps explore options like bursaries and scholarships available for university students?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would be interested in finding out about what financial help might be available for Emma during her university studies.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s start with Student Finance.

First, could you tell me, is Emma a UK resident?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Emma is a UK resident. We've always lived here.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, to help determine her eligibility for Student Finance, could you tell me what type of degree Emma is studying?

[evaluation_judge]: She's studying for a 3-year Bachelor's degree. It's her first university degree.

[root_agent]: Alright. And just to confirm, Emma is a UK resident and is pursuing her first university degree – a 3-year Bachelor’s.

To help me check the specific Student Finance options available to her, could you please tell me Emma’s date of birth?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly attempted to provide financial advice about Student Finance options after determining I was not eligible for Child Benefit, which goes beyond determining eligibility for the Child Benefit that was being discussed.
