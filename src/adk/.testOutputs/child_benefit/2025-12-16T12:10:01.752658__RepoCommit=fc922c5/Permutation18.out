[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know.  To help me determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you tell me: Is the child in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my son Dev is in approved education. He's studying full-time for his A-levels at the moment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now, to help me assess your situation further, could you tell me: Is the child under 20?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, actually Dev just celebrated his 20th birthday last month, in the middle of his term. He's still studying full-time for his A-levels though.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Given that Dev just turned 20, he is no longer eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, so the benefit stops once he turns 20? Even though he's still in education and finishing his A-levels?

[root_agent]: That’s correct. The rules state that Child Benefit eligibility ends once a child turns 20, regardless of whether they are still in education or finishing their studies.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's unfortunate, but I understand. So the benefit would have completely stopped on his 20th birthday last month?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s right. The benefit would have ceased on his 20th birthday last month.

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. Thank you for explaining that to me. I'll need to update my records since I wasn't aware the benefit would stop immediately on his birthday.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help clarify that for you.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not eligible once a child turns 20, even if they're still in approved education, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)."
