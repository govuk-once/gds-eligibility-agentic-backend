[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a UK resident seeking benefit information in the given scenario.

Hi, i'm Robert and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Robert, it’s nice to talk to you. I can certainly help you understand your eligibility for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you tell me, are you responsible for any children?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I have a 10-year-old son named Sam who lives with me. My ex-wife Tina and I recently divorced, and our daughter Ella who is 8 lives with her.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. So you are responsible for Sam, who is 10 years old, and your ex-wife Tina is responsible for Ella, who is 8. 

Just to be clear, are you currently living with Sam?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Sam lives with me full-time since the divorce, and Ella lives with Tina. We're both trying to take care of our children separately now.

[root_agent]: Right, I understand. Given that Sam lives with you and Ella lives with your ex-wife, Tina, it’s important to consider the rules around separated families. 

Could you tell me, do you believe you are the primary carer for Sam?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am definitely the primary carer for Sam. He lives with me full-time, and I'm responsible for all his daily needs, school matters, and everything else.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Robert. That’s very helpful.

Now, regarding the Child Benefit rates, it’s worth noting a specific rule for families who have separated. In situations like yours, where children live with different parents, *both* you and Tina are entitled to the full Child Benefit rate of £26.05 per week for the eldest child – which in your case is Sam. 

Would you agree with that understanding?

[evaluation_judge]: That sounds right, but to be honest, I wasn't totally sure how the benefit would work now that we're separated. So I'll get the higher rate for Sam, and Tina will get the higher rate for Ella? That's good news.

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Robert! You’ve got it exactly right. You will receive the full £26.05 weekly rate for Sam, and Tina will receive the full £26.05 weekly rate for Ella. It's designed to ensure both parents receive the appropriate amount considering their individual circumstances. 

Is there anything else about your eligibility for Child Benefit that you’d like me to clarify, or would you like me to confirm you meet the other criteria, such as residency requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that answers my main question. I just wanted to make sure I understood how it works since the divorce. I'm relieved to hear I'll get the full rate for Sam. I do live in the UK full-time, if that's what you mean by residency requirements. Is there anything else I need to know about claiming this benefit?

[root_agent]: That’s perfectly understandable, Robert. It’s good you’re relieved to have that clarified. 

Yes, you do meet the residency requirement – living in the UK full-time is essential for claiming Child Benefit. 

Regarding claiming the benefit, you’ll need to make a claim through the government website – [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit). You'll need to provide information about Sam, your National Insurance number, and bank details for the payment to be made. 

Do you want me to outline the key information you'll need when making your claim, such as the required documentation?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I'm all set. I can find that information on the website when I apply. I'm just happy to understand that I'll be eligible for the full rate for Sam, and that makes our situation a bit easier. Thanks for your help today.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Robert! I’m glad I could clarify things for you and provide some reassurance. It’s great to hear that understanding the full rate for Sam will make a positive difference. 

If you do have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, have a good day too!

✓ The agent correctly explained that both parents in a separated family with split custody are eligible for the higher "eldest child" rate (£26.05) for their respective children, which matches the expected outcome of "Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)."
