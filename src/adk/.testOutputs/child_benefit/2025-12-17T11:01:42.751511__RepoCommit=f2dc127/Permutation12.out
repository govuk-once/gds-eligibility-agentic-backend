[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jessica and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s start with the first question.

Could you tell me how many children live with you, Jessica?

[evaluation_judge]: I have one child living with me, my son Liam. He's 18 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Just to clarify, is Liam responsible for his own living costs, or does he receive financial support from you?

[evaluation_judge]: I provide him with a home and general family support, but he has started receiving Universal Credit recently to help with his personal living costs. He's still in school studying for his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that detail.

The government rules state that if a child starts receiving Universal Credit (or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right, Child Benefit payments will stop. 

Could you confirm that Liam is receiving Universal Credit to help with his personal living costs?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Liam is receiving Universal Credit to help with his personal living costs. He's 18 and still studying for his A-levels, but due to his circumstances, he made his own claim for Universal Credit and was approved.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears Liam receiving Universal Credit means you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is that an accurate understanding of the situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that sounds right. I didn't know that his Universal Credit claim would affect Child Benefit. He only started receiving it recently. So you're saying I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore because Liam gets Universal Credit?

[root_agent]: You’re welcome! Yes, that’s correct. The government’s rules state that Child Benefit stops if a child starts receiving Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance. 

It’s understandable to be surprised by that – it’s a specific rule. Do you want to explore whether there might be any other benefits you could apply for, considering Liam’s situation?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent correctly identified that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because my child receives Universal Credit. However, the agent failed to acknowledge that Child Benefit would have already stopped when Liam turned 18, unless he was in approved education (which he is). The agent should have noted that while 18-19 year olds in approved education can qualify for Child Benefit, this exception doesn't apply when they receive Universal Credit in their own right.
