[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jordan and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Just to confirm, you are Jordan, and you are 17 years old and not currently in approved education or training, and you haven't registered with a careers service or similar. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm 17. I finished my GCSEs last year, but I'm not in college or working at the moment. I haven't signed up with any careers service or anything like that. I live with my dad, Steve, if that matters.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Jordan. I appreciate you confirming that. Let’s move on to the next criterion.

Could you tell me, do you have any siblings?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any siblings. It's just me and my dad at home.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Just to be clear, you are 17 years old, you are not in approved education or training, you haven’t registered with a careers service, and you don’t have any siblings. And you live with your father, Steve.

Now, I need to ask you about your financial situation. Does your father, Steve, claim any benefits himself, such as Universal Credit or Employment Support Allowance?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not really sure what benefits my dad claims, to be honest. I know he works part-time, but I don't keep track of his finances or benefits. Should I ask him about that?

[root_agent]: That’s perfectly alright, Jordan. It’s completely understandable not to know those details.

Let’s focus on something else for now. To help me determine your eligibility, could you tell me – are there any children living with you who are under 16?

[evaluation_judge]: No, there are no children under 16 living with us. It's just me and my dad in the house.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Jordan. That’s helpful to know.

Just one more question regarding the children living with you – are there any children living with you who are currently receiving care or treatment in hospital or care?

[evaluation_judge]: No, there aren't any children living with us who are in hospital or care. Like I said, it's just me and my dad at home.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that.

So, to summarise, you are 17 years old, not in education or training, you don’t have any siblings, and there are no children under 16 or receiving care living with you or your father.

Based on this information, and using the guidelines from [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), you are **not eligible** for Child Benefit. The criteria state that Child Benefit is generally not available to those aged 16 or over who are not in approved education or training.

Do you understand this assessment, and would you like me to explain any part of it in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. So I'm too old for Child Benefit since I'm 17 and not in any education or training programs. That makes sense. I was just wondering if there were any benefits I might be eligible for. Thanks for explaining it clearly.

✗ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit, but failed to explain the extension eligibility criteria - that I could potentially qualify if I registered with a careers service or similar program.
