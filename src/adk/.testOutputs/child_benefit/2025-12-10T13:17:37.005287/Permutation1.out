[evaluation_judge]: I'll help test the agent by role-playing as Sarah, a mother seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll engage with the agent and evaluate if they correctly determine my eligibility based on the scenario provided.

As Sarah, I'll ask about Child Benefit for my family situation and continue the conversation until the agent provides an eligibility outcome. Then I'll assess whether their conclusion matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."

Let me know when the agent is ready, and I'll begin the conversation.

[root_agent]: Okay, I’m ready. Let’s begin.

First, could you tell me, is the child under 16, or under 20 and in approved education?
