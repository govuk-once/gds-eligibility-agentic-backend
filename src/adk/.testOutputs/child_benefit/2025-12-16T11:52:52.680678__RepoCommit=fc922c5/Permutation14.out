[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Sophie, a single mother whose child is temporarily staying with his grandmother while Sophie recovers from surgery. I'll engage with the agent to determine my eligibility for Child Benefit.

Hi, i'm Sophie and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Sophie, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me, does Noah live with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. Well, not at the moment actually. Noah is staying with his grandmother temporarily while I recover from surgery. He's been there for about 6 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Sophie. And to confirm, has Noah been living with his grandmother for more than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's been about 6 weeks so far. He's supposed to come back home to me once I'm fully recovered from my surgery.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Just to be clear, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Noah while he’s living with your grandmother, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: That's correct. My mother hasn't made any claims for Child Benefit while Noah is staying with her. She's just helping me out temporarily while I recover.

[root_agent]: Alright, Sophie. Based on what you’ve told me – that Noah is living with your grandmother and no one else is claiming Child Benefit – you are eligible for Child Benefit. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's a relief to hear I'm still eligible! No, I think that answers my question. I was worried that since Noah isn't physically living with me right now I might lose the benefit, but it sounds like I'm still covered. Thank you for the information.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Sophie! I’m glad I could clarify things for you. It’s understandable to be concerned, but you’re certainly covered. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions in the future.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I'm eligible for Child Benefit since my child has been away for less than 8 weeks and no one else is claiming the benefit, which matches the expected outcome.
