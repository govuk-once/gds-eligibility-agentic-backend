[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a user named Raj who's trying to understand his eligibility for Child Benefit for his son Dev.

Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Raj, it’s good to talk with you. To help me understand your situation, could you tell me, is Dev currently in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Dev is currently studying full-time for his A-levels. He's in his final year at the local college.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Now, could you confirm for me, is Dev under the age of 20?

[evaluation_judge]: Dev is actually 20 now. He just had his birthday last month, during the middle of his current term. He was 19 when he started this academic year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Raj. I appreciate the update. Given that Dev is now 20, it means he’s no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So you're saying I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore because Dev turned 20? Even though he's still completing his A-levels that he started when he was 19?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit upon a key point, Raj. Yes, that’s correct. The rules state that Child Benefit ceases to be paid once a child reaches the age of 20, regardless of whether they are still in education. I understand this may be disappointing, but I’m simply explaining how the system works based on the criteria I’ve been given.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So it doesn't matter that he's still finishing his course, the eligibility stops right on his 20th birthday. That's disappointing but I understand. Thank you for explaining that to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Raj. I’m glad I could clarify things for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or were you just hoping to confirm that aspect of Child Benefit eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since Dev turned 20, which matches the expected outcome. The agent correctly explained that eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday regardless of whether the child is still in education.
