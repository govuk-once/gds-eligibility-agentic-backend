[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Robert and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Robert. It’s good to speak with you. To start, can you tell me, are you responsible for a child?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am responsible for my son Sam who's 10. He lives with me since my ex-wife Tina and I divorced recently. We have another child, Ella who's 8, but she lives with her mother.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, just to clarify, who gets the higher “Eldest Child” rate (£26.05)?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure exactly what you mean. Sam is my eldest child and he lives with me. My ex-wife Tina has our daughter Ella living with her. Are you referring to Child Benefit? I'm trying to understand what benefits I'm eligible for as a single father.

[root_agent]: Yes, I’m referring to Child Benefit. Since you’re responsible for Sam, who is your eldest child living with you, and your ex-wife has Ella living with her, both you and Tina are entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for Sam. Is that correct so far?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Sam lives with me full-time. So I would get Child Benefit for him. But I think you might have misspoken - Sam is my only child living with me, not my eldest child living with me. My ex-wife Tina has Ella living with her.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Robert. That’s very important information. Just to be absolutely sure, are you responsible for a child?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am responsible for my son Sam who is 10 years old and lives with me full-time.

[root_agent]: Okay, Robert. Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you are responsible for Sam, who lives with you full-time – you are eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to explain anything further about the amount you might receive or the process for applying?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would like to know how much Child Benefit I would receive for Sam. And also, does it matter that he's technically the eldest child of our family, even though he's the only one living with me? I'm trying to understand if I get the higher "eldest child" rate or some other rate.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s address both of those questions. Regarding the amount you’ll receive, the exact amount of Child Benefit depends on your income. However, as a general guide, you can check the current rates and how they are calculated on the official government website: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit.

Now, about whether it matters that Sam is the eldest child – yes, it does. As we discussed previously, when families split up and children are living with different parents, each parent is entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for the child living in their household, regardless of whether they are the eldest. So, you would receive the higher “eldest child” rate for Sam. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So to confirm, I would receive the higher "eldest child" rate of £26.05 per week for Sam, even though he's the only child living with me? And my ex-wife Tina would also receive the same rate for Ella, even though she's technically the younger child in our family?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Robert. You would receive the higher “eldest child” rate of £26.05 per week for Sam, and your ex-wife Tina would also receive the same rate for Ella. It’s important that each parent receives the full rate for the child living in their home, regardless of their age relative to the other child. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit or any other benefits you might be interested in?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming. That's the information I was looking for - that I'd get the full "eldest child" rate for Sam, and Tina would also get the full rate for Ella. I don't have any other questions right now about benefits, but I appreciate your help.

✓ The agent correctly explained that both parents are eligible for the higher "eldest child" rate of £26.05 weekly when children are split between households after divorce, which matches the expected outcome.
