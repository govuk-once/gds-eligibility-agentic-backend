[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jessica and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Jessica, thank you for reaching out. To help me determine what benefits you might be eligible for, could you tell me, does Liam receive any other benefits besides Universal Credit?

[evaluation_judge]: Liam only receives Universal Credit. He's 18 and studying for his A-levels, but due to our circumstances, he was able to claim Universal Credit to help with his living costs.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Just to be absolutely clear, Liam only receives Universal Credit, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Liam only receives Universal Credit, nothing else.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, could you tell me, does Liam have any children?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Liam doesn't have any children. He's just 18 and focusing on his A-levels at the moment.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Just to confirm, Liam is 18 and studying for his A-levels and receives Universal Credit as a lone contributor, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Liam is 18, he's studying for his A-levels, and he receives Universal Credit on his own. He doesn't have any contact with his father, and I'm his mother. He lives with me but has his own Universal Credit claim.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Considering Liam receives Universal Credit and doesn’t have any children, it appears he is not eligible for Child Benefit. Is that an accurate understanding?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I think there might be some confusion. I'm asking about whether I can still get Child Benefit for Liam. He's my child who is 18 and in approved education (A-levels), but he gets Universal Credit himself. I want to know if I'm eligible to claim Child Benefit for him.

[root_agent]: I apologize for the misunderstanding. Thank you for clarifying. The criteria state that you stop getting Child Benefit if the child starts getting Universal Credit (or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right. Could you tell me, does Liam receive any other benefits in addition to Universal Credit?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Liam only receives Universal Credit, no other benefits.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – that Liam is 18, studying for his A-levels, receives Universal Credit, and doesn’t receive any other benefits – you are not eligible for Child Benefit. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: So I'm not eligible to receive Child Benefit for Liam because he gets Universal Credit himself? Is that why?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s exactly why. The rules state that if a child is receiving Universal Credit as a lone contributor, Child Benefit is no longer payable.

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. Thank you for explaining that I can't get Child Benefit for Liam because he receives Universal Credit himself.

✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since my son receives Universal Credit in his own right, which matches the expected outcome.
