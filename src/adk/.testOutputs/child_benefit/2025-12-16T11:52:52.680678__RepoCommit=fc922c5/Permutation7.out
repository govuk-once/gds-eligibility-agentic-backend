[evaluation_judge]: I'll now role-play as a user seeking benefit information based on the given scenario.

Hi, i'm David and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello David, it’s good to talk to you. To help me determine if you might be eligible, could you tell me, is the child, Jack, of eligible age for Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my son Jack is 14 years old. I'm wondering if I can still get Child Benefit for him though, since he's been in care for about 3 months now. But he does come home to stay with me every weekend from Friday evening until Sunday evening.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. To help me assess your situation fully, could you tell me, is the applicant – that’s you – responsible for Jack?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm still responsible for Jack. I'm his father. Even though he's in local authority care during the week, I'm still his parent and take care of him every weekend.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Just one more question to help me with my assessment – could you tell me, has Jack been in care for more than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's been in care for about 3 months now, so that's definitely more than 8 weeks.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And to help me fully understand, does Jack spend at least 2 nights in a row or 24 hours a week at your home?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he stays with me every weekend. He comes to my home on Friday evening and leaves on Sunday evening, so that's 2 nights in a row each weekend.

[root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for clarifying that. Based on your answers, it appears you might be eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to explain the reasoning behind this, or would you like me to provide you with some further information about the benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you explain the reasoning behind why I'm eligible? I was worried that because Jack has been in care for more than 8 weeks, I might not be eligible anymore.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Because Jack spends Friday and Saturday night at your home, which is two nights in a row, you are still entitled to Child Benefit, despite him being in local authority care for longer than 8 weeks. The exception to the usual 8-week rule applies in this situation.

[evaluation_judge]: That's a relief to hear. So even though he's been in care for over 8 weeks, the fact that he stays with me for two nights in a row each weekend means I can still receive Child Benefit. That's really helpful to know. Thank you for explaining that.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, David! I’m glad I could clarify that for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. Thanks for helping me understand my eligibility situation with the Child Benefit.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit despite Jack being in care for more than 8 weeks, due to the exception that he spends two consecutive nights with me each weekend. This matches the expected "Eligible (via Exception)" outcome in the scenario.
