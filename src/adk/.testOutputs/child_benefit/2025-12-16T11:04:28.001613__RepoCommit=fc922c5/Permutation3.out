[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by roleplaying as a person in this scenario to test the benefits eligibility agent. I'll be Gary, seeking information about benefits for his son Ben.

Hi, i'm Gary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, Gary. I’m happy to help you with that. To start, could you tell me, are you responsible for Ben?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm responsible for Ben. He lives with me full-time.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. And how old is Ben currently?

[evaluation_judge]: Ben is 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, Ben is 17. And has he been in any kind of formal education – like school or college – recently?

[evaluation_judge]: Ben left school in June this year. He didn't go on to college, but he's registered with the local youth careers service and is actively looking for an apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Gary. Just to clarify, that means he left school within the last 20 weeks, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. It's August now, so it's only been about two months since he left school in June.

[root_agent]: Right, okay. And does Ben live with you full-time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Ben lives with me full-time.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. Finally, can you confirm that you meet the UK residency rules?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I meet the UK residency rules.

[root_agent]: Great. Thank you for answering all those questions, Gary. Based on the information you’ve provided, it looks like you may be eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to explain further how this might apply to you and Ben?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain further how this might apply to us. I'm not sure how Child Benefit works when Ben isn't in education anymore.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Gary. Because Ben is 17, has recently left education, and is actively seeking an apprenticeship, he qualifies for an “extension” period. This means you *may* be eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from the date he left school. 

Essentially, the rules recognize that young people leaving education and seeking training still require financial support. 

Do you have any questions about this extension period or how it applies to your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: How long exactly will I receive the Child Benefit? Will it stop after the 20 weeks no matter what, or could it continue if Ben starts an apprenticeship?

[root_agent]: That’s a really important question, Gary. The Child Benefit would stop after the 20-week extension period, regardless of whether Ben starts an apprenticeship. The extension is specifically tied to the period immediately following his leaving school.

However, once Ben starts the apprenticeship, he *may* become eligible for other benefits, such as support for training, which could potentially provide additional financial assistance. 

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, just so you can explore this further? [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that link would be helpful. So to confirm, I'm eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when Ben left school in June, but after that it will stop even if he hasn't found an apprenticeship by then?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Gary. You’re eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from June, but it will cease after that period, regardless of whether Ben has secured an apprenticeship by then. 

Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit or anything else related to your situation that I can help you with?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome, accurately stating I'm eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks after Ben left education, matching the expected "Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)" outcome. The agent correctly identified that Ben qualifies for the extension period as a 17-year-old who left education and is registered with a careers service.
