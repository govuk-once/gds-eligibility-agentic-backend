[evaluation_judge]: I'll now role-play as a user named Bella's mother seeking benefit information. I'll interact with the agent until I receive an eligibility determination, then evaluate if the outcome matches the expected "Not Eligible" result.

Hi, i'm Janet and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Janet, I’m happy to help you with that. To start, could you tell me a little about your daughter, Bella? Specifically, how old is she?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. My daughter Bella is 16 years old. She's recently started training to become a travel agent, and I'm wondering if I might be eligible for any child benefits because of her situation.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And just to confirm, Bella is 16 years old. Could you tell me, is Bella responsible for looking after her own needs, such as meals and clothing?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm responsible for her. She lives with me and I take care of all her needs - meals, clothing, and everything else a mother would provide.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Now, I’d like to ask, who is paying for Bella’s training course?

[evaluation_judge]: Her training course is being fully paid for by the local travel agency that's employed her. They're covering all the costs of the training program.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Just to be clear, the training is entirely funded by the travel agency, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The travel agency is paying for the entire training program. They've taken her on as an employee and are providing this training as part of her employment with them.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for confirming that. Based on the eligibility criteria, education is only considered “approved” if it’s not funded by an employer. Since the travel agency is covering the cost of Bella’s training, we can conclude that she isn’t eligible for Child Benefit at this time.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. So because her employer is paying for her training, we don't qualify for Child Benefit? I wasn't aware of that rule.

[root_agent]: You’re welcome! I understand that can be a little confusing. Essentially, the rules around Child Benefit are designed to support families where the education costs are borne by the parent or guardian rather than the educational provider.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit since Bella's training is employer-funded, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
