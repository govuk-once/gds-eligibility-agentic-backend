[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a person in the described scenario to test the agent's knowledge of the "Split Family" Allowance situation.

Hi, i'm Robert and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Robert, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me, are you responsible for any children?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I have a son named Sam who is 10 years old living with me. My ex-wife Tina and I recently divorced, and our daughter Ella lives with her. I'm trying to figure out what benefits I might be entitled to for Sam.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. And just to confirm, Sam is 10 years old and lives with you, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Sam is 10 and lives with me full-time since the divorce. Our daughter Ella is 8 and lives with my ex-wife Tina.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now, regarding the child benefit, who gets the higher “Eldest Child” rate of £26.05?

[evaluation_judge]: That's actually what I'm trying to find out. My ex-wife Tina has our daughter Ella, and I have Sam. We're both making separate claims for the children who live with us. I'm not sure how the rates work in this situation - would I get the higher rate for Sam since he's with me and the eldest, or how does that work when parents are separated?

[root_agent]: That’s a really important question. The guidance states that if families split up and children are divided between parents – one lives with you, one lives with someone else – each parent is entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for the eldest child in their specific household. Would you agree that Sam is the eldest child living in your household?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Sam is the only child living in my household, so he would be the eldest in my home. So you're saying I would be entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for him?

[root_agent]: Exactly! Yes, you would be entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for Sam. It’s designed to ensure both parents receive the maximum benefit for the child residing with them. Is there anything else you’d like to ask about your eligibility for child benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! And I assume my ex-wife Tina would also get the full £26.05 weekly rate for Ella since she's the eldest (and only) child in her household? I just want to make sure I understand how it works for both of us.

[root_agent]: You’ve got it exactly right! Tina would also be entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for Ella, as she’s the eldest child in her household. So, to recap, you would receive the higher “Eldest Child” rate of £26.05 for Sam, and Tina would receive the same amount for Ella. Do you feel you now have a clear understanding of your eligibility for child benefit in this situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense now. Both Tina and I will receive the higher rate of £26.05 each week for our respective children. I appreciate you explaining how this works for separated families. That's all I needed to know, thank you for your help!

✓ The agent correctly explained that both parents would receive the higher "Eldest Child" rate of £26.05 for their respective children, matching the expected outcome that both are eligible for the higher rate.
