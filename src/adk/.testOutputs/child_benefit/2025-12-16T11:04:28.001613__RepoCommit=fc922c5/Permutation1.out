[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you're looking into benefits. To start, could you tell me, is the child (Leo) living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my son Leo is 8 years old and lives with us - with me and my husband Tom.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Just to clarify, are both you and your husband, Tom, responsible for Leo?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, we're both responsible for Leo. He's our son and lives with us full-time.

[root_agent]: Great. And is Leo currently under the age of 16?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Leo is 8 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay. And just to confirm, both you and your husband are ordinarily resident in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. We're both UK nationals living in Manchester.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, could you tell me what your combined adjusted net income is? (This is the income after deducting allowable expenses).

[evaluation_judge]: I work part-time and earn about £15,000 a year, and my husband Tom is a teacher earning £35,000. So our combined income would be £50,000, but we don't earn that much individually.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Just to be absolutely clear, is either you or your husband’s individual adjusted net income over £60,000?

[evaluation_judge]: No, neither of us earns that much. Tom earns £35,000 as a teacher and I earn £15,000 from my part-time work. So both of our individual incomes are well below £60,000.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And to confirm, is Leo currently in hospital or care for a longer period?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Leo is not in hospital or care. He's living at home with us and attending primary school.

[root_agent]: Okay, fantastic. Based on the information you’ve provided – that Leo is living with you, he’s under 16, you and your husband are both responsible for him, you’re both UK nationals, and neither of your incomes exceeds £60,000 – it appears you would likely be eligible for Child Benefit. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that sounds right. So we would be eligible for Child Benefit then?

[root_agent]: Yes, it does indeed sound like you would be eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, just for your reference?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit based on all the criteria, matching the expected outcome. The agent asked all the relevant questions covering responsibility, child's age, residency status, living arrangements, hospital/care status, and income thresholds before reaching their conclusion.
