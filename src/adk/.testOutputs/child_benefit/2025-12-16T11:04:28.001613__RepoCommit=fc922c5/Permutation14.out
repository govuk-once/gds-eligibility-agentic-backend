[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sophie and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Sophie, thank you for letting me know. Just to clarify, when Noah was living with you, did he live with you at the same address?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Noah normally lives with me at the same address. He's only staying with his grandmother temporarily while I recover from surgery.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. And to be clear, Noah has now been living with his grandmother for less than 8 weeks, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Noah has been staying with his grandmother for 6 weeks now. It's just a temporary arrangement until I'm fully recovered from my surgery.

[root_agent]: Alright. Just one more quick question then – since his grandmother isn’t claiming Child Benefit, are you the only one claiming Child Benefit for Noah?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm the only one claiming Child Benefit for Noah. His grandmother hasn't made any claim for Child Benefit while he's staying with her.

[root_agent]: Okay, Sophie. Based on this information – that Noah normally lives with you at the same address, he’s only been living with his grandmother for 6 weeks, and you’re the only one claiming Child Benefit – you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for letting me know. That's a relief to hear I'm still eligible while he's staying with his grandmother. No, I think that answers my question for now. I appreciate your help.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I'm eligible for Child Benefit since the child has been away for less than 8 weeks (6 weeks) and no one else is claiming the benefit.
