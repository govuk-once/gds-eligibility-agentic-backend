[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Elena, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand whether you might be eligible for any benefits, could you please tell me how old your child is?





[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Sofia is 18 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And is Sofia currently in any form of full-time education, such as a college, university, or apprenticeship?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Sofia isn't in any education. She left school two years ago and now works as a receptionist about 30 hours a week.

[root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know. Just to confirm, she works 30 hours a week as a receptionist?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. She works 30 hours a week as a receptionist. She's not taking any courses or training at all.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you are not eligible for Child Benefit. This is because Sofia is over 16 and not in approved education or training, and she also works more than 24 hours a week. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because Sofia is working and not in education? Is there any other benefit I might be eligible for given our situation?

[root_agent]: You are correct, your ineligibility for Child Benefit is due to Sofia being over 16, not in approved education or training, and working over 24 hours a week. 

However, Child Benefit is the only benefit I'm currently able to assess eligibility for. I am unable to advise on other benefits you might be eligible for.





[evaluation_judge]: I see. Thank you for the information about Child Benefit. I appreciate you explaining why I'm not eligible.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Elena. I'm glad I could clarify things for you. If you have any other questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter is over 16, not in approved education, and works more than 24 hours per week, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
