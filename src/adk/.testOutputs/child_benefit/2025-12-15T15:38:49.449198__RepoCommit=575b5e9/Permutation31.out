[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about benefit eligibility. I'll assume the role of Sarah who is inquiring about Child Benefit for her 18-year-old daughter who just started university.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, thanks for reaching out. I can certainly help you with that. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. My daughter Emma is 18 years old. I've been receiving Child Benefit for her, but she's just started university this year and I'm not sure if I can still claim it.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Sarah. That's good to know.

Is your daughter currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she is in full-time education. She just started a 3-year Bachelor's degree at university. She still lives at home with me and commutes to the university every day.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information.

Could you please confirm what level of education your daughter is currently undertaking – is it approved education, such as A-Levels or NVQ Level 3, or is it advanced education, such as a university degree or BTEC Higher National?

[evaluation_judge]: She's doing a university degree - it's a Bachelor's degree which will take 3 years to complete. So I guess that would be advanced education.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Sarah. 

Just to be clear, when did your daughter begin this Bachelor's degree? Was it within the last few months?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she just started in September. She finished her A-levels in the summer and then started university this autumn.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying.

Based on the information you've provided, unfortunately, you are no longer eligible to claim Child Benefit for your daughter now that she has started her Bachelor's degree. Child Benefit usually stops when a child starts advanced education, such as a university degree.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so I'm not eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit now that she's at university. That's disappointing but thank you for the clear information. No, I think that answers my question for now.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit since my daughter is in advanced education (university degree), which aligns with the expected outcome in the scenario.
