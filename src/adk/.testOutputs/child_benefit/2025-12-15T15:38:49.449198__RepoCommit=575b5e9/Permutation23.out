[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Kevin and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Kevin, it’s lovely to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and whether you might be eligible, could you tell me how old you are?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 50 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And do you have any children?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a daughter named Sarah. She's 12 years old.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. Does Sarah live with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, she doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Do you make any regular contributions towards Sarah’s upkeep?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't pay weekly maintenance, but every 4 weeks I buy a large bulk order of groceries and clothes for Sarah that costs about £120, and I deliver these to her mother.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just to clarify, is £120 the total cost of groceries and clothes you provide to Sarah every four weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The total cost is £120 every four weeks for groceries and clothes that I deliver to her mother.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Aside from the groceries and clothes you purchase, do you contribute to Sarah’s upkeep in any other way, such as paying for activities or school trips?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the £120 bulk order of groceries and clothes every 4 weeks is my only contribution.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. To be clear, this is just to fully understand your situation. Are you currently employed, or do you have another source of income? (This doesn’t affect eligibility for *this* particular benefit, but might be relevant for others).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm employed. I work full-time, but I'd rather not go into details about my income if that's not relevant for this particular benefit.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to ask – your income isn’t relevant for this particular benefit, so please don’t feel you need to share it. Thank you for confirming you are employed. 

Based on the information you've provided, it sounds like you might be eligible for Child Benefit, even though Sarah doesn't live with you. Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd like to understand why I might be eligible for Child Benefit even though Sarah doesn't live with me.

[root_agent]: Certainly. You might be eligible because you contribute financially to Sarah’s upkeep, and your contributions meet certain criteria. Specifically, your £120 contribution every four weeks – which averages to £30 per week – exceeds the minimum weekly amount of £26.05 that counts as financial support for Child Benefit purposes, even if it’s a lump sum rather than weekly payments. 

Does that make sense? Would you like me to go over any part of that again, or would you like to know more about how to claim?

[evaluation_judge]: That does make sense. Can you tell me more about how I would go about claiming Child Benefit in my situation?

[root_agent]: Certainly. Because Sarah lives with her mother, it’s likely her mother is already claiming Child Benefit for Sarah. In this situation, you would need to inform HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) about your contributions. 

Essentially, you’ll need to contact HMRC and provide details of the £120 payments you make every four weeks. They will then assess whether your contributions mean you should also receive a share of the Child Benefit, or whether the full amount should be paid to you instead of her mother. 

I unfortunately can’t provide a direct link, but if you search “HMRC Child Benefit contributions non-resident parent” on a search engine, it should lead you to the relevant information and contact details on the gov.uk website.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or any other benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am eligible for Child Benefit because my contribution of £120 every four weeks (averaging to £30 per week) exceeds the minimum required amount of £26.05, even though it's paid as a lump sum rather than weekly payments.
