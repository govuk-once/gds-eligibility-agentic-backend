[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jordan and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Jordan, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks Jordan. And are you currently in approved education or training? This could include things like A-Levels, college, university, or an apprenticeship.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not. I finished my GCSEs last year but I'm not in college or doing any training at the moment. I'm not really doing anything right now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Have you registered with any government-sponsored careers service, the armed forces, or a similar program? These can sometimes allow eligibility for a bit longer.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't registered with any careers service or program. I'm just staying at home with my dad at the moment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Jordan. Just to clarify, you've mentioned you live with your father. Is your father responsible for your care?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my dad Steve looks after me. It's just me and him at home.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Jordan. Based on the information you've provided – you are 17, not currently in education or training, haven’t registered with any relevant services, and live with your father – it appears you are not currently eligible for Child Benefit. 

Child Benefit generally continues until a child turns 16, or until they start approved education or training, whichever is later. As you are 17 and not in education or training, and haven’t registered with a relevant program, you unfortunately don’t meet the criteria.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit as a 17-year-old who is not in education/training and has not registered with any careers service or similar program.
