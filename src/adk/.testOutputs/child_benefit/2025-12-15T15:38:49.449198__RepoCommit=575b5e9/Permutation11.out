[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Karen and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Karen, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: My son Ryan is 17 years old. I'm not sure if I can still claim for him.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that's helpful. Is Ryan currently in full-time education, such as A-levels, or undertaking an apprenticeship?

[evaluation_judge]: Ryan has just left school and started an Intermediate Apprenticeship. It's government-funded, and he still lives at home with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, is this apprenticeship in England?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the apprenticeship is in England.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Because Ryan is 17 and has started a government-funded apprenticeship in England, unfortunately, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Starting an apprenticeship is a disqualifying event, even though he still lives with you. 

I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So just to be clear, I need to stop my Child Benefit claim now that Ryan has started his apprenticeship? Even though he still lives at home with me?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct. Even though Ryan lives at home with you, starting a government-funded apprenticeship in England means you need to stop your Child Benefit claim for him. It’s a requirement of the benefit rules.



Would you like me to quickly summarise the rules around Child Benefit and apprenticeships, just so you have it clearly explained?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'd like to understand why I'm not eligible anymore when he's still living at home and under 18.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The rules state that Child Benefit generally continues as long as a child is under 18 and in "approved" education or training. However, beginning a government-funded apprenticeship in England is specifically considered a disqualifying event, regardless of age or living arrangements. 

Essentially, the government sees an apprenticeship as equivalent to employment for the purposes of Child Benefit eligibility. Even though he is still your dependent and living with you, the apprenticeship changes his status in relation to the benefit.



Does that make things a little clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make things clearer, though it's disappointing news. How do I go about stopping my claim? And is there any other support I might be eligible for since he's still living at home and dependent on me?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, and I'm happy to help with the next steps. To stop your Child Benefit claim, you’ll need to contact HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). You can do this via their website or by calling them. I am unable to provide direct links, but searching "HMRC stop Child Benefit" should easily lead you to the right place.

Regarding other support, that’s a bit outside the scope of what I can assess right now, as I’m focused on Child Benefit. However, as Ryan is undertaking an apprenticeship, he may be eligible for some support specifically relating to that, such as travel expenses. You might also want to explore if you’re eligible for Universal Credit or other benefits based on your own income and circumstances. These would require a separate assessment.

Would you like me to provide you with some general information on where to find details about other benefits, even though I can’t assess your eligibility for them directly?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit since my son has started a government-funded apprenticeship in England, which is a disqualifying event even though he still lives at home and is under 18. The agent accurately matched the expected outcome.
