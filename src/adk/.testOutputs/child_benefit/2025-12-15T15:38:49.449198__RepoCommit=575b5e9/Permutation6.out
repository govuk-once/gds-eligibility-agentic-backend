[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Mary, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and whether you might be eligible for benefits, could you please tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 29 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mary. And how old is your child?

[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Chloe is 6 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Is Chloe currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, Chloe has been in the hospital for the past 14 weeks. She has a serious condition. I visit her every day though.

[root_agent]: I'm sorry to hear that Chloe is in hospital, and I hope she gets well soon. 

To clarify, has Chloe been in hospital continuously for those 14 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she's been in the hospital continuously for all 14 weeks. It's been a really difficult time.

[root_agent]: I understand this must be a very difficult time for you.

Do you contribute financially towards Chloe's upkeep while she is in hospital - for example, do you spend money on things for her while she's there?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I visit daily and spend about £30 a week on books, new pyjamas, and some special foods that she likes. I try to make her stay as comfortable as possible.

[root_agent]: That’s very kind of you, Mary. Just to confirm, are you Chloe’s primary caregiver and responsible for her upbringing?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am her mother and her primary caregiver. I'm responsible for her upbringing.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Mary. Based on the information you've provided, it sounds like you may still be eligible for Child Benefit, despite Chloe being in hospital for more than 12 weeks, because you are contributing to her upkeep. 

I will need to confirm a few more details to be certain, but it’s looking positive. Would you mind if I ask you a few more questions to be sure?

[evaluation_judge]: Of course, please go ahead and ask me any questions you need to.

[root_agent]: Great. Just to be absolutely clear, when you say you are responsible for Chloe’s upbringing, does this mean you are the only person responsible, or are there others sharing that responsibility?

[evaluation_judge]: I am the only person responsible for Chloe. It's just me raising her.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Mary. Based on everything you’ve told me, you *are* likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Chloe, even though she has been in hospital for over 12 weeks. This is because you are financially supporting her upkeep while she’s in hospital and you are her sole caregiver.



Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on how to report the change in circumstances to HMRC?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit despite my child being in hospital over 12 weeks. They accurately recognized the exception applies because I regularly spend money on my child's upkeep while in hospital, which maintains my eligibility beyond the normal 12-week limit.
