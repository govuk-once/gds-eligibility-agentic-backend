[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sophie and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Sophie, I'm happy to help! To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 28 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you! And do you have any children?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a son named Noah who is 6 years old.

[root_agent]: That's lovely to hear. Currently, where is Noah living? Is he living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, Noah is currently staying with his grandmother. I had to have surgery recently, and during my recovery, Noah is staying with her. He's been there for about 6 weeks now.

[root_agent]: I wish you a speedy recovery from your surgery, Sophie. Just to clarify, is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Noah while he is staying with his grandmother?

[evaluation_judge]: No, his grandmother isn't claiming any Child Benefit for him. It's just a temporary arrangement while I recover.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. And to be sure I have the information right, has Noah been living with his grandmother for more than 8 weeks in a row?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's been about 6 weeks so far. He should be coming back to live with me in a couple of weeks when I'm fully recovered.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Based on the information you've provided, you are likely still eligible for Child Benefit. You can usually continue to receive it for up to 8 weeks while your child lives with someone else, as long as no one else is claiming for them. 

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit or other benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: So I can still receive Child Benefit even though Noah isn't currently living with me? That's a relief to hear. I was concerned my payments might stop during this temporary arrangement. Will the payments just continue automatically or do I need to notify anyone about the situation?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, I'm glad I could reassure you! Generally, as long as no one else is claiming for Noah and he returns within 8 weeks, your payments should continue automatically. However, it's always a good idea to inform HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) about a change in circumstances, even if it’s temporary. You can do this through your online account on GOV.UK. Would you like me to explain how to access your online account?

[evaluation_judge]: No thank you, I know how to access my online account. I'll make sure to let HMRC know about the temporary situation. You've been very helpful. I feel much better knowing I can still receive the benefit while Noah stays with his grandmother for this short period.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sophie! I'm delighted I could help put your mind at ease. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions in the future. I wish you a continued speedy recovery and all the best with Noah.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I am still eligible for Child Benefit even though my child is temporarily staying with his grandmother, as it has been less than 8 weeks and no one else is claiming the benefit.
