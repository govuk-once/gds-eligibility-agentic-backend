[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Alice and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Alice, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me the age of the child you are claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: My son Tom is 14 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Is Tom currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he isn't living with me at the moment. Tom has severe behavioral needs and has moved into a residential school. The local council is paying for it. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that, Alice. To clarify, is this residential school providing care as part of a care arrangement made with the local authority, or is it primarily for his education or specific behavioral support needs, and funded by the local council for those reasons?





[evaluation_judge]: It's primarily for his education and behavioral support needs. It's not a care arrangement - it's a residential school placement because of his specific needs. The local council is funding it because of his educational and behavioral requirements.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Alice. Knowing this is helpful.

Is Tom usually a UK resident?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Tom has always lived in the UK. He's a UK resident.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. 

And just to confirm, is Tom’s residential school in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, his residential school is in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Alice. Based on the information you've provided, it sounds like Tom may still be eligible for Child Benefit. He is 14, a UK resident, and attending a residential school in the UK for educational and behavioral support, funded by the local council. 

Just to be absolutely sure, could you confirm that you are Tom's parent?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am Tom's parent.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Alice.

Given everything you've told me, Tom is likely still eligible for Child Benefit. Because he's in residential accommodation (rather than being 'in care') for educational and behavioral support, the 12-week rule applies. He has been there for 10 weeks, so he remains eligible for now.

Do you have any other children you claim for, or any other questions about Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have any other children I claim for. So just to be clear, I'm still eligible for Child Benefit for Tom now, but will that change after the 12-week mark?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to ask for clarification, Alice. Yes, that is correct. You are currently eligible for Child Benefit for Tom. However, eligibility will change after the 12-week mark from when he started at the residential school. After 12 weeks, Tom will no longer be considered eligible for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining that I'm eligible now but will lose eligibility after the 12-week mark. That gives me time to plan ahead.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Alice! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It's good you are planning ahead. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that I am eligible for Child Benefit currently because Tom has been in residential accommodation for only 10 weeks, and that eligibility would end after the 12-week mark, which matches the expected outcome.
