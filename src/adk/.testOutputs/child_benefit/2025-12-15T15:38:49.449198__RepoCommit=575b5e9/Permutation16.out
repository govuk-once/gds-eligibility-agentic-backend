[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Hannah, a UK resident whose son is receiving specialized medical treatment in the USA. I'll engage with the agent to determine my benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Hannah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Hannah, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you tell me if you are claiming for a child?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm claiming for my son Oliver. He's 14 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Hannah. That's good to know.

Is Oliver currently living with you in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's not living with me at the moment. He has a rare medical condition and has been sent to a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I'm still in the UK, but I pay for his costs and visit him when I can.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining the situation, Hannah. That's very helpful.

To clarify, was Oliver already receiving hospital treatment when he went to the USA, or did he travel *specifically* to receive treatment there?

[evaluation_judge]: He traveled specifically to receive treatment in the USA. His condition is rare, and the specialists recommended a particular hospital there that has experience with his condition.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Hannah. 

Has Oliver been in the hospital in the USA for more than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's been in the hospital in the USA for 15 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And just to be clear, while Oliver is receiving treatment in the USA, are you continuing to financially support him – paying for things like his living costs while there, or contributing towards his care?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm definitely still financially supporting him. I pay for all his incidental costs that aren't covered by his medical care, and I also pay for my own travel when I visit him. He's still completely dependent on me financially.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hannah. 

Based on what you've told me – that Oliver is 14, he's receiving hospital treatment in the USA which he travelled to specifically for that treatment, he’s been there for over 12 weeks, and you are continuing to financially support him – it sounds like you *are* likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit.

Would you like me to summarise why, and perhaps double-check any specific details to be completely sure?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain to me why I'm still eligible despite him being abroad for so long. I'd like to understand the reasoning.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Hannah.

You're still eligible for Child Benefit because of specific rules regarding children receiving hospital treatment abroad. Generally, Child Benefit stops when a child stops living in the UK. However, there’s an exception if a child is in hospital *abroad*, and they only went abroad specifically to receive hospital treatment. 

Because Oliver travelled to the USA *for* hospital treatment, and has been there for more than 12 weeks, you can continue to claim Child Benefit as long as you continue to financially support him. The fact that you are paying for his costs and visiting him confirms this continuing financial support.

Does that explanation make sense, and would you like me to go over any part of it again?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes perfect sense, thank you. It's a relief to know that I can continue to receive Child Benefit while Oliver gets the treatment he needs abroad. I appreciate you explaining the specific exception that applies to our situation.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Hannah. I'm genuinely glad I could help clarify things for you and provide some reassurance during what I imagine must be a stressful time. 

I wish Oliver all the best with his treatment and a speedy recovery. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for Child Benefit based on the international exception rule for children who go abroad specifically for hospital treatment. They properly identified that despite being abroad for 15 weeks (over 12 weeks), the benefit continues because I still financially support my son.
