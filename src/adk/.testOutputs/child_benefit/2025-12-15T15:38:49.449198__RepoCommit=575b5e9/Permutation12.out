[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you evaluate the agent's performance in this scenario. I'll be playing the role of a parent with a teenage son who receives Universal Credit on his own.

Hi, i'm Jessica and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Jessica, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm checking about Child Benefit for my son Liam. He's 18 years old and still lives with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Jessica. Liam is 18 and lives with you – that’s helpful.

Is Liam currently in approved full-time education, such as A-Levels?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he is currently studying for his A-levels at the local college.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. And does Liam receive any benefits in his own right, such as Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Liam has been receiving Universal Credit for a few months now. He's estranged from his father and needed some financial support for his personal expenses.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Jessica.

Just to be absolutely sure, is the Universal Credit Liam receives paid directly *to him*, and not to you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the Universal Credit is paid directly to Liam. He applied for it himself and it goes into his own bank account.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Jessica. 

Based on the information you’ve provided, as Liam is 18, in full-time education, and receiving Universal Credit in his own right, you are unfortunately **not eligible** for Child Benefit. Receiving Universal Credit as an 18-year-old generally stops Child Benefit from being payable.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you’d like to discuss other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing, but I understand. No, I don't have any other questions right now. Thanks for the information.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit since my son receives Universal Credit in his own right, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
