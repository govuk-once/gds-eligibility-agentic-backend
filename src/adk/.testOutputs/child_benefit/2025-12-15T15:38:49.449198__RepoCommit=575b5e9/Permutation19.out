[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Pete and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Pete, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible, could you tell me how old your child is?





[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Holly is 9 years old. I'm wondering about Child Benefit since I have her staying with me 3 days a week. Her mother Sue has her the other 4 days of the week, but we're separated now.

[root_agent]: Thanks for that information, Pete. Do you contribute towards the costs of raising Holly, such as buying her clothes or food?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I definitely do. I buy her clothes and food when she's with me those 3 days a week. I make sure she has everything she needs when she's staying at my place.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Is Holly living with you more than half the time?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Holly stays with me 3 days a week and with her mother Sue for 4 days a week, so she's with her mother slightly more.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Pete. Are you and Holly’s mother both currently claiming Child Benefit for her?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I've submitted a claim to HMRC, and I believe Sue has done the same. We couldn't agree on who should claim it, so we both decided to put in applications.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being upfront about that, Pete. Just to confirm, are you aware that only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I was told that might be the case, but since Sue and I couldn't agree on who should get it, we both submitted claims. I was hoping HMRC might be able to sort it out or tell us what to do.

[root_agent]: I understand. Since you and Holly’s mother both claimed, HMRC will need to decide who is eligible. Generally, they will award the Child Benefit to the person the child lives with the most, which sounds like it would be Holly’s mother in your situation.

Would you like me to explain this further, or are you happy with this explanation?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit disappointed to hear that, but I understand. So you're saying that since Holly spends 4 days with Sue and only 3 days with me, HMRC will likely award the Child Benefit to her instead of me? Is there anything I can do about this, or is that just how it works?

[root_agent]: You're right to understand it that way, Pete. As Holly lives with her mother for a greater number of days each week, HMRC will likely award the Child Benefit to Sue. 

Unfortunately, if you can't reach an agreement with Sue, there isn't much you can do to change HMRC's decision as long as she is the parent with whom Holly primarily resides. HMRC makes the final decision based on where the child lives most of the time. Would you like me to reiterate any of the information I've provided?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think you've explained it clearly. So basically, Sue will most likely get the Child Benefit because Holly stays with her more days of the week, and HMRC makes the final decision when parents can't agree. I appreciate you being straightforward about my situation.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Pete. I'm glad I could clarify things for you. If you have any other questions about benefits in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that since Holly stays with her mother Sue for 4 days (versus 3 days with Pete), and both parents submitted claims, HMRC would award the Child Benefit to Sue. This matches the expected outcome that Sue is eligible and Pete is not eligible.
