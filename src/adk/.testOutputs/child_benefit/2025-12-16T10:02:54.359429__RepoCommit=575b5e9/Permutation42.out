[evaluation_judge]: I'll now take on the role of Sian, a 17-year-old from Cardiff who wants to know about benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Sian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sian, it's lovely to speak with you! I can certainly help you with that.

To start, could you tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I've just turned 17 last month.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. And are you currently in education or training?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've left school and I've just started a Foundation Apprenticeship that's funded by the Welsh Government.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you're starting an apprenticeship! 

Just to clarify, are you living with your mother?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I live with my mother in Cardiff.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming.

To help me understand your situation a little better, could you tell me if you are financially dependent on your mother?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am financially dependent on my mother. The apprenticeship gives me some income but it's not enough to support myself fully.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Just one final question for now - is the Foundation Apprenticeship your *only* form of income, besides support from your mother?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the Foundation Apprenticeship is my only source of income. My mother helps with everything else.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sian. Based on the information you've provided – you're 17, living with your mother in Cardiff, financially dependent on her, and undertaking a Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are considered approved training for these purposes, which is different to apprenticeships in England.

Would you like me to explain this in a little more detail, or perhaps discuss anything else related to benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, could you explain a bit more about why I'm eligible even though I'm doing an apprenticeship? I thought apprenticeships usually weren't covered by Child Benefit.

[root_agent]: You’re right to ask – that’s a very good question! Generally, apprenticeships *do* disqualify someone from receiving Child Benefit. However, there’s a specific exception for **Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales** that are funded by the Welsh Government.

The rules state that approved training courses are eligible, and these Foundation Apprenticeships fall into that category. Apprenticeships in England don't have this same exception.

So, because you’re in Wales and on this specific type of apprenticeship, you *are* still eligible, even though you're in training. Does that make things a little clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense now. Thank you for explaining that my Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales is treated differently than other apprenticeships when it comes to Child Benefit eligibility. I appreciate your help in clarifying this.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Sian! I’m so glad I could help clarify things for you. 

Is there anything else I can assist you with today? Perhaps information on how to apply for Child Benefit, or any other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I (as Sian) would be eligible for Child Benefit. They accurately explained that while apprenticeships typically disqualify someone from receiving this benefit, Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales specifically are considered approved training and therefore eligible. This matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
