[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mark and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Mark, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand whether you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me the age of the child you are interested in claiming for?


[evaluation_judge]: My son Lucas is 10 years old. I'm interested in claiming Child Benefit for him.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And where does Lucas currently live – with you, or with someone else?

[evaluation_judge]: Lucas lives with my ex-wife Jenny. We're divorced, and he lives with her.

[root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know. Does Jenny currently claim Child Benefit for Lucas?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Jenny doesn't claim Child Benefit for Lucas.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Do you contribute financially towards Lucas’s upbringing, and if so, approximately how much do you contribute each month?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I transfer £150 per month to Jenny specifically for Lucas's food and clothes.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, do you live with Lucas at all?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't live with Lucas. As I mentioned, he lives with my ex-wife Jenny full-time.

[root_agent]: Thanks for confirming. Finally, are you currently claiming any other benefits for Lucas?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not claiming any other benefits for Lucas at the moment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Mark. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you *are* eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas.

Even though Lucas lives with his mother, you contribute financially to his upkeep with £150 per month, which is more than the current Child Benefit amount. As Jenny isn’t currently claiming, you would be eligible to claim as the parent who contributes financially. 

Would you like me to provide you with information on how to apply?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful. Could you tell me how to apply for Child Benefit?

[root_agent]: You can apply for Child Benefit through the gov.uk website. The application is online and asks for details about you, your child, and your finances. 

You'll need your National Insurance number, Lucas’s date of birth, and details of any other benefits you receive.

To start your application, you can visit: [https://www.gov.uk/apply-child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/apply-child-benefit)



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for the information about my eligibility and how to apply.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Mark! I'm glad I could help. If you have any other questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit. They accurately assessed that even though Lucas lives with his mother, I contribute more than the Child Benefit amount to his upkeep (£150/month vs £113/month), and since Jenny is not claiming, I am eligible to claim.
