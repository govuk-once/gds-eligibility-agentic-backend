[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Hannah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Hannah, I'm happy to help! To start with, could you tell me the age of the child you're hoping to claim for?


[evaluation_judge]: My son Oliver is 14 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And is Oliver currently living with you in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's actually in a hospital in the USA. He has a rare condition and was sent to a specialist hospital there for treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Has Oliver been in the hospital in the USA continuously for more than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's been in the hospital in the USA continuously for 15 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. Was Oliver sent to the USA *specifically* to receive hospital treatment for his condition?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he was sent to the USA specifically for hospital treatment. He has a rare condition that requires specialist care that was only available at this particular hospital.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Do you, as Oliver’s parent, continue to financially support him while he is receiving treatment in the USA?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I pay for all his incidental costs while he's there, and I visit him when I can afford to make the trip.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hannah. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you may still be eligible for Child Benefit despite Oliver being treated in the USA. 

To be absolutely sure, could you confirm you are a UK resident?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am a UK resident. I continue to live and work here in the UK while Oliver is receiving his treatment abroad.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming. Based on all the information you’ve provided – Oliver is 14, he’s been in hospital in the USA for more than 12 weeks specifically for treatment, you continue to financially support him, and you are a UK resident – you are likely still eligible to receive Child Benefit. 

Would you like me to summarise why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, that would be helpful to understand why I'm still eligible despite Oliver being abroad.

[root_agent]: Certainly. You are likely still eligible for Child Benefit because Oliver is in hospital abroad, and he went to the USA *specifically* for hospital treatment. The rules state that Child Benefit can continue to be paid as long as these conditions are met, and you continue to financially support him, even though he is not currently living in the UK. Additionally, you are a UK resident.



Does that make things clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes everything very clear. Thank you for explaining that I can still receive Child Benefit even though Oliver is being treated abroad, since he went specifically for the hospital treatment and I'm still supporting him financially while remaining a UK resident myself.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Hannah! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit. They correctly identified that since my son went abroad specifically for hospital treatment, and I continue to financially support him while remaining a UK resident, I remain eligible despite him being abroad for more than 12 weeks.
