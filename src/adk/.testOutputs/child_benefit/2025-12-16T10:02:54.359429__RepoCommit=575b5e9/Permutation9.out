[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you evaluate the other agent by roleplaying as Lars, a German citizen with Pre-Settled Status who's looking for information about benefit eligibility. I'll engage naturally with the agent and assess whether they provide the correct outcome (that Lars is eligible for Child Benefit).

Hi, i'm Lars and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Lars, it's lovely to meet you. I can certainly help you with that. To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?





[evaluation_judge]: I have a 5-year-old son named Hans. I moved to the UK from Germany recently and I'm currently looking for work.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Lars. That's helpful. Are you responsible for Hans financially?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am fully responsible for Hans financially. I'm his father and his primary caregiver.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lars. And just to confirm, are you currently working in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not currently working. I'm unemployed at the moment but I've registered as a jobseeker and I'm actively looking for work.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Lars. Do you have a right to reside in the UK? For example, do you have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme. I moved to the UK from Germany recently.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you Lars. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you have Pre-Settled Status, you are responsible for a 5-year-old child, and you are actively seeking work – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





[evaluation_judge]: That's good news! Just to make sure I understand correctly - I can claim Child Benefit for Hans even though I'm not working yet? I'm registered as a jobseeker and actively looking, but I want to be certain that's enough with my Pre-Settled Status.

[root_agent]: You are right to double-check, Lars! Yes, that’s correct. Because you have Pre-Settled Status *and* you are registered as a jobseeker actively looking for work, you *can* claim Child Benefit for Hans, even though you aren't currently employed. Your status as a registered jobseeker satisfies the 'right to reside' requirement in your situation.



Is there anything else I can clarify for you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thanks for the information about Child Benefit for my son. I'll look into applying for it right away.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit with Pre-Settled Status as a registered jobseeker with a 5-year-old child. The information provided matched the expected outcome.
