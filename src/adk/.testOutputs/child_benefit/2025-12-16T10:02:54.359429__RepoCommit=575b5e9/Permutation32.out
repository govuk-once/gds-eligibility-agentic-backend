[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi John, it's good to hear from you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And where do you currently live – with a parent, guardian, or someone else?

[evaluation_judge]: I live with my dad, Pete. It's just the two of us.

[root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know. Are you currently in education, and if so, what kind? For example, are you at school, college, university, or doing an apprenticeship?

[evaluation_judge]: I've left school but I'm attending a local college to re-sit two of my GCSEs. I only go in for about 6 hours a week for supervised study. The rest of the time I'm just at home, mostly gaming.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, this course involves 6 hours of *supervised* study each week? (Supervised study means you are being taught or observed by a teacher).

[evaluation_judge]: Yeah, that's right. It's 6 hours of supervised study each week with teachers. They help me prepare to retake my English and Maths GCSEs. The rest of the time I'm supposed to study on my own, but honestly, I mostly just play video games at home.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for being honest about that. To clarify, are you receiving any other financial support for this course, such as a bursary or grant?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not getting any financial support like bursaries or grants for my course. Dad just pays for everything right now.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Based on the information you’ve provided, it seems you are 17, live with your father, and are attending college for 6 hours of supervised study per week. 

To be eligible for Child Benefit when someone is in education, the course generally needs to involve more than 12 hours of supervised study a week. As your course is 6 hours, unfortunately, it doesn't meet that requirement. 

Therefore, it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit. Is that okay with you, or would you like me to double-check anything?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I didn't know there was an hourly requirement. That's disappointing but I guess it makes sense. No, I don't think there's anything to double-check. Thanks for explaining why I'm not eligible.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could explain things clearly for you. If you ever have any other questions about benefits or anything else, feel free to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because my education doesn't meet the minimum requirement of more than 12 hours of supervised study per week (I only do 6 hours).
