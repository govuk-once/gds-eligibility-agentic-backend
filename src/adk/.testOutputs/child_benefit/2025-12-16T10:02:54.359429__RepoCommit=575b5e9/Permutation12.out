[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a user named Jessica who is inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility for her 18-year-old son Liam.

Hi, i'm Jessica and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Jessica, I'm happy to help. To start, could you please tell me how old your son Liam is?





[evaluation_judge]: He's 18 years old. He's still living at home with me while finishing his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And is Liam currently in approved education, such as studying for his A-Levels?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's currently studying for his A-levels at the local sixth form college. He's in his final year.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Is Liam financially dependent on you, or does he receive any income or benefits in his own right?

[evaluation_judge]: He doesn't have a job or any income from work, but he has been approved for Universal Credit in his own right recently. He's estranged from his father, so he applied for it to help with his personal expenses while studying.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Just to be certain, could you confirm that the Universal Credit Liam is receiving is paid directly to *him*, and not to you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The Universal Credit is paid directly to him. He has his own bank account where the payments go in.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided, as Liam is 18 years old, in approved education, and receiving Universal Credit in his own right, you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit. Receiving Universal Credit in their own right automatically stops Child Benefit entitlement. 

I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. I didn't realize that his Universal Credit would affect my Child Benefit claim. Is there anything I can do about that, or is that just how it works?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask for clarification. It's understandable to be surprised by how benefits interact. Unfortunately, the rules state that Child Benefit stops when a child starts receiving Universal Credit (or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right. This is regardless of whether they are in education or living at home. 

There isn’t anything you can do to continue receiving Child Benefit while Liam is receiving Universal Credit independently. However, it’s worth remembering that if Liam were to stop receiving Universal Credit, you could reapply for Child Benefit as long as he still meets the other eligibility criteria (age, education, etc.).



Would you like me to double-check anything, or perhaps look into other potential benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's clear now. I appreciate the explanation. I think that's all I needed to know today, thank you.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Jessica. I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit since my son receives Universal Credit in his own right, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
