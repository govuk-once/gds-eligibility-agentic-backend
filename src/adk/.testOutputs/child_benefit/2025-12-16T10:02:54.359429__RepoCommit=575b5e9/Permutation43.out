[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Callum and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Callum, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks Callum. And where in the UK do you live? Just the country or city is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: I live in Glasgow, Scotland with my father.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. Are you currently in full-time non-advanced education? (For example, A-Levels or equivalent).

[evaluation_judge]: No, I've started a Modern Apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Is this Modern Apprenticeship an approved training scheme?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure what you mean by an approved training scheme. It's just a standard Modern Apprenticeship that I'm doing through a local employer.

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. Generally, Child Benefit isn't paid to those doing apprenticeships in Scotland, England or Northern Ireland.

To confirm, this isn’t a Welsh apprenticeship is it?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's definitely in Scotland. I live in Glasgow and my apprenticeship is with a local company here in the city.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided – that you are 17, live in Scotland, and are undertaking a Modern Apprenticeship – it appears you are not eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So my dad can't claim Child Benefit for me anymore because I'm doing this apprenticeship?

[root_agent]: That's correct, Callum. Because you are 17 and undertaking a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Your father would need to inform HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) that your apprenticeship has started, as this will affect the Child Benefit payments. Would you like me to explain how your father can do that?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit because I am doing a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, which is not eligible for Child Benefit.
