[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a user seeking benefit eligibility information. Let me begin my conversation with the agent under test.

Hi, i'm Alice and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Alice, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you tell me if you are currently receiving Child Benefit for the child you are enquiring about?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am receiving Child Benefit for my son Tom. He's 14 years old, but he's been staying at a residential school for about 10 weeks now because of his severe behavioral needs. The local council is paying for the school. I'm wondering if this affects my Child Benefit.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Alice. It's good to know you're currently receiving Child Benefit for Tom. 

To clarify, is this residential school providing care because of his behavioral needs, or is it primarily for educational purposes? Knowing this helps me understand the specific rules that apply.

[evaluation_judge]: It's primarily for educational purposes - it's a residential school that specializes in supporting children with behavioral needs. The local council is funding it because they agreed he needs this specialized educational environment. He still comes home occasionally on weekends, but he's been living at the school for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Alice. That's very helpful. 

Just to confirm, the local council is paying for Tom to attend this residential school, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The local council is paying for Tom to attend this residential school. They assessed his needs and agreed that this specialized setting would be best for him.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Alice. And approximately how long has Tom been staying at the residential school now? You mentioned around 10 weeks, but just want to be certain.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's been 10 weeks now since Tom started staying at the residential school.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Alice.

Given that Tom is in residential accommodation funded by the local council, and he’s been there for 10 weeks, currently you *remain* eligible for Child Benefit. However, eligibility continues for up to 12 weeks in this situation.

Would you like me to explain the rules around Child Benefit and residential accommodation in a bit more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would appreciate if you could explain the rules around Child Benefit and residential accommodation in more detail. So I understand I'm still eligible now, but what happens after 12 weeks?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Alice. Happy to explain.

Child Benefit eligibility usually changes when a child is in care or residential accommodation. If a child is in *care* – meaning fostered by a local authority or living with them – Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks.

However, because Tom is in *residential accommodation* – specifically a school funded by the local council for his educational and behavioral needs – the rules are slightly different. You can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks from when he started staying there. 

After 12 weeks, Child Benefit will unfortunately stop. You would need to inform HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) when Tom has been at the school for 12 weeks.

Does that make things a bit clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes things much clearer. So I'll continue getting Child Benefit for another 2 weeks, and then I'll need to inform HMRC once we hit the 12-week mark. I appreciate you explaining the different rules for residential accommodation versus care.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Alice! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. 

Just to be sure, is there anything else I can assist you with today regarding Child Benefit or any other benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you for explaining the situation with Child Benefit while Tom is at his residential school. It's helpful to understand that I'm still eligible for now but will need to notify HMRC in two weeks when we hit the 12-week mark.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Alice. I'm pleased I could help. 

If you do have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Wishing you and Tom all the best. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, have a good day too!

✓ The agent provided the correct eligibility outcome. They correctly identified that I am eligible for Child Benefit while my son is in residential accommodation (not care) for up to 12 weeks, and accurately stated I remain eligible now at 10 weeks but will become ineligible after 12 weeks.
