[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Emily and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Emily, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you please tell me your date of birth?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 18 years old. I just finished my A-Levels this past summer.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Are you currently in any form of full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've just started a Higher National Certificate course at my local college.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Is this course an "Approved" course, or would you consider it to be an "Advanced" course, like a degree level course?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a level 4 course, so I think it's considered advanced education. It's not quite a degree but it's higher level than A-Levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Just to confirm, is this course at a university, or at a college?

[evaluation_judge]: It's at a college, not a university.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me – that you are 18, in advanced education (a Level 4 HNC) at a college – it appears you are not eligible for Child Benefit. This is because Child Benefit generally stops when someone turns 18 and is in advanced education. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit because I am in advanced education (HNC is level 4) which matches the expected outcome.
