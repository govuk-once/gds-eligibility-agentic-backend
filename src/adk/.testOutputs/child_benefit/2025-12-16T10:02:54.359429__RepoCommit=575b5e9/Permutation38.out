[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Tom, it's lovely to hear from you! I can certainly help you look into your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me the age of your child?

[evaluation_judge]: My wife Jerry and I just had a baby 4 months ago. We've been so overwhelmed with being new parents that we completely forgot to apply for Child Benefit until now. I'm worried we might have lost out on some money for those first few months.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Tom. It's completely understandable to be overwhelmed as new parents! It's great you're looking into Child Benefit now.

To clarify, just to be sure I have everything correct, is your child currently under 20 years old and in full-time education, or under 16?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, our baby is only 4 months old, so definitely under 16.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you! And just to confirm, does your baby currently live with you and Jerry?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the baby lives with us. We're the parents and take care of the baby in our home.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, thank you. 

To help me understand your situation fully, are either you or Jerry responsible for caring for a child under 12 who doesn’t live with you, for at least 29 weeks of the year?

[evaluation_judge]: No, we just have our baby who lives with us full time.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s perfectly clear.

You mentioned you recently had your baby 4 months ago and are only just applying for Child Benefit now. Do you know roughly how many months back Child Benefit can be claimed for when applying late?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure actually. That's one of the things I'm worried about. Can Child Benefit be backdated at all? I hope we haven't lost the money for those 4 months.

[root_agent]: That's a very valid concern, Tom. I understand why you'd want to know. 

Child Benefit can be backdated, but unfortunately, it can only be backdated for a maximum of **3 months**. So, while you will be able to claim, you won’t receive payment for the very first month after your baby was born.



Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or perhaps another benefit you'd like to explore?

[evaluation_judge]: So just to confirm, we can get the Child Benefit payments for 3 out of the 4 months since our baby was born, but we've lost out on that first month's payment? That's unfortunate, but I'm glad we can at least get most of it backdated.

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly, Tom. Yes, you will be able to claim for the last 3 months, but the first month's payment won't be backdated. 

I'm glad you feel you can at least get most of it backdated – it's always good to know where you stand.

Is there anything else at all I can help you with today? Perhaps information on how to actually *make* the claim, or any other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. We'll go ahead and make the claim right away to avoid losing any more money. Thank you for the information!

✓ The agent correctly informed me that Child Benefit can only be backdated for 3 months, meaning we would lose the first month's payment, which matches the expected outcome of being eligible but only for the last 3 months.
