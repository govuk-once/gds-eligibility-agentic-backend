[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Karen and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Karen, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand whether you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?


[evaluation_judge]: My son Ryan is 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful. Is Ryan currently in full-time education, or undertaking an apprenticeship?

[evaluation_judge]: Ryan has just left school and started an Intermediate Apprenticeship. It's government-funded and he's doing it here in England. He still lives at home with me.

[root_agent]: Thanks for that information. Just to confirm, is this apprenticeship his only activity, or is he also doing anything else, like part-time work or further study alongside it?

[evaluation_judge]: This apprenticeship is his only activity. He's just started it after finishing school.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. And to be certain, you are Ryan's parent and are financially responsible for him?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm his mum and financially responsible for him. It's just the two of us at home.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided, as Ryan has started an apprenticeship in England and is over 16, you are unfortunately no longer eligible for Child Benefit. 

Do you have any questions about this, or would you like me to explain the reasoning in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Can you please explain why I'm no longer eligible? I thought I would still get Child Benefit while he's training.

[root_agent]: You’re right to ask for clarification – it can be confusing! While staying in full-time education *does* qualify a child for Child Benefit, starting a government-funded apprenticeship in England is considered a disqualifying event, even though it’s a form of training.

The rules state that Child Benefit usually ends when a child turns 16, but can continue if they are:

*   completing full-time education until they turn 18
*   in approved training

However, an apprenticeship doesn’t fall under the category of ‘approved training’ for Child Benefit purposes in England.

I understand this isn't the news you were hoping for, and I apologise for any inconvenience. Would you like me to point you towards the official government guidance on this, or is there anything else I can help you with?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's clear enough, thank you. I'm disappointed as I didn't realize apprenticeships weren't covered. When should I stop my claim?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome. You should stop your claim from the date Ryan started his apprenticeship. It’s important to inform the Child Benefit office as soon as possible to avoid overpayment, which you would need to repay.

You can find details on how to report a change in circumstances, and end your claim, on the government website. Though I'm unable to provide a direct link, searching "report a change for Child Benefit" on the gov.uk website should take you to the correct page.



Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly advised that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since my son has started an apprenticeship in England, which is a disqualifying event. This matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
