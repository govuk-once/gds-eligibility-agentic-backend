[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a user who's inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility for their child in custody. I'll follow all the rules and evaluate the agent based on their response.

Hi, i'm Lisa and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Lisa, it’s lovely to speak with you. I’m here to help you understand your eligibility for Child Benefit.

To start, and as per the guidelines, could you tell me – is Mark currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Mark isn't living with me at the moment. He's been sentenced to a youth custody center. He's 15 years old and has been there for about 10 weeks now. He's serving a 6-month sentence. I was claiming Child Benefit for him before this happened, and I'm wondering if I'm still eligible to receive it.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Lisa. That’s very helpful information.

Let me just double-check something. Could you confirm for me – is Mark currently in custody or prison?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Mark is currently in a youth custody center. He's been there for 10 weeks now as part of his 6-month sentence.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you again for confirming that. Now, I need to check a specific point regarding the length of time a child spends in custody. 

Could you tell me, has Mark been in custody for more than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he has been in custody for 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lisa. I appreciate you confirming that.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that Mark is currently in custody and has been there for over 8 weeks – I need to advise you that you will likely no longer be eligible for Child Benefit.

The guidelines state that Child Benefit typically stops if a child is in custody for more than 8 weeks. Since Mark has been in custody for 10 weeks, it appears that the benefit will cease.

Do you have any questions about this, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: I was afraid that might be the case, but thank you for confirming. Does this mean the benefit has already stopped, or will it stop from now? Also, when Mark is released after his 6-month sentence is complete, will I need to reapply for Child Benefit or will it automatically start again?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good set of follow-up questions, Lisa. Let’s address them one by one.

Currently, because Mark has been in custody for over 8 weeks, Child Benefit is likely to have stopped from the date he entered custody. However, the exact date it stopped would depend on when exactly he was placed in the custody center. 

Regarding his release, when Mark is released from custody after his 6-month sentence, you *will* need to reapply for Child Benefit. The benefit won’t automatically restart. You’ll need to provide updated information about his living situation and circumstances. 

Do you want me to explain any part of that process in more detail, or would you like me to clarify anything else regarding the reapplication?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all clear to me now. I understand the benefit will have stopped and I'll need to reapply when he's released. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.

✓ The agent correctly informed me that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since my son has been in custody for more than 8 weeks (10 weeks), which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
