[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Maria, it's understandable you’re trying to understand your eligibility for Child Benefit. I’m here to help with that.

To start, could you confirm for me, has your daughter been in hospital for longer than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my daughter has been in the hospital for 14 weeks now. It's been very difficult. I visit her every day to keep her company.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That’s a lot to deal with. 

Now, I want to ask you about spending money on your daughter. Does the parent “regularly spend money” on the child’s upkeep, such as buying food, clothes, or treats?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't spend money on those things because the hospital provides everything she needs - they give her meals, hospital gowns, and the basic necessities. I just visit her every day and spend time with her, but I don't bring things like food, clothes, or gifts.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like you’re doing everything you can to support her while she’s in the hospital.

Just to be absolutely clear, the Child Benefit rules have an exception for children who are in hospital for longer than 12 weeks. However, this exception *requires* that the parent “regularly spend money” on the child’s upkeep. Since you aren’t spending any money on her – as the hospital provides everything – it means that, unfortunately, you won’t qualify for Child Benefit in this situation.

Do you understand that, based on the information you’ve provided, you’re not currently eligible for Child Benefit due to the spending requirement exception?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter has been in the hospital for more than 12 weeks, and I'm not regularly spending money on her upkeep, even though I visit her every day. That's disappointing, but I appreciate the explanation.

[root_agent]: I completely understand your disappointment, Maria. It’s certainly a frustrating situation when you’re not receiving the benefit you were hoping for. 

I’m glad I could clearly explain the reasoning behind the decision. Is there anything else I can help you with today, or would you like me to reiterate any part of the process for you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know about Child Benefit eligibility given my situation. Thank you for the clear explanation.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my child has been in hospital for over 12 weeks (14 weeks) and I do not regularly spend money on her upkeep, which is required for the exception to apply after 12 weeks.
