[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a UK resident in this scenario who is seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Jessica and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Jessica, it’s lovely to speak with you. I’m happy to help you with that.

To start, could you tell me how many children you have in total?

[evaluation_judge]: I have one son, Liam. He's 18 years old and lives with me. I'm a single mother raising him on my own since he's estranged from his father.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So, you have one son, Liam, who is 18 years old and lives with you.

Let’s delve a little deeper into Liam’s situation. Is Liam currently receiving any benefits in his own right, such as Universal Credit or perhaps any other type of assistance?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Liam has started claiming Universal Credit in his own right recently. He's currently studying for his A-levels, but he needed some financial help for his personal living costs since he has no income. He was able to successfully claim Universal Credit.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. That’s very helpful information.

Just to confirm, Liam is 18 years old, living with you, and he’s recently started receiving Universal Credit to help with his personal living costs while he’s studying for his A-levels?

And he has no income of his own?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. He's 18, living with me, studying for his A-levels, and he recently started receiving Universal Credit since he has no income of his own. I'm his mother and take care of most household expenses, but he needed some money for his personal expenses.

[root_agent]: Okay, Jessica, thank you for confirming all of that.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that Liam is 18, living with you, studying for his A-levels, and receiving Universal Credit – I need to check something specific about Child Benefit eligibility. 

The government rules state that you stop getting Child Benefit if the child starts receiving Universal Credit (or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right. 

Could you confirm that Liam *hasn’t* previously received any other benefits in his own right before starting Universal Credit?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right, he hasn't received any other benefits before starting Universal Credit. This is his first time claiming any benefits on his own. Is this going to affect my Child Benefit eligibility?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Jessica.

Yes, unfortunately, Liam’s recent start to receiving Universal Credit will likely affect your Child Benefit eligibility. The government rules state that if a child starts receiving Universal Credit (or ESA) they stop getting Child Benefit.

Therefore, based on the information we’ve discussed, I’m afraid you are unlikely to be eligible for Child Benefit at this time.

Do you have any questions about this outcome, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing to hear. So just to be completely clear - because Liam is receiving Universal Credit himself, I can't claim Child Benefit for him anymore? Even though he's still in education and living with me?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit on the crucial point, Jessica. Yes, exactly. Because Liam is receiving Universal Credit, you are no longer eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, regardless of the fact that he’s still in education and living with you.

It’s a common situation and it’s based directly on the government’s guidelines regarding benefit entitlement. 

I understand this might be disappointing, and I’m sorry that it’s impacting your circumstances. Is there anything else I can help you with today, perhaps regarding alternative support options or understanding how this might affect other benefits you receive?

[evaluation_judge]: That's helpful to understand, thank you. No other questions right now, but I appreciate the clear explanation about why I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore since Liam is getting Universal Credit himself.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Jessica. I’m glad I could provide a clear explanation. 

If anything changes in Liam’s situation – for example, if he stops receiving Universal Credit – it’s always worth checking the government website ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit)) to see if your eligibility could be reinstated.

Thank you for speaking with me today. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, I'll keep that in mind. Goodbye!

✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit because my child (Liam) is receiving Universal Credit in his own right, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
