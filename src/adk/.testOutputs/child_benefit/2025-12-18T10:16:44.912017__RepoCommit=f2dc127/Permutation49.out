[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. Let's proceed carefully and ensure we follow all the guidelines.

Hello there! I'm here to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you tell me how old is the child you’re considering for Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: My son Tom is 17 years old. I'm wondering if I can claim Child Benefit for him.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. So, Tom is 17 years old. 

To help me understand your situation fully, could you tell me a little bit about what Tom is doing right now? Specifically, is he currently at school, or is he involved in any other type of education or training?

[evaluation_judge]: Tom is taking a computer coding course right now. He's not being paid for it, but his future employer is paying for all the course fees. They've made an agreement with him that he'll join their company after he completes the course.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. That’s very helpful. 

Just to be completely clear, this computer coding course is being funded entirely by Tom’s future employer as part of an agreement that he will work for them after he finishes the course, and he’s not receiving any payment for it? 

(I’m referring to the information on the gov.uk website about “doing a course with an employer’s agreement – for example, to get a job” being excluded from approved education).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. The course is fully funded by his future employer with the understanding that he'll work for them after he completes it. He isn't getting any payment during the course - they're just covering all the course fees.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. I appreciate the detailed explanation.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that Tom is 17, undertaking a course fully funded by his future employer with an agreement to work for them afterwards, and this isn’t considered ‘approved education’ – I need to advise that you are unlikely to be eligible for Child Benefit for him at this time. 

The guidance states that courses like this, where the funding comes from an employer for the purpose of future employment, are not included in the definition of ‘approved education’ for Child Benefit purposes. 

Do you have any other circumstances you’d like to discuss that might affect your eligibility, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's fine. I just wanted to check if I could still claim Child Benefit while he's doing this course. Thank you for explaining the situation clearly.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my son's education arrangement (a course with employer agreement) is excluded from approved education for Child Benefit purposes.
