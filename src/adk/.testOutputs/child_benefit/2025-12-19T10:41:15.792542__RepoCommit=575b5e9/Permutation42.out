[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Sian, a 17-year-old from Cardiff who's started a Foundation Apprenticeship and is inquiring about benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Sian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sian, it's lovely to speak with you. To help me understand if you might be eligible, could you tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sian. And are you currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I've left school and I've started a Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales. It's funded by the Welsh Government.

[root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know. Could you tell me, who do you live with?

[evaluation_judge]: I live with my mother in Cardiff.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know. Just to clarify, is your mother your only parent, or do you have another parent who you live with or who contributes to your care?

[evaluation_judge]: It's just my mother I live with. She's my only parent caring for me.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sian. To confirm, this Foundation Apprenticeship is a Welsh Government funded apprenticeship, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. It's a Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government.

[root_agent]: Great, thanks for confirming. And just so I fully understand, is this apprenticeship your only activity, or are you also doing anything else, like part-time work?

[evaluation_judge]: This Foundation Apprenticeship is my main activity right now. I'm not doing any part-time work alongside it.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sian. Based on the information you've provided – that you are 17, live with your mother, are undertaking a Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales funded by the Welsh Government, and aren't currently working – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for Child Benefit. They properly recognized that while apprenticeships are usually disqualifying, Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are an exception and count as "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes.
