[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a user in this scenario to test the other agent's knowledge about benefits eligibility for a child detained under the Mental Health Act.

Hi, i'm Simon's dad and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. To start, could you please tell me how old Simon is?





[evaluation_judge]: My son Simon is 15 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And is Simon currently living with you, or is he living somewhere else at the moment?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, Simon has been detained under the Mental Health Act and has been placed in a secure psychiatric unit. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: I understand. Thank you for letting me know. To clarify, is this secure psychiatric unit a hospital or a custody setting? Knowing this will help me assess eligibility.

[evaluation_judge]: It's a secure psychiatric unit in a hospital setting. He's there for mental health treatment, not as a criminal matter or anything like that.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. And to confirm, has Simon been in the unit for more or less than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Just one final question for now - is Simon usually a UK resident?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he normally lives at home with us. We're UK residents.

[root_agent]: Thank you for all of that information. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you may be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Simon for a further 2 weeks, as he is in hospital and has been there for 10 weeks, with eligibility lasting up to 12 weeks in this situation. 

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or perhaps tell you about any other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you please explain a bit more about why it's 12 weeks in this situation? I wasn't sure how long I could continue to receive the benefit while he's in the hospital.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Child Benefit rules are different depending on *why* a child isn’t living with you. If a child is in hospital – or in a similar situation like a secure psychiatric unit providing medical treatment – the rules allow you to continue claiming Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks. 

If the child was in custody, or in care, the limit would be 8 weeks. However, because Simon is receiving mental health treatment in a hospital setting under the Mental Health Act, the 12-week rule applies. He's been there for 10 weeks already, leaving 2 weeks remaining where you can continue to claim.

Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense now. So I can continue receiving Child Benefit for 2 more weeks since Simon has been in the psychiatric unit for 10 weeks, and the limit is 12 weeks for hospital settings. Thank you for explaining that clearly.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today regarding benefits or any other questions you may have?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that I would be eligible for Child Benefit until 12 weeks (meaning 2 more weeks since my son has been in the psychiatric unit for 10 weeks already). This matches the expected outcome that Simon's situation falls under the hospital/residential accommodation rules with a 12-week timeline, not the 8-week custody rule.
