[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lisa and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lisa, I'm happy to help. To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: My son Mark is 15 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lisa. Is Mark currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he isn't living with me at the moment.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Is Mark currently in custody, such as in a youth offender institution or prison?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's in a youth custody center. He was sentenced to 6 months and has been there for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Lisa. Has Mark been in custody for more than 8 weeks now?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's been there for 10 weeks so far.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Lisa. Based on the information you've provided, as Mark is 15, not living with you, and has been in custody for over 8 weeks, unfortunately, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. 

I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome. They accurately determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit since my son Mark has been in youth custody for more than 8 weeks (10 weeks), which exceeds the 8-week limit for continuing to receive Child Benefit while a child is in custody.
