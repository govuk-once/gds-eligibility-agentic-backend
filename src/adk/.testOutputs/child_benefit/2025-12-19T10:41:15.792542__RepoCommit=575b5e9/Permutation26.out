[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Mo, I'm happy to help. To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are applying for Child Benefit for?


[evaluation_judge]: My son Zahid is 15 years old. He actually lives with my sister, his aunt, but I want to apply for Child Benefit for him since she doesn't claim it.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Does your sister claim any benefits for Zahid currently?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my sister doesn't claim any benefits for Zahid at all. That's why I want to check if I could apply for Child Benefit for him.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. Do you contribute financially towards Zahid's upkeep? If so, roughly how much do you contribute each week?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I send £15 a week to my sister for Zahid's upkeep. My mother (Zahid's grandmother) also sends £15 a week to help with his expenses.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just to confirm, the total amount contributed by both you and your mother each week is £30, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I contribute £15 per week and my mother contributes another £15 per week, so the total is £30 per week for Zahid's care.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit for Zahid. Even though Zahid lives with your sister, and you contribute less than the full amount individually, the combined contributions from you and your mother meet the required threshold. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





[evaluation_judge]: No, that's exactly what I needed to know. Thank you for explaining my eligibility for Child Benefit for Zahid.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit. They recognized that while my individual contribution of £15 is below the threshold, the combined contributions from me and my mother (£30 total) exceed the required amount of £26.05, making me eligible.
