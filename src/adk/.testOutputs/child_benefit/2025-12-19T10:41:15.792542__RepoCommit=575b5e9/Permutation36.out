[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Kelly's mom Joan and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Joan, I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me how old is the child you are claiming for?


[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Kelly is 16 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And is Kelly currently in approved education, such as school, college, or an apprenticeship?

[evaluation_judge]: Kelly just finished her GCSEs in June. She's been accepted into college to start her A-levels in September, but she's not actually in school right now since it's August - we're in that summer break period. That's what I'm worried about.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So, Kelly has been accepted to start college in September. Just to confirm, is this a full-time education course?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she'll be doing her A-levels full-time at the college starting in September.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know. Has Kelly ever been claimed for Child Benefit before?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been receiving Child Benefit for Kelly all along.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. Just to be clear, is Kelly currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she lives with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming all of that information, Joan. Based on what you've told me, as Kelly is under 20, has been in approved education, and will be starting a full-time college course in September, you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit during this summer break. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would remain eligible for Child Benefit during the summer break period, as Kelly has been accepted into approved further education starting in September.
