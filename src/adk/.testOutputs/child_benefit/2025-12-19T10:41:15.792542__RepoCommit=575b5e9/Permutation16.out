[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Hannah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Hannah, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and whether you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me the age of the child you are referring to?

[evaluation_judge]: My son Oliver is 14 years old. He has a rare condition and had to be sent to a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now, while I've stayed here in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hannah. To clarify, is your son currently receiving treatment *in* hospital in the USA?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's currently receiving treatment in a hospital in the USA. The specialists there are the only ones who can properly treat his condition.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And to confirm, did Oliver go to the USA *specifically* to receive hospital treatment for his condition?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. We only sent him to the USA specifically for this hospital treatment. The specialists in that particular American hospital have expertise in treating his rare condition that wasn't available here in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Hannah. Do you, as his mother, continue to financially support Oliver while he is receiving treatment in the USA?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do. I pay for all his incidental costs while he's there, and I try to visit him when possible, though it's expensive to travel back and forth.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hannah. Based on what you've told me, and considering Oliver is 14, has been in hospital abroad for more than 12 weeks, went abroad specifically for hospital treatment, and you continue to financially support him, you are likely still eligible for Child Benefit. 

Would you like me to explain this in a little more detail, or perhaps explore other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to understand a bit more about why I'm still eligible despite him being away for so long, if you don't mind explaining.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Hannah. Generally, Child Benefit eligibility can be affected when a child lives outside the UK. However, there are exceptions, and one of those exceptions applies to children who are in hospital abroad.

As long as your son went to the USA *specifically* to receive hospital treatment, and he remains in hospital there, you can continue to claim Child Benefit. This is also true as long as you are still financially supporting him. The 12-week rule also comes into play - because he’s been in hospital for over 12 weeks, eligibility continues.

Essentially, the rules recognise that a parent continues to have costs associated with a child receiving necessary medical care abroad, even if the child isn't physically present in the UK.



Does that make things a little clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make things much clearer. Thank you for explaining. I was worried that since he's been gone for over 3 months now that I might lose the benefit, so it's a relief to hear that I'm still eligible given the circumstances. I appreciate your help with this.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Hannah! I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. It's perfectly understandable to be concerned about these things. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you'd like information on claiming expenses related to travelling to visit Oliver, or any other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit despite my son being in hospital abroad for more than 12 weeks, as he went specifically for medical treatment and I continue to financially support him.
