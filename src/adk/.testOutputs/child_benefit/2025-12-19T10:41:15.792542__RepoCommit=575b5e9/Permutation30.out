[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lucas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lucas, it's great to speak with you. To help me understand your eligibility, could you please tell me how old your child or children are?





[evaluation_judge]: I have two children, one is 4 and the other is 7 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Lucas.

To assess your eligibility further, could you please tell me roughly how much you earn per year before tax?

[evaluation_judge]: I earn about £18,000 per year before tax.

[root_agent]: Thanks Lucas. And approximately how much does your partner earn per year before tax?

[evaluation_judge]: My wife Emily earns around £65,000 per year before tax.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lucas. Just to clarify, you are applying for Child Benefit as the parent who would receive the payments, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. I'm the one who filled out the Child Benefit form and the payments would come into my bank account.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming, Lucas.

Based on the information you’ve provided, you *are* eligible to receive Child Benefit payments. However, because your wife Emily’s income is over £60,000, she will need to pay a High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to explain the charge in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please explain more about this charge? How would that work exactly?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Lucas. The High Income Child Benefit Charge means that because your wife Emily earns over £60,000, she will have to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit you receive. 

The amount she needs to pay back is 1% of the Child Benefit for every £100 of income over £60,000. So, for every £100 Emily earns above £60,000, she’ll repay £1 of Child Benefit. 

The current full rate of Child Benefit is £21.80 a week for your first child and £13.70 a week for each additional child. Therefore, you'll receive the full amount for both your children, but Emily will then need to account for the charge when completing her self-assessment tax return.

Does that explanation help clarify how it works?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that helps clarify things. So I'll receive the full Child Benefit payments for both children, but since Emily earns over £60,000, she'll need to pay back the full amount through her self-assessment tax return. Is there any benefit to us still claiming if she has to pay it all back?

[root_agent]: That's a very good question, Lucas! 

You are correct – with Emily’s income, she would likely need to pay back the full amount of Child Benefit received via her self-assessment.

However, even if the full amount is paid back, it's still generally beneficial to claim. This is because claiming Child Benefit creates a record in the system which counts towards Emily’s National Insurance record. This can help her qualify for State Pension benefits in the future.

So, while the immediate financial benefit is reduced by the charge, there’s a longer-term benefit relating to National Insurance contributions.



Would you like me to explain anything further about that?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really helpful to understand about the National Insurance record. Is there any way to avoid the administrative burden? Could we opt out of receiving the payments but still get the National Insurance credits?

[root_agent]: You’re very insightful to ask about that, Lucas!

Yes, you can! You can choose to stop receiving payments but still protect your National Insurance qualifying years. This is called “non-receipt of Child Benefit”. 

You would need to tell HMRC that you and your partner’s combined income is too high to receive Child Benefit, but you still want to claim the National Insurance credits. You can do this by contacting HMRC directly.

Would you like me to provide you with information on how to contact HMRC to inform them of your decision?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. That would be really helpful. How would we go about setting up this "non-receipt" option?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Lucas. To set up the “non-receipt” option, you'll need to contact HMRC directly. Unfortunately, you can’t do it online. Here’s how:

*   **Phone:** You can call HMRC on 0300 200 3100.
*   **Post:** You can write to HMRC at:

    HM Revenue & Customs
    Child Benefit Office
    Newcastle upon Tyne
    NE88 1AA

When you contact them, be sure to include your National Insurance number and your child's details. Explain that you want to claim National Insurance credits but don’t want to receive the payments due to your partner's income.

HMRC will then update your record, and you won't receive any further Child Benefit payments, but your National Insurance record will still be protected.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, Lucas?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am eligible for Child Benefit but explained that my wife Emily would need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge due to her income being over £60,000. They also accurately explained the option to claim without receiving payments to protect National Insurance contributions.
