[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Mike, a father who lives apart from his 12-year-old daughter, and wants to understand his eligibility for Child Benefit.

Hi, i'm Mike and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Mike, it's lovely to speak with you. I can certainly help you with that. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 45 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mike. And how old is your daughter?

[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Emma is 12 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks Mike. Does Emma live with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Emma lives with her mother. We live separately.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that, Mike. Does Emma’s mother currently claim Child Benefit for her?

[evaluation_judge]: No, her mother doesn't claim Child Benefit for Emma.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mike. Roughly how much money do you contribute towards Emma's expenses each week or month? An approximate amount is fine for now.

[evaluation_judge]: I transfer £10 a week to her mother for food, and I also send Emma a birthday present once a year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Mike. Just to clarify, the £10 a week is specifically for Emma's food, correct? And aside from the birthday present, that £10 is your regular financial contribution to her upkeep?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The £10 a week is meant to help with Emma's food, and I send her a birthday present once a year. That's my regular contribution to her upkeep.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mike. Do you have any other financial contributions towards Emma, or contribute in other ways, such as paying for activities or clothing?

[evaluation_judge]: No, just the £10 a week for food and the birthday present once a year. That's all I contribute financially.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for being so clear, Mike. To check eligibility for Child Benefit when a child lives with someone else, the contribution needs to be at least £26.05 a week. 

Are you aware of this weekly amount?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that. I didn't know I needed to contribute that much per week to be eligible.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Mike. As you contribute £10 a week, which is less than the £26.05 required, unfortunately, you wouldn’t currently be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma. 

I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain the rules around this in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the rules to me. I'm a bit disappointed as I thought I could claim since her mother isn't claiming.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Mike. I understand your disappointment. Even though Emma's mother isn't claiming, there are specific rules when a child lives with someone else and someone else wants to claim Child Benefit.

The key is 'responsibility' for the child. When a child doesn't live with you, you're considered responsible if you contribute financially to their upkeep *at least* as much as the full amount of Child Benefit – which is currently £26.05 a week for the eldest child. Your £10 a week, and the yearly birthday present, doesn’t quite meet that threshold. 

The government considers this level of contribution as demonstrating a significant financial responsibility for the child’s well-being. 

Does that make the situation a little clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make it clearer. So I'd need to contribute at least £26.05 per week to Emma's upkeep to be considered eligible for Child Benefit since she doesn't live with me. Since I'm only contributing £10 weekly plus an annual birthday present, I don't qualify. 

Thank you for explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Mike. You've understood the rules perfectly. I'm glad I could clarify things for you. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because my weekly contribution (£10) is less than the required minimum contribution (£26.05/week) to be considered "responsible" for a child who doesn't live with me.
