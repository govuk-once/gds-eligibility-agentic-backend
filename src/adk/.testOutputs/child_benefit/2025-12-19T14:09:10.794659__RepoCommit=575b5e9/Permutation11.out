[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Karen and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Karen, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?

[evaluation_judge]: My son Ryan is 17 years old. He's just started an Intermediate Apprenticeship that's funded by the government. He still lives at home with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Karen. Is Ryan currently in full-time education, or is the apprenticeship his primary activity?





[evaluation_judge]: The apprenticeship is his primary activity. He left school and has just started this Intermediate Apprenticeship in England.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Karen. Just to confirm, is this apprenticeship a government-funded apprenticeship in England?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. And just to be absolutely clear, are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Ryan?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been receiving Child Benefit for Ryan while he was in school. I'm wondering if I can continue receiving it now that he's started his apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Karen. Based on the information you've provided, unfortunately, starting a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England means Ryan is no longer eligible for Child Benefit. You will need to inform HMRC to stop your claim. 

Would you like me to explain the reasoning behind this, or are you happy with just knowing the outcome?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to understand the reasoning behind this, please. I thought I might still be eligible since he's only 17 and still living at home.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Karen. The rules state that Child Benefit generally stops when a child turns 16, *unless* they are:

*   continuing in relevant full-time education
*   starting a qualifying course of advanced education

While Ryan is 17 and living at home, starting a government-funded apprenticeship in England is considered a disqualifying event. It’s treated differently from remaining in full-time education like A-levels or university. 

Essentially, the apprenticeship is seen as entering employment or training, rather than continuing in approved education for Child Benefit purposes.



Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense, although it's disappointing. So because he's doing an apprenticeship rather than staying in school or college, I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to contact HMRC to stop my claim. Thank you for explaining that to me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Karen. I understand it’s disappointing to hear, even when the reasoning is clear. You are correct – because he’s started the apprenticeship, you’ll need to inform HMRC to stop your claim. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on other benefits you might be eligible for, or guidance on contacting HMRC?

[evaluation_judge]: No thank you, that's all I needed to know for now. I'll get in touch with HMRC to stop my claim. Thanks for your help today.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Karen. I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. If you do have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. 

Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since my son Ryan started a government-funded apprenticeship in England, which is a disqualifying event for Child Benefit. This matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
