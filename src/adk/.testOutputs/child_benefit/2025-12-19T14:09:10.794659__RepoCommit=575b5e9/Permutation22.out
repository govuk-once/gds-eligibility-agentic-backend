[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Jenny and engage with the agent under test regarding benefits eligibility for my son who has been hospitalized.

Hi, i'm Jenny and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Jenny, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me if you are currently claiming Child Benefit for your child?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do get Child Benefit for my son Arthur, he's 7 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Jenny.

Has Arthur been in hospital at any point in the last year?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he has. Arthur was in the hospital for 10 weeks, then came home for about 2 weeks, but unfortunately got sick again and had to go back to the hospital after 15 days. He's been back in hospital for 3 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Jenny. It sounds like a very worrying time for you and Arthur.

Just to clarify, when Arthur was discharged the first time, was it for a full 2 weeks at home, or was that a shorter period? Knowing the exact dates will help me understand the situation better.

[evaluation_judge]: He was home for about 2 weeks - 15 days to be exact. He got discharged after his 10-week stay, was home for 15 days, and then had to be readmitted. He's now been in hospital for another 3 weeks since going back in.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Jenny. That's very helpful.

To confirm, is Arthur still currently in hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Arthur is still in the hospital. He's been there for 3 weeks during this second stay.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Jenny. 

While Arthur is in hospital, are you still covering his usual costs – things like clothes, toys, or pocket money – as you would if he were at home?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I still buy him some new clothes occasionally and bring him toys and books, but obviously he's getting his meals at the hospital and they're taking care of most of his needs. I'm visiting him every day though, so I do spend money on travel to the hospital and little treats to cheer him up.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detail, Jenny. It's good you're able to visit and bring him little comforts.

Just so I can be sure I have all the information, roughly how much would you say you spend *each week* on things for Arthur while he is in hospital – including travel, treats, clothes, and toys? An approximate amount is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: I'd say I spend about £20-25 per week on travel to the hospital, maybe another £10-15 on treats and small gifts for him, and occasionally something bigger like a new set of pajamas or a game. So probably around £40 a week on average.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Jenny. That's very helpful.

Based on the information you've provided, it looks like Arthur has been in hospital for a total of 13 weeks now (10 weeks + 3 weeks), and his stays are linked because he was readmitted within 28 days of being discharged. 

Unfortunately, as you aren't spending more than £40 a week on his upkeep while he’s in hospital, your Child Benefit may have stopped after the cumulative 12th week of his hospital stay. 

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or would you like to know how to check the status of your payments?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you explain a bit more about why my benefit would stop? I'm still his mum and taking care of him. I don't understand why the benefit would stop just because he's in hospital.

[root_agent]: Of course, Jenny, I understand your frustration. It seems unfair, and I'll do my best to explain.

Child Benefit continues while a child is in hospital, but there's a limit of 12 weeks. If a child is in hospital for longer than that *continuously*, or if hospital stays are linked – meaning they're readmitted within 28 days of being discharged – those weeks count towards the 12-week limit.

In your case, Arthur was in hospital for 10 weeks, then home for 15 days, and then back in hospital for 3 weeks. Because the second stay started within 28 days of the first ending, these periods are added together. That brings the total to 13 weeks.

The exception to this is if you're still meeting the usual costs of caring for Arthur – things like clothes, toys, and his general upkeep – and are spending more than the standard rate (which changes, but is currently around £40 a week) on those costs *while he is in hospital*. If you are, the benefit can continue. However, as you mentioned you're spending around £40 a week, the benefit will likely have stopped after the 12th week.

It's designed this way because when a child is in hospital for a long period, the NHS takes on a lot of the costs that you would normally cover.

Does that explanation make things a bit clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make it clearer, though it's still difficult to accept. So basically, because Arthur has been in the hospital for more than 12 weeks total (counting both stays as linked since he was readmitted within 28 days), and I'm not spending more than the standard rate on his upkeep while he's in hospital, the Child Benefit has likely stopped. That seems to be what you're telling me.

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Jenny. That is exactly right. Because of the linked hospital stays exceeding 12 weeks, and your expenditure being around the standard rate, your Child Benefit has likely stopped.

I understand it's difficult to accept, especially when you're already dealing with the stress of Arthur being unwell.

Would you like me to provide you with information on how to report a change in circumstances, or to check if your payments have indeed stopped? Alternatively, I can provide details on other benefits you might be eligible for.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that I am not eligible for Child Benefit since Arthur's cumulative hospital stay exceeds 12 weeks (10+3=13) and the stays are linked because he returned within 28 days (after 15 days). The agent accurately applied the linking rule and confirmed I'm not eligible, matching the expected outcome.
