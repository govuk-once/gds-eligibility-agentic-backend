[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of a UK resident seeking benefits information.

Hi, i'm Gary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Gary, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm here to help you understand which benefits you might be eligible for.

To start, do you have any children living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have my son Ben who's living with me. He's 17.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. That's good to know.

Is your son currently in any form of full-time education, such as school, college, or university? Or is he perhaps undertaking an apprenticeship?





[evaluation_judge]: No, actually Ben left school in June and isn't in college. He's registered with the local youth careers service though and is actively looking for an apprenticeship. He hasn't found one yet.

[root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know, Gary. That’s helpful. 

Just to confirm, is Ben’s 17th birthday already passed?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's 17 now.

[root_agent]: Okay, Gary. And to be clear, when Ben left school in June, was that the end of a full-time education, and has he been actively seeking education or training since then?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. He finished his full-time education in June when he left school, and since then he's been registered with the youth careers service actively looking for an apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. This is all very helpful.

Do you meet the UK residency rules? In other words, are you a UK resident?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm a UK resident.

[root_agent]: Great, Gary. And finally, is Ben currently receiving any state-funded care, such as being in foster care or residential care?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's not in any kind of state-funded care. He lives at home with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions, Gary. 

Based on what you've told me – you are responsible for your 17-year-old son Ben, who left full-time education in June and is actively seeking an apprenticeship while registered with the youth careers service – you are likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

However, because Ben is no longer in full-time education, this eligibility is currently limited to a period of up to 20 weeks from when he left school. As it's currently August, you are still within that timeframe.

Does this information make sense? Would you like me to explain anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: So I'm eligible for Child Benefit right now, but only for a limited time since he left school? How long exactly do I have left since he finished in June?

[root_agent]: You are exactly right, Gary – you are eligible for Child Benefit right now, but it's time-limited since Ben left school.

Since he finished his education in June, and we're currently in August, you have roughly 6-8 weeks remaining within the 20-week window. To be precise, the 20 weeks would be calculated from the end of June.

It's important to note that if Ben *does* return to full-time education or start an approved apprenticeship, that would restart the eligibility for Child Benefit.



Would you like me to clarify anything else about this?

[evaluation_judge]: No that's clear. So I can still receive Child Benefit for a few more weeks, but if Ben doesn't start an apprenticeship or go back to education by the end of the 20 weeks, then I'll no longer be eligible?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Gary. That's absolutely correct. You can continue to receive Child Benefit for a few more weeks, as long as it’s within that 20-week period from when Ben finished school in June. 

If he doesn’t go back into full-time education or start an approved apprenticeship before the 20 weeks is up, then your entitlement to Child Benefit will end.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thanks for helping me understand my situation.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit during the extension period of up to 20 weeks after my son left education (since he is registered with a youth careers service and actively looking for an apprenticeship). This matches the expected outcome.
