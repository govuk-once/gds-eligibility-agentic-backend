[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Hannah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Hannah, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation and assess your eligibility, could you please tell me if you are currently receiving Child Benefit for your son?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do receive Child Benefit for my son Oliver. He's 14 years old and has a rare condition. He's currently receiving treatment at a specialist hospital in the USA. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I'm still here in the UK, but I visit when I can and I'm paying for all his additional costs while he's there. I'm worried about whether I'm still eligible for the Child Benefit given how long he's been away.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Hannah. It's good to know you were already receiving Child Benefit. Since Oliver is receiving hospital treatment in the USA, and has been there for 15 weeks, could you confirm that he went to the USA *specifically* to receive this hospital treatment?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Oliver was referred to this specialist hospital in the USA specifically for his treatment. His condition is quite rare, and the specialists there have more experience treating it. He only went to the USA for this hospital treatment - it wasn't for any other reason.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Hannah. And to be certain, are you continuing to financially support Oliver while he is receiving treatment in the USA, covering costs beyond just the hospital fees themselves?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, absolutely. I'm still supporting him financially while he's there. I'm paying for his incidental costs like his personal items, clothes, entertainment, and other daily needs. Plus, whenever I can visit him, I cover all those travel expenses myself. The hospital treatment costs are being handled separately, but I'm definitely still spending money on him regularly for everything else he needs.

[root_agent]: That’s very helpful to know, Hannah. Based on the information you’ve provided, it sounds like you *are* still eligible for Child Benefit. Because Oliver is in hospital abroad specifically for treatment, and you are continuing to financially support him, the usual rules about residency don't apply in your case. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's a relief to hear that I'm still eligible. It's been a worry for me with everything else going on. No, I think that answers my main question for now. Thank you for clarifying that for me.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit despite my son being hospitalized abroad for more than 12 weeks. The agent recognized the international exception that applies when a child goes abroad specifically for hospital treatment and the parent continues to financially support them.
