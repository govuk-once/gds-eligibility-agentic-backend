[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi John, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible, could you tell me your age please?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks! And where do you live – with your parents, or someone else?





[evaluation_judge]: I live with my dad, Pete. It's just the two of us.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Are you currently in approved full-time education? This could be school, college, or an apprenticeship.

[evaluation_judge]: I've left school but I'm attending a local college to re-sit two GCSEs. I only have about 6 hours of supervised study each week at the college. The rest of the time I'm mostly just at home gaming.

[root_agent]: Thanks for that information. Just to clarify, those 6 hours of study are *supervised* study or tuition, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. It's 6 hours of supervised study at the college each week.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. One final question – are you financially dependent on your dad, Pete?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm financially dependent on my dad. He supports me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions, John. Based on the information you've provided, and specifically the fact that your supervised study is 6 hours a week, which is less than the 12 hours required for full-time education, it appears you may not be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or perhaps look into other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you explain why I'm not eligible a bit more? I didn't know there was an hour requirement.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Child Benefit can be paid for young people who are in approved education. However, to qualify as "full-time" education for Child Benefit purposes, the course needs to involve an average of more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or tuition. 

Because your course only involves 6 hours of supervised study, it doesn’t meet that requirement. Even though you are still under 20 and dependent on your father, the hours of study are a key factor in determining eligibility in your situation.



Does that make things a little clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yeah, that makes sense. So if my course had more than 12 hours of supervised study each week, I might have been eligible?

[root_agent]: That's correct! If your course involved more than 12 hours of supervised study or tuition each week, you likely *would* have been eligible, assuming all other criteria were met (like your age and living arrangement). It’s the amount of supervised study that makes the biggest difference in cases like yours.

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for explaining. That's helpful to know about the 12-hour requirement.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, John. I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thanks for your time.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome! Have a good day, John. If you think of anything else in the future, don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my 6 hours of supervised study doesn't meet the minimum 12 hours required to qualify as full-time education for Child Benefit purposes.
