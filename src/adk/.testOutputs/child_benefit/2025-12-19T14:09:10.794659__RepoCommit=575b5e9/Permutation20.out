[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Maria, it's lovely to speak with you.

To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 60 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. 

And could you please tell me, do you currently have any children living with you who are under 20 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my granddaughter Lucia lives with me. She's 14 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. That's helpful to know.

To clarify, are you Lucia’s parent?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not her parent. I'm her grandmother. Her parents aren't able to care for her, so she lives with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Maria. 

Is there a formal arrangement in place with the local council regarding Lucia’s care, such as a fostering arrangement, or are you caring for her through an informal family arrangement?

[evaluation_judge]: It's an informal family arrangement. There's no formal fostering arrangement or court order. Her parents just couldn't take care of her, so I stepped in. I pay for everything she needs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Maria.

To confirm, is the local council paying for Lucia’s accommodation or care in any way?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the local council isn't paying anything. I cover all of Lucia's expenses myself.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Lucia. 

You are responsible for Lucia, she is under 20, you are not her parent, there is no formal arrangement with the council, and you are financially supporting her.

Would you like me to explain a bit more about Child Benefit, or perhaps discuss other potential benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate some more information about Child Benefit and what it would mean for me. Also, are there any other benefits I might be eligible for in my situation?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Maria.

Child Benefit is a payment made to people who are responsible for a child under 20. The current rate is £21.80 a week for your first child, and £13.70 a week for each additional child. As Lucia is your only grandchild living with you, you would receive £21.80 per week. This is usually paid every four weeks.

It's important to note that Child Benefit can sometimes affect other benefits or your State Pension forecast, so it's good to be aware of this.

Now, regarding other benefits you *might* be eligible for, given your situation as a sole carer for your granddaughter, it’s worth looking into:

* **Universal Credit:** This could provide financial support based on your income and savings. Because you're covering Lucia's expenses, it might be worth exploring if you qualify.
* **Pension Credit:** As you are 60, this is a possibility depending on your state pension and other income.
* **Council Tax Reduction:** You may be able to get a discount on your Council Tax.

Would you like me to ask you some questions to see if you might be eligible for Universal Credit or Pension Credit? We can take it one step at a time.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful. I'd like to know if I might be eligible for Universal Credit or Pension Credit. Let's take it one step at a time.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Let’s start with Universal Credit.

Firstly, Maria, do you currently have any income from work – either employed or self-employed? This includes things like wages, salaries, or profits from a business.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any income from work. I'm not currently employed or running a business.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria.

And approximately how much money do you have in savings and investments – things like bank accounts, ISAs, shares, or bonds? Just a rough estimate is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: I have about £4,000 in savings in my bank account. That's all I have.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. That's good to know.

Do you receive any other benefits or pensions currently, apart from anything we've discussed already? This could include things like State Pension, Housing Benefit, or any other forms of financial support.

[evaluation_judge]: I receive my State Pension. That's my main source of income right now.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. Roughly how much is your State Pension each month? You don't need to be exact, just an approximate amount would be helpful.

[evaluation_judge]: I receive about £800 per month from my State Pension.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. That's very helpful.

Considering you have no income from work, around £4,000 in savings, and receive approximately £800 per month from your State Pension, it’s *possible* you might be eligible for a small amount of Universal Credit to help with living costs. However, the amount would likely be quite modest, as your State Pension is a significant income.

To give you a more accurate assessment, a full calculation would be needed, but this gives you a general idea.

Would you like me to switch gears now and ask you some questions relating to Pension Credit, or would you like me to explore Universal Credit in a little more detail first?

[evaluation_judge]: Let's switch to discussing Pension Credit. I'd like to know if I might be eligible for that as well.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Maria. Let’s look at Pension Credit.

Pension Credit is designed to help people of State Pension age who have modest incomes. 

Firstly, does your £800 monthly State Pension cover all of your regular expenses, or do you find it difficult to manage financially?

[evaluation_judge]: It's quite difficult to manage, especially with looking after Lucia. My £800 pension doesn't stretch very far with all our expenses.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. That's important to know.

Do you own your home outright, or do you have a mortgage or pay rent?

[evaluation_judge]: I own my home outright. I don't have a mortgage anymore.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know, Maria.

And finally, apart from Lucia, are there any other people living with you in your household?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's just me and Lucia in the household.

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria. Based on the information you’ve provided – your age (60), receiving State Pension of around £800 per month, owning your home, and being responsible for your granddaughter Lucia – you are **likely** to be eligible for Pension Credit.

Your State Pension being insufficient to cover your expenses, particularly with the additional cost of caring for Lucia, strongly suggests you’d qualify.

Pension Credit comes in two parts:

*   **Guarantee Credit:** This is for those with a low income.
*   **Savings Credit:** This is for those who have some savings or a pension, but not enough to live on comfortably.

Because you have £4,000 in savings, you may be eligible for some Savings Credit alongside the Guarantee Credit.

Would you like me to provide you with information on how to claim Pension Credit, or would you like to explore Universal Credit a bit further?

[evaluation_judge]: I would appreciate information on how to claim Pension Credit. That sounds like it could be helpful for our situation.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Maria. Here's how you can claim Pension Credit:

**You can claim Pension Credit online:** [https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit/how-to-claim](https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit/how-to-claim)

**Or you can claim by phone:**

*   **New claims:** 0800 971 2345
*   **Existing claims:** 0800 731 0469

**You will need to have the following information ready:**

*   Your National Insurance number
*   Your birth date
*   Details of your income (including your State Pension)
*   Details of your savings and investments
*   Details of any expenses you have, such as housing costs or council tax.
*   Lucia's date of birth.

It's a good idea to have this information to hand before you start your claim.

The Pension Service will assess your situation and let you know if you are eligible and how much you can receive. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today, Maria? Perhaps you’d like me to summarise the benefits we’ve discussed?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit based on my informal care arrangement for my granddaughter, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
