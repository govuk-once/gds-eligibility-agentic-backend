[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lisa and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Lisa, I'm happy to help! To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are seeking to claim Child Benefit for?


[evaluation_judge]: I have a son, Mark, who's 15 years old. I've been claiming Child Benefit for him, but I'm not sure if I'm still eligible.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Is Mark currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's not living with me at the moment. He's been sentenced to a youth custody center.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Is Mark in custody as part of a sentence from a court?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he was sentenced to 6 months in a youth custody center. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Has Mark been in custody for more than 8 weeks now?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's been in custody for about 10 weeks so far.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Lisa. Based on the details you’ve provided, as Mark has been in custody for more than 8 weeks, you are unfortunately no longer eligible for Child Benefit. I understand this may be disappointing, but I hope I've been able to clarify things for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So because he's been in custody for more than 8 weeks, I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit. That's what I was afraid of, but I wanted to be sure. Thank you for explaining that to me.

✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since my son has been in custody for more than 8 weeks (10 weeks), which exceeds the 8-week limit for maintaining eligibility.
