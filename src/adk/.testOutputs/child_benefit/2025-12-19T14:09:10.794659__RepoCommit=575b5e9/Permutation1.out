[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to speak with you. I can certainly help you with that. 

To start, are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 and in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am responsible for my son Leo. He's 8 years old and lives with us. He's currently in primary school.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear, thank you.

To clarify, are you a UK national, or do you have the right of abode in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm a UK national. Both my husband Tom and I are UK nationals living in Manchester.

[root_agent]: Wonderful, thank you for confirming.

Now, could you tell me roughly how much you and your husband earn individually per year, before tax? I understand this is personal, but it helps determine eligibility. Even a rough estimate is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: Of course. I work part-time and earn about £15,000 a year. My husband Tom is a teacher and earns around £35,000 annually.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Just to be certain, is Leo currently in hospital or receiving care in a residential setting?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Leo isn't in hospital or in any residential care. He lives at home with us.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, thank you. 

One final question for now – does either you or your husband have an individual adjusted net income of over £60,000 per year? (Adjusted net income is your total taxable income after some deductions).

[evaluation_judge]: No, neither of us has an income anywhere near that amount. As I mentioned, Tom earns £35,000 and I earn £15,000, so we're both well below that threshold.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

You are responsible for a child under 16, you are a UK national, you both live in the UK, Leo lives with you, he isn't in hospital or care, and your combined income is below the high-income threshold.

Would you like me to summarise this, or perhaps explore other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! Could you just summarize the Child Benefit for me? How much would we be likely to receive for Leo?

[root_agent]: Certainly! Here's a summary of your Child Benefit eligibility and how much you could receive:

You are eligible for Child Benefit because:

*   You are responsible for Leo, who is 8 years old and lives with you.
*   You and your husband are UK nationals.
*   Your household income is below the high-income threshold.
*   Leo isn’t currently in hospital or residential care.

As of the current tax year (2024/2025), the standard weekly rate for Child Benefit is £21.80 for your first child. Therefore, you would likely receive £21.80 per week for Leo. This amounts to approximately £1,133.60 per year.

Keep in mind that Child Benefit is usually paid directly into your bank account. Does that all make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Thank you so much for confirming our eligibility and explaining the amount we would receive for Leo. That weekly amount will definitely help with his expenses. Is there anything specific we need to do to apply for it?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help.

To apply for Child Benefit, you can do so online through the government website. You’ll need your National Insurance number, Leo’s date of birth, and your bank details to receive the payments. 

While I can't provide a direct link, if you search "apply for Child Benefit" on the [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk) website, it will be the first result.

It's worth noting that applying for Child Benefit also protects Leo's National Insurance record, which can be beneficial for him later in life, even if he doesn't receive the benefit directly.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on any other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit based on my family situation, meeting all criteria for eligibility including responsibility for my child, Leo's age, our UK national status, living arrangements, and our income being below the threshold.
