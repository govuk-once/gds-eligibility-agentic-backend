[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me how old your child is?

[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Emma is 18. She's just started university after finishing college.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that's helpful. Is the education Emma is now receiving considered "Approved Education" or "Advanced Education"? 

For example, is she studying for A-Levels, NVQ Level 3, or a university degree like a Bachelor’s degree?

[evaluation_judge]: She's just started a 3-year Bachelor's degree at the university. She still lives at home with me and commutes to university every day.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you've provided, it appears Emma is now undertaking Advanced Education.

Unfortunately, Child Benefit generally stops when a child starts Advanced Education, such as a university degree. 

Would you like me to explain this in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain a bit more about why Child Benefit stops when my daughter starts university. I thought I might still be eligible since she's only 18 and still lives at home with me.

[root_agent]: You’re right to ask – it can be a little confusing! While Emma’s age and the fact she lives at home are factors considered for Child Benefit generally, the key factor here is the type of education she's now receiving.

Child Benefit continues as long as a child is in “approved education”. This includes things like A-Levels or NVQ Level 3 qualifications. However, once a child begins "advanced education" – which includes university degrees like Emma’s Bachelor’s degree – Child Benefit typically stops. 

The rules are in place because students in advanced education are generally considered to be developing financial independence.

Does that explanation help clarify things?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that explanation helps, thank you. So even though she's still 18 and living with me, because she's started a Bachelor's degree, I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore. I understand now.

[root_agent]: You’ve understood perfectly. Even though Emma is still 18 and living at home, starting her Bachelor’s degree means she’s now in advanced education, and unfortunately, that makes you ineligible for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, or any other benefits you'd like to explore?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you for explaining the situation about Child Benefit.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter is in advanced education (university degree), despite being under 20 and living at home.
