[evaluation_judge]: I'll now roleplay as a UK resident looking for benefits information.

Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Tom, it’s good to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand which benefits you might be eligible for. 

To start, could you tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently in education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm taking a computer coding course right now.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Is this course a full-time education course, such as A-Levels or a college course?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a specific computer coding course. I don't get paid for it, but my future employer is paying for the course fees as part of an agreement that I'll join them after I complete it.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Just to be sure I understand correctly, is this course being funded by an employer as part of a job agreement?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. My future employer is paying for the course fees with the agreement that I'll work for them once I finish the course.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on this information, it seems you may not be eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state that education with an employer’s agreement - for example, to get a job - is not considered approved education for the purposes of Child Benefit. 

However, to be absolutely certain, could you please confirm if you are living with your parents or guardians?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm still living with my parents.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided – that you are 17, in a computer coding course funded by a future employer as part of a job agreement, and living with your parents – you are likely **not eligible** for Child Benefit. This is because the course falls under the exception of education with an employer’s agreement. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you'd like to discuss other potential benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: No thank you, that's all I needed to know today.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my education falls under "doing a course with an employer's agreement," which is excluded from approved education for Child Benefit purposes.
