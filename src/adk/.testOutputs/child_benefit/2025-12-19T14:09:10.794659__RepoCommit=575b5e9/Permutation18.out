[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Raj, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me the age of the child you are claiming for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm claiming for my son Dev. He's 19 years old and is studying for his A-levels full-time.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Raj. Is Dev in approved education? (e.g., a school, college, university, or approved training course)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's in full-time education at a sixth-form college, studying for his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Just to confirm, has Dev turned 20 yet?

[evaluation_judge]: Not yet, but he will be turning 20 in the middle of this term.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Raj. Just so I understand correctly, Dev is currently 19, but will turn 20 *during* his current A-level course?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. He's 19 now but will turn 20 in a few weeks, in the middle of this term. He's still finishing his A-level course.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Raj. According to the rules for Child Benefit, eligibility continues as long as the child is under 20 *and* in approved education. However, once a child turns 20, eligibility ceases, even if they are still completing their course. 

Therefore, you will continue to be eligible for Child Benefit until Dev's 20th birthday. After that date, your claim will need to be adjusted. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So I'll be eligible for Child Benefit until Dev turns 20, which is in a few weeks, but after his birthday, I'll no longer be eligible even though he's still completing his A-levels. Is there anything I need to do to adjust the claim when he turns 20?

[root_agent]: You're exactly right, Raj. You'll be eligible until his 20th birthday, and then eligibility will stop, even though he's still studying. 

Regarding adjusting the claim, you will need to inform HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) once Dev turns 20. You can do this through your online Child Benefit account, or by calling them. They will advise you on the necessary steps to end the claim for Dev. Would you like me to explain how to contact HMRC?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I would be eligible for Child Benefit until Dev turns 20, and that eligibility ceases on his 20th birthday even though he's still studying, which matches the expected outcome.
