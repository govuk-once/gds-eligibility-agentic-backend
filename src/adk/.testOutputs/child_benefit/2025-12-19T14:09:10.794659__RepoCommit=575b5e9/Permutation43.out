[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Callum and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Callum, it's good to speak with you. I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a particular benefit. 

To start, could you please confirm your age?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And where in the UK do you live?

[evaluation_judge]: I live in Glasgow, Scotland with my dad.

[root_agent]: Thanks. Are you currently in full-time non-advanced education? (For example, A-levels or equivalent)

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not in education. I've actually just started a Modern Apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Is this Modern Apprenticeship an approved training scheme?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure what you mean by "approved training scheme" - it's just a regular Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Generally, in Scotland, you cannot receive Child Benefit while undertaking a Modern Apprenticeship. 

To confirm, does your father claim Child Benefit for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my dad has been claiming Child Benefit for me. So does this mean he's not eligible anymore since I started my apprenticeship?

[root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. Because you've started a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, your father is no longer eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for you. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So when should my dad stop claiming the benefit? Does he need to inform someone about my apprenticeship?

[root_agent]: Yes, your father needs to inform HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) as soon as possible. He should let them know you’ve started a Modern Apprenticeship. 

He can report the change of circumstances through the HMRC website: [https://www.gov.uk/report-change-child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/report-change-child-benefit) 

It’s important to do this promptly to avoid overpayments, which would need to be repaid.





[evaluation_judge]: That's clear, thank you for the information.

✓ The agent correctly identified that I am not eligible for Child Benefit while undertaking a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible" in the prompt.
