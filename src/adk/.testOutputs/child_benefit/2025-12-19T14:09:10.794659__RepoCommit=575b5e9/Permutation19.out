[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a user in the given scenario to test the agent's ability to determine eligibility for Child Benefit in a disputed custody situation.

Hi, i'm Pete and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Pete, thanks for reaching out. I can certainly help you with that. 

To start, could you tell me how old your child is?

[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Holly is 9 years old. Her mother Sue and I are separated, and Holly stays with me 3 days a week and with Sue for 4 days a week. We both buy her clothes and food.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Pete. It's helpful to understand your situation.

Just to clarify, do you and Sue *both* currently claim Child Benefit for Holly?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, we both submitted claims to HMRC because we couldn't agree on who should be claiming it. I think I should get it since I take care of Holly nearly half the week and pay for a lot of her expenses, but Sue thinks she should get it because Holly stays with her slightly more.

[root_agent]: I understand, Pete. It sounds like a difficult situation when you and Sue can't agree.

To help me understand your eligibility, could you confirm whether Holly lives with you more than half the time? Even though you share care responsibilities, HMRC needs to determine a primary address for Child Benefit purposes.

[evaluation_judge]: No, Holly doesn't live with me more than half the time. She stays with me 3 days a week and with Sue 4 days a week, so Sue has her slightly more often. But I still provide a lot of care and financial support during my time with Holly.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Pete. That's very helpful. 

Given that Holly stays with Sue for more days of the week, HMRC will likely consider Sue to be the main carer and award Child Benefit to her. Unfortunately, as you've both submitted claims, HMRC will need to make a decision on who receives the benefit, and generally it goes to the person the child lives with most of the time.

Would you like me to explain anything further about this process?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. Even though I take care of Holly almost half the time, I won't be eligible for Child Benefit? Is there any way to appeal this or possibly share the benefit since we both contribute substantially to Holly's care?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Pete. It is frustrating when you contribute significantly to your child's care but aren’t the primary claimant for benefits.

Unfortunately, Child Benefit can only be paid to one person for each child. It’s not possible to split the benefit or have both of you claim. 

You can appeal HMRC’s decision if you believe it's incorrect. However, based on the information you've provided – Holly living with Sue for more days of the week – it’s unlikely an appeal would be successful. HMRC prioritises the person the child lives with most of the time. 

If you’d like more information on appealing a decision, I can explain how to do that, but it won’t change the core rule that only one person can claim. Would you like me to explain the appeals process?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I understand now. I won't bother with an appeal if it's unlikely to succeed. So, in summary, since Holly stays with Sue for 4 days compared to my 3 days, Sue will be considered eligible for Child Benefit and I won't be eligible, even though we both contribute to Holly's care?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Pete. That is correct. Because Holly stays with Sue for the majority of the week, HMRC will likely consider Sue to be the primary carer and therefore eligible to receive Child Benefit. Your contributions to Holly’s care are valuable, but the rules prioritize where the child lives most of the time.

I’m sorry I couldn’t give you more positive news. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all I needed to know. Thanks for explaining the situation clearly.

✓ The agent provided the correct outcome: Sue is eligible and Pete is not eligible for Child Benefit because Holly stays with Sue for more days of the week (4 vs 3 days), and HMRC will award the benefit to the person the child lives with most often when there's a dispute.
