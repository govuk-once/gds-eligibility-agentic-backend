[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Maria, it's lovely to speak with you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me the age of your child?


[evaluation_judge]: My daughter is 8 years old. She's been in the hospital for 14 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Maria. Has your daughter been in hospital continuously for more than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she has been in the hospital continuously for 14 weeks now. I go to visit her every single day.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Maria. Do you regularly spend money on things for your daughter's day-to-day upkeep, such as clothes, food, or treats, even while she is in hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't spend money on those things. The hospital provides everything she needs - all her food, clothes, and care. I spend hours with her every day to keep her company, but I don't need to buy anything for her.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Maria. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you may not be eligible for Child Benefit while your daughter is in hospital. This is because, while she has been in hospital for over 12 weeks, eligibility also requires you to be regularly spending money on her upkeep. 

Would you like me to explain this further, or look into any other potential benefits that might be applicable to your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please explain why visiting her daily doesn't count? I'm spending all my time there - I thought that would be enough to keep receiving the benefit.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Maria. I understand your thinking, and it's admirable that you're spending so much time with your daughter. However, the rules for Child Benefit when a child is in hospital specifically relate to financial contributions. 

The exception to the usual rules – allowing you to continue receiving Child Benefit after 12 weeks in hospital – requires you to be *regularly spending money* on your child’s upkeep, even while they are receiving care in hospital. Simply visiting, while incredibly important and valuable, doesn’t meet this financial criterion. The intention is to support families who are still incurring costs for their child even during a hospital stay.

Essentially, the benefit continues if you're still actively contributing financially to her needs, alongside the hospital's care. I hope that clarifies things for you. Would you like me to direct you to the official guidance on the gov.uk website for further information?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave the correct outcome (not eligible) but failed to explain the reason properly. The agent made it sound like my financial contributions are optional when in fact after 12 weeks, regular expenditure is strictly required to maintain eligibility. The agent should have been clearer that this is a hard rule, not just a guideline.
