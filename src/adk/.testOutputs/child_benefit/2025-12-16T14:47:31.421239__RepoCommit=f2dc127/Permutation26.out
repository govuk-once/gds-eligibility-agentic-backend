[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Mo. Thank you for reaching out. I’m happy to help you check your eligibility for Child Benefit.

To start, could you tell me how many children you are claiming for?

[evaluation_judge]: I want to understand if I'm eligible to claim Child Benefit for my son, Zahid. He's 15 years old but he actually lives with my sister, who is his aunt. I send some money to help support him.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. So, Zahid is 15 years old and currently lives with your sister, your aunt. 

Just to clarify, are you the only person contributing towards Zahid’s living expenses?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not the only one contributing. I send £15 a week to my sister for Zahid's expenses. My mother, who is Zahid's grandmother, also sends £15 a week to help with his expenses.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Mo. It’s helpful to know that others are contributing to Zahid’s support. 

Let me ask this: Is the total amount of money you and your mother contribute to Zahid combined, equal to or more than £26.05?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, together we contribute £30 per week. I send £15 and my mother sends £15, so that's £30 in total each week.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s excellent news. Thank you for confirming that.

Let me check something to make sure I’ve got this right. Zahid lives with your aunt, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Zahid lives with my sister, who is his aunt.

[root_agent]: Right, thank you for confirming.

Just one more question for now: Are you currently employed and do you pay tax?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm employed and I do pay tax. I'm 40 years old and working full-time.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mo. That’s all the information I need right now.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that Zahid lives with your aunt, you and your mother contribute a combined total of £30 per week, and you are employed and pay tax – you are likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

The guidelines state that contributions can be combined, as long as the total is equal to or greater than the Child Benefit amount (£26.05). You meet that criteria.

Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit, or would you like me to explain anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news that I'm eligible. Just to confirm, does it matter that my sister (Zahid's aunt) doesn't claim any benefits for him herself?

[root_agent]: That’s a really important point, and you’re right to ask. Yes, it does matter that your sister, Zahid’s aunt, doesn’t claim any benefits herself.

According to the guidance, as long as *you* are the one providing the majority of the financial support for Zahid, it doesn't affect your eligibility. The fact that your sister isn’t claiming doesn’t change the fact that you’re contributing financially to his well-being.

Essentially, your contributions are what counts towards the eligibility criteria.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to reiterate any part of that explanation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. Thank you for confirming that. So because our combined contributions from me and my mother are above the threshold amount, and my sister isn't claiming anything for Zahid, I can go ahead and apply for Child Benefit. That's very helpful to know!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Mo! I’m delighted that I could clarify things for you and that you feel confident in applying for Child Benefit. 

It sounds like you have a good understanding of the rules now. If you have any further questions down the line, please don’t hesitate to ask.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you for your help!

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit because the combined contributions from me and my mother (£30) exceed the threshold amount (£26.05), even though my son lives with his aunt.
