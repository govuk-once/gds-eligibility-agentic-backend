[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Raj. Thank you for reaching out. I understand you’re wondering about your eligibility for Child Benefit. To start, could you tell me, is your son, Dev, currently enrolled in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my son Dev is enrolled full-time in his A-levels. He's studying at the local sixth form college.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Raj. That’s good to know. Now, to clarify, is Dev currently under the age of 20?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, Dev just celebrated his 20th birthday in the middle of this term. He turned 20 last month.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That’s very helpful. Given that Dev turned 20 recently, he is no longer eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state that Child Benefit stops being paid once a child reaches 20, regardless of whether they are still in education.

So, based on this information, it appears you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit for Dev. Do you have any other questions about this, or perhaps would you like to explore other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So even though Dev is still finishing his A-levels, because he's turned 20, I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit for him. That's disappointing, but I understand. I don't have any other questions about this right now.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit since my son Dev turned 20, which aligns with the expected outcome that eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday.
