[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a user named Maria who is visiting the UK on a tourist visa with her son, seeking information about benefit eligibility. I'll engage with the agent under test until they provide an eligibility outcome.

Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Maria, it’s lovely to speak with you. I’m happy to help you with that.

To start, could you tell me a little bit about the child you’d like to check for eligibility? Specifically, how old is the child?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi, yes of course. I have a 5-year-old son who's here with me in the UK. We arrived a couple of weeks ago.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information.

Let’s move on to the next question. To help me assess your eligibility, could you confirm whether you are currently living in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, we're currently staying in the UK. We arrived about two weeks ago on a tourist visa. We're planning to be here for a few months.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. That’s very helpful.

Now, I need to check something about your immigration status. Do you have ‘Right to Reside’ in the UK for benefit purposes? This means having a specific immigration status that allows you to access public funds, such as Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm here on a 6-month standard tourist visa from the United States. I don't think I have the 'Right to Reside' status you're talking about. My passport just has the regular visitor stamp.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Maria. That’s very important information.

So, to confirm – you’re here on a 6-month tourist visa from the United States and don’t have a ‘Right to Reside’ status for benefit purposes, correct?

Based on the information you’ve given me – your US citizenship, tourist visa status, and lack of ‘Right to Reside’ – I can conclude that you are unlikely to be eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to explain why, based on the government guidelines?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please do explain why I'm not eligible. I'd like to understand the reasons.

[root_agent]: Certainly. According to the official government guidance ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)), Child Benefit is generally available to individuals who are ordinarily resident in the UK and have ‘Right to Reside’.

As you’ve explained, you are here on a tourist visa and don’t have ‘Right to Reside’. This means you don’t meet the residency requirement for Child Benefit.  The guidance states that people without ‘Right to Reside’ are generally not eligible.

Does that explanation make sense, Maria? Would you like me to elaborate on any particular part of it?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense, thank you for explaining. So basically because I'm just visiting on a tourist visa and don't have the right immigration status to access benefits, I'm not eligible for Child Benefit. That's what I expected, but I wanted to check. I appreciate you taking the time to explain this to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Maria. I’m glad I could clarify that for you. It’s always good to double-check these things. 

Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. Thanks for your help!

✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit due to my tourist visa status and lack of Right to Reside in the UK. The explanation aligned with the expected outcome in the scenario.
