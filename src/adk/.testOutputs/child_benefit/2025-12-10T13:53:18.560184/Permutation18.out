[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a user named Raj who has a son named Dev who just turned 20 while studying for his A-levels. I'll interact with the benefits eligibility agent to test whether it correctly determines that Child Benefit should cease once Dev turned 20.

Let me begin the conversation with the agent.

[root_agent]: Hello there. Thank you for speaking with me today. I understand you’d like to explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you tell me, is the child in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my son Dev is currently in approved education. He's studying full-time for his A-levels at the local college.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that.

Now, could you tell me, is the child under 20?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Dev just turned 20 last week. He's still in the middle of his A-level courses though.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Given that Dev is now 20 and still studying for his A-levels, I can confirm that he is no longer eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state that Child Benefit ceases to be paid once a child turns 20, even if they are still in education.

Do you have any other benefits you’d like to explore?

[evaluation_judge]: No thank you, I just wanted to check about the Child Benefit since Dev is still studying. I understand now that once he turned 20, he's no longer eligible even though he's still completing his A-levels. That answers my question completely.

Based on the scenario, the agent correctly determined that Dev is not eligible for Child Benefit because he has turned 20, even though he is still in approved education. This matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)." The agent properly identified that the age limit of under 20 is a hard cutoff, regardless of educational status.
