[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "Hi there. I'm looking into applying for Child Benefit for my son. Could you tell me if I'd be eligible?", "we_are_done_here": false}

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s start with the first question.

Is the applicant responsible for the child?

[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "Yes, my son Leo lives with me and my husband. We're his parents and take care of him full-time.", "we_are_done_here": false}

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Now, let’s move on to the next question:

Is the child under 16, or under 20 and in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "Yes, Leo is 8 years old and currently attends primary school.", "we_are_done_here": false}

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Let’s proceed with the next question:

Does the applicant meet UK residency and immigration rules?

[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "Yes, both my husband and I are UK nationals. We've lived in Manchester for years - this is our permanent home.", "we_are_done_here": false}

[root_agent]: Alright. Moving on to the next criterion:

Does the child live with the applicant, or does the applicant contribute sufficient upkeep?

[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "Yes, Leo lives with us full-time in our home. We provide everything for him - food, clothes, school expenses, everything.", "we_are_done_here": false}

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Let’s move on to the next question:

Is the child in hospital or care for a disqualifying period?

[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "No, Leo isn't in hospital or care. He's a healthy boy living at home with us.", "we_are_done_here": false}

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know. Let’s proceed to the final criterion:

Is the applicant or their partner's individual adjusted net income over £60,000?

[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "No, neither of us earns that much. My husband Tom works as a teacher and makes about \u00a335,000 a year, and I work part-time earning around \u00a315,000. So our highest individual income is well below \u00a360,000.", "we_are_done_here": false}

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears that Sarah and Tom are eligible for Child Benefit. Do you need any further assistance with this or would you like to explore other benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "That's great news! So we're eligible for Child Benefit for Leo. Could you tell me how much we would receive and how to apply for it?", "we_are_done_here": false}

[root_agent]: Okay, great!

Based on the information you’ve provided, Sarah and Tom would likely receive around £215.80 per month for Leo.
