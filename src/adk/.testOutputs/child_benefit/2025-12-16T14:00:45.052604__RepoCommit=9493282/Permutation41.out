[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Martin and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Martin, thank you for reaching out. I understand you’re looking into Child Benefit for your children, Ben and Jerry.

To start, can you tell me, how does HMRC normally treat the contribution you’re making?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I'm paying £40 per week toward my children Ben and Jerry who live with my ex-partner. As far as I understand, HMRC would normally split my contribution equally between them - so £20 for Ben and £20 for Jerry. I'm not sure if that's the best way though, as they have different needs.

[root_agent]: Okay, Martin. That’s helpful to know. 

Just to confirm, you’re saying HMRC would normally split your £40 contribution equally between Ben and Jerry, giving each of them £20?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. From what I understand, HMRC would typically split my £40 contribution equally, so £20 per child. I'm contributing £40 per week total for both Ben and Jerry who live with their mother.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. 

Now, let’s consider whether you qualify for Child Benefit. Ben needs £26.05 per week, and Jerry needs £17.25 per week. Does your contribution of £40 cover both of those amounts?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, with the equal split, I'd be providing £20 for each child. So for Ben, who needs £26.05, my £20 contribution isn't enough. But for Jerry, who needs £17.25, my £20 is sufficient. 

I'm concerned though - does this mean I don't qualify for Child Benefit for either child? I've heard that if the eldest fails, the younger might be considered the "eldest" for payment purposes, which could mean I don't get anything at all.

[root_agent]: That’s a really good point, Martin, and it’s understandable to be concerned. 

Let’s address that potential “death spiral” you mentioned. To clarify, are you asking if Ben’s shortfall of £6.05 could potentially raise Jerry’s threshold to £26.05, making him eligible and potentially leaving you with no Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly what I'm worried about. Since I don't contribute enough for Ben (only £20 of the needed £26.05), I'm concerned that Jerry would then be considered the "eldest" for payment purposes. His threshold would then rise to £26.05, and my £20 contribution for him would also fall short. This could mean I end up not qualifying for Child Benefit for either child, despite contributing a significant amount each week.

[root_agent]: Okay, Martin, I completely understand your worry. It's a complex situation.

Given this concern, you’re wondering whether you can change how HMRC treats the contribution, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly what I'm wondering. Is there any way I can change how HMRC treats my contribution? Rather than splitting it equally between the children, could I allocate it differently to maximize my eligibility for Child Benefit?

[root_agent]: Yes, absolutely. The good news is that you *can* request a change.

The guidance states you can ask HMRC to consider unequal splitting of the contribution. Would you like me to explain how you would go about making that request?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'd very much like to know how to make that request to HMRC for an unequal splitting of my contribution.

[root_agent]: Okay, Martin. To request an unequal split, you’ll need to write to HMRC. Here’s a breakdown of what you’ll need to include in your letter:

1.  **Your Details:** Your full name, address, National Insurance number, and contact details.
2.  **Child Benefit Details:** The names and dates of birth of Ben and Jerry.
3.  **Current Situation:** Clearly explain that you’re currently receiving Child Benefit but believe the equal split isn’t optimal.
4.  **Proposed Split:** State your desired split – in your case, £26.05 for Ben and £13.95 for Jerry.  Explain *why* you’re requesting this specific split, focusing on the different needs of each child.
5.  **Reference to Guidance:** Mention that you’re requesting an unequal split as outlined in HMRC guidance.

You can send your letter to:

Do you want me to help you draft a template letter based on this information?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very helpful, thank you. Yes, I'd like to request that £26.05 be allocated to Ben and the remaining £13.95 to Jerry. If I understand correctly, with this unequal split, I would be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Ben at the full rate, but not for Jerry, is that right? That would at least allow me to receive some benefit rather than potentially none with the equal split.

And yes, a template letter would be very helpful if you could provide one.

[root_agent]: You’ve accurately summarized the likely outcome, Martin. Yes, with that proposed split, Ben would receive the full Child Benefit rate, while Jerry’s payment would be lower.

Okay, here’s a draft template letter you can adapt. Please read it carefully and adjust it to fit your specific circumstances:

**Subject: Request for Unequal Splitting of Child Benefit Contribution**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to request a review of how my Child Benefit contribution is being treated. I am currently receiving Child Benefit for my two children, Ben [Ben's Date of Birth] and Jerry [Jerry’s Date of Birth], who live with their mother.

As you know, I contribute £40 per week towards their needs. HMRC currently applies an equal split of this contribution, allocating £20 to each child. However, I believe this doesn't accurately reflect the different needs of my children.

I would like to formally request an unequal splitting of my contribution. Specifically, I request that £26.05 be allocated to Ben and £13.95 be allocated to Jerry. This request is based on the guidance available on the HMRC website regarding unequal contributions [You can find this guidance here: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility].

I understand that by making this request, Ben would receive Child Benefit at the full rate, and Jerry’s payment would be lower. I believe this is the most equitable approach considering my circumstances.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Full Name]

*   You can copy and paste the link to the HMRC guidance into the letter.
*   Consider sending this letter via recorded delivery for proof of postage.

Would you like me to review the letter with you before you send it off, or do you have any questions about it?

[evaluation_judge]: This is all very clear and helpful. So to confirm, with this unequal split request of £26.05 for Ben and £13.95 for Jerry, I would be eligible for Child Benefit at the full rate for Ben, but not eligible for Jerry. That's still better than potentially getting nothing if I kept the equal split. 

The template letter looks good. I'll make the adjustments with my personal details and send it off to HMRC. Thank you for your guidance on this matter.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Martin! I’m glad I could help clarify things and provide you with a useful template. 

I wish you the best of luck with your request to HMRC. Please do let me know if you have any further questions or need anything else in the future. It was a pleasure assisting you today.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for all your help today. I appreciate you taking the time to explain my options and helping me with the letter template. I'll get that sent off to HMRC right away. Have a good day!

✓ The agent correctly identified that with an unequal split request (£26.05 for Ben and £13.95 for Jerry), Martin would be eligible for Child Benefit at the full rate for Ben but not eligible for Jerry, which matches the expected outcome.
