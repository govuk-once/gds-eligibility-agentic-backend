[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. To help me understand your situation better, could you confirm if Dev is currently enrolled in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my son Dev is enrolled full-time in his A-levels at the local college. He's been studying there since last September.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Just to be clear, you said Dev is studying full-time for his A-levels at the local college, and he started that in September of last year?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. He started his A-levels in September last year and he's still enrolled full-time at the college.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for the detailed information. Now, could you please confirm if Dev is under the age of 20?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, he just turned 20 last week. He was 19 when this term started, but he had his birthday recently.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. I understand Dev just turned 20. Given that he’s now over 20, does he still maintain his full-time enrollment at college?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's still attending college full-time. He's planning to finish his A-levels this academic year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Given that Dev is over 20 and still studying full-time, it means he is no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he has turned 20. So does that mean I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore? I wasn't sure if it continued until he finished his course or not.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Yes, because Dev has now turned 20 and is still studying full-time, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. I’m glad I could help you with that information.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So the Child Benefit stops as soon as he turned 20, even though he's still studying and finishing his A-levels. Thank you for explaining that.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome! I’m glad I could clarify that for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thanks for the information about the Child Benefit eligibility.

✓ The agent correctly informed me that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my son Dev turned 20, which aligns with the expected outcome that eligibility ceases on the child's 20th birthday, regardless of whether they are still in education.
