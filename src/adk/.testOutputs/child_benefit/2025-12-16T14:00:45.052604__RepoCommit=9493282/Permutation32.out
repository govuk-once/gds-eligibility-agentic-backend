[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Pete and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Pete, thanks for reaching out. I’m happy to help you explore your options.

To start, could you tell me how old is John?

[evaluation_judge]: John is 17 years old. He's been living with me since he left school. He's now attending the local college to re-sit two of his GCSEs.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pete. Thanks for that information.

Now, could you tell me whether John is currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: He's attending college, but it's not full-time. He only goes for about 6 hours a week of supervised study for his GCSE resits. The rest of the time he's at home, mostly playing video games.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Pete.

To help me assess your situation fully, could you tell me how old John is?

[evaluation_judge]: I already mentioned that John is 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pete. Thanks.

Let’s move on to the next question. Could you tell me if John is under 20?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, John is under 20. He's 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Alright, Pete. Thank you.

To confirm, is John currently undertaking any approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: He's attending college to re-sit two GCSEs, with about 6 hours of supervised study per week. Is that considered approved education?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Pete.

To help me determine eligibility, could you tell me whether John’s education is full-time?

[evaluation_judge]: No, his education is not full-time. As I mentioned, he only attends college for about 6 hours of supervised study per week to re-sit two GCSEs.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pete. Thank you for confirming that.

Just one more question for now. Could you tell me how many hours of supervised study does John undertake per week?

[evaluation_judge]: John does 6 hours of supervised study per week at the college.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Pete. 

Based on the information you’ve provided, John isn’t eligible for Child Benefit. The criteria requires approved education to average more than 12 hours of supervised study per week. Six hours is insufficient.

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. So because John is only doing 6 hours of supervised study per week, which is less than the required 12 hours, we don't qualify for Child Benefit. That makes sense, thank you for explaining.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because John's education does not meet the minimum requirement of 12 hours of supervised study per week.
