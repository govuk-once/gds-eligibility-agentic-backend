[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Hannah in this scenario, seeking information about benefits eligibility for my son who is receiving medical treatment abroad.

Hi, i'm Hannah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Hannah, it’s good to speak with you. To help me assess your situation, could you tell me, has Oliver been in hospital for more than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Oliver has been in a hospital in the USA for about 15 weeks now. He has a rare condition and needed to see specialists there.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Just to be certain, did Oliver go to the hospital in the USA specifically for his medical treatment, or was this a trip for a different reason?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he went to the USA specifically for the medical treatment. The specialists for his rare condition are there, so we were referred to that hospital. I'm still here in the UK but I visit him when I can and pay for his incidental costs while he's there.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. Considering Oliver has been in hospital abroad specifically for treatment, and you’re continuing to support him financially while he’s there, it sounds like you might be eligible for Child Benefit.  

To help me confirm this, could you tell me how many children you have in total?

[evaluation_judge]: Oliver is my only child.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Let’s move on to another question. Could you tell me, are you currently employed?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm employed full-time here in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just one more question regarding Oliver’s circumstances – is Oliver currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Oliver is currently in the hospital in the USA. He's been there for 15 weeks now. I'm still living here in the UK, though I visit him when I can.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – Oliver being in hospital abroad specifically for treatment, you continuing to support him financially, and him not currently living with you – you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Would you like me to provide you with some additional information about how to apply, or would you like to explore any other benefits you might be interested in?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit, recognizing that my son is receiving treatment abroad and that I still financially support him.
