[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for providing that helpful example.

To start, could you tell me, are you contributing the full £26.05 amount personally?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not contributing the full amount personally. I send about £15 a week to support my son Zahid who lives with his aunt. He's 15 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that.

Let's move on to the next question. Can contributions from multiple people be combined when determining eligibility for this benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure about how the rules work exactly. My mother - Zahid's grandmother - also sends about £15 a week to his aunt to help take care of him. So between us we're sending £30 a week total. The aunt doesn't claim any benefits for him. Does that information help?

[root_agent]: That’s very helpful information.

Just to confirm, you’re saying that contributions from both you and your mother – totaling £30 a week – are being made to support Zahid?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I send £15 a week and my mother sends another £15 a week to my son's aunt who he lives with. So between us we're contributing £30 weekly for Zahid's care.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on this information, are you contributing the full £26.05 amount personally?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I personally only contribute £15 per week. The total of £30 comes from combining my £15 and my mother's £15 contributions.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that.

Let me just double-check something to ensure I have all the details correct. Zahid is 15 years old, lives with his aunt who doesn’t claim any benefits, and you and your mother are each contributing £15 a week towards his care – totaling £30 a week. Is that all accurate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's completely accurate. Zahid is 15, he lives with his aunt who doesn't claim any benefits for him, and between me and my mother (Zahid's grandmother), we contribute a total of £30 per week - £15 from each of us - toward his care.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming all of that.

Based on this information, would you say you are eligible for Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I want to know if I'm eligible for Child Benefit in this situation. My son doesn't live with me, but I'm contributing financially to his care.

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand.

To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me, is Mo contributing the full £26.05 amount personally?

[evaluation_judge]: No, as I mentioned before, I (Mo) only contribute £15 per week personally. The other £15 comes from my mother (Zahid's grandmother).

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying.

Let’s move on to the next criteria. Can contributions from multiple people be combined?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure about that - that's what I'm hoping to find out. My mother and I are both contributing to Zahid's care, with a combined total of £30 per week. I need to know if that arrangement would make me eligible for Child Benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for emphasizing that.

The guidance states that contributions still count if more than one person is contributing, as long as the total contributions are worth at least as much as the Child Benefit. Given that you and your mother are contributing a combined £30 a week, does that cover the threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh I see. Yes, our combined contributions of £30 per week would be more than the £26.05 threshold you mentioned. So does that mean I would be eligible for Child Benefit?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct.

Based on your combined contributions of £30 a week, you would be eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit since the combined contributions from me and my mother (£30 total) exceed the Child Benefit threshold of £26.05, matching the expected outcome of "Eligible."
