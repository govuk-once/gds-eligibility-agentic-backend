[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mark and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Mark, it’s nice to talk to you. To help me determine your eligibility, could you please tell me: Is the applicant responsible for the child?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm divorced, and my son Lucas who is 10 years old lives with his ex-wife Jenny. I don't live with Lucas, but I transfer £150 per month to Jenny specifically for Lucas's food and clothes. I was wondering if I could claim Child Benefit for him.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me: Is the applicant responsible for the child?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe I am responsible for Lucas. Even though he lives with my ex-wife Jenny, I contribute £150 per month specifically for his food and clothes, which I send directly to Jenny for Lucas's care.

[root_agent]: That’s helpful to know. Now, to clarify, is the child of eligible age?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Lucas is 10 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And could you tell me, does the applicant meet residency rules?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the residency rules. I'm a UK resident.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Just one more question regarding your living situation: Does the child live with the applicant?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Lucas doesn't live with me. He lives with my ex-wife Jenny, but as I mentioned, I do contribute £150 per month specifically for his care.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Finally, is anyone else claiming for the child?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Jenny is not claiming Child Benefit for Lucas.

[root_agent]: Okay, Mark. Based on your answers, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to explain how the contribution you make affects your eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would like to understand more about how my contributions affect my eligibility. I want to make sure I understand all the details.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here’s how your contributions affect Child Benefit eligibility, based on the information you’ve provided:

As you contribute more than £113.35 a month towards Lucas’s upkeep – specifically for food and clothes – this exceeds the standard Child Benefit amount.  Because you’re making a significant contribution, the Child Benefit rules allow for an exception.

Essentially, you’re treated as having parental responsibility, even though you don’t live with Lucas. This is because you’re meeting his needs.

Do you have any specific questions about this exception, or would you like me to elaborate on any part of it?

[evaluation_judge]: That's good to know. So even though I don't live with Lucas, my monthly contribution of £150 allows me to qualify because it exceeds the Child Benefit amount. Does Jenny need to provide any confirmation that she's not claiming the benefit? And is there anything else I should know about applying?

[root_agent]: That’s correct – your £150 contribution allows you to qualify. 

Regarding Jenny, she doesn’t need to provide any confirmation that she isn’t claiming. Because she isn’t claiming, you automatically qualify due to your contribution.

As for other things you should know about applying: You’ll need to provide evidence of your contribution, such as bank statements showing the £150 transfer to Jenny. You can find more details and a list of required documents on the official government website: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/apply-child-benefit.

Would you like me to help you find any specific information on the application process, such as how to submit your evidence?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit since I contribute more than the Child Benefit amount toward my child's upkeep, and nobody else is claiming it.
