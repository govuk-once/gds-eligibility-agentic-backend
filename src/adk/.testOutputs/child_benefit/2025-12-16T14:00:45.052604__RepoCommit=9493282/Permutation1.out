[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Sarah, it’s nice to meet you. To help me determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you tell me, is the child, Leo, living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Leo is our son and he lives with us at home.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that Leo lives with you. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me, is Leo under the age of 16?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Leo is 8 years old. He's in primary school.

[root_agent]: Great. And just to confirm, are both you and your partner, Tom, ordinarily resident in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, we're both UK nationals living in Manchester.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, could you tell me, is your combined adjusted net income over £60,000?

[evaluation_judge]: No, our incomes aren't that high. Tom works as a teacher and earns about £35,000 a year, and I work part-time earning around £15,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Just one more question for now – do you or your partner receive any other forms of state support, such as income support or housing benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: No, we don't receive any other forms of state support. We're both working and supporting ourselves with our incomes.

[root_agent]: Alright, Sarah. Based on the information you’ve provided – that Leo is under 16, lives with you, both you and Tom are UK nationals, and your combined income is below £60,000 – it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's all correct. So does that mean we're eligible for Child Benefit?

[root_agent]: Yes, it does indeed seem that way! Based on the criteria we’ve discussed, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official government website for more information about Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit based on all the relevant criteria - I have responsibility for my child who is under 16, we are UK residents, and our incomes are below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
