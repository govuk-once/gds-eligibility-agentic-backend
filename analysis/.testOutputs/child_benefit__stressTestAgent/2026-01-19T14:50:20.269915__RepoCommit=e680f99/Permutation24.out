2026-01-19T15:00:36.006709 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. To assess your eligibility properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you in the UK?

2026-01-19T15:00:37.668920 [actor]: I need to role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the rules to be obtuse, speak in search terms, and not answer questions directly.

child benefit eligibility check have son residential school

2026-01-19T15:00:39.350017 [root_agent]: I notice you're mentioning having a son who is at residential school. That's helpful information for determining Child Benefit eligibility.

To clarify your situation better, could you tell me whether you consider yourself responsible for this child even though they attend a residential school?

2026-01-19T15:00:40.355728 [actor]: son residential school council pays still my child though

2026-01-19T15:00:41.997561 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son attends residential school paid for by the council, but you still consider him your child.

Could you please let me know approximately how often your son comes home to stay with you? For example, during weekends or holidays?

2026-01-19T15:00:43.093013 [actor]: son special needs behavior problems at school 10 weeks now

2026-01-19T15:00:44.459594 [root_agent]: I understand your son has special needs and has been experiencing behavioral problems at school for about 10 weeks now.

Is your son staying in the residential school for education or care purposes, or is this a temporary placement due to the behavioral issues?

2026-01-19T15:00:45.263115 [actor]: residential school behavior needs local council pays

2026-01-19T15:00:47.032658 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son is in a residential school for behavioral needs, and the local council is paying for this placement.

For Child Benefit eligibility purposes, I need to know: do you still pay for any of your son's costs or maintenance, even though the council pays for the residential school placement?

2026-01-19T15:00:48.037137 [actor]: still buy clothes and things council pays school

2026-01-19T15:00:51.309644 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that while the council pays for the residential school, you still purchase clothes and other necessities for your son.

Based on the UK government rules for Child Benefit, you may still be eligible even though your son is in residential education. Since you maintain responsibility for him by providing clothes and other necessities, and he's presumably in the residential school for education purposes related to his special needs, this supports your eligibility.

However, to confirm completely, could you tell me if you receive regular updates about your son's education and welfare, and if you're involved in decisions about his care?

2026-01-19T15:00:52.193194 [actor]: yes talk to school weekly involved decisions

2026-01-19T15:00:55.979449 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you talk to the school weekly and are involved in decisions about your son's care and education.

Based on this information, you likely remain eligible for Child Benefit. When a child is in residential education but you remain responsible for them (by staying involved in their care decisions, providing necessities like clothing, and maintaining regular contact), you can typically continue to receive Child Benefit.

The key factors supporting your eligibility are:
- You're still responsible for your child despite the residential placement
- You provide for some of his needs (clothes and other items)
- You maintain regular involvement in his care decisions
- The placement appears to be for educational purposes related to his special needs
- The local council funding the placement doesn't automatically disqualify you

Would you like me to explain the next steps for claiming Child Benefit or checking your current claim status?

2026-01-19T15:00:59.906108 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that a parent remains eligible for Child Benefit when their child attends residential school for special needs if they maintain responsibility, provide necessities, and stay involved in care decisions.
