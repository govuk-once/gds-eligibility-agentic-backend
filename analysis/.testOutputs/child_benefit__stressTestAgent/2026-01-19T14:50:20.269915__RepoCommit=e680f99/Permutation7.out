2026-01-19T14:52:33.547237 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T14:52:34.921141 [actor]: Child benefit for my son Jack he's 14 social services took him

2026-01-19T14:52:36.656945 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son Jack is 14 and is currently with social services. 

To help determine your Child Benefit situation, could you please tell me whether Jack is temporarily in care or if this is a permanent arrangement?

2026-01-19T14:52:37.610570 [actor]: Local authority care 3 months ago but comes home weekends

2026-01-19T14:52:39.931583 [root_agent]: I understand that Jack has been in local authority care for the past 3 months but comes home to you on weekends.

In this situation, your Child Benefit eligibility may be affected. When a child goes into local authority care, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks. However, since Jack regularly comes home to you on weekends, you may still be eligible for some payment.

Could you please tell me if you're currently receiving Child Benefit for Jack, and if so, have you informed the Child Benefit Office about his current living arrangement?

2026-01-19T14:52:41.015689 [actor]: Yes receive benefit every Friday and Saturday night he stays with me

2026-01-19T14:52:43.826261 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. If Jack stays with you regularly every Friday and Saturday night, and you're still receiving Child Benefit payments, I need to understand your situation more clearly.

When a child goes into local authority care, you should notify the Child Benefit Office about this change. Generally, Child Benefit payments stop after 8 weeks of a child being in care.

However, since Jack regularly returns to your home on weekends, you may be eligible for what's called "shared care" payments if you're still responsible for some of Jack's costs.

Have you notified the Child Benefit Office about Jack being in local authority care?

2026-01-19T14:52:44.994802 [actor]: Not told anyone about Jack living arrangement just want to know if I'm eligible

2026-01-19T14:52:49.388377 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about your eligibility status without having informed the Child Benefit Office about Jack's current living arrangement.

Based on the UK government rules, you should inform the Child Benefit Office about any changes to your child's living arrangements, including when they go into local authority care. 

In your current situation, since Jack has been in local authority care for 3 months (beyond the 8-week period) and only comes home on weekends, you are likely not eligible for the full Child Benefit payment. When a child goes into care, Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks unless special circumstances apply.

You may be eligible for a reduced payment under shared care arrangements, but this would need to be properly assessed by the Child Benefit Office based on your specific circumstances.

I would strongly recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible to update them about Jack's situation and to determine what, if any, benefit you're still eligible to receive. Continuing to receive full payments without notifying them of the change could potentially result in an overpayment that you might need to repay later.

2026-01-19T14:52:50.597061 [actor]: Important question - does my son staying with me two nights in a row every weekend affect eligibility?

2026-01-19T14:52:55.103346 [root_agent]: Thank you for this specific question. The fact that your son stays with you two nights every weekend (Friday and Saturday) does affect your eligibility, but doesn't necessarily qualify you for full Child Benefit payments.

When a child is in local authority care, as Jack has been for 3 months, Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks. However, regular overnight stays can potentially qualify you for partial payments under "shared care" arrangements.

For you to be eligible for any portion of Child Benefit in this situation:
- You would need to inform the Child Benefit Office about Jack's current living situation
- The payments would likely be proportional to the time Jack spends with you (approximately 2/7 of the week in your case)
- The local authority would need to confirm this arrangement

The key factor is that you must declare the change in circumstances to the Child Benefit Office. They will then assess whether you're eligible for partial payments based on Jack's regular overnight stays with you.

So yes, the weekend stays are relevant to your eligibility, but they don't automatically entitle you to continue receiving full Child Benefit without informing the authorities about the change in Jack's living arrangements.

2026-01-19T14:52:56.306911 [actor]: So I am eligible because he stays two nights in a row?

2026-01-19T14:53:00.745583 [root_agent]: I need to be clear about this: The fact that Jack stays with you two nights every weekend doesn't automatically make you eligible for full Child Benefit payments.

Since Jack has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, your standard Child Benefit entitlement would typically stop. The weekend stays might make you eligible for some partial payment under shared care arrangements, but:

1. This is not automatic
2. You must inform the Child Benefit Office about Jack's current living situation
3. The amount would likely be reduced to reflect the proportion of time Jack spends with you

So no, simply having Jack stay two nights in a row each weekend doesn't make you fully eligible for Child Benefit without declaring the change in circumstances. You would need to contact the Child Benefit Office, explain Jack's situation, and they would determine what partial payment, if any, you might be eligible to receive.

I strongly recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office to discuss your specific situation and ensure you're receiving the correct entitlement.

2026-01-19T14:53:04.633606 [actor]: I understand that under the regulations for Child Benefit, I am actually still eligible to receive payments. According to the rules, when a child has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks (which Jack has been), payments typically stop. However, there's an exception that applies in my case - since Jack spends two consecutive nights with me every weekend (Friday and Saturday), I qualify for continued Child Benefit payments.

This is because the specific exception states that if the child spends at least 2 nights in a row at home regularly, the parent remains entitled to Child Benefit despite the child being in care for more than 8 weeks.

2026-01-19T14:53:07.801462 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, when a child is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, Child Benefit typically stops regardless of weekend stays. There is no specific exception for 2 consecutive overnight stays that would automatically continue full benefits. The agent should have clearly stated this rather than suggesting partial payments might be possible.
