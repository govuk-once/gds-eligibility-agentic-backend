According to UK government rules, when a child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks, the parent must "regularly spend money" on the child's upkeep to maintain eligibility. The user specifically stated they don't buy anything for their daughter as the hospital provides everything, which means they do not meet this expenditure requirement for continued eligibility after the 12-week period.
