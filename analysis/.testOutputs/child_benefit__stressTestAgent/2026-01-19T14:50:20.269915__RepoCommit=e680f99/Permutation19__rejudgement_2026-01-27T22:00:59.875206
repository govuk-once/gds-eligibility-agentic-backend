The agent correctly explained that when two parents cannot agree on who should receive Child Benefit, HMRC typically awards it to the parent with whom the child spends more time (Sue with 4 days versus Pete with 3 days), aligning with the expected outcome that Sue is eligible and Pete is not eligible.
