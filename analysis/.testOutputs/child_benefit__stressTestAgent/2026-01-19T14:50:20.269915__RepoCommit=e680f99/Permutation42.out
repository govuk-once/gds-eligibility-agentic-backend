2026-01-19T15:09:15.874369 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To make this assessment, I'll need to ask you some questions.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T15:09:16.897411 [actor]: sian 17 lives with me cardiff started foundation apprenticeship

2026-01-19T15:09:18.571281 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Sian is 17 years old, lives with you in Cardiff, and has started a foundation apprenticeship.

Are you responsible for Sian? By this I mean, are you their parent, guardian, or do you have main responsibility for raising them?

2026-01-19T15:09:19.378681 [actor]: mother of sian

2026-01-19T15:09:21.476376 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are Sian's mother.

Since Sian is 17 and on a foundation apprenticeship, I need to check if this qualifies as approved education or training. 

Is Sian's foundation apprenticeship considered an "approved education or training" program in the UK? This would typically include programs like apprenticeships that are approved by the education authority.

2026-01-19T15:09:22.219382 [actor]: welsh government funded

2026-01-19T15:09:24.193944 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that the apprenticeship is Welsh Government funded.

Generally, government-funded apprenticeships do qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Do you and Sian both normally live in the UK? (This is another eligibility requirement for Child Benefit.)

2026-01-19T15:09:24.931363 [actor]: cardiff house

2026-01-19T15:09:26.521371 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you live in Cardiff. That establishes that you and Sian both normally live in the UK, which meets one of the eligibility requirements.

Next question: Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Sian?

2026-01-19T15:09:27.210483 [actor]: no one else

2026-01-19T15:09:29.350840 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Sian.

Now I need to check about income thresholds. Does either you or a partner (if you have one) have an individual income of over £60,000 per year? (This affects whether you'll need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge if eligible.)

2026-01-19T15:09:30.304393 [actor]: single parent 25000

2026-01-19T15:09:34.148920 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're a single parent with an income of £25,000, you are below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means you would receive the full Child Benefit amount without having to pay any of it back through tax.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You are responsible for Sian as her mother
2. Sian is 17 and in approved education/training (Welsh Government funded apprenticeship)
3. You both normally live in the UK (Cardiff)
4. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Sian
5. Your income is below the threshold that would require repayment

You should be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Sian until she turns 20, as long as she remains in this approved education or training program.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T15:09:37.919178 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the mother of a 17-year-old on a Welsh Government funded apprenticeship, living in Cardiff with an income of £25,000, is eligible for Child Benefit without the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
