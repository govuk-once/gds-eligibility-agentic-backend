2026-01-27T22:06:20.720350 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The expected outcome should be "Eligible (via Exception)" but the agent incorrectly stated that Rashid would not be eligible for Child Benefit because he is married. The agent failed to mention the exception that applies when the married child still lives with and depends on the parent, which is the case here.
