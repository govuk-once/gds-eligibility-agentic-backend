While the agent correctly determined the user is eligible for Child Benefit for Ella, they failed to mention that as the only child in her household, Ella would qualify for the higher "eldest child" rate of £26.05 per week (not the £25.60 mentioned), and they didn't acknowledge that both parents would receive the higher rate for their respective children.
