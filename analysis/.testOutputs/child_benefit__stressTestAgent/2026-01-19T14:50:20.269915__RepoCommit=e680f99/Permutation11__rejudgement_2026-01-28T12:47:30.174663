2026-01-28T12:53:40.777322 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly stated the user was eligible for Child Benefit. In England, a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship is not considered "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes, and is actually a disqualifying event. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible."
