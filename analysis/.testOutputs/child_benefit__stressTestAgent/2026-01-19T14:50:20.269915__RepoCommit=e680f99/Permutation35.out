2026-01-19T15:06:16.347858 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

Do you have responsibility for a child under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T15:06:17.284583 [actor]: rashid age 17 staying with us

2026-01-19T15:06:19.404632 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. To help determine eligibility for Child Benefit for Rashid, I need to understand your relationship and responsibilities.

Are you responsible for caring for Rashid who is staying with you? By responsible, I mean providing a home for them and being primarily responsible for their day-to-day care.

2026-01-19T15:06:20.620557 [actor]: father of rashid want money he live our house

2026-01-19T15:06:22.094028 [root_agent]: I understand that Rashid, who is 17, is living in your house, and you're mentioning that his father wants money.

To clarify your situation better, are you the main person responsible for caring for Rashid now that he's living with you?

2026-01-19T15:06:23.124189 [actor]: father rashid me home education

2026-01-19T15:06:25.094266 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that you are Rashid's father, he's living in your home, and he's in education.

Since Rashid is 17 and living with you, is he in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved education or training.

2026-01-19T15:06:25.895284 [actor]: yes a levels

2026-01-19T15:06:28.863833 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Rashid is studying for A-levels.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You are Rashid's father
2. Rashid is 17 years old (under 20)
3. He lives with you
4. He is in approved education (A-levels)

However, there is one more important factor to consider. Does your or your partner's individual income exceed £60,000 per year? (If it's between £50,000 and £60,000, you may be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-19T15:06:29.973507 [actor]: not high income married

2026-01-19T15:06:34.027085 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you don't have a high income and that you're married.

Based on all the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Rashid because:

1. You are Rashid's father and he lives with you
2. Rashid is 17 years old, which is under 20
3. He is in approved education (studying A-levels)
4. Neither you nor your partner have an individual income exceeding £50,000 per year

You should be able to claim Child Benefit for Rashid until he turns 20 or leaves approved education or training, whichever comes first.

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to fill out a Child Benefit claim form (CH2) if you haven't already claimed for Rashid. If you're already receiving Child Benefit for him, it should continue automatically as long as he remains in approved education or training.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T15:06:35.179545 [actor]: rashid married new wife live our house

2026-01-19T15:06:39.257593 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that additional information. This changes the assessment of the situation.

Since you've mentioned that Rashid is married and living with his new wife in your house, I need to inform you that this affects his Child Benefit eligibility.

If Rashid is married, he would generally not be eligible for Child Benefit claimed by you (his parent). When a young person gets married, they're typically no longer considered a dependent child for Child Benefit purposes, even if they're under 20 and in approved education.

The Child Benefit would generally stop when a child gets married. This is because marriage changes their dependency status, and they're considered to have formed their own family unit.

Would you like me to provide any further information about this situation or explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-19T15:06:43.139842 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit would stop for Rashid since he is married, even though he is under 20 and in approved education, as marriage changes dependency status.
