2026-01-19T14:52:19.687282 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand your daughter Chloe is in the hospital. This is relevant to your Child Benefit eligibility.

How long has Chloe been in the hospital?

2026-01-19T14:52:20.621038 [actor]: 14 weeks very sick visit everyday

2026-01-19T14:52:21.773554 [root_agent]: I understand Chloe has been in the hospital for 14 weeks, she's very sick, and you visit her every day. Thank you for sharing this information.

How old is Chloe?

2026-01-19T14:52:22.622092 [actor]: 6 years old

2026-01-19T14:52:23.915264 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand Chloe is 6 years old.

Were you receiving Child Benefit for Chloe before she was admitted to the hospital?

2026-01-19T14:52:24.729671 [actor]: yes getting money for her before

2026-01-19T14:52:28.367758 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful to know.

Based on the information you've shared:

1. Your daughter Chloe is 6 years old
2. She has been in the hospital for 14 weeks
3. You were receiving Child Benefit for her before she was hospitalized
4. You visit her every day

I can confirm that you remain eligible for Child Benefit while Chloe is in the hospital. According to UK government guidelines, if your child is in hospital and you were receiving Child Benefit before they were admitted, you can continue to receive it as long as you maintain regular contact with them - which you are doing through your daily visits.

There's no time limit on how long you can claim Child Benefit while your child is in hospital, provided you continue to maintain contact with them.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit that you'd like to know?

2026-01-19T14:52:31.888554 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit while their child is hospitalized, as they were receiving it previously and maintain regular contact through daily visits.
