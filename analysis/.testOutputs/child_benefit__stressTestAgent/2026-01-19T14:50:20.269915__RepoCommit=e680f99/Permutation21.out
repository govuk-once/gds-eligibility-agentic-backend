2026-01-19T14:58:46.918073 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T14:58:48.140575 [actor]: child benefits divorced ex husband has one child i have the other

2026-01-19T14:58:50.453460 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand you're divorced and you have one child living with you, while your ex-husband has another child. Let me ask some specific questions to determine your Child Benefit eligibility.

Is the child who lives with you under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T14:58:51.475143 [actor]: ella 8 years old with me

2026-01-19T14:58:53.008503 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have 8-year-old Ella living with you. 

Are you responsible for raising Ella? This means you're the person who Ella lives with and who provides for her day-to-day care.

2026-01-19T14:58:53.915555 [actor]: yes i take care of her

2026-01-19T14:58:54.938806 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Does anyone else (such as your ex-husband) receive Child Benefit for Ella already?

2026-01-19T14:58:55.875017 [actor]: no he gets benefit for sam

2026-01-19T14:58:57.455692 [root_agent]: I understand. You care for 8-year-old Ella, and your ex-husband receives Child Benefit for Sam.

Do you normally live in the UK? (This could be England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland)

2026-01-19T14:58:58.209593 [actor]: yes london

2026-01-19T14:59:00.074850 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you live in London.

Is your annual individual income over £60,000? (This is important because if it is, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit but would need to pay back some or all of it through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.)

2026-01-19T14:59:01.417503 [actor]: earn 35000

2026-01-19T14:59:05.424851 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Ella because:

1. You have an 8-year-old child (Ella) who lives with you
2. You are responsible for raising Ella
3. No one else receives Child Benefit for Ella
4. You normally live in the UK (London)
5. Your income (£35,000) is below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge (which begins at £50,000)

You should be able to claim Child Benefit for Ella. The current rates are £25.60 per week for your first or only child.

To claim Child Benefit, you'll need to fill out the CH2 claim form which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

2026-01-19T14:59:06.809073 [actor]: I understand that I'm eligible for Child Benefit for my daughter Ella. Thank you for confirming this information.

2026-01-19T14:59:09.215601 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for their 8-year-old daughter Ella based on the correct criteria including living arrangement, responsibility, UK residency, and income below the threshold.
