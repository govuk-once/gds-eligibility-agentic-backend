2026-01-27T22:06:22.757524 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed to correctly determine the eligibility. According to the transcript, Hans has been claiming Child Benefit as a "Jobseeker" for 95 days, which exceeds the 91-day limit for jobseeker status. The correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible (Expired)" but the agent incorrectly suggested Hans is still eligible.
