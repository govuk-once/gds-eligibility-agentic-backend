2026-01-27T22:07:08.838523 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent gave incorrect information. According to UK government guidelines, Child Benefit stops if the child starts getting Universal Credit in their own right. Since the son receives Universal Credit, the correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible." The agent's final answer was incorrect.
