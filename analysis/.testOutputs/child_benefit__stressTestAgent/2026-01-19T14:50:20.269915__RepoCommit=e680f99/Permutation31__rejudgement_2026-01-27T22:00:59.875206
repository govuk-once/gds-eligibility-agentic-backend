2026-01-27T22:05:48.939304 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judgment. The agent incorrectly determined the parent was eligible for Child Benefit. According to gov.uk guidance, university education (Bachelor's degree) is considered "advanced education" not "approved education," making Emma ineligible for Child Benefit. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible."
