2026-01-15T12:33:01.629387 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:33:02.389763 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm here to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, are you currently in full-time education?


2026-01-15T12:33:03.252563 [actor]: no but my son is college a levels

2026-01-15T12:33:04.135987 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that it's your son who is in full-time education, studying A-Levels. 

Is your son currently married or in a civil partnership?

2026-01-15T12:33:04.960028 [actor]: got married last month lives with us

2026-01-15T12:33:06.262050 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To confirm, does your son live with you and depend on you financially, even though he is married? This includes whether you are financially supporting his spouse, or if his spouse is also in full-time education or financially dependent on someone else.





2026-01-15T12:33:07.270151 [actor]: son and his wife both live in our house both 17 we pay for everything

2026-01-15T12:33:08.398077 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

Just to be absolutely clear, when you say you "pay for everything", does that include covering the costs for your son's wife as well as your son? Essentially, are you financially supporting both of them?

2026-01-15T12:33:09.409020 [actor]: yes food bills school stuff clothes both 17 both in school

2026-01-15T12:33:12.850605 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail.

Based on the information you've given me – your son is married, lives with you, is under 20 and in full-time education (A-Levels), and you financially support both him *and* his wife – it appears you **are likely still eligible** to continue claiming Child Benefit for your son. 

The rules state that generally Child Benefit stops when a child gets married, but there is an exception if they live with you and you are financially supporting them (and their spouse), or their spouse is also in full-time education or dependent.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. It's always best to double-check with the official government guidance or contact HMRC directly to confirm your specific situation.



Would you like me to summarise the key points that make you likely eligible?

2026-01-15T12:33:16.593319 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that while Child Benefit normally stops when a child gets married, an exception applies since the child lives with and is financially dependent on the parent, and both the son and his wife are supported by the parents.
