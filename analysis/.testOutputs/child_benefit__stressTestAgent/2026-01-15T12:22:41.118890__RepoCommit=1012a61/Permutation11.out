2026-01-15T12:25:29.827236 [actor]: I'll help you test the agent by role-playing as Karen in this scenario.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:25:30.663693 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-15T12:25:31.319237 [actor]: over 40

2026-01-15T12:25:31.772290 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is the child you are claiming for?

2026-01-15T12:25:32.427832 [actor]: ryan is 17

2026-01-15T12:25:32.920240 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Is Ryan currently in full-time education?

2026-01-15T12:25:33.549083 [actor]: started apprenticeship

2026-01-15T12:25:34.160716 [root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know. Just to clarify, is this apprenticeship a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England?

2026-01-15T12:25:34.852691 [actor]: yes england apprenticeship intermediate

2026-01-15T12:25:35.503117 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. And to be absolutely sure I understand correctly, is Ryan living at home with you?

2026-01-15T12:25:36.120666 [actor]: yes home

2026-01-15T12:25:38.828620 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for all of that information. 

Based on what you've told me – that you are over 40, your son Ryan is 17, he’s started a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England, and he lives at home with you – it appears you are **not** currently eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit. 

Starting an apprenticeship in England is considered a disqualifying event for Child Benefit, even though Ryan is under 20.

Would you like me to explain any of that in more detail? Or perhaps you'd like to double-check any of the information we've discussed?

2026-01-15T12:25:41.945594 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed Karen that she is not eligible for Child Benefit when her son starts an apprenticeship in England, as this is considered a disqualifying event.
