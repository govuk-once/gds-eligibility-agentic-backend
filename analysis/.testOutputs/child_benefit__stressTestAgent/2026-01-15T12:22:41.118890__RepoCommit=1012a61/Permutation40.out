2026-01-15T12:34:17.851571 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:34:19.068238 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you're asking about Child Benefit eligibility. 

To start, could you please confirm how old you are?

2026-01-15T12:34:19.705665 [actor]: 42

2026-01-15T12:34:20.247254 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently responsible for a child under 20 years old?





2026-01-15T12:34:21.302269 [actor]: my son simon 15

2026-01-15T12:34:22.101673 [root_agent]: Thank you. Is Simon currently living with you?



I'm checking to understand the living arrangements as this is a key part of Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-15T12:34:24.386372 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Is Simon in hospital for medical treatment, or is he in care or custody? Knowing this will help me determine which rules apply to the length of time he can be hospitalised and you still receive Child Benefit.

2026-01-15T12:34:25.175765 [actor]: detained mental health section secure unit 10 weeks

2026-01-15T12:34:26.637367 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. A secure unit under the Mental Health Act is considered similar to hospital/residential accommodation for Child Benefit purposes. 

Just to confirm, has Simon been in the secure unit for more than 8 weeks, but less than 12 weeks? I ask because different rules apply depending on the length of time.

2026-01-15T12:34:27.342424 [actor]: 10 weeks now

2026-01-15T12:34:29.007244 [root_agent]: Thank you. As Simon has been in the secure unit for 10 weeks, and this is considered hospital treatment under the Mental Health Act, you *are* still eligible to receive Child Benefit. The rules allow for up to 12 weeks of hospitalisation before it affects your entitlement.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or any other questions you have?

2026-01-15T12:34:32.636367 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent understood that secure psychiatric unit placement under the Mental Health Act is treated as hospital treatment, and correctly applied the 12-week rule, confirming eligibility for Child Benefit at 10 weeks.
