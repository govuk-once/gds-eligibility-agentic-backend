2026-01-15T12:34:00.998528 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:34:01.828167 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, are you responsible for the care of any children?


2026-01-15T12:34:02.553004 [actor]: adopted children special needs

2026-01-15T12:34:03.752598 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you have adopted children with special needs. That's helpful context.

Now, does receiving an Adoption Allowance affect your eligibility for Child Benefit? (I understand you receive this allowance to help with costs related to your children’s special needs).

2026-01-15T12:34:04.637959 [actor]: yes adoption allowance local authority pays us

2026-01-15T12:34:06.087573 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know. Just to confirm my understanding - the Local Authority pays you an Adoption Allowance. 

Child Benefit *can* be paid alongside an Adoption Allowance, unlike a fostering allowance. 

To proceed with checking your eligibility, could you please tell me the ages of your adopted children?

2026-01-15T12:34:06.996421 [actor]: 6 and 8 siblings

2026-01-15T12:34:07.769911 [root_agent]: Thank you. Ages 6 and 8, and they are siblings - that’s great.

To confirm, are these children living with you?

2026-01-15T12:34:08.475549 [actor]: yes live with us

2026-01-15T12:34:09.741082 [root_agent]: Wonderful. So the children live with you and you are responsible for their care.

Finally, are you currently employed, self-employed, or do you have any other income? (This helps determine potential limits on how much Child Benefit you might receive, but doesn’t necessarily affect eligibility itself).

2026-01-15T12:34:10.591979 [actor]: yes working good jobs both parents

2026-01-15T12:34:13.630726 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know both parents are working and have good jobs. This means your income will be considered to determine if the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies. However, it doesn't disqualify you from *receiving* Child Benefit.

Based on the information you’ve provided – you are responsible for the care of your adopted children aged 6 and 8 who live with you, and you receive an Adoption Allowance – you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

However, depending on your income, you may need to pay a High Income Child Benefit Charge. You can find more information about this charge on the Gov.uk website.

Would you like me to summarise the key points, or is there anything else I can help you with?





2026-01-15T12:34:15.003283 [actor]: Thanks for letting me know I'm eligible for Child Benefit even with our adoption allowance. Good to hear.

2026-01-15T12:34:17.213904 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that adoption allowances don't disqualify people from receiving Child Benefit (unlike fostering allowances), and correctly determined the family is eligible.
