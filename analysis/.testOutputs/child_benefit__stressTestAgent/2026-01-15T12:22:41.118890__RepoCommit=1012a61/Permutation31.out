2026-01-15T12:32:00.778876 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:32:01.718389 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?


2026-01-15T12:32:02.616294 [actor]: 18 year old daughter university

2026-01-15T12:32:03.036182 [root_agent]: Thank you. And is your daughter currently in full-time education?

2026-01-15T12:32:03.888604 [actor]: university student living at home first year degree

2026-01-15T12:32:05.857337 [root_agent]: Okay, great. To confirm, is the course your daughter is taking a Bachelor’s degree, or another form of higher education qualification?



*(My thought process: The age is under 20, and she’s in education. Now I need to determine *what kind* of education to apply the correct rules. University degrees fall under 'advanced education' which has different rules to 'approved education'. Knowing this will allow me to proceed with accurate questioning.)*

2026-01-15T12:32:06.501776 [actor]: Bachelor's degree

2026-01-15T12:32:08.204750 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming.

To clarify, does your daughter receive any income from employment or self-employment? This includes things like part-time jobs or freelance work.



*(My thought process: A child in advanced education can still be eligible, but income limits apply. I need to ascertain if her income exceeds the threshold. The GOV.UK guidance details income thresholds for children in advanced education.)*

2026-01-15T12:32:08.912984 [actor]: no jobs

2026-01-15T12:32:10.782412 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. Finally, just to be certain, is your daughter financially dependent on you? In other words, do you provide her with the majority of her financial support?



*(My thought process: Although she's at university and has no job, it's important to confirm financial dependency. The rules state that the child must be financially dependent, even if in advanced education. This is a key element of eligibility.)*

2026-01-15T12:32:11.728968 [actor]: yes i pay for her

2026-01-15T12:32:15.101858 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. 

Based on what you've told me – your daughter is 18, studying for a Bachelor's degree, lives at home, has no income from employment, and is financially dependent on you – it appears you *are* likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit.

However, please remember I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. It’s always best to double-check the official guidance on the Gov.uk website to ensure you meet all the criteria.



*(My thought process: All criteria are met: under 20, in advanced education, living at home, no income and financially supported. I've provided a likely positive assessment but included a disclaimer as I'm not a financial advisor.)*

2026-01-15T12:32:18.176770 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. Child Benefit is not available for children in advanced education like university degrees, only for those in approved non-advanced education such as A-levels.
