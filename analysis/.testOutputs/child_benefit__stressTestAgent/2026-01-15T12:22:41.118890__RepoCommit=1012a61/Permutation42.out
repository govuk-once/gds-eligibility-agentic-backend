2026-01-15T12:35:05.424934 [actor]: I understand I need to play the role of Sian's mother in Cardiff, Wales. I'll engage with the benefits agent while being deliberately obtuse and searching for information about child benefit eligibility with a 17-year-old apprentice daughter.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:35:06.231951 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please confirm how old your daughter is?





2026-01-15T12:35:07.272747 [actor]: 17 years girl foundation apprentice wales

2026-01-15T12:35:08.062185 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your daughter is 17 and undertaking a Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales.

To clarify, is your daughter currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:35:08.916386 [actor]: cardiff with me yes teenager

2026-01-15T12:35:09.854219 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Is your daughter currently receiving any financial support *specifically* from her apprenticeship, beyond the costs of the training itself - for example, a weekly wage or allowance?

2026-01-15T12:35:11.182441 [actor]: wales government training no wage

2026-01-15T12:35:12.540636 [root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know. So the Foundation Apprenticeship is Welsh Government funded training *without* a wage or allowance.

Just to be absolutely sure, is your daughter still considered to be in full-time education? Even though it’s an apprenticeship, it's important to establish this.

2026-01-15T12:35:13.672259 [actor]: welsh government approved training cardiff college

2026-01-15T12:35:15.561091 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Welsh Government approved training through Cardiff College is a helpful detail.

According to the rules, a Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales *can* be considered as continuing in full-time education for Child Benefit purposes. However, just to be certain, could you tell me roughly how many hours per week your daughter spends on her apprenticeship, including both the training at college and any work-related learning she does?

2026-01-15T12:35:16.306437 [actor]: full time monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday

2026-01-15T12:35:17.844662 [root_agent]: Thank you - that's very clear. So she's engaged in the apprenticeship full-time, Monday to Friday.

One final question for now: are you, or your husband/partner (if you have one), working more than 24 hours a week? This is relevant to whether you can claim Child Benefit based on your own National Insurance record.

2026-01-15T12:35:18.639950 [actor]: single parent working fulltime office

2026-01-15T12:35:22.582046 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you are a single parent working full-time in an office.

Based on the information you've provided – your daughter is 17, living with you in Wales, undertaking a full-time Foundation Apprenticeship without a wage, and you are working full-time – it appears you *are* likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit until your daughter turns 18.

The key factor here is that Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are treated differently to apprenticeships in England and are considered approved education. As you are working full-time, your National Insurance record is also being built up.

Would you like me to summarise this information, or do you have any other questions?

2026-01-15T12:35:23.734583 [actor]: thank you understand until 18 daughter birthday

2026-01-15T12:35:25.965688 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are considered approved education/training for Child Benefit purposes, making the mother eligible until the daughter turns 18.
