2026-01-15T12:33:30.009357 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:33:30.841008 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, do you have a child under 16?


2026-01-15T12:33:31.650111 [actor]: looking after friends child she is 10

2026-01-15T12:33:32.975881 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that you are looking after a friend’s child who is 10 years old. 

To help me understand your situation better, is this a formal fostering arrangement arranged through the local council, or is it a private arrangement between you and the child’s parents?





2026-01-15T12:33:33.815224 [actor]: private arrangement friend is ill

2026-01-15T12:33:34.878947 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know it’s a private arrangement because your friend is ill.

Is the local council contributing financially towards the cost of looking after this child, for example, by paying for accommodation or a fostering allowance?

2026-01-15T12:33:35.641685 [actor]: not paying council knows about it

2026-01-15T12:33:37.208185 [root_agent]: Okay, so the council is aware of the arrangement but isn’t providing any financial support. That’s good to know.

Just to confirm, are *you* financially responsible for the day-to-day care and accommodation of this 10-year-old child?

2026-01-15T12:33:37.949707 [actor]: yes paying for everything

2026-01-15T12:33:39.680465 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are financially responsible for all of the child’s care and accommodation.

Based on the information you've provided – you are privately fostering a child under 16 and are fully financially responsible for them – you *are* likely eligible to claim Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or would you like me to summarise the information?

2026-01-15T12:33:42.753250 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that as a private fosterer who is financially responsible for the child, Carol is eligible for Child Benefit.
