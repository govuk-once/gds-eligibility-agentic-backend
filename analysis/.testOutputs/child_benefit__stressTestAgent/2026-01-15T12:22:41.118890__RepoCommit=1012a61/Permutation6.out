2026-01-15T12:24:09.925948 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:24:10.772731 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm here to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, are you responsible for a child under 20?

2026-01-15T12:24:11.527449 [actor]: child chloe 6 years

2026-01-15T12:24:12.225970 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. So you are responsible for Chloe, who is 6 years old. 

Is Chloe currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:24:12.812801 [actor]: hospital 14 weeks

2026-01-15T12:24:13.723486 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know Chloe has been in hospital for 14 weeks. 

To clarify, is Chloe’s stay in hospital due to an illness or injury?





2026-01-15T12:24:14.490893 [actor]: yes sick hospital treatment

2026-01-15T12:24:15.665473 [root_agent]: Thank you. Just to be clear, you mentioned Chloe has been in hospital for 14 weeks receiving treatment for an illness.

Do you regularly contribute towards Chloe's upkeep whilst she is in hospital – for example, by providing money for things she needs there?

2026-01-15T12:24:16.535390 [actor]: yes books pajamas food 30 pounds weekly

2026-01-15T12:24:17.884472 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It’s good to know you’re regularly providing for Chloe with things like books, pyjamas and food, spending around £30 a week.

Just to confirm, is Chloe’s main home still with you, even though she’s currently in hospital?

2026-01-15T12:24:18.586044 [actor]: yes my home her home

2026-01-15T12:24:20.590611 [root_agent]: That’s helpful to know. So, Chloe’s main home is still with you.

Considering everything you’ve told me, it sounds like you *are* likely still eligible for Child Benefit, even though Chloe has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks, because you are continuing to support her financially whilst she is there and her main home remains with you.

Would you like me to summarise the key reasons why, based on the information you've provided?





2026-01-15T12:24:23.732052 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent recognized that despite Chloe being in hospital for more than 12 weeks, Mary remains eligible for Child Benefit because she continues to support Chloe financially with regular expenses of £30 weekly.
