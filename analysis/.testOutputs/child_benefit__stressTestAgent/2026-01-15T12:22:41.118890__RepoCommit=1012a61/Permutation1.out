2026-01-15T12:22:42.911876 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-15T12:22:44.469555 [root_agent]: Thank you. And do you have a child, or children, under 16?

2026-01-15T12:22:45.679545 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Does your son live with you?

2026-01-15T12:22:46.519859 [actor]: yes lives with me husband

2026-01-15T12:22:47.045328 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Are you, or your husband, a UK national?

2026-01-15T12:22:47.802549 [actor]: both uk nationals manchester

2026-01-15T12:22:48.396245 [root_agent]: Excellent. And roughly, what is your annual income before tax? Just an estimate is fine.

2026-01-15T12:22:49.343146 [actor]: part time work 15000

2026-01-15T12:22:49.858511 [root_agent]: Thank you. And approximately what is your husband’s annual income before tax?

2026-01-15T12:22:50.578572 [actor]: teacher earns 35000

2026-01-15T12:22:51.117953 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Finally, is your son currently in approved education, such as school?

2026-01-15T12:22:51.825736 [actor]: primary school

2026-01-15T12:22:54.850516 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for answering all of my questions. 

Based on the information you’ve provided – you are a UK national, your son is 8 years old and lives with you and your husband, who is also a UK national, and your combined income is under £60,000 – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

However, please remember I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. You can find more detailed information and confirm your eligibility on the government website: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility).



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T12:22:56.859645 [actor]: Thanks for letting me know I'm eligible for child benefit.

2026-01-15T12:22:59.009099 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Sarah is eligible for Child Benefit as all criteria are met: she has an 8-year-old son living with her, both parents are UK nationals, and their incomes are below the threshold that would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
