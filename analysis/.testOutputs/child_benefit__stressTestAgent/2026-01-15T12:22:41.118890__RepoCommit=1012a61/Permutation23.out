2026-01-15T12:28:53.207536 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:28:53.959711 [root_agent]: Hello! Thanks for asking about Child Benefit. To help me understand if you might be eligible, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-15T12:28:54.694587 [actor]: 50 years old Kevin

2026-01-15T12:28:55.336325 [root_agent]: Thank you, Kevin. And could you please tell me, does Sarah, the child in question, live with you?

2026-01-15T12:28:56.562973 [actor]: Sarah no live with me daughter 12

2026-01-15T12:28:57.651010 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that Sarah, your 12-year-old daughter, doesn't live with you. 

To understand your situation a little better, do you make any regular contributions towards Sarah’s upkeep?





2026-01-15T12:28:58.444991 [actor]: buy groceries clothes every 4 weeks £120

2026-01-15T12:28:59.757321 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Kevin. Just to confirm, you buy groceries and clothes for Sarah every four weeks, and this typically costs around £120.

Do you make any *other* regular contributions towards Sarah's upkeep, or is the £120 the only financial support you provide?

2026-01-15T12:29:00.460559 [actor]: only £120 groceries clothes deliver to mother

2026-01-15T12:29:01.894992 [root_agent]: Okay, that's very helpful. So the £120 for groceries and clothes delivered to Sarah's mother is the only financial support you provide. 

To be certain, is this £120 provided *instead* of any formal maintenance arrangements, or are those in place separately?

2026-01-15T12:29:02.717573 [actor]: no maintenance only groceries

2026-01-15T12:29:05.341787 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that there are no formal maintenance arrangements in place, only the £120 groceries and clothes every four weeks.

Based on the information you've provided, and checking the guidance, it appears you *may* be eligible to claim Child Benefit. The rules state that contributions don't need to be weekly, and a lump sum covering the equivalent weekly benefit amount can be considered. Your £120 every four weeks equates to £30 a week, which is above the current Child Benefit rate.

However, to be absolutely sure, could you clarify – is Sarah’s mother also claiming Child Benefit for Sarah?

2026-01-15T12:29:06.081853 [actor]: don't know if mother claims

2026-01-15T12:29:07.980470 [root_agent]: Okay, that's perfectly alright. If you don’t know whether Sarah’s mother is claiming, that's important information to find out.

To clarify, you would need to know if someone is *already* receiving Child Benefit for Sarah before you can apply yourself.

Would you be able to ask Sarah’s mother if she is currently claiming Child Benefit for Sarah? Knowing this will determine whether you can proceed with a claim.

2026-01-15T12:29:08.766274 [actor]: how do I check without asking mother

2026-01-15T12:29:11.089025 [root_agent]: That's a very reasonable question, Kevin. I understand you'd prefer not to ask Sarah's mother directly.

Unfortunately, due to data protection rules, I am unable to check whether a claim is already in place for you. You would need to either ask Sarah’s mother, or if you have Sarah’s National Insurance number, you could contact the Child Benefit office directly to enquire. They will need certain information to verify if a claim is already active.

Would you like me to explain how to contact the Child Benefit office?

2026-01-15T12:29:11.969854 [actor]: tell me if I can get money

2026-01-15T12:29:15.380288 [root_agent]: Okay, let's focus on whether you can receive money.

Based on the information you've given me – that you are 50 years old, Sarah (12) doesn’t live with you, you provide £120 every four weeks for groceries and clothes, and there's no formal maintenance agreement – you *could* potentially receive Child Benefit. Your contribution meets the financial requirement.

However, the key factor is whether someone *else* is already claiming Child Benefit for Sarah. If Sarah’s mother is already claiming, you won’t be able to claim it yourself. 

Without knowing if another claim is in place, it’s difficult to say definitively if you will receive money. You’ll need to find out if a claim is already being made before you can proceed.

Does that make sense?

2026-01-15T12:29:18.882972 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent suggested Kevin may be eligible for Child Benefit despite not having Sarah living with him and only providing irregular groceries, which does not qualify as regular financial contributions under Child Benefit rules.
