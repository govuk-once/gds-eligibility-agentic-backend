2026-01-15T12:23:40.529225 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:23:41.160518 [root_agent]: Hello! I can help you with that. 

First, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:23:41.865605 [actor]: mother of teenager

2026-01-15T12:23:42.678765 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you are a mother of a teenager.

To assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old your child is?

2026-01-15T12:23:43.299413 [actor]: sofia 18

2026-01-15T12:23:44.308458 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Sofia is 18 years old.

Is Sofia currently in approved full-time education, or in approved training? (For example, A-Levels, university, or an apprenticeship).

2026-01-15T12:23:45.038116 [actor]: receptionist job 30 hours

2026-01-15T12:23:45.973624 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Sofia is working 30 hours a week as a receptionist.

Just to confirm, is Sofia still attending any courses or training programs alongside her job?

2026-01-15T12:23:46.736700 [actor]: no courses left school 2 years ago

2026-01-15T12:23:49.219340 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. 

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you are likely **not** eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia. This is because Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 16, or if they are 16-19 and not in approved education or training. Since Sofia is 18 and has been out of school for two years, and is working more than 24 hours a week, she doesn’t meet the criteria for continued eligibility.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or would you like to discuss anything else?





2026-01-15T12:23:50.391736 [actor]: not eligible

2026-01-15T12:23:52.786432 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Child Benefit is not available since Sofia is 18, not in approved education or training, left school two years ago, and works 30 hours per week.
