2026-01-15T12:24:37.922729 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:24:38.788790 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

First, are you responsible for a child under 20 years old?

2026-01-15T12:24:39.435230 [actor]: child responsibility yes

2026-01-15T12:24:39.999105 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Is the child you are responsible for currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:24:40.698685 [actor]: 4 year old daughter

2026-01-15T12:24:41.509310 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. 

To assess your eligibility fully, could you tell me roughly what your annual income is before tax? (Just an approximate figure is fine).

2026-01-15T12:24:42.319868 [actor]: salary 75000 partner earns 20000

2026-01-15T12:24:43.674703 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. So your income is £75,000 and your partner’s income is £20,000.

Just to clarify, is this adjusted net income – that is, your total income before tax minus certain deductions like pension contributions and Gift Aid?





2026-01-15T12:24:44.416076 [actor]: income before tax 75000

2026-01-15T12:24:46.410879 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. As your income is £75,000, this is above the threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge might apply.

Do you understand that while you can still *claim* Child Benefit, you may have to pay some or all of it back through your tax return, depending on your total household income? Or would you like me to explain this in more detail?

2026-01-15T12:24:47.236182 [actor]: explain tax

2026-01-15T12:24:51.733575 [root_agent]: Certainly! The High Income Child Benefit Charge means that if either you or your partner has an adjusted net income over £60,000, the amount of Child Benefit you receive is gradually reduced.

For every £100 of income *above* £60,000, you have to repay 1% of the total Child Benefit amount. Since your income is £75,000, you are £15,000 over the threshold. This means you would need to repay 15% of the Child Benefit you receive.

For the 2024/2025 tax year, the full amount of Child Benefit is £21.80 a week for your first child. So, you would receive this amount, but then repay 15% of it through your tax return at the end of the year.

You can choose to claim Child Benefit and pay the charge, or you can choose to opt out of receiving payments to avoid the tax return adjustment. 

Would you like me to work out an approximate amount of how much you might have to repay annually?

2026-01-15T12:24:52.391085 [actor]: how much

2026-01-15T12:24:55.348072 [root_agent]: Okay, let's work that out. 

The current full rate of Child Benefit is £21.80 per week for a first child. Over a year, that totals £1133.60 (£21.80 x 52 weeks).

Because your income is £75,000, you'd need to repay 15% of this amount. 

15% of £1133.60 is £170.04.

Therefore, you would likely need to repay approximately £170.04 through your tax return for the year.

Does this make sense? Would you like me to clarify anything about this calculation?

2026-01-15T12:24:56.139183 [actor]: am i eligible

2026-01-15T12:24:58.101535 [root_agent]: Yes, you *are* eligible to *claim* Child Benefit. However, because your income is over £60,000, you will likely have to repay some of it through your tax return – in your case, approximately £170.04 per year.

You can choose to claim and repay, or you can opt out of receiving payments to avoid the tax return adjustment. 

Would you like any further information about either of those options?

2026-01-15T12:25:01.857006 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Fiona is eligible to claim Child Benefit but would need to repay a portion through the High Income Child Benefit Charge due to her income being over £60,000.
