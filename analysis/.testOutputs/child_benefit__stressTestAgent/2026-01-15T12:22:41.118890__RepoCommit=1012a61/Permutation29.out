2026-01-15T12:30:56.424464 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:30:57.274452 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?





2026-01-15T12:30:58.259086 [actor]: 39 father have son

2026-01-15T12:30:59.697682 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you are 39 and have a son. That's helpful.

To clarify, are you asking whether *you* are eligible to *receive* Child Benefit for your son, or is your son asking if *he* is eligible to be *included* in a Child Benefit claim?





2026-01-15T12:31:00.474673 [actor]: claiming child benefit for my son living with me

2026-01-15T12:31:01.357348 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying – you are claiming Child Benefit *for* your son who lives with you.

To assess eligibility, could you please tell me how old your son is?

2026-01-15T12:31:01.969374 [actor]: son 17

2026-01-15T12:31:02.842291 [root_agent]: Thanks! Your son is 17.

Is your son currently in full-time, approved education or training? This includes things like A-levels, university, or an apprenticeship.

2026-01-15T12:31:03.725865 [actor]: no finished gcse last year not in college not working

2026-01-15T12:31:05.649502 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. So your son finished his GCSEs last year and is not currently in college, working, or undertaking any training.

Has he registered with any government-sponsored careers service, the armed forces, or started any similar approved training program? This is important because a young person can still be considered in approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes for up to 20 weeks *if* they've taken one of these steps.

2026-01-15T12:31:06.320467 [actor]: no not registered anywhere

2026-01-15T12:31:08.851579 [root_agent]: Thank you. As he’s 17 and not in approved education or training, and hasn’t registered with any relevant services, it appears he is no longer eligible for Child Benefit. 

Child Benefit usually stops at the end of August following a young person’s 16th birthday, unless they continue in approved education or training, or meet other specific criteria. As he doesn’t meet those criteria, it’s likely the claim would need to be adjusted.

Would you like me to summarise this for you, or perhaps discuss what steps you might take to confirm this with HMRC directly?

2026-01-15T12:31:11.098456 [actor]: I understand, thank you for the information. I won't be able to receive Child Benefit for my son since he's 17, not in education or training, and hasn't registered with any career services.

2026-01-15T12:31:12.656944 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available for a 17-year-old who is not in approved education or training and hasn't registered with career services.
