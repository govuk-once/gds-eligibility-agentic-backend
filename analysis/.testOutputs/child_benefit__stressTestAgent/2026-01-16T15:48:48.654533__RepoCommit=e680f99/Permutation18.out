2026-01-16T15:56:21.400991 [root_agent]: #I need to understand if the person is eligible for Child Benefit based on UK government rules. I'll need to ask several questions to determine this, one at a time.

Hello! I'd be happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to understand your situation better.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:56:22.551332 [actor]: child benefit for son in school

2026-01-16T15:56:24.242468 [root_agent]: #I need to understand more about the person's son and their specific situation to determine Child Benefit eligibility.

Thank you for sharing that information. How old is your son who is in school?

2026-01-16T15:56:25.240609 [actor]: son dev 19 a-levels

2026-01-16T15:56:27.698780 [root_agent]: #I need to confirm if this 19-year-old son doing A-levels qualifies as being in "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes, and gather other relevant details.

Thank you for that information. Since your son Dev is 19 and studying A-levels, I need to check a few more things.

Is Dev studying full-time (at least 12 hours a week of supervised study) at a school, college, or other approved education provider?

2026-01-16T15:56:28.447444 [actor]: full time yes

2026-01-16T15:56:31.036468 [root_agent]: #I need to continue gathering information about the person's situation to determine Child Benefit eligibility. I know their son is 19, doing A-levels full-time, which meets the education requirement, but I need more details.

Thank you. That's good to know that Dev is in full-time education. Child Benefit can continue until age 20 for young people in approved education like A-levels.

Do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-16T15:56:31.657049 [actor]: yes london

2026-01-16T15:56:33.385490 [root_agent]: #I need to gather more information about their residency status and right to reside in the UK, which are important eligibility factors for Child Benefit.

Thank you for confirming that you live in London. 

Are you a UK citizen, have settled status, or otherwise have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-16T15:56:34.197910 [actor]: british citizen

2026-01-16T15:56:35.984029 [root_agent]: #I need to check if they have responsibility for the child and if there are any high-income considerations, which might affect their Child Benefit entitlement.

Thank you for confirming that you're a British citizen. 

Is Dev living with you, or do you have main responsibility for his care?

2026-01-16T15:56:36.711120 [actor]: dev lives with me

2026-01-16T15:56:38.529138 [root_agent]: #I need to check about high-income considerations, as this may affect their Child Benefit entitlement.

Thank you for confirming that Dev lives with you. 

One important factor I need to check: Do you or a partner you live with have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-16T15:56:39.269599 [actor]: income 30000

2026-01-16T15:56:42.141512 [root_agent]: #I need to check if there are any other potential disqualifying factors, but based on what I know so far, they seem eligible.

Thank you for providing your income information. 

Based on what you've told me so far:
- Your son Dev is 19 and in full-time approved education (A-levels)
- You live in the UK and are a British citizen
- Dev lives with you
- Your income is below the £50,000 threshold

From this information, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit for Dev. 

Are there any other benefits or financial support you're currently receiving that you think might affect your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-16T15:56:42.989549 [actor]: dev birthday next month 20 years old

2026-01-16T15:56:46.370662 [root_agent]: #This is a critical piece of information. Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 20, even if they're still in education.

Thank you for sharing that important information. 

Child Benefit will stop when Dev turns 20 next month, even if he continues his A-level studies. This is because Child Benefit can only be paid for children under 16, or young people under 20 who are in approved education or training.

Based on what you've told me, you should be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Dev until his 20th birthday next month. After that date, the payments will stop automatically.

Would you like to know about any other forms of support that might be available after Dev turns 20?

2026-01-16T15:56:49.923485 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit would be available until Dev turns 20 next month, after which it would stop, which aligns with UK government rules.
