Do you have responsibility for Ryan, your 17-year-old son who is in an apprenticeship?

2026-01-16T15:53:07.485813 [actor]: Ryan lives with me yes

2026-01-16T15:53:08.488521 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Ryan lives with you. 

Is Ryan normally living in the UK?

2026-01-16T15:53:09.463260 [actor]: UK yes he lives at home

2026-01-16T15:53:11.327585 [root_agent]: Thank you. Since Ryan is 17 years old and in an apprenticeship, I need to understand more about his educational situation.

Is Ryan's apprenticeship considered approved education or training? This typically includes education in schools or colleges, or training programs approved by the government.

2026-01-16T15:53:12.209613 [actor]: Intermediate Apprenticeship government funded England

2026-01-16T15:53:13.060941 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is this apprenticeship unpaid, or does Ryan receive payment for it?

2026-01-16T15:53:13.771813 [actor]: apprenticeship paid training job

2026-01-16T15:53:14.887511 [root_agent]: I understand that Ryan is in a paid apprenticeship. 

Does Ryan's pay from this apprenticeship exceed £290 per week?

2026-01-16T15:53:15.760101 [actor]: no less money apprentice wage

2026-01-16T15:53:17.030625 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-16T15:53:17.816179 [actor]: single parent not earning that much

2026-01-16T15:53:21.923485 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've told me, it appears you are likely eligible for Child Benefit for Ryan because:

1. Ryan is your 17-year-old son who lives with you in the UK
2. He is in an approved government-funded intermediate apprenticeship
3. His apprenticeship wage is below £290 per week
4. You are a single parent earning below the £60,000 high income threshold

Child Benefit can be paid for children under 20 who are in approved education or training, which includes government-funded apprenticeships. Since Ryan meets these criteria and his apprenticeship pay is below the threshold, you should be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him.

Would you like information about how to claim Child Benefit or any details about the payment amounts?

2026-01-16T15:53:23.227991 [actor]: I understand that I'm eligible for Child Benefit for Ryan. Thank you for confirming this.

2026-01-16T15:53:25.346934 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The determination was accurate as 17-year-olds in approved training (like government-funded apprenticeships) with earnings below £290 per week are eligible for Child Benefit.
