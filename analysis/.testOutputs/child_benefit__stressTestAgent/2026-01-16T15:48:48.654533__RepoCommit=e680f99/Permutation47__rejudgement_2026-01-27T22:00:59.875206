The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is meant for the person with whom the child lives and has day-to-day responsibility, not for the non-resident parent making maintenance payments, even if court-ordered. This aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible" (meaning the ex-partner would be eligible, not the inquirer).
