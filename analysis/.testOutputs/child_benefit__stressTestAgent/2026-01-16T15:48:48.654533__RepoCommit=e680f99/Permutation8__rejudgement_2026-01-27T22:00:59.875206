2026-01-27T22:04:52.997864 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated the user would have to pay back the "full amount" through the High Income Child Benefit Charge. Since Fiona earns £75,000 (between £60,000-£80,000), she would only need to pay back a portion of the benefit (1% for every £200 over £60k), not the full amount. The expected outcome should be "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)" without implying full repayment.
