2026-01-27T22:04:39.544900 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The expected outcome is "Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)" but the agent incorrectly stated the person was likely still eligible for Child Benefit. The agent failed to correctly apply the rule that eligibility ceases after the linked hospital stays exceed 12 weeks unless specific exceptions apply.
