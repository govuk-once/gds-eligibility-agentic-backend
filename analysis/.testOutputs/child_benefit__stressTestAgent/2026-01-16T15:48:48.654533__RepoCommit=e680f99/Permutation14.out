2026-01-16T15:54:20.619129 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you in the UK?

2026-01-16T15:54:21.463221 [actor]: Noah child benefit

2026-01-16T15:54:23.261157 [root_agent]: I notice your response is quite brief. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand if you're responsible for raising a child who lives with you in the UK. 

Could you please confirm whether you are responsible for a child named Noah who lives with you in the UK?

2026-01-16T15:54:24.072173 [actor]: my son Noah grandmother house after surgery

2026-01-16T15:54:25.594875 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son Noah is staying at his grandmother's house after surgery.

To continue assessing your Child Benefit eligibility, is Noah temporarily staying with his grandmother, or is this a permanent arrangement?

2026-01-16T15:54:26.337649 [actor]: temporary my surgery recovering

2026-01-16T15:54:29.576599 [root_agent]: I understand that Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother while you recover from surgery. Thank you for clarifying that.

For Child Benefit purposes, this type of temporary arrangement typically doesn't affect your eligibility. Since this is a temporary situation due to your medical recovery, and you remain responsible for Noah, you would generally still be considered eligible for Child Benefit.

May I ask how old Noah is? (Child Benefit is usually available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training.)

2026-01-16T15:54:30.242038 [actor]: 6 years

2026-01-16T15:54:32.099663 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Noah is 6 years old. That means he meets the age requirement for Child Benefit.

Is Noah normally living in the UK when he's not temporarily staying with his grandmother?

2026-01-16T15:54:33.061400 [actor]: yes uk only

2026-01-16T15:54:35.897999 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Noah normally lives in the UK.

Based on what you've told me so far, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit because:
- You are responsible for Noah, who is 6 years old
- Noah normally lives with you in the UK
- His current stay with his grandmother is only temporary while you recover from surgery

May I ask if you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year? This affects whether you would need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-16T15:54:36.762712 [actor]: single mother income low

2026-01-16T15:54:39.834283 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. As a single mother with a low income, you should be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit payment without having to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit for your son Noah. Even though he's temporarily staying with his grandmother while you recover from surgery, you remain responsible for him, and temporary arrangements like this typically don't affect your eligibility.

If you're not already claiming Child Benefit, you can apply online or by post using form CH2. Would you like me to provide more information about how to claim Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T15:54:40.715190 [actor]: How long can he stay with my mother?

2026-01-16T15:54:44.898447 [root_agent]: When it comes to Child Benefit eligibility while your child stays with someone else temporarily, there isn't a strict time limit specified by the UK government. What's important is that you maintain responsibility for Noah and that this arrangement is indeed temporary.

As long as:
- You remain responsible for Noah's upbringing
- You're providing financial support for him
- The arrangement with your mother is temporary while you recover
- You intend for Noah to return to live with you

You should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit during this period.

If the arrangement becomes more long-term (several months or more), it would be advisable to contact the Child Benefit Office to update them on your situation. They can provide specific guidance based on your circumstances.

Is there anything specific about your recovery timeline that you're concerned about regarding this arrangement?

2026-01-16T15:54:45.717083 [actor]: 8 weeks?

2026-01-16T15:54:48.693066 [root_agent]: Yes, an 8-week temporary stay with your mother while you recover should not affect your Child Benefit eligibility. This is well within what would be considered a reasonable temporary arrangement due to health circumstances.

During this period, as long as you maintain parental responsibility for Noah and continue to support him financially, your Child Benefit should continue as normal. You don't need to notify the Child Benefit Office for a temporary arrangement of this length unless there are other changes in your circumstances.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit during this temporary arrangement?

2026-01-16T15:54:51.543078 [actor]: I understand now. My son can stay with grandmother for up to 8 weeks while I recover from surgery and I'll still get Child Benefit. Mother not claiming benefit for Noah. Thank you for information.

2026-01-16T15:54:53.581336 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit while their child temporarily stays with the grandmother during recovery from surgery, which aligns with government guidance on temporary childcare arrangements.
