2026-01-16T16:11:02.932956 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:11:04.152740 [actor]: I'll play the role of the user in this conversation about Child Benefit eligibility.

teenager edinburgh not in school anymore training program

2026-01-16T16:11:06.098542 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. To clarify further about your situation with the teenager:

Are you responsible for this teenager who lives in Edinburgh and is in a training program? By responsible, I mean they live with you or you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit toward their care.

2026-01-16T16:11:07.221816 [actor]: my daughter Fiona lives with me shes 16 no school now doing that no one left behind thing

2026-01-16T16:11:09.620169 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your daughter Fiona is 16, lives with you in Edinburgh, and is participating in the "No One Left Behind" program rather than being in school.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to confirm: Is the "No One Left Behind" program an approved education or training program? This would typically be something like further education, training, or an apprenticeship that's approved by the relevant authorities.

2026-01-16T16:11:10.922749 [actor]: scottish government program for young people training

2026-01-16T16:11:12.852839 [root_agent]: I understand now. So your 16-year-old daughter Fiona lives with you and is in a Scottish Government training program called "No One Left Behind."

For my next question: Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year? This is important because it affects whether you'll need to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-16T16:11:14.116762 [actor]: no money issues part time work only

2026-01-16T16:11:15.596017 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you work part-time and don't have income over £60,000, you wouldn't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Next question: Is Fiona a UK resident? This is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-16T16:11:16.406773 [actor]: born here edinburgh all her life

2026-01-16T16:11:18.041848 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Fiona was born in Edinburgh and has lived there all her life, so she is a UK resident.

My next question: Do you or Fiona receive any other payments from the government specifically for her care, such as from a local authority or through other support programs?

2026-01-16T16:11:18.994694 [actor]: no other money just the training place

2026-01-16T16:11:22.941349 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're not receiving other payments for Fiona's care.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears that you are likely eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. Your daughter Fiona is 16 years old
2. She lives with you (you have responsibility for her)
3. She is in approved training (the Scottish Government's "No One Left Behind" program)
4. She is a UK resident
5. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge
6. You're not receiving other payments specifically for her care

Child Benefit can typically be claimed until a child turns 16, or until they're 20 if they stay in approved education or training. The "No One Left Behind" program as a Scottish Government training initiative should qualify as approved training.

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-16T16:11:24.082835 [actor]: thank you eligible good news

2026-01-16T16:11:27.278377 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly assessed that a 16-year-old in the Scottish Government's "No One Left Behind" training program would qualify for Child Benefit, with all other eligibility criteria also being met.
