First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T15:49:21.844593 [root_agent]: I notice I need to clarify our conversation. I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit based on your situation.

From what you've shared, it seems you're Amit, a single father in London with a 17-year-old daughter who is in college. To properly assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to confirm a few details.

Is your 17-year-old daughter living with you?

2026-01-16T15:49:22.796176 [actor]: live together london flat daughter studies nearby

2026-01-16T15:49:24.348429 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you live together with your 17-year-old daughter in a London flat, and she studies nearby.

Is your daughter in approved education, such as A-levels, NVQs, or other further education?

2026-01-16T15:49:24.997897 [actor]: sixth form college a-levels

2026-01-16T15:49:26.543211 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Your daughter is studying A-levels at a sixth form college, which is considered approved education.

May I ask about your income? Do you (or a partner if applicable) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-16T15:49:27.275921 [actor]: forty thousand pounds yearly accountant job

2026-01-16T15:49:29.039256 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. You earn £40,000 per year from your accountant job, which is below the £60,000 threshold where Child Benefit starts to be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Is your daughter's other parent involved in her care, and if so, do they claim Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-16T15:49:29.681846 [actor]: single father no other parent involved

2026-01-16T15:49:33.652330 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're a single father with no other parent involved.

Given the information you've provided:
- You're a single father living with your 17-year-old daughter
- Your daughter is studying A-levels at sixth form college (approved education)
- Your income is £40,000 per year, which is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold
- There is no other parent involved who might be claiming Child Benefit

Based on UK government rules, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter. Child Benefit can be paid for children under 20 who are in approved education.

Since your daughter is 17 and in approved education (A-levels), and she lives with you, you meet the basic eligibility requirements. Your income level also means you would receive the full amount without reduction.

Would you like to know about the next steps for claiming Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T15:49:35.569148 [actor]: Thank you for confirming my eligibility money important need to apply online?

2026-01-16T15:49:37.453522 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Amit is eligible for Child Benefit as he has a 17-year-old daughter in approved education (A-levels), lives with her, has an income below the threshold (£40,000), and is the only parent involved.
