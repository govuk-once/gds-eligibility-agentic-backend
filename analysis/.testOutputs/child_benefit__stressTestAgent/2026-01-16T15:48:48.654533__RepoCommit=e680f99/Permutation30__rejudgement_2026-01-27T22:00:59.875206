The agent correctly determined that Lucas (the claimant earning £18,000) is eligible to receive Child Benefit for their children, while also accurately explaining that Emily (partner earning £65,000) would be liable to pay the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge, effectively paying back the full amount through the tax system. This matches the expected outcome.
