2026-01-27T22:04:50.407395 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed to provide accurate information about the 91-day limit for jobseekers. According to the scenario, there is a specific 91-day limit for claiming as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status, after which the right to reside for benefit purposes often expires. Since the user has been a jobseeker for 95 days with no job offer, the correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible (Expired)" rather than suggesting continued eligibility.
