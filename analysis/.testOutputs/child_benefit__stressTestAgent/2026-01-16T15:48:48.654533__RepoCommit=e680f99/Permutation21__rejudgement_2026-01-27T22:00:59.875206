2026-01-27T22:04:45.498970 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed to correctly identify that Robert should receive the higher "eldest child" rate (£26.05) since Sam is the only child in his household. According to the expected outcome, both parents should receive the higher rate for their respective children, but the agent didn't mention this important aspect of the benefit calculation.
