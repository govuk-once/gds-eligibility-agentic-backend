2026-01-16T15:53:59.078633 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:54:00.176314 [actor]: child 4 years old coming to live with us adoption process

2026-01-16T15:54:01.954531 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand you have a 4-year-old child who will be coming to live with you through the adoption process.

In relation to this adoption process, has the child already moved in with you, or are you still in the process of the child coming to live with you?

2026-01-16T15:54:02.882983 [actor]: maya lives with us now adoption agency placed her not final court order yet

2026-01-16T15:54:04.702907 [root_agent]: I understand that Maya, who is 4 years old, is currently living with you after being placed by the adoption agency, though you don't have the final court order yet.

Are you currently responsible for Maya's day-to-day care and providing for her needs while she's living with you?

2026-01-16T15:54:05.501418 [actor]: yes we take care of everything for her

2026-01-16T15:54:07.428102 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're taking care of everything for Maya while she lives with you.

Based on the information you've provided, you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Maya even though the adoption isn't finalized yet, as you have responsibility for her care.

Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year in individual adjusted net income?

2026-01-16T15:54:08.309932 [actor]: husband job earns 50,000

2026-01-16T15:54:11.319998 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. With your husband earning £50,000, you should be aware that:

1. You can receive the full Child Benefit payment since his income is under £60,000. (The Child Benefit High Income Tax Charge only begins to reduce benefits when an individual's income exceeds £50,000, with full repayment required at £60,000).

2. Since Maya is living with you and you're responsible for her care, even though the adoption isn't finalized, you appear to meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

Is Maya a UK resident? (This is important for Child Benefit eligibility)

2026-01-16T15:54:12.086893 [actor]: yes UK resident same as us

2026-01-16T15:54:14.720528 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Maya is a UK resident, same as you.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Maya because:

1. She is 4 years old (under 16)
2. She lives with you and you're responsible for her care
3. Neither you nor your husband earns over £60,000
4. She is a UK resident

You can apply for Child Benefit even though the adoption isn't finalized yet, as you have responsibility for Maya's care after placement by the adoption agency.

Is there anything specific about the Child Benefit process you'd like to know?

2026-01-16T15:54:16.787356 [actor]: Thank you for the information. We need to fill out child benefit forms then. My husband and I will do this soon.

2026-01-16T15:54:18.541489 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit because they have responsibility for a 4-year-old child placed with them by an adoption agency (even without final court order), their household income is below the threshold, and the child is a UK resident.
