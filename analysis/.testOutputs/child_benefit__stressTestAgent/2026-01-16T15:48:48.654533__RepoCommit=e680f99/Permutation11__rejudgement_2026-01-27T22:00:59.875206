2026-01-27T22:05:33.587477 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the evaluation judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly determined that Karen is eligible for Child Benefit. According to UK government rules, apprenticeships in England are a disqualifying event for Child Benefit, unlike staying in school for A-levels. The expected outcome should have been "Not Eligible" (Karen must stop her claim), but the agent incorrectly advised that she was eligible.
