2026-01-28T12:50:50.188455 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the parent (Mo) was not eligible for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome was "Eligible." According to gov.uk guidance, combined contributions from multiple people (Mo and grandmother totaling £30) that meet or exceed the Child Benefit amount (£25.60) can qualify the contributor for Child Benefit even when the child lives with someone else.
