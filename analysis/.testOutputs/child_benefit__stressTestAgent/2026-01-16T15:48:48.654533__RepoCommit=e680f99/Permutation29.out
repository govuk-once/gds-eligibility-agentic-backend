2026-01-16T16:01:12.629196 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess this.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-16T16:01:13.484481 [actor]: son Jordan

2026-01-16T16:01:14.474059 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit regarding your son Jordan.

How old is Jordan?

2026-01-16T16:01:15.191453 [actor]: Jordan 17

2026-01-16T16:01:17.063420 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Jordan is 17, to determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to know if he's in approved education or training.

Is Jordan currently in approved education (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3) or approved training?

2026-01-16T16:01:17.988446 [actor]: finished GCSEs not working not college

2026-01-16T16:01:21.052224 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared, since Jordan is 17, has finished his GCSEs, and is not currently in approved education or training, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for him.

Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 16, or for those aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training. Since Jordan is 17 and not currently in education or training, he doesn't meet these criteria.

If Jordan decides to start approved education or training before his 19th birthday, you could potentially become eligible again at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:01:24.037882 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit cannot be claimed for a 17-year-old who is not in approved education or training.
