2026-01-28T12:51:16.037621 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly determined the user was eligible for Child Benefit. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible (Expired)" because jobseeker status for benefit purposes expires after 91 days. The user explicitly mentioned being at 95 days, which is past the limit, but the agent incorrectly stated there was no 91-day limit and advised the user they should still be eligible to apply.
