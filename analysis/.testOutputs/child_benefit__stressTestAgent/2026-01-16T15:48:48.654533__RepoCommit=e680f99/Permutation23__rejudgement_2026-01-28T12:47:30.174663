2026-01-28T12:50:57.771543 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly determined the user was not eligible for Child Benefit. According to gov.uk guidance, a non-resident parent who regularly spends enough on their child can claim Child Benefit. The user's £120 every 4 weeks (£30/week) exceeds the required weekly amount (£26.05), making them potentially eligible despite not living with their child.
