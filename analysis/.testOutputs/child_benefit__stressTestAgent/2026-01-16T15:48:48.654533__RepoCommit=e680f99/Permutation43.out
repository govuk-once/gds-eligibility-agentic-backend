2026-01-16T16:07:31.408340 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:07:32.994755 [actor]: I'll act as a UK resident who needs to find out about Child Benefit eligibility, following the persona described. I'll be obtuse, speak in search terms, and not directly answer questions.

2026-01-16T16:07:34.264946 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about Child Benefit in Glasgow regarding a son who is in an apprenticeship.

To determine your eligibility, I need to know: How old is your son who is doing the apprenticeship?

2026-01-16T16:07:35.025279 [actor]: callum 17 modern apprentice scotland

2026-01-16T16:07:36.713932 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Callum is 17 and doing a modern apprenticeship in Scotland, I need to check if this qualifies as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Is Callum's apprenticeship considered an "approved" training course by the education authority?

2026-01-16T16:07:37.580133 [actor]: modern apprenticeship glasgow getting paid weekly

2026-01-16T16:07:38.988489 [root_agent]: I understand your son is on a modern apprenticeship in Glasgow and is getting paid weekly.

Is your son living with you while he's doing this apprenticeship?

2026-01-16T16:07:39.698077 [actor]: callum lives father glasgow

2026-01-16T16:07:40.831898 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Callum lives with his father in Glasgow.

Are you the father that Callum lives with in Glasgow?

2026-01-16T16:07:41.589578 [actor]: yes father callum

2026-01-16T16:07:42.753125 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are Callum's father and he lives with you.

Does anyone else claim Child Benefit for Callum already?

2026-01-16T16:07:43.512976 [actor]: no one else claim benefit

2026-01-16T16:07:45.046520 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since Callum is 17 and on a modern apprenticeship, I need to confirm one more important detail: Is Callum's apprenticeship unpaid or does the payment he receives exceed £280 per week?

2026-01-16T16:07:45.828228 [actor]: paid apprenticeship salary below £280

2026-01-16T16:07:49.463148 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Callum's apprenticeship salary is below £280 per week.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You are Callum's father and he lives with you in Glasgow
- Callum is 17 years old and on a modern apprenticeship
- His apprenticeship pays him weekly but less than £280 per week
- No one else claims Child Benefit for him

You are likely eligible for Child Benefit for Callum. Modern apprenticeships generally count as approved education or training in the UK, and Child Benefit can continue until a child turns 20 if they remain in approved education or training. Since his income is below £280 per week, this shouldn't affect eligibility.

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to complete a Child Benefit claim form (CH2) if you haven't claimed before.

Would you like information on how to make a claim?

2026-01-16T16:07:52.163516 [actor]: Unfortunately, I need to inform you that what you've told me isn't accurate. In England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, parents generally cannot get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship, regardless of the pay amount. Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland are paid training programs that don't qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Since Callum is 17 and on a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, you are not eligible for Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-16T16:07:54.504039 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent incorrectly stated I would be eligible for Child Benefit for my 17-year-old son on a paid Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, when apprenticeships do not qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.
