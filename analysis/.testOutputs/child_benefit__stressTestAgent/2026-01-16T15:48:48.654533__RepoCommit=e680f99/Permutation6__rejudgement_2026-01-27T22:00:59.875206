2026-01-27T22:05:21.389401 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge. The agent provided incorrect information. According to UK government rules, Child Benefit normally stops after 12 weeks when a child is in hospital, but there are exceptions when the parent continues spending money on the child's upkeep (which is the case here). The agent should have mentioned the 12-week rule and explained that Mary qualifies for an exception, rather than stating there is no time limit.
