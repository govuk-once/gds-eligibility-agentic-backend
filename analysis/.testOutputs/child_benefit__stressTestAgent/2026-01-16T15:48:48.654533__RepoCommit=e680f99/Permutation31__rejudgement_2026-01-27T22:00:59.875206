2026-01-27T22:04:15.974377 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed because a university bachelor's degree is considered "advanced education" not "approved education", and Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education such as a university degree. The agent incorrectly told the user they were eligible.
