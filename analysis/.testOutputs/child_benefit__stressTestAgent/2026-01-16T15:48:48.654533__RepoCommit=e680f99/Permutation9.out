First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

German jobseeker UK benefits son 5 years

2026-01-16T15:52:31.638576 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I'll need to ask you some questions to determine your Child Benefit eligibility.

Based on what you've shared, it seems you're from Germany, currently in the UK as a jobseeker, and you have a 5-year-old son. To properly assess your eligibility, I need to understand your specific situation better.

Does your 5-year-old son live with you in the UK?

2026-01-16T15:52:32.482311 [actor]: Lives with me UK my house

2026-01-16T15:52:34.327557 [root_agent]: I understand that your 5-year-old son lives with you in your house in the UK. Thank you for confirming that.

Do you have the right to live in the UK (for example, do you have UK citizenship, settled status, pre-settled status, or another immigration status that allows you to live in the UK)?

2026-01-16T15:52:35.219034 [actor]: Pre-settled German looking for job

2026-01-16T15:52:37.063784 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you have pre-settled status and are from Germany looking for a job in the UK.

Do you have the main responsibility for raising your 5-year-old son? By this I mean, does your son live with you and are you the person who primarily cares for him?

2026-01-16T15:52:37.795855 [actor]: Yes care for son alone

2026-01-16T15:52:39.061330 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you have sole responsibility for caring for your son.

Are you subject to immigration control with a condition that prevents you from claiming public funds in the UK?

2026-01-16T15:52:39.930468 [actor]: No restrictions jobseeker EU settlement scheme

2026-01-16T15:52:41.454982 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're on the EU Settlement Scheme with pre-settled status and don't have restrictions preventing you from claiming public funds, that's helpful to know.

Is your child attending school or appropriate education for their age in the UK?

2026-01-16T15:52:42.084773 [actor]: Yes school kindergarten

2026-01-16T15:52:46.663493 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your child attends kindergarten, which is appropriate education for a 5-year-old in the UK.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have pre-settled status in the UK under the EU Settlement Scheme
- Your 5-year-old son lives with you in the UK
- You have sole responsibility for caring for your son
- You don't have immigration restrictions preventing you from claiming public funds
- Your child is attending appropriate education (kindergarten)

You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. As someone with pre-settled status without restrictions on claiming public funds, who is responsible for a child under 16 living with you in the UK, you meet the basic eligibility criteria.

You can apply for Child Benefit by completing the CH2 form, which is available on the GOV.UK website or by calling the Child Benefit Office. The current rates are £25.60 per week for your first child and £16.95 per week for any additional children.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for someone with pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme who has responsibility for a child living with them in the UK and who isn't subject to immigration restrictions.
