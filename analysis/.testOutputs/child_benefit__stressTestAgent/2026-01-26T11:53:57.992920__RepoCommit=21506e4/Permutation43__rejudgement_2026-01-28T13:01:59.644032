2026-01-28T13:10:49.340371 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly determined the user was eligible for Child Benefit. According to UK government guidance, in Scotland, Modern Apprenticeships do not qualify as approved training for Child Benefit purposes. The correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible" as Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland are paid apprenticeships that disqualify eligibility.
