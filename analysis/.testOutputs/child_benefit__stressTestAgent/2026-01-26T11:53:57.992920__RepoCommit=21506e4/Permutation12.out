2026-01-26T11:58:16.843043 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T11:58:19.376991 [actor]: I need to respond as someone in the situation described. I'll play the role of an 18-year-old named Liam who lives with his mother Jessica.

Yes, I'm a bit confused actually. I'm 18, still living at home with my mum. I'm studying for my A-levels at the moment. I've started getting Universal Credit recently to help with my personal expenses since I'm estranged from my dad and don't have any income.

2026-01-26T11:58:22.006059 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context, Liam. Based on what you've shared, I need to clarify something - it sounds like you're the 18-year-old child in your household, not someone responsible for raising a child. 

To determine eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand who is applying. Is your question about whether your mother Jessica would be eligible to receive Child Benefit for you, or are you asking about something else?

2026-01-26T11:58:24.420443 [actor]: Oh, I see the confusion. No, I'm asking on behalf of my mum, Jessica. She wants to know if she's eligible to receive Child Benefit for me. I'm 18 and still living with her while I study for my A-levels. She's wondering if she can claim Child Benefit since I'm still in education, even though I've recently started receiving Universal Credit myself.

2026-01-26T11:58:26.139434 [root_agent]: I understand now, thank you for clarifying. You're asking about your mother Jessica's eligibility to receive Child Benefit for you. Let me ask some questions to determine this.

Since you're 18 years old, is your education currently approved full-time non-advanced education (like A-levels) or approved training?

2026-01-26T11:58:27.343034 [actor]: Yes, I'm currently studying for my A-levels full-time. I'm in my final year at sixth form college.

2026-01-26T11:58:29.214089 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know that you're studying A-levels full-time at sixth form college.

You mentioned you're receiving Universal Credit. Are you receiving this benefit in your own right as an individual claim, rather than as part of your mother's claim?

2026-01-26T11:58:30.581217 [actor]: Yes, I've claimed Universal Credit on my own. Since I'm estranged from my dad and don't have any income, I was able to make my own claim to help with my personal expenses, even though I'm living with my mum.

2026-01-26T11:58:34.712992 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since you're 18 and receiving Universal Credit in your own right, this affects your mother's eligibility for Child Benefit. According to UK government rules, Child Benefit typically stops on August 31st after a child turns 16, but can continue if they stay in approved education or training.

However, if a young person aged 16 to 19 starts claiming certain benefits in their own right (including Universal Credit), then Child Benefit payments for them will stop.

Based on what you've told me, since you're 18 and claiming Universal Credit independently, your mother Jessica would not be eligible to receive Child Benefit for you, even though you're still in full-time education.

2026-01-26T11:58:36.785837 [actor]: I understand. I didn't realize that me getting Universal Credit would affect mum's Child Benefit. That's disappointing as every bit helps with the household expenses, but I guess those are the rules. Thanks for explaining it to me.

2026-01-26T11:58:39.546172 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent was right to explain that when a young person aged 16-19 claims Universal Credit in their own right, Child Benefit payments for them will stop, even if they are still in approved education.
