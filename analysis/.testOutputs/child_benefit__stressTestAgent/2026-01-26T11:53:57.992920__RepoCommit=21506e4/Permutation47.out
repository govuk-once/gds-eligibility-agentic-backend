2026-01-26T12:14:17.119954 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:14:18.995952 [actor]: Yes, I have a child, but they don't live with me. I pay £50 a week for their maintenance, but that's only because there's a court order forcing me to pay it. I don't think I should be eligible since I'm not paying voluntarily.

2026-01-26T12:14:20.378972 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To clarify your situation, is the child living with their other parent or another person who is receiving Child Benefit for them?

2026-01-26T12:14:21.911751 [actor]: Yes, the child lives with their mother. She probably gets Child Benefit for our child. I only pay the maintenance because the court ordered me to pay it, not by choice.

2026-01-26T12:14:24.887824 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you've provided, you wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit for this child. 

Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with, which in this case is the child's mother. Since the child doesn't live with you and the other parent is likely already receiving Child Benefit, you wouldn't be eligible to claim it.

The fact that you pay court-ordered maintenance doesn't qualify you for Child Benefit in this situation. Child Benefit is separate from child maintenance arrangements and is generally paid to the person who has the main responsibility for caring for the child.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T12:14:26.887196 [actor]: I understand. So even though I'm paying maintenance for my child through the court order, I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because my child lives with their mother. That makes sense since she's the one taking care of them day-to-day. Thanks for explaining that to me.

2026-01-26T12:14:29.019002 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with (in this case, the mother), and the fact that the user pays court-ordered maintenance doesn't qualify them for Child Benefit.
