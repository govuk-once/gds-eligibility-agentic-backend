2026-01-26T11:55:25.027703 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First question: Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T11:55:26.824153 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Lucas who is 10 years old. He doesn't live with me though - he lives with my ex-wife Jenny after our divorce. I do send money to help with his expenses every month.

2026-01-26T11:55:28.864787 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Lucas doesn't live with you, I need to understand more about your situation.

Next question: Do you pay an equal or higher amount in child maintenance for Lucas than the Child Benefit rate (currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child)?

2026-01-26T11:55:29.971778 [actor]: Yes, I transfer £150 per month to Jenny specifically for Lucas's food and clothes. I make sure to send this money regularly to help with his expenses.

2026-01-26T11:55:31.894934 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. The amount you're paying (£150 per month) is approximately £34.62 per week, which is higher than the current Child Benefit rate of £25.60 per week for an eldest or only child.

Next question: Has Lucas's mother (Jenny) made a claim for Child Benefit for him already?

2026-01-26T11:55:33.307034 [actor]: No, Jenny hasn't claimed Child Benefit for Lucas. She mentioned this to me recently, which is why I'm now looking into whether I could claim it instead.

2026-01-26T11:55:34.598160 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: Is Lucas living in the UK? And are you also a UK resident?

2026-01-26T11:55:36.202291 [actor]: Yes, both Lucas and I live in the UK. He's with his mother in Manchester, and I'm living in Liverpool now. We're all UK residents.

2026-01-26T11:55:37.481304 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: Do you have regular contact with Lucas? For example, do you see him on weekends or holidays?

2026-01-26T11:55:38.986274 [actor]: Yes, I see Lucas regularly. He stays with me every other weekend and for two weeks during the summer holidays. We also spend time together during other school breaks throughout the year. I make sure to stay involved in his life despite our living situation.

2026-01-26T11:55:44.082015 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on what you've told me, you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas because:

1. You're responsible for a child under 16 (Lucas is 10)
2. You pay more than the Child Benefit rate in maintenance (£150/month exceeds the £25.60/week requirement)
3. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Lucas
4. Both you and Lucas are UK residents
5. You maintain regular contact with Lucas

Since you're paying maintenance and have regular contact with your son, you could be considered to be taking sufficient financial responsibility for him to qualify.

However, I should note that typically Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with most of the time, which would be Lucas's mother. It might be worth discussing this with Jenny, as she would generally have the primary claim.

Would you like me to explain what steps you would need to take to make a claim?

2026-01-26T11:55:45.227972 [actor]: Yes, that's great news! I'd appreciate if you could tell me what steps I need to take to make a claim for Child Benefit for Lucas.

2026-01-26T11:55:52.500272 [root_agent]: I'm happy to explain the steps you need to take to make a Child Benefit claim for Lucas. Here's what you'll need to do:

1. Complete a Child Benefit claim form CH2. You can:
   - Download and print the form from GOV.UK
   - Call the Child Benefit Office to request a form be sent to you
   - Get a form from your local post office (in some cases)

2. When filling out the form, you'll need to provide:
   - Your personal details (National Insurance number, contact information)
   - Lucas's details (birth certificate or passport may be needed)
   - Bank or building society account details where you want the benefit paid

3. In your specific situation, you should also:
   - Include information about your maintenance payments
   - Explain your regular contact arrangements with Lucas
   - Note that Lucas primarily lives with his mother but no claim has been made

4. Send your completed form to:
   Child Benefit Office
   PO Box 1
   Newcastle Upon Tyne
   NE88 1AA

5. Be prepared that the Child Benefit Office might contact both you and Jenny to confirm the situation, as they generally pay Child Benefit to the person the child lives with most of the time.

6. If your individual income is over £60,000 per year, you'll have to pay back all of your Child Benefit through a tax charge. If your income is between £50,000 and £60,000, you'll have to pay back part of it.

Would you like me to explain anything specific about any of these steps?

2026-01-26T11:55:55.125663 [actor]: Thank you for the detailed information. That all seems clear - I'll download the CH2 form and make sure to include all the details about my maintenance payments and contact arrangements with Lucas. 

One quick question - approximately how long does it usually take for a claim to be processed once I've submitted everything?

2026-01-26T11:55:58.055034 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about child benefit eligibility in cases where the child lives with an ex-partner, correctly noting that the father may be eligible since he pays more than the minimum maintenance amount, has regular contact with his son, and no one else has claimed.
