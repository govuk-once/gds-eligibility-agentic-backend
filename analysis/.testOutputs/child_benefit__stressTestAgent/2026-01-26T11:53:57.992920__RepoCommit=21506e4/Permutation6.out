2026-01-26T11:55:59.506571 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T11:56:00.752975 [actor]: I have a daughter named Chloe who is 6 years old, so she's definitely under 16.

2026-01-26T11:56:02.789659 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your daughter Chloe who is 6 years old. She's indeed under 16, which meets one of the criteria.

Now, are you responsible for raising Chloe? This typically means she lives with you, or you're paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent in kind) toward looking after her.

2026-01-26T11:56:03.920370 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for raising Chloe. She's my daughter and I take care of her.

2026-01-26T11:56:04.938137 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're responsible for raising Chloe.

Next, I need to ask: do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T11:56:05.785434 [actor]: Yes, I do live in the UK.

2026-01-26T11:56:07.345862 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Now, regarding your immigration status: are you a UK national, or do you have a right to reside in the UK, or do you have settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme?

2026-01-26T11:56:08.500850 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK national.

2026-01-26T11:56:10.466873 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you're a UK national.

Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year? This is important because while you'd still be eligible for Child Benefit, if either of you earns over £50,000 per year, you may need to pay a tax charge known as the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-26T11:56:11.428910 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that amount. My income is well below £50,000.

2026-01-26T11:56:15.753634 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your income being well below £50,000.

Based on all the information you've provided:
- You have a 6-year-old daughter named Chloe (under 16)
- You are responsible for raising her
- You live in the UK
- You are a UK national
- Your income is below £50,000

I'm pleased to tell you that you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Since your income is below £50,000, you would receive the full amount without being subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office. Once your claim is processed, payments are usually made every 4 weeks into your bank account.

Would you like me to explain how much Child Benefit you might receive for Chloe?

2026-01-26T11:56:18.105254 [actor]: That's helpful, thank you. Actually, there's something I should mention - Chloe has been in the hospital for the past 14 weeks due to a serious condition. I visit her daily and spend about £30 a week on books, pajamas, and special food for her. Does this affect my eligibility for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T11:56:24.005444 [root_agent]: I appreciate you sharing this additional information about Chloe's situation. I'm sorry to hear that she's been in the hospital for an extended period.

The good news is that your child being in the hospital does not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit. You can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks (or in some cases longer) while your child is in hospital.

Since you're:
- Visiting Chloe regularly
- Incurring costs for her care (books, pajamas, special food)
- Maintaining your parental responsibility

You remain eligible for Child Benefit during this period. The fact that you're spending money on items for her care (approximately £30 a week) demonstrates that you're still contributing to her upbringing even while she's hospitalized.

If Chloe's hospital stay extends beyond 12 weeks and you continue to incur costs for her care similar to or exceeding the Child Benefit amount, you should still be eligible. However, if her stay becomes very prolonged, it might be worth contacting the Child Benefit Office to confirm your ongoing eligibility.

I hope Chloe recovers soon. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T11:56:26.117275 [actor]: Thank you for explaining. So even though Chloe has been in the hospital for 14 weeks now (which is already past the 12-week mark you mentioned), I should still be eligible because I'm spending money on her care regularly? That's a relief to know. I wasn't sure if I would still qualify since she's been hospitalized for so long.

2026-01-26T11:56:32.314136 [root_agent]: You're welcome, and I apologize for any concern I may have caused. Let me clarify this important point.

You're absolutely right to seek clarification about the 12-week period. Based on the UK government guidelines, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for a child in hospital beyond the initial 12 weeks if you continue to incur costs for your child that are at least equal to the weekly rate of Child Benefit.

In your case, you've mentioned:
- You visit Chloe daily
- You spend approximately £30 per week on books, pajamas, and special food for her

Since the weekly Child Benefit rate for your first child would be £24.00 (as of my last update), and you're spending more than this amount (£30) on items for Chloe's care, you should remain eligible for Child Benefit despite her hospitalization extending beyond 12 weeks.

The key factor here is that you're maintaining your parental responsibility and continuing to incur expenses for her care that equal or exceed the Child Benefit amount. The fact that you're visiting her daily and providing items for her comfort and wellbeing demonstrates this ongoing care.

So yes, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit in your current situation. If Chloe's hospital stay becomes very prolonged or if your circumstances change, you might want to contact the Child Benefit Office directly for specific guidance, but based on what you've shared, your eligibility continues.

2026-01-26T11:56:35.172065 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that so clearly. I'm glad to hear that I'm still eligible since I'm spending more than the weekly Child Benefit rate on Chloe's care while she's in the hospital. It's a relief to know this support will continue during this difficult time. I'll make sure to keep track of my expenses just in case I need to prove them at some point.

2026-01-26T11:56:37.758484 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a child in hospital, correctly explaining that eligibility continues beyond 12 weeks when the parent incurs costs equal to or exceeding the Child Benefit amount.
