The agent correctly determined that the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit despite the child being in hospital for 14 weeks, as the exception applies since the parent spends £30 weekly on the child's care (exceeding the benefit amount). This matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (via Exception)."
