2026-01-26T12:15:02.633243 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T12:15:04.413086 [actor]: I have a 17-year-old son named Tom who lives with me. He's currently taking a computer coding course that his future employer is paying for. They're covering all the course fees as part of an agreement that he'll join their company after he completes the training.

2026-01-26T12:15:06.431272 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Let me ask another question to continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit.

Is your son's computer coding course approved as an education or training course by a recognized organization? (This would help determine if it counts as "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes)

2026-01-26T12:15:08.514227 [actor]: I'm not sure if the course is officially approved in that way. It's a specific coding course that his future employer selected and is paying for as part of their agreement that he'll work for them afterward. Tom isn't getting paid during the training, but they're covering all the course fees.

2026-01-26T12:15:09.903628 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask another question to help determine your eligibility.

Is Tom's coding course lasting for more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience?

2026-01-26T12:15:11.315368 [actor]: Yes, it's quite intensive. Tom spends about 30 hours a week on the course with supervised training and practical coding exercises.

2026-01-26T12:15:12.536463 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Now, I'd like to confirm if you are responsible for Tom - meaning you're the person who primarily looks after him. Is that correct?

2026-01-26T12:15:13.524767 [actor]: Yes, I'm Tom's parent and he lives with me. I'm responsible for looking after him and covering his living expenses.

2026-01-26T12:15:14.862816 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Could you please let me know if you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income of over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T12:15:15.985854 [actor]: No, my income is well below £60,000 per year, and I'm a single parent.

2026-01-26T12:15:16.988561 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Do you live in the UK and have the right to reside here?

2026-01-26T12:15:17.972071 [actor]: Yes, we live in the UK and I have the right to reside here.

2026-01-26T12:15:22.007698 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Based on the information you've provided, it appears that you are likely eligible for Child Benefit for your son Tom because:

1. He is under 20 years old (17 years old)
2. He is in what appears to be qualifying education (a course with supervised study over 12 hours per week)
3. You are responsible for him and he lives with you
4. You live in the UK and have the right to reside here
5. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would start to apply

Child Benefit can be paid for children under 20 who are in approved education or training, which typically includes courses with more than 12 hours of supervised study per week. Since Tom's course involves 30 hours of supervised training weekly, this should qualify.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T12:15:24.808099 [actor]: Actually, I'm a bit confused now. I thought you said I was eligible, but I'm concerned about Tom's course being "employer-agreed." Does that affect our eligibility? He's not being paid during the course, but his future employer is paying for the course with the agreement that he'll work for them when he finishes.

2026-01-26T12:15:27.398922 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a 17-year-old in education with over 12 hours of supervised study per week, correctly identifying that the parent would likely be eligible.
