2026-01-26T11:57:41.317635 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T11:57:42.491220 [actor]: Hi there! Yes, I do. I've been fostering a 12-year-old boy named Liam who lives with me. He was placed with me by the local authority.

2026-01-26T11:57:43.741034 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that you're fostering a 12-year-old boy named Liam who was placed with you by the local authority.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you tell me if you receive any payments from the local authority for fostering Liam?

2026-01-26T11:57:44.759564 [actor]: Yes, I do receive payments from the local council. They pay me a fostering allowance that covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance costs.

2026-01-26T11:57:47.767919 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared, it appears you may not be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam. 

When a child is being looked after by a local authority and they've placed the child with you as a foster parent, and you receive payments from the local authority for the child's accommodation and maintenance, you typically cannot claim Child Benefit for that child.

This is because Child Benefit is generally not payable when a child is being looked after by a local authority and maintenance payments are being made for them.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other potential support you might be eligible for as a foster parent?

2026-01-26T11:57:50.276294 [actor]: I see, that's disappointing but I understand. I wasn't sure if I could claim Child Benefit on top of the fostering allowance. Is there any circumstance where I could be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam in the future, or is it always the case that foster parents can't claim it when receiving council payments?

2026-01-26T11:57:54.185515 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that foster parents receiving fostering allowance from a local authority for a child's accommodation and maintenance cannot claim Child Benefit for that child.
