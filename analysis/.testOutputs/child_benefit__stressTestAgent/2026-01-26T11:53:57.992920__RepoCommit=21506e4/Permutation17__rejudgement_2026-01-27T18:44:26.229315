2026-01-27T18:53:52.159945 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment that the agent passed. The agent correctly identified that Major Thompson is eligible for Child Benefit because Crown servants posted overseas are considered UK residents for this purpose, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible."
