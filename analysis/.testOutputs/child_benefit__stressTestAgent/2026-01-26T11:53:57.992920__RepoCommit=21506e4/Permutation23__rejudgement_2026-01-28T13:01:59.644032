2026-01-28T13:10:14.184595 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit, contradicting the expected outcome of "Eligible." While the agent correctly noted the user's contributions exceed the weekly Child Benefit rate threshold, they incorrectly concluded that the non-resident parent couldn't claim Child Benefit despite meeting the sufficient financial contribution criteria.
