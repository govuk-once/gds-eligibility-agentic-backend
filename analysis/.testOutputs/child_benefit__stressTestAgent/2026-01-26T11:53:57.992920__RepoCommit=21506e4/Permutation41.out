2026-01-26T12:10:49.881971 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:10:51.752263 [actor]: Yes, I have two children, Ben who is 10 and Jerry who is 8. But they actually live with my ex-partner, not with me.

2026-01-26T12:10:53.830085 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since your children Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner and not with you, this is an important factor in determining Child Benefit eligibility.

In cases where a child lives with someone else, typically the person who the child lives with is the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.

May I ask, do you provide any financial support for your children?

2026-01-26T12:10:55.891465 [actor]: Yes, I contribute £40 per week towards their care. I'm their father, and even though they live with my ex, I still want to support them financially. My name is Martin, by the way.

2026-01-26T12:10:58.344315 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Martin. It's good that you're providing financial support for your children.

Generally, Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with - in this case, your ex-partner. Even though you provide financial support of £40 per week, the main eligibility factor for Child Benefit is who has the main responsibility for the child's day-to-day care.

Do you have any formal arrangement regarding the care of Ben and Jerry, such as a court order or a formal agreement about who is responsible for them?

2026-01-26T12:11:00.414586 [actor]: No, we don't have any formal court order or anything like that. We separated about 3 years ago and worked things out between us. My ex has the kids living with her full-time, and I see them on weekends and contribute financially. I was just wondering if I'm eligible for any portion of the Child Benefit since I do provide regular financial support.

2026-01-26T12:11:04.525213 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation, Martin. I understand you've worked out an informal arrangement with your ex-partner where she has full-time care of Ben and Jerry, while you provide financial support and spend time with them on weekends.

Based on the UK government rules, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who the child lives with and who has main responsibility for them. Since your children live full-time with your ex-partner, she would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit, not you.

Even though you provide financial support and spend time with your children on weekends, this doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit in this situation. The benefit is designed to go to the person with primary day-to-day responsibility for the children.

Your ex-partner would need to claim the Child Benefit, and the financial support you provide is separate from this government benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you as a non-resident parent?

2026-01-26T12:11:06.647881 [actor]: I think I read something about being eligible for a portion of Child Benefit if I contribute enough financially. Isn't there some kind of calculation based on how much I contribute compared to the Child Benefit amount? Since I'm giving £40 per week and there are two children, wouldn't that count for something?

2026-01-26T12:11:11.914209 [root_agent]: I understand your question, Martin, but I need to clarify something important: there isn't a system in the UK where Child Benefit can be split or partially claimed based on financial contributions.

The UK Child Benefit system doesn't work on a proportional basis related to financial contributions. Child Benefit is paid in full to the person who has main responsibility for the child - typically the person the child lives with. In your case, since Ben and Jerry live full-time with your ex-partner, she would be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount, regardless of your financial contributions.

Your regular financial support of £40 per week is commendable and important for your children's wellbeing, but it operates separately from the Child Benefit system. This financial support would generally be considered maintenance payments or child support, which is different from Child Benefit.

To be clear: there is no calculation that would make you eligible for a portion of Child Benefit based on your financial contributions while the children live full-time with your ex-partner.

Is there something specific about your arrangement that makes you think you might be eligible for a portion of the benefit?

2026-01-26T12:11:14.350812 [actor]: Well, I'm a bit confused because I thought I read something on a government website about this. If one parent contributes financially at a certain level, they might be able to receive some portion of Child Benefit even if the child lives with the other parent. 

The Child Benefit for two children is about £43 per week, right? And I'm contributing £40, which is pretty close to that full amount. Doesn't that count for anything in terms of eligibility? I thought there was some sort of threshold test.

2026-01-26T12:11:20.740479 [root_agent]: I understand your confusion, Martin, but I need to clarify this point: The UK Child Benefit system does not have provisions for splitting or sharing the benefit based on financial contributions from a non-resident parent.

You're correct about the approximate amount - Child Benefit is currently £24.00 per week for the eldest or only child, and £15.90 for each additional child. So for two children, it would be around £39.90 per week. While your contribution of £40 per week is similar to this amount, this doesn't make you eligible for any portion of Child Benefit.

The eligibility criteria for Child Benefit focuses primarily on who has responsibility for the child, which typically means who the child lives with and who takes care of them day-to-day. There is no "threshold test" or calculation based on financial contributions that allows a non-resident parent to claim part of the benefit.

The information you may have read might have been referring to:
1. Child maintenance arrangements, which are separate from Child Benefit
2. Tax implications for high earners who receive Child Benefit
3. Special arrangements where care is genuinely shared equally

Since your children live full-time with your ex-partner and you see them on weekends, she would be considered the person with main responsibility and therefore eligible for the full Child Benefit.

Is there perhaps another aspect of support for children after separation that you were thinking of?

2026-01-26T12:11:23.732748 [actor]: I see. I must have misunderstood something I read. I thought there was a way to split the benefit if I was contributing financially. Maybe I was confusing it with something else.

One more question - what if my financial contribution was specifically designated for particular expenses? For example, what if I said that £26.05 of my contribution was specifically for Ben and £13.95 was for Jerry? Would that make any difference to how the benefits are assigned?

2026-01-26T12:11:28.194774 [root_agent]: You're right, Martin - there appears to be a misunderstanding about how Child Benefit works. 

To answer your question: No, designating specific amounts of your financial contribution for each child (£26.05 for Ben and £13.95 for Jerry) would not make any difference to how Child Benefit is assigned. Child Benefit is not tied to specific expenses or designated payments from either parent.

The UK Child Benefit system is quite straightforward in this regard - it's paid to the person who has main responsibility for the child, regardless of how financial support from the other parent is structured or designated. Since your children live full-time with your ex-partner, she remains eligible for the full Child Benefit.

What you're describing sounds more like child maintenance arrangements, which are separate from government benefits. Child maintenance is the financial support between parents for their children after separation, while Child Benefit is a government payment to help with the costs of raising a child.

Is there something specific about your maintenance arrangements with your ex-partner that you're concerned about?

2026-01-26T12:11:30.437495 [actor]: I understand now. I think I was mixing up Child Benefit with maintenance arrangements. Thank you for clearing that up. Since my children live with my ex-partner full-time, she's the one eligible for Child Benefit, and my financial contributions are separate from that system.

2026-01-26T12:11:32.864123 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that since the children live full-time with the ex-partner, only the ex-partner is eligible for Child Benefit, regardless of the financial contributions made by the non-resident parent.
