2026-01-26T12:02:24.930210 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you one question at a time to assess your situation.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:02:26.763826 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility.

Yes, I'm responsible for my child. I have a 10-year-old son named Sam who lives with me after my recent divorce from my ex-wife Tina. She has our daughter Ella who is 8 years old.

2026-01-26T12:02:28.145621 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify, your 10-year-old son Sam lives with you, and your 8-year-old daughter Ella lives with your ex-wife Tina.

Are you already receiving Child Benefit for Sam who lives with you?

2026-01-26T12:02:30.000254 [actor]: No, I'm not receiving any Child Benefit for Sam yet. After the divorce, we're still sorting out all these benefit matters. I haven't made any claims yet, but I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible to receive it for Sam since he lives with me now.

2026-01-26T12:02:31.829012 [root_agent]: I understand your situation. Since you're responsible for your son Sam who lives with you and you haven't claimed Child Benefit for him yet, you may be eligible.

Is Sam a UK resident? (Children must normally live in the UK for Child Benefit eligibility)

2026-01-26T12:02:33.029169 [actor]: Yes, Sam is a UK resident. He was born here and has always lived in the UK. We both live in Manchester.

2026-01-26T12:02:34.615396 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Sam is a UK resident, that's good for your eligibility.

Next question: Are you a UK resident yourself?

2026-01-26T12:02:35.787925 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK resident. I've lived in Manchester all my life and work here as well.

2026-01-26T12:02:37.401600 [root_agent]: Thank you. Your UK residency is another positive factor for eligibility.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T12:02:39.148233 [actor]: No, my income is about £38,000 per year. I don't have a new partner - it's just me and Sam in our household since the divorce.

2026-01-26T12:02:41.565504 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since your income is £38,000 per year, you would be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit amount without any High Income Child Benefit Charge. (The charge only begins to apply when an individual income exceeds £50,000, and the full charge applies at £60,000+).

Is Sam in full-time education or approved training?

2026-01-26T12:02:42.754198 [actor]: Yes, Sam is in primary school. He's in Year 5 now, attending full-time education at a local school here in Manchester.

2026-01-26T12:02:47.305399 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Sam is in full-time education at primary school.

Based on all the information you've provided, I can inform you that you are eligible for Child Benefit for Sam because:

1. You have responsibility for Sam who is 10 years old (under 16)
2. Sam lives with you
3. Both you and Sam are UK residents
4. Sam is in full-time education
5. Your income is below the threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would reduce your benefit

You would need to submit a Child Benefit claim form (CH2) to start receiving the benefit. As the parent Sam lives with, you would be the one entitled to claim Child Benefit for him. Your ex-wife Tina would be the one eligible to claim for Ella who lives with her.

Would you like me to provide information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T12:02:50.429773 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you for letting me know I'm eligible for Child Benefit for Sam. Since he's the only child in my household, would I receive the higher "eldest child" rate for him, even though Tina might claim for Ella separately? I want to make sure I understand correctly how it works when parents are separated with children living in different households.

2026-01-26T12:02:53.520904 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for their 10-year-old son Sam who lives with them, as both are UK residents, the child is in full-time education, and the user's income is below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
