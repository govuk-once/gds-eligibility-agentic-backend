2026-01-28T13:10:47.107651 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit, stating that only the ex-partner who has full-time care is eligible. However, per the expected outcome, Martin should be eligible for Child Benefit for Ben at the full rate (by explicitly allocating £26.05 to Ben), while not eligible for Jerry. The agent did not mention the possibility of unequal splitting of contributions.
