2026-01-27T18:53:55.811382 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent provided incorrect information. According to gov.uk, a person can claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit payment (£26.05/week) to the child's upkeep, even if they don't live with them. The agent failed to mention this specific contribution threshold when directly asked.
