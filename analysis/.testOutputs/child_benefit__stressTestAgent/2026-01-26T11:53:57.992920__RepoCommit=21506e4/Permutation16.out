2026-01-26T11:59:59.902359 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation properly.

Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T12:00:02.695134 [actor]: I'm happy to discuss whether you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me answer your question about children living with you.

Actually, my situation is a bit unique. I have a 14-year-old son named Oliver, but he's not currently living with me. He has a rare medical condition and has been sent to a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I'm still in the UK, but I pay for his incidental costs and visit him whenever I can.

2026-01-26T12:00:05.292327 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your situation. I understand your son Oliver is currently receiving specialist treatment in the USA and has been there for about 15 weeks.

If a child is temporarily away from home because they're in hospital, you can still claim Child Benefit for them. This applies even when the hospital is abroad, as long as you're normally responsible for the child in the UK.

May I ask if you were already receiving Child Benefit for Oliver before he went to the USA for treatment?

2026-01-26T12:00:08.378572 [actor]: Yes, I was already receiving Child Benefit for Oliver before he went to the USA for his treatment. We've lived in the UK all his life, and I've been claiming the benefit since he was born. This situation with him needing specialist treatment abroad is just temporary, even though it's been a few months already.

2026-01-26T12:00:10.974509 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Since you were already receiving Child Benefit for Oliver before his hospital stay, and his current stay in the USA hospital is temporary for medical treatment, you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit during this period.

The rules allow for Child Benefit to continue when a child is temporarily away from home receiving medical treatment, even when that treatment is abroad.

May I ask if you've informed the Child Benefit Office about Oliver's temporary stay in the USA for medical treatment?

2026-01-26T12:00:12.671128 [actor]: No, I haven't informed the Child Benefit Office about Oliver's situation yet. I wasn't sure if I needed to, or if it would affect my payments. Should I have told them? The payments have been continuing as normal so far.

2026-01-26T12:00:15.955637 [root_agent]: I would recommend informing the Child Benefit Office about Oliver's temporary stay in the USA for medical treatment. While your eligibility continues since this is a temporary medical situation, it's always best to keep them updated about significant changes in circumstances.

You can contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them about Oliver's situation. This ensures everything is properly documented and helps prevent any potential issues in the future. Since your son remains your responsibility and his absence is temporary for medical reasons, your payments should continue, but keeping them informed is good practice.

Would you like to know how to contact the Child Benefit Office to update them about Oliver's situation?

2026-01-26T12:00:17.628427 [actor]: Yes, I would like to know how to contact the Child Benefit Office to update them about Oliver's situation. I want to make sure everything is done properly and avoid any issues. How can I get in touch with them?

2026-01-26T12:00:22.252432 [root_agent]: You can contact the Child Benefit Office using the following methods:

By phone:
Child Benefit Helpline: 0300 200 3100
Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
(You'll need your National Insurance number and Child Benefit number when you call)

By post:
Child Benefit Office
PO Box 1
Newcastle Upon Tyne
NE88 1AA

When you contact them, explain Oliver's situation - that he's temporarily in a hospital in the USA for specialist treatment, and that you remain responsible for him. They may ask for some documentation about his medical treatment, so having some information about the hospital and expected duration of treatment would be helpful.

It's good that you're taking this step to keep them informed. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit during this situation?

2026-01-26T12:00:25.292462 [actor]: Thank you for providing those contact details. I'll call the Child Benefit Helpline tomorrow with my National Insurance number and Child Benefit number ready. I'll make sure to explain Oliver's situation clearly and have information about his hospital and treatment ready.

I think that covers everything I needed to know. It's a relief to hear that I'm still eligible for Child Benefit while Oliver is receiving treatment abroad. It makes a difference financially during this difficult time. Thanks for your help.

2026-01-26T12:00:27.862895 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit can continue when a child is temporarily away from home receiving medical treatment abroad, and recommended informing the Child Benefit Office about the situation.
