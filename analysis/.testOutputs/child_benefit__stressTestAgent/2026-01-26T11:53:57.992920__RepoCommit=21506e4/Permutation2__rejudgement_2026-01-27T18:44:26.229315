The agent correctly assessed that Amit is eligible for Child Benefit because his 17-year-old daughter is in approved education (A-levels), they both live in the UK, no one else is claiming the benefit, and his income is below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit charge. This matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."
