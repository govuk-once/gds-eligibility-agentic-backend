2026-01-26T12:04:43.742086 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:04:45.439172 [actor]: I'm looking after my son, but he doesn't actually live with me. He's 15 years old and lives with his aunt. I send money every week to help support him. Would I still be eligible for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T12:04:47.528959 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context about your situation. 

For Child Benefit eligibility, it typically matters who the child "normally lives with" or who has main responsibility for the child. Since your 15-year-old son lives with his aunt, this is an important factor.

Could you tell me if your son's aunt is already claiming Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-26T12:04:48.607512 [actor]: No, my son's aunt isn't claiming Child Benefit for him. She's just taking care of him while I send money to help out.

2026-01-26T12:04:50.249086 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since your son lives with his aunt but you're financially supporting him, I need to understand more about the living arrangement. 

Is this a temporary arrangement, or is your son living permanently with his aunt? And could you clarify why he's living with his aunt rather than with you?

2026-01-26T12:04:52.331114 [actor]: It's been a permanent arrangement for a few years now. His aunt lives closer to his school and can provide better care for him during the week than I can because of my work schedule. I still see him regularly on weekends, but it works better for him to stay with his aunt. I do send money every week to help with his expenses.

2026-01-26T12:04:57.106399 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining the situation. This helps me understand your arrangement better.

Based on the UK government's Child Benefit rules, Child Benefit is usually paid to the person the child "normally lives with." In your case, since your son permanently lives with his aunt, she would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, even though you provide financial support.

The rules consider factors like:
- Who the child normally lives with
- Who has main day-to-day responsibility for the child
- Who covers the child's everyday needs

Since your son permanently lives with his aunt and she provides his day-to-day care (even though you contribute financially), it appears she would be the appropriate person to claim Child Benefit.

You might want to discuss this with your son's aunt, as she may be eligible to claim if she hasn't already done so. If there are special circumstances in your situation, you could contact the Child Benefit Office directly for specific advice about your case.

Would you like to know anything else about this situation?

2026-01-26T12:04:59.162935 [actor]: Well, I do send my son £15 every week to help with his expenses. My mother (his grandmother) also sends £15 weekly to help out. Together that's £30 a week we're contributing to his care. Does that make any difference to who can claim the benefit?

2026-01-26T12:05:03.645832 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those additional details about the financial support you and your son's grandmother provide.

While it's commendable that you and your son's grandmother are contributing financially to his care (£30 per week combined), this doesn't typically change the eligibility rules for Child Benefit. 

The main factor in determining who can claim Child Benefit is who has the main day-to-day responsibility for the child and who the child normally lives with - not just who provides financial support. Since your son permanently lives with his aunt and she provides his daily care, she would still be considered the appropriate person to claim Child Benefit.

Financial contributions are certainly important and show your ongoing involvement in your son's life, but for Child Benefit purposes, the government generally recognizes the person providing the day-to-day care as the eligible claimant.

If you feel there are specific circumstances that should be considered, you could contact the Child Benefit Office directly to discuss your particular situation in more detail. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.

2026-01-26T12:05:06.178149 [actor]: I see, that makes sense. So even though my mother and I are sending money to help with my son's care, his aunt would be the one who should claim the Child Benefit because she's looking after him day-to-day. I'll have a chat with her about this since she hasn't claimed it yet. Thank you for explaining this to me.

2026-01-26T12:05:08.854394 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child normally lives with (the aunt in this case), not the parent who provides financial support but doesn't have day-to-day care responsibilities.
