2026-01-26T11:57:16.552755 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T11:57:17.489539 [actor]: Hi there. Yes, I do have responsibility for my son Hans who is 5 years old.

2026-01-26T11:57:18.542967 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know about your son Hans who is 5 years old.

Does Hans normally live with you?

2026-01-26T11:57:19.551192 [actor]: Yes, Hans lives with me. We have a small flat together where I take care of him.

2026-01-26T11:57:20.968450 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Hans lives with you. 

Is Hans receiving education in the UK? This could be at a school, through homeschooling, or in another approved educational setting.

2026-01-26T11:57:21.973753 [actor]: Yes, Hans is attending a local primary school here in the UK. He just started last year.

2026-01-26T11:57:23.021447 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Hans is attending a local primary school in the UK.

Are you a UK resident?

2026-01-26T11:57:24.308382 [actor]: No, I'm not a UK resident. I'm a German citizen who moved to the UK recently. I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme though. I'm currently looking for work and have registered as a jobseeker.

2026-01-26T11:57:25.808213 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your status. 

Since you have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme and have registered as a jobseeker, I need to understand more about your situation.

Do you have the right to work in the UK with your current immigration status?

2026-01-26T11:57:27.201168 [actor]: Yes, I do have the right to work in the UK with my Pre-Settled Status. That's why I've registered as a jobseeker and I'm actively looking for employment right now. I'm hopeful I'll find something soon.

2026-01-26T11:57:28.790262 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you have the right to work in the UK with your Pre-Settled Status.

Are you receiving any other benefits or support from the UK government, such as Universal Credit, Child Tax Credit, or income-related Employment and Support Allowance?

2026-01-26T11:57:30.514018 [actor]: No, I'm not receiving any other benefits at the moment. I've just moved here recently and I'm still trying to understand what support might be available while I look for work. That's why I'm asking about Child Benefit specifically for my son.

2026-01-26T11:57:34.657724 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have responsibility for your 5-year-old son, Hans, who lives with you
2. Hans is receiving education at a local primary school in the UK
3. You have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme with the right to work in the UK

As an EU citizen with Pre-Settled Status who has the right to work in the UK, you should qualify for Child Benefit.

You should apply as soon as possible as Child Benefit can only be backdated for up to 3 months from the date your application is received.

To apply, you'll need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK, or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

Would you like me to explain anything else about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-26T11:57:37.338541 [actor]: That's great news! I'm glad to hear that I may be eligible for Child Benefit for Hans. This will definitely help us while I'm looking for work. 

I think I understand what I need to do now. I'll download that CH2 form from the GOV.UK website and submit it as soon as possible to make sure I don't miss out on any potential backdated payments.

Thank you for your help in explaining all this.

2026-01-26T11:57:39.853447 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that as an EU citizen with Pre-Settled Status who has the right to work in the UK, with responsibility for a child living with them and attending school in the UK, the person would be eligible for Child Benefit.
