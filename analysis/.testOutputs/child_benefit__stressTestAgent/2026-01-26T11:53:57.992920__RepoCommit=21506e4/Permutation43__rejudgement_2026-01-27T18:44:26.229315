2026-01-27T18:53:20.576187 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that a Modern Apprenticeship qualifies as approved training for Child Benefit. According to UK rules, you generally cannot get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship in Scotland (unlike a specific Welsh exception). The correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
