2026-01-27T18:53:18.380342 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent did not correctly determine the outcome. According to the expected outcome, Martin should be eligible for Child Benefit for Ben at full rate but not for Jerry. The agent incorrectly stated that Martin is not eligible for any Child Benefit and missed the provision about unequal allocation of contributions.
