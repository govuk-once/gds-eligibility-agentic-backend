2026-01-26T11:54:24.019001 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T11:54:25.717734 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility.

Hi there. Yes, I have a daughter who is 17 years old. She's currently studying for her A-levels at a sixth-form college here in London. She lives with me full-time.

2026-01-26T11:54:27.266646 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your 17-year-old daughter studying A-levels at sixth-form college would be considered in approved education, which is good.

Next question: Are you and your daughter living in the UK?

2026-01-26T11:54:29.460844 [actor]: Yes, we're both living in the UK. We've been in London for many years now.

2026-01-26T11:54:30.805019 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you and your daughter live in the UK.

Next question: Is your daughter's other parent claiming Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-26T11:54:32.296362 [actor]: No, I'm a single father raising Priya on my own. Her other parent isn't involved and definitely isn't claiming any benefits for her.

2026-01-26T11:54:34.117319 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: What is your individual annual income? (This is important because there's a High Income Child Benefit charge if an individual's income is over £50,000 per year.)

2026-01-26T11:54:35.597806 [actor]: My annual income is £40,000. I work full-time to support us both.

2026-01-26T11:54:37.201867 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your income information. Since your annual income is £40,000, which is below the £50,000 threshold, you wouldn't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit charge.

Next question: Does your daughter have any disabilities or special needs that you provide care for?

2026-01-26T11:54:38.323602 [actor]: No, my daughter doesn't have any disabilities or special needs. She's healthy and doing well in her studies.

2026-01-26T11:54:41.143500 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared so far, it appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have responsibility for your 17-year-old daughter who is in approved education (A-levels at sixth-form college)
2. Both you and your daughter are living in the UK
3. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for your daughter
4. Your income is below the £50,000 threshold for the High Income Child Benefit charge

You should be eligible to receive Child Benefit until your daughter completes her A-levels or turns 20, whichever comes first.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T11:54:42.969426 [actor]: Yes, that's great news! I would definitely like information about how to apply for Child Benefit. It will really help with Priya's expenses while she finishes her A-levels.

2026-01-26T11:54:45.923381 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that the father is eligible for Child Benefit since his 17-year-old daughter is in approved education (A-levels), both live in the UK, no one else claims the benefit, and his income is below the £50,000 threshold.
