2026-01-27T18:53:29.856644 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly determined eligibility. According to UK government guidelines, education "with an employer's agreement" is specifically excluded from approved education for Child Benefit purposes. Since Tom's course is employer-paid with an agreement to join them afterward, he doesn't qualify, and the correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
