2026-01-26T12:11:34.718546 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To determine your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:11:36.708527 [actor]: I'll role-play as the user based on the provided situation.

Hi there. Yes, I have a daughter named Sian. She's 17 and lives with me in Cardiff. She recently left school and has started a Foundation Apprenticeship that's funded by the Welsh Government. I'm wondering if I can still claim Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-26T12:11:39.023911 [root_agent]: I understand that you have a 17-year-old daughter named Sian who lives with you in Cardiff and has started a Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government. Thank you for providing this information.

Since your daughter is 17 and has left school, I need to check if her apprenticeship qualifies as approved education or training. Could you please tell me if her Foundation Apprenticeship includes more than 12 hours a week of classroom or workplace learning?

2026-01-26T12:11:41.170984 [actor]: Yes, her Foundation Apprenticeship definitely includes more than 12 hours a week of learning. She spends about 3 days a week at a college and 2 days with her employer getting workplace training. It's a pretty intensive program - she's learning quite a lot and comes home quite tired most days!

2026-01-26T12:11:43.488090 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It sounds like Sian's Foundation Apprenticeship involves significant learning time both at college and with her employer.

Since her apprenticeship includes more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience, it likely qualifies as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Are you responsible for Sian? By this I mean, do you provide for her financially and is she living with you in your household?

2026-01-26T12:11:45.401490 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for Sian. She lives with me in our home in Cardiff. I provide for all her needs - food, clothing, transportation, everything really. Her apprenticeship pays a small allowance, but it's not much at all and doesn't cover her living expenses. I'm still very much financially supporting her.

2026-01-26T12:11:46.938394 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're responsible for Sian, providing for her needs and that she lives with you in Cardiff.

Next question: Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year in individual taxable income?

2026-01-26T12:11:48.433408 [actor]: No, I'm nowhere near that income level. I'm a single mother and I work part-time at a local shop. My annual income is about £18,000. I don't have a partner.

2026-01-26T12:11:50.112454 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since your income is about £18,000 per year, you're well below the Child Benefit high income threshold of £60,000.

Next question: Are you a UK resident for tax purposes?

2026-01-26T12:11:51.260198 [actor]: Yes, I am. I've lived in Cardiff all my life, born and raised here in Wales. I'm definitely a UK resident for tax purposes.

2026-01-26T12:11:54.942638 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK resident for tax purposes.

Based on the information you've provided:

1. Your daughter Sian is 17 and in approved education (Foundation Apprenticeship with more than 12 hours of supervised study/work experience per week)
2. You are responsible for her and she lives with you
3. Your income is below the high income threshold
4. You are a UK resident for tax purposes

I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter Sian. Since she is in approved education and is under 20, you can continue to receive Child Benefit while she completes her apprenticeship.

If you're not already claiming Child Benefit, you can apply online or by post. If you're already receiving it, this should continue automatically as long as Sian remains in her approved education or training.

Is there anything specific about Child Benefit that you'd like me to explain further?

2026-01-26T12:11:58.412085 [actor]: Thank you so much for confirming that! That's a relief to know I'm still eligible for Child Benefit while Sian is doing her Foundation Apprenticeship. I was worried because someone told me apprenticeships don't qualify, but I guess that's different for Welsh Foundation Apprenticeships. I'm already claiming it, so it's good to know it will continue. I don't have any other questions right now - you've been really helpful.

2026-01-26T12:12:01.009337 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately confirmed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit since their 17-year-old daughter is in approved education (Foundation Apprenticeship with more than 12 hours of supervised study per week), they are responsible for the child, their income is below the threshold, and they are a UK resident.
