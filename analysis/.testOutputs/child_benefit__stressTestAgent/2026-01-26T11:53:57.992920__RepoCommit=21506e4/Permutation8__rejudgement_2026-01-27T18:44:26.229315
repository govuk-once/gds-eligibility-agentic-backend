2026-01-27T18:53:05.231157 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated the user would have to pay back the "full amount" of Child Benefit through the tax charge. Since the user earns £75,000 (which is between £60,000 and £80,000), they would only need to pay back a portion of the benefit (1% for every £200 over £60k), not the entire amount. This is incorrect information about the tax implications.
