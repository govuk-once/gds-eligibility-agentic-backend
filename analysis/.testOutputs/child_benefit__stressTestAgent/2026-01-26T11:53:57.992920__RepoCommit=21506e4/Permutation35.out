2026-01-26T12:08:25.736512 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:08:27.447392 [actor]: Hello there. Yes, I have a son named Rashid who's 17 years old. He's still living with us and is currently studying for his A-Levels.

2026-01-26T12:08:29.626514 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Rashid is 17 and studying for his A-Levels, that's helpful to know.

Is Rashid in approved education? Approved education generally includes A-Levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, home education (if it started before your child turned 16), or other qualified training courses.

2026-01-26T12:08:31.020546 [actor]: Yes, Rashid is definitely in approved education. He's studying for his A-Levels at the local sixth form college. He's in his final year now and attends full-time.

2026-01-26T12:08:32.312956 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Rashid is studying A-Levels at a sixth form college, which counts as approved education.

Do you normally live in the UK? (This includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland)

2026-01-26T12:08:33.310401 [actor]: Yes, we've lived in the UK for many years. Our family home is in Birmingham.

2026-01-26T12:08:34.802449 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Is Rashid living with you? Or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent in kind) towards looking after him?

2026-01-26T12:08:36.719242 [actor]: Yes, Rashid lives with us in our family home. Although, there has been a recent change - Rashid recently got married to his girlfriend who is also 17, and she's moved into our house as well. We're still looking after both of them while they continue their education.

2026-01-26T12:08:40.391619 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that important information. The fact that Rashid is married does affect his eligibility for Child Benefit.

Under UK rules, Child Benefit stops when a child gets married or forms a civil partnership, even if they're still under 20 and in approved education or training.

Based on this information, I'm afraid you would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Rashid since he is now married. The marriage of a child is one of the circumstances where entitlement to Child Benefit ends, regardless of whether he continues to live with you and is in education.

Would you like me to provide any further information about this situation or about Child Benefit for any other children you may have?

2026-01-26T12:08:43.314439 [actor]: Oh, I didn't realize that. So even though he's still living under our roof and we're supporting him through his A-Levels, we can't claim Child Benefit anymore just because he's married? That's disappointing. We're still financially responsible for him and his new wife isn't working either - they're both still in education. Is there really no exception in this case?

2026-01-26T12:08:45.513487 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit stops when a child gets married, even if they're under 20 and in approved education, which aligns with UK government guidelines.
