2026-01-15T11:06:31.483036 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:06:32.400610 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?


2026-01-15T11:06:33.412149 [actor]: 8 year old daughter hospital

2026-01-15T11:06:34.326262 [root_agent]: Thank you. I understand your daughter is 8 years old and currently in hospital. 

To help me understand your situation better, how long has your daughter been in hospital?

2026-01-15T11:06:35.211990 [actor]: 14 weeks visit every day

2026-01-15T11:06:36.698011 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. It's good you are able to visit your daughter so often.

Now, considering your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks, do you regularly spend any money on things for her – things like clothes, food, or treats – *in addition* to what the hospital provides?

2026-01-15T11:06:37.420891 [actor]: hospital provides everything

2026-01-15T11:06:38.710004 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So the hospital provides everything your daughter needs.

Just to be absolutely sure I have understood correctly, does that mean you don’t regularly spend any of your own money on things like clothes, food, or treats for your daughter while she is in hospital?

2026-01-15T11:06:39.696676 [actor]: no don't buy anything hospital gives everything

2026-01-15T11:06:41.688620 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

Based on the information you've provided, and according to the rules for Child Benefit, even though your daughter has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks, you wouldn't usually be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit because you aren't regularly spending money on her upkeep while she is in hospital. The hospital is providing everything she needs.

Is there anything else about your situation you'd like me to consider?

2026-01-15T11:06:44.154930 [actor]: Thank you for the information about my eligibility. I understand now that I wouldn't usually be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit since my daughter has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks and I'm not regularly spending money on her upkeep.

2026-01-15T11:06:45.915097 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit eligibility stops after 12 weeks when a child is in hospital unless the parent regularly spends money on the child's upkeep, which Maria does not.
