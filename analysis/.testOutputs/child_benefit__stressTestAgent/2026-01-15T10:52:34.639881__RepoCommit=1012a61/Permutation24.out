2026-01-15T10:59:50.802147 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:59:51.961716 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand. I will ask you questions one at a time to assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, based on the UK government's rules. 

To start, are you the parent or legal guardian of the child in question?


2026-01-15T10:59:52.883331 [actor]: yes my son tom

2026-01-15T10:59:53.469544 [root_agent]: Thank you. And is your son currently living at home with you?

2026-01-15T10:59:54.388535 [actor]: tom residential school 10 weeks

2026-01-15T10:59:55.469068 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So Tom is currently living at a residential school and has been there for 10 weeks. 

Just to confirm, is this residential school paid for by the local council?

2026-01-15T10:59:56.405154 [actor]: yes council pays

2026-01-15T10:59:58.007048 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. As Tom is in residential accommodation paid for by the local council, and he has been there for 10 weeks, he is currently still eligible for Child Benefit, as eligibility continues for up to 12 weeks in these circumstances.

To be absolutely sure everything is correct, could you please confirm Tom is 16 or under?

2026-01-15T10:59:58.954761 [actor]: Tom is 14 years old

2026-01-15T11:00:00.479524 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming Tom’s age. As he is 14 years old, and in residential school paid for by the local council for 10 weeks (under the 12 week limit), you *are* currently eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for him.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T11:00:04.290962 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Child Benefit continues for children in residential accommodation for up to 12 weeks (Tom has only been there for 10 weeks).
