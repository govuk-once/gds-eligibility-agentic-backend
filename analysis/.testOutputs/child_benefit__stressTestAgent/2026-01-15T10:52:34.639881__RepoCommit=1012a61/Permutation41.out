2026-01-15T11:05:13.226534 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:05:14.144109 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm here to help you understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your children are?

2026-01-15T11:05:14.954226 [actor]: two boys 10 and 8 years old

2026-01-15T11:05:15.503322 [root_agent]: Thank you. And do your children live with you?

2026-01-15T11:05:16.451911 [actor]: live with ex partner

2026-01-15T11:05:17.100519 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Do you contribute financially towards the upkeep of your children?

2026-01-15T11:05:17.873222 [actor]: 40 pounds weekly

2026-01-15T11:05:18.640588 [root_agent]: Thank you. Just to be clear, is that £40 per week for *both* children combined?

2026-01-15T11:05:19.536148 [actor]: yes total 40

2026-01-15T11:05:20.426624 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Do you have a formal arrangement, like a Child Maintenance arrangement, in place with your ex-partner regarding these payments, or is it an informal agreement?

2026-01-15T11:05:21.146173 [actor]: informal agreement we decided

2026-01-15T11:05:22.630461 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just so I fully understand the situation, are you the parent who has day-to-day care of the children, or does your ex-partner have that responsibility? While I understand they *live* with your ex-partner, this relates to who is primarily responsible for their care.

2026-01-15T11:05:23.647275 [actor]: they live with ex partner not with me

2026-01-15T11:05:24.604489 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. To clarify, when you say you contribute £40 a week, is that directly to your ex-partner, or do you contribute towards expenses in another way?

2026-01-15T11:05:25.353264 [actor]: directly to ex partner bank transfer

2026-01-15T11:05:26.040604 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Finally, are you currently receiving any other benefits for these children?

2026-01-15T11:05:26.688975 [actor]: no other benefits

2026-01-15T11:05:33.096321 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all of my questions. 

Based on the information you've provided – your children are 10 and 8 years old, they live with your ex-partner, you contribute £40 per week directly to your ex-partner, it’s an informal arrangement, and you don’t receive any other benefits for them – it sounds like you *might* be eligible for Child Benefit, but it's likely to be partial. 

Here's why: Because the children live with your ex-partner, Child Benefit would normally be paid to them. However, as you contribute financially, you can claim a proportion. HMRC usually splits the contribution equally between the children. In your case, that would be £20 towards each child. 

The weekly amount for a 10-year-old is £26.05, and for an 8-year-old it’s £17.25. As you only contribute £20 towards each child, you would only receive benefit for the 8 year old, as your contribution doesn’t meet the full amount for the 10 year old.

However, you can ask HMRC to consider an unequal split, allocating the full £26.05 to the 10-year-old and the remainder to the 8-year-old. Would you like me to explain how you can do that?



**Please note:** I am an AI assistant and this is not financial advice. It's based on my understanding of the current rules. HMRC will make the final decision.

2026-01-15T11:05:34.436659 [actor]: thanks don't need to explain

2026-01-15T11:05:37.314166 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Martin would only be eligible for partial Child Benefit based on his £40 contribution, and correctly described the option to request an unequal split to maximize eligibility.
