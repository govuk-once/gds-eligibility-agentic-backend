2026-01-15T10:57:22.814967 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:57:23.698751 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please confirm how old you are?


2026-01-15T10:57:24.610264 [actor]: 42 age years old

2026-01-15T10:57:25.106594 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-15T10:57:25.970331 [actor]: Germany military base

2026-01-15T10:57:27.324567 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Are you a member of the British Armed Forces, or a civil servant serving overseas? (This is sometimes referred to as being a 'Crown servant').



*(I'm checking to see if the exception for Crown Servants applies, as highlighted in the guidance.)*

2026-01-15T10:57:28.187432 [actor]: British Army Major deployed

2026-01-15T10:57:29.380249 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming.

Now, are the children you would like to claim Child Benefit for currently living with you in Germany?



*(I need to confirm the children's residency to determine eligibility, considering the parent is a Crown Servant living abroad.)*

2026-01-15T10:57:30.327017 [actor]: children with me yes 8 10

2026-01-15T10:57:31.642965 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. 

Just to confirm, are you married to the children’s mother?



*(I'm checking parental responsibility as part of establishing eligibility. While not explicitly stated as a primary factor, it’s relevant for a complete assessment.)*

2026-01-15T10:57:32.404072 [actor]: married wife here Germany

2026-01-15T10:57:34.901768 [root_agent]: Excellent. Based on the information you've provided so far, it appears you *are* likely to be eligible for Child Benefit. 

As a member of the British Armed Forces stationed in Germany, and with your children living with you, you meet the criteria for claiming Child Benefit even though you don’t currently live in the UK.

However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that you (or your wife) are responsible for the children?



*(I'm re-affirming the initial positive assessment, based on the information gathered, and completing the check for parental responsibility.)*

2026-01-15T10:57:35.989496 [actor]: yes responsible parent

2026-01-15T10:57:37.578333 [root_agent]: Wonderful! Based on all the information you’ve provided, you *are* eligible for Child Benefit. 

As a Crown servant (British Army Major) stationed in Germany, with your wife and children living with you, and you confirming you are a responsible parent, you meet the requirements.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T10:57:39.414189 [actor]: no thats all

2026-01-15T10:57:40.991064 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that as a Crown servant (British Armed Forces member) stationed abroad with their children, Major Thompson is exempt from the UK residency requirement and eligible for Child Benefit.
