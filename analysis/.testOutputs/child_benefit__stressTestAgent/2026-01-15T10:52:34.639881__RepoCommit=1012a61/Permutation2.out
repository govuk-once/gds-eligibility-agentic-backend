2026-01-15T10:52:52.296050 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:52:53.209756 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm here to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T10:52:54.034935 [actor]: 45 amit

2026-01-15T10:52:54.664286 [root_agent]: Thank you, Amit. And how old is the child you are claiming for?

2026-01-15T10:52:55.417980 [actor]: priya daughter 17

2026-01-15T10:52:56.498673 [root_agent]: Thank you. Priya is 17, that's good to know.

Is Priya currently in approved full-time education? For example, is she attending school, college, or university?

2026-01-15T10:52:57.319113 [actor]: college a levels

2026-01-15T10:52:58.088201 [root_agent]: Great, Priya is studying A-levels at college – that qualifies as approved full-time education.

Do you live with Priya?

2026-01-15T10:52:58.832345 [actor]: yes london

2026-01-15T10:52:59.786907 [root_agent]: Okay, you both live in London. That’s helpful.

Just to confirm, approximately how much do you earn per year, before tax? (You can give me an estimate).

2026-01-15T10:53:00.612125 [actor]: 40000

2026-01-15T10:53:01.442542 [root_agent]: Thank you, £40,000. 

Finally, is Priya currently in hospital or residential care for more than 8 weeks?

2026-01-15T10:53:02.112624 [actor]: no

2026-01-15T10:53:04.656106 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for answering all my questions, Amit.

Based on the information you’ve provided: you are 45, your daughter Priya is 17 and studying A-levels, you both live together in London, your income is £40,000, and Priya is not in hospital or care.

Therefore, it appears you *are* eligible for Child Benefit. Your income is below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge, and Priya meets the age and education requirements. 

Would you like me to summarise this for you, or perhaps explain anything further?





2026-01-15T10:53:05.957180 [actor]: thank you

2026-01-15T10:53:08.632573 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately noted that Amit is eligible for Child Benefit because Priya is under 20 and in approved education (A-levels), they live together, and Amit's income (£40,000) is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
