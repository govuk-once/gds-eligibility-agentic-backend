2026-01-15T11:01:07.921491 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:01:08.812863 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, are you currently living in the UK?


2026-01-15T11:01:09.726914 [actor]: yes in london now with my son

2026-01-15T11:01:10.702440 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know.

To clarify, what is your current immigration status in the UK? For example, are you a British citizen, or do you have a visa?





2026-01-15T11:01:11.525267 [actor]: tourist visa from america six months

2026-01-15T11:01:13.489303 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just to be absolutely sure I understand correctly, you are in the UK with a 6-month tourist visa from the USA. Is that right?



**(Thinking: A tourist visa typically means the person has limited right to reside, and likely no recourse to public funds, and therefore likely ineligible. I need to confirm this before proceeding, but it's important to remain polite and not assume.)**

2026-01-15T11:01:14.432620 [actor]: yes with son five years old american citizens

2026-01-15T11:01:16.475391 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. 

To assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand a little more about your work situation. Are you currently employed or self-employed in the UK, or anywhere else?



**(Thinking: The rules state that eligibility depends on National Insurance contributions. As a tourist, it is highly unlikely she is making NI contributions. This strengthens the initial assessment of ineligibility, but I need the explicit answer before drawing any conclusions.)**

2026-01-15T11:01:17.553531 [actor]: no just visiting family not working

2026-01-15T11:01:20.124796 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. As you are visiting and not working, and holding a tourist visa, it seems likely you wouldn’t currently be eligible for Child Benefit. This is because Child Benefit usually requires you to be resident in the UK with a right to reside, and often relies on National Insurance contributions through work.

However, I want to be absolutely certain. Are you receiving any other benefits or financial support from the UK government?



**(Thinking: Double-checking for any other potential income sources or benefit claims that might affect eligibility. It's rare on a tourist visa, but important to check.)**

2026-01-15T11:01:21.002098 [actor]: no benefits here just visiting for three months

2026-01-15T11:01:23.818573 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided – that you are visiting the UK for three months with a tourist visa, are not working, and are not receiving any other benefits – it is highly unlikely you are eligible for Child Benefit. 

Child Benefit typically requires a legal right to reside in the UK, which is generally not granted with a standard visitor visa, and often requires contributions to the National Insurance system.

I hope this information is helpful. Is there anything else I can help you with today?



**(Thinking: I have given a clear, polite, and definitive answer based on the provided information and the guidance documents. I’ve also offered further assistance.)**

2026-01-15T11:01:27.312505 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Maria, as a tourist visa holder with no right to reside or National Insurance contributions, would not be eligible for Child Benefit.
