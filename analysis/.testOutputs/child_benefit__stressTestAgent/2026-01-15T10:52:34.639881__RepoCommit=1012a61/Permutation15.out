2026-01-15T10:56:39.075661 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:56:39.723128 [root_agent]: Hello! I can help you with that. To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T10:56:40.448430 [actor]: 45

2026-01-15T10:56:41.078329 [root_agent]: Thank you. And do you have a child or children under 20 years old?





2026-01-15T10:56:41.857609 [actor]: daughter Emma 12 years old

2026-01-15T10:56:42.287988 [root_agent]: Thank you. Does Emma live with you?

2026-01-15T10:56:43.124309 [actor]: no lives with her mother

2026-01-15T10:56:43.672248 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Do you contribute to Emma's upkeep financially?

2026-01-15T10:56:44.518343 [actor]: send money 10 pounds weekly food

2026-01-15T10:56:45.632796 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Aside from the £10 a week for food, do you contribute to Emma’s upkeep in any other way, such as paying for clothes, school trips, or activities?

2026-01-15T10:56:46.461929 [actor]: birthday present yearly

2026-01-15T10:56:48.960241 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So, to clarify, your main contribution is £10 per week for food and a birthday present each year. 

Currently, the full rate of Child Benefit for an eldest child is £26.05 per week. To be eligible to claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with you, your contributions need to be at least equal to this amount. 

Based on what you've told me so far, your current contribution of £10 a week falls short of the £26.05 required. Do you understand this?





2026-01-15T10:56:49.761814 [actor]: mothers not claiming benefit

2026-01-15T10:56:51.473837 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that the mother isn't claiming Child Benefit. However, the amount of contribution needed for you to claim is still £26.05 per week, regardless of whether the mother is claiming or not. 

To be clear, are you able to increase your financial contribution to at least £26.05 per week to cover Emma’s expenses?

2026-01-15T10:56:52.787911 [actor]: why 26 pounds needed

2026-01-15T10:56:54.900302 [root_agent]: That’s a fair question! The £26.05 figure is the current weekly rate of Child Benefit for the eldest child. The rules state that if a child doesn't live with you, you need to be contributing at least as much as the full Child Benefit rate to demonstrate you are taking financial responsibility for them. This is to prevent duplicate claims - essentially, to ensure the child isn't receiving two full Child Benefit payments.

Does that explanation make sense?

2026-01-15T10:56:55.907762 [actor]: so not eligible with 10 pounds

2026-01-15T10:56:57.493139 [root_agent]: You are correct. Based on the information you’ve provided, with a current contribution of £10 per week, you wouldn’t currently meet the eligibility requirements to claim Child Benefit for Emma. To be eligible, your contribution would need to be at least £26.05 per week.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T10:57:01.949360 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent explained that to claim Child Benefit when a child doesn't live with you, contributions must equal at least the weekly benefit amount (£26.05), and Mike's £10/week is insufficient.
