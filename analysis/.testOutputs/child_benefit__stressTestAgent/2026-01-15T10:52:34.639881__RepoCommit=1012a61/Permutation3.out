2026-01-15T10:53:09.382830 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:53:10.291676 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm here to help determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-15T10:53:11.051151 [actor]: 50 years old

2026-01-15T10:53:11.624232 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is the child you are claiming for?

2026-01-15T10:53:12.636924 [actor]: son 17 years old

2026-01-15T10:53:13.292128 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Has your son left school, and if so, when did he finish his education?

2026-01-15T10:53:14.114410 [actor]: left school june not college

2026-01-15T10:53:14.914059 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Is your son currently registered with a youth careers service or any similar organisation that helps with finding work or apprenticeships?

2026-01-15T10:53:15.668594 [actor]: careers service looking apprenticeship

2026-01-15T10:53:16.331034 [root_agent]: Great. And just to confirm, is your son actively looking for work or an apprenticeship now?

2026-01-15T10:53:16.994634 [actor]: yes actively looking

2026-01-15T10:53:17.651709 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Just one final question for now: does your son live with you?

2026-01-15T10:53:18.357471 [actor]: yes lives with me

2026-01-15T10:53:21.882484 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for all that information. 

Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you *may* be eligible for Child Benefit. Your son is 17, he left school in June and is actively seeking an apprenticeship while registered with a careers service – this means he may be covered by the extension to the usual age limit. As you are responsible for him and he lives with you, and assuming your income is below the threshold, it looks promising.

However, the extension only lasts for up to 20 weeks from when he left school. As it is now August, this is within that timeframe.

I would recommend checking the government website to be absolutely sure, but it appears you meet the initial criteria. Would you like me to summarise the key points, or is there anything else I can help you with?





2026-01-15T10:53:25.178077 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent recognized that Child Benefit could continue for up to 20 weeks after Ben left education since he's registered with a careers service and actively seeking an apprenticeship.
