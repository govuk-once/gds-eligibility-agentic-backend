2026-01-15T10:53:25.935754 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:53:26.883675 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old the child you are claiming for is?


2026-01-15T10:53:27.631592 [actor]: Sofia 18

2026-01-15T10:53:28.520457 [root_agent]: Thank you. And is Sofia currently in any sort of approved education or training, such as A-levels, university, or an apprenticeship? Or is she working?

2026-01-15T10:53:29.224824 [actor]: working receptionist 30 hours

2026-01-15T10:53:29.983594 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Just to clarify, is Sofia working more than 24 hours a week?

2026-01-15T10:53:30.819247 [actor]: yes thirty hours weekly receptionist

2026-01-15T10:53:32.290630 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided, unfortunately, it appears you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia. This is because she is over 16 and working more than 24 hours a week. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





2026-01-15T10:53:35.804335 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available for Sofia since she is over 16, not in approved education or training, and working more than 24 hours per week (30 hours as a receptionist).
