2026-01-29T12:29:31.007339 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:29:32.936032 [actor]: Yes, I have a son - he's 17. He's just started at the local college doing a couple of GCSEs.

2026-01-29T12:29:36.590064 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son being 17 and in education is relevant, so let me ask you the next question:

**Is your son's course at the local college considered "approved education or training"?** 

To clarify, approved education or training generally includes:
- Full-time non-advanced education (such as A levels, Scottish Highers, or GCSEs if done full-time)
- Approved training courses (such as certain vocational training)

Is his course full-time (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience)?

2026-01-29T12:29:38.537099 [actor]: No, it's not full-time. He's only doing 6 hours a week of supervised study - he's just re-sitting two GCSEs. The rest of the time he's at home.

2026-01-29T12:29:41.650218 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Since your son is 17 and his course is only 6 hours per week of supervised study, which is below the 12-hour threshold for full-time education, he wouldn't meet the criteria for Child Benefit based on being in approved education or training.

However, let me ask you another important question:

**Is your son registered with a government-approved careers service or with Connexions (or equivalent in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland)?**

This can sometimes be relevant for young people who have left education.

2026-01-29T12:29:43.375258 [actor]: No, he's not registered with any careers service or Connexions. He's just doing his course and spending the rest of his time at home.

2026-01-29T12:29:47.623146 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to let you know that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** for your 17-year-old son in this situation.

Here's why:

- Child Benefit is payable for children under 16, OR for young people aged 16-19 who are in **full-time approved education or training**
- Full-time education means more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience
- Your son's course is only 6 hours per week, which doesn't meet the full-time threshold
- He's not registered with an approved careers service

If your son's circumstances change - for example, if he enrolls in a full-time course (more than 12 hours per week) - you could become eligible at that point and should reapply.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T12:29:53.735341 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a 17-year-old doing only 6 hours per week of supervised study does not meet the full-time education threshold (12+ hours required) for Child Benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds, and correctly concluded ineligibility.
