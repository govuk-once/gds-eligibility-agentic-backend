2026-01-29T12:38:11.906014 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you are responsible for?

2026-01-29T12:38:14.760595 [actor]: Yes, I do have children I'm responsible for. But I'm a bit worried about my situation - I've got Pre-Settled Status and I've been out of work for about 95 days now. I've been claiming Child Benefit while looking for a job, but I haven't found anything yet. Will this affect my eligibility?

2026-01-29T12:38:16.740659 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand your concern about your situation.

Let me ask you an important question to help assess your eligibility: Do you currently live in the UK, and is your child (or children) also living with you in the UK?

2026-01-29T12:38:19.111537 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK and my children live with me here. I'm just concerned because I've been unemployed for quite a while now - over 3 months - and I don't have any job offers lined up at the moment. Does that matter for my Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:38:21.763588 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you and your children live together in the UK.

To help assess your situation fully, I need to ask: Are you the person who is primarily responsible for your child or children? By this I mean, are you the main person who looks after them and pays for things like food, clothing, and their day-to-day care?

2026-01-29T12:38:24.392228 [actor]: Yes, I am. I'm the main person looking after them and paying for everything they need - their food, clothes, all of that. But like I said, I've been unemployed and looking for work for 95 days now with my Pre-Settled Status. I'm really worried about whether I can still get Child Benefit since I've been out of work for so long without finding a job.

2026-01-29T12:38:26.419707 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are the main person responsible for your children.

Let me ask you: Is there anyone else who also claims Child Benefit for the same child or children? For example, is there another parent or guardian who might be claiming it for them?

2026-01-29T12:38:29.006870 [actor]: No, there's no one else claiming Child Benefit for my children. It's just me - I'm the only one claiming for them. But I'm still concerned about my immigration status and how long I've been unemployed. Does the 95 days of unemployment affect whether I can keep claiming?

2026-01-29T12:38:31.365047 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're the only person claiming Child Benefit for your children.

Let me ask you another important question: Are your children currently living in hospital or in care (such as a children's home or with foster carers), or are they living at home with you full-time?

2026-01-29T12:38:34.208516 [actor]: They're living at home with me full-time. They're not in hospital or in care or anything like that. 

Look, I really need to know - with my Pre-Settled Status and being unemployed for 95 days now as a jobseeker, am I still eligible for Child Benefit or not? I know there are time limits on this sort of thing.

2026-01-29T12:38:39.811486 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your children live at home with you full-time.

Based on the information you've provided and the official guidance, let me address your concerns:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** based on the key criteria:

✓ You have children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education/training)
✓ You are responsible for them
✓ You live in the UK
✓ Your children live with you
✓ You are the only person claiming for them
✓ They are not in hospital or care

Regarding your specific concern about Pre-Settled Status and unemployment: The official Child Benefit eligibility guidance I have access to does not indicate that your employment status or the length of time you've been unemployed affects your eligibility for Child Benefit itself. Child Benefit eligibility is primarily based on your responsibility for the child and residence in the UK.

However, I want to be careful here - immigration status can sometimes involve complex rules that interact with different benefits. While Child Benefit eligibility doesn't depend on employment status according to the guidance, if you have specific concerns about how your Pre-Settled Status interacts with your benefit claims or any time limits that might apply to your situation, you may want to contact the Child Benefit Office directly at 0300 200 3100 for confirmation specific to your circumstances.

Does this help clarify your situation?

2026-01-29T12:38:42.408726 [actor]: Wait, so you're saying I'm eligible? But I've been claiming as a jobseeker for 95 days - that's over 3 months. I thought there was a 91-day limit for people like me with Pre-Settled Status who are looking for work? Doesn't that mean my right to reside for benefits has run out since I don't have a job offer or anything?

2026-01-29T12:38:48.871615 [root_agent]: Thank you for raising this important point about the 91-day limit. I need to be careful here because you're touching on a specific and complex area of immigration law and benefit eligibility that goes beyond what I can definitively assess from the Child Benefit guidance alone.

You're referring to what sounds like "right to reside" rules, which can affect benefit eligibility for people with certain immigration statuses. This is a more technical legal area that intersects immigration status with benefit entitlement.

Let me ask you: Have you received any communication from the Child Benefit Office or any other government department about your right to reside or about your Child Benefit claim being affected by the length of your job search?

I'm asking this because while the basic Child Benefit eligibility criteria appear to be met, the specific interaction between Pre-Settled Status, right to reside requirements, and the 91-day jobseeker period you mentioned involves rules that may not be fully covered in the standard Child Benefit guidance I have access to. Your situation may require assessment by someone with expertise in both immigration and benefits law.

2026-01-29T12:38:51.876765 [actor]: No, I haven't received any communication from them yet. But I'm worried because I know about this 91-day rule - I've gone past that now at 95 days, and I don't have a genuine prospect of work or a job offer or anything like that. Surely that means I've lost my right to reside for benefit purposes? I need to know if I'm actually still eligible or if I should stop claiming.

2026-01-29T12:38:57.425188 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you haven't received any communication yet. I understand your concern is very specific and urgent.

I need to be honest with you: The question you're asking about the interaction between Pre-Settled Status, the 91-day jobseeker time limit, "right to reside" rules, and how these specifically affect Child Benefit eligibility involves complex immigration and benefits law that goes beyond the standard Child Benefit eligibility guidance I have access to.

The Child Benefit eligibility pages I'm working from focus on the basic criteria (having a child, being responsible for them, UK residence), but they don't provide detailed guidance on how "right to reside" requirements interact with different immigration statuses and time limits for jobseekers.

**Given the seriousness of your concern and the technical complexity involved, I strongly recommend you:**

1. **Contact the Child Benefit Office directly on 0300 200 3100** to discuss your specific situation with Pre-Settled Status and the 91-day jobseeker period

2. **Consider seeking advice from an immigration or benefits adviser** who can properly assess whether the right to reside rules affect your Child Benefit entitlement

I don't want to give you incorrect advice on something this important that could affect your family's finances. Would you be able to contact the Child Benefit Office or a specialist adviser to get definitive guidance on your specific situation?

2026-01-29T12:38:59.908999 [actor]: So you're saying you can't tell me whether I'm eligible or not? I thought you were supposed to help me figure out if I'm eligible for Child Benefit. You said I was eligible before, but now you're saying you don't know because of the right to reside rules and the 91-day limit? Which is it - am I eligible or not?

2026-01-29T12:39:06.332550 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right to push back on this, and I apologize for the confusion. Let me be clear and direct with you.

Based on the official Child Benefit eligibility guidance I have access to from gov.uk, I need to tell you honestly:

**The Child Benefit eligibility pages do not address "right to reside" requirements, immigration status conditions, or 91-day jobseeker time limits.** These rules may exist in other benefit or immigration legislation, but they are not covered in the Child Benefit guidance I'm using to assess eligibility.

According to the Child Benefit criteria alone - which focus on having a child, being responsible for them, living in the UK, and the child living with you - you would meet the basic requirements.

**However**, you are clearly aware of a specific rule (the 91-day limit for Pre-Settled Status jobseekers) that you believe affects your eligibility. This suggests there are legal requirements beyond the basic Child Benefit criteria that I cannot properly assess with the information available to me.

**I cannot definitively tell you whether you are eligible or not** because your situation involves complex rules that aren't covered in the standard Child Benefit guidance.

Given that you've already exceeded what you believe is a 91-day limit, and this is causing you genuine concern, you need urgent specialist advice - either from the Child Benefit Office (0300 200 3100) or an immigration/benefits adviser - who can properly assess your specific circumstances.

I'm sorry I cannot give you the definitive answer you need.

2026-01-29T12:39:08.977039 [actor]: Look, I appreciate your honesty, but this is really frustrating. I came here to find out if I'm eligible for Child Benefit and you're telling me you don't know. So what am I supposed to do now? Just keep claiming and hope for the best? Or stop claiming because I've gone over the 91 days? I need some kind of answer here about my situation.

2026-01-29T12:39:15.897582 [root_agent]: I completely understand your frustration, and you're right - you came here for a clear answer and I haven't been able to provide one. I'm truly sorry for that.

Here's what I can tell you clearly:

**What you should do now:**

1. **Contact the Child Benefit Office immediately on 0300 200 3100** - Explain your exact situation: that you have Pre-Settled Status, you've been a jobseeker for 95 days, and you're concerned about right to reside rules and the 91-day limit. They are the authority who can tell you definitively whether you remain eligible.

2. **Don't make assumptions either way** - Don't just stop claiming without confirmation, and don't assume everything is fine without checking. Get the official answer from them.

3. **Consider getting free advice** - Organizations like Citizens Advice can help with immigration and benefits questions if you need support understanding your rights.

**Why I can't give you a definitive answer:**

The Child Benefit guidance I have access to doesn't cover the specific intersection of Pre-Settled Status and jobseeker time limits. You're asking about a real legal issue that exists, but it's outside what I can properly assess.

I know this isn't the answer you wanted, but the most important thing is that you get accurate information about your specific situation - and that can only come from the Child Benefit Office or a qualified adviser.

Can I help you with anything else, or would you like to know the best way to reach the Child Benefit Office?

2026-01-29T12:39:17.750934 [actor]: Fine. I'll call them myself then. Thanks anyway.

2026-01-29T12:39:22.267454 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent initially told me I was eligible for Child Benefit, but when I specifically raised the 91-day right to reside limit for Pre-Settled Status jobseekers (which I had exceeded at 95 days), the agent backtracked and said it couldn't definitively determine my eligibility. Since I have Pre-Settled Status and have been unemployed as a jobseeker for 95 days (exceeding the 91-day limit without genuine prospects of work), I am Not Eligible (Expired) for Child Benefit. The agent gave incorrect information by initially stating I was eligible.
