2026-01-29T12:34:10.527283 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T12:34:12.231404 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T12:34:13.845655 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Is your son living with you, or are you responsible for him?

2026-01-29T12:34:15.894435 [actor]: Well, he's not living with me at the moment. He's been detained under the Mental Health Act and is in a secure psychiatric unit. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-29T12:34:18.771118 [root_agent]: I understand, thank you for sharing that. This is an important detail.

Can you tell me - are you still contributing to the cost of supporting your son while he's in the secure psychiatric unit? For example, are you paying for items like clothing, supporting his needs, or maintaining his home with you for when he returns?

2026-01-29T12:34:21.429098 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm still paying for all his clothes, his phone, and keeping his room ready at home for when he comes back. I visit him regularly too and bring him things he needs.

2026-01-29T12:34:23.731422 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. That's helpful to know.

Now, let me ask about your immigration status: Are you living in the UK, and do you have the right to live here? This includes being a UK citizen, having settled status, or having another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits?

2026-01-29T12:34:25.318318 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK citizen. I was born here and have always lived here.

2026-01-29T12:34:27.362931 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your son, or are you the only person claiming (or intending to claim) for him?

2026-01-29T12:34:29.062229 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming for him. It's just me - I'm his only parent and I'm the one who's been responsible for him.

2026-01-29T12:34:35.137867 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all those questions. Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility.

**You should be eligible for Child Benefit** for your son. Here's why:

1. ✓ Your son is under 16 years old
2. ✓ You are a UK citizen with the right to live here
3. ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him
4. ✓ Most importantly: Even though your son is detained under the Mental Health Act in a secure psychiatric unit, you are still responsible for him and contributing to his costs (clothing, phone, maintaining his room, etc.)

According to the rules, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for a child who is in hospital or care (including secure psychiatric units) if you're still contributing toward their maintenance or if the child has only been away for up to 12 weeks (your son has been there for 10 weeks).

Since you're actively supporting your son financially and maintaining his home for his return, you meet the criteria for continuing to claim Child Benefit.

If you're not already claiming, you should apply. If you are already claiming and were worried about your eligibility due to his detention, you can continue to claim.

2026-01-29T12:34:38.495460 [actor]: Oh, that's such a relief! I was really worried I might lose the benefit while he's in the unit. Thank you so much for explaining that to me. It's been a difficult time, and knowing I can continue to receive the Child Benefit really helps.

2026-01-29T12:34:42.945277 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit because their son has been detained for 10 weeks (under the 12-week threshold) and the user is still contributing to the child's maintenance, which aligns with the rules at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care.
