2026-01-29T12:16:22.938893 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T12:16:24.464408 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who is 5 years old.

2026-01-29T12:16:25.979775 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does your 5-year-old son normally live with you, or do they live with someone else?

2026-01-29T12:16:27.589573 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me. I'm responsible for him.

2026-01-29T12:16:29.864836 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Now I need to ask about your residency status. Are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-29T12:16:31.739245 [actor]: Yes, I'm living in the UK. I moved here from Germany recently. I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme.

2026-01-29T12:16:33.814501 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

To help me assess your eligibility fully, I need to understand a bit more about your situation. Are you currently working in the UK, or do you have any other connection here such as receiving certain benefits or having a spouse/partner who works in the UK?

2026-01-29T12:16:35.611652 [actor]: I'm currently unemployed, but I'm actively looking for work. I've registered as a jobseeker and I'm genuinely trying to find employment.

2026-01-29T12:16:37.927974 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

One more question to help me assess your situation: Are you receiving any benefits or support while you're looking for work, such as Jobseeker's Allowance or Universal Credit?

2026-01-29T12:16:39.666528 [actor]: No, I'm not currently receiving any benefits. I've just registered as a jobseeker and I'm actively searching for work.

2026-01-29T12:16:45.602508 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

Based on the UK government's Child Benefit eligibility criteria, I need to inform you that there may be some concerns about your eligibility in your current situation.

While you meet several criteria:
- You have a child under 16 who lives with you
- You are responsible for your child
- You are living in the UK

The challenge relates to your immigration status and right to reside. With Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme, eligibility for Child Benefit generally requires you to have a "right to reside" in the UK. This typically means you need to be:
- Working in the UK, or
- Self-employed, or
- Receiving certain benefits, or
- Have a family member who is working

Since you mentioned you're currently unemployed and not receiving any benefits, you may not currently meet the "right to reside" test for Child Benefit purposes, even though you're actively looking for work and registered as a jobseeker.

However, this is a complex area of eligibility. I would recommend that you:
1. Apply anyway and let the Child Benefit Office assess your specific circumstances
2. Contact the Child Benefit helpline to discuss your particular situation

Is there anything else about your circumstances that might be relevant to your eligibility?

2026-01-29T12:16:48.382230 [actor]: Actually, I should mention - I am registered as a jobseeker with the jobcentre. I'm actively looking for work and I have a genuine prospect of finding employment. Doesn't that count as meeting the right to reside test? I thought being a registered jobseeker was one of the ways to qualify.

2026-01-29T12:16:52.826470 [root_agent]: You've raised a very important point, and I need to reconsider my previous response. Thank you for clarifying that.

Let me think about this more carefully. You're right that being a registered jobseeker can be relevant to the right to reside test. However, I need to be cautious here because the rules around "right to reside" for people with Pre-Settled Status who are jobseekers are quite specific and complex.

The situation with jobseekers and right to reside has some nuances that depend on:
- How long you've been in the UK
- Your specific circumstances as a jobseeker
- The nature of your job search

To give you accurate guidance on this point, can you tell me: How long have you been living in the UK since you moved here from Germany?

This will help me better understand whether your status as a registered jobseeker would give you the right to reside for Child Benefit purposes in your specific situation.

2026-01-29T12:16:54.891938 [actor]: I moved to the UK recently - it's been just a few months. I came here to look for work and I'm doing everything I can to find a job. I registered as a jobseeker as soon as I could.

2026-01-29T12:17:01.095144 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. This is an important detail.

Let me reflect on this carefully, as the rules around jobseekers and right to reside are quite specific.

For someone with Pre-Settled Status who has recently moved to the UK primarily to look for work, the right to reside as a jobseeker is more limited than I initially suggested. The key issue is that:

- While EU citizens (and those with Pre-Settled Status) can retain their right to reside as jobseekers under certain conditions, this is typically for people who were previously working in the UK and are now looking for new work
- Coming to the UK primarily as a jobseeker without having worked here first generally provides a more limited right to reside for benefit purposes

Given that you've only been in the UK for a few months and came here to look for work (rather than having worked here previously), you may not currently meet the right to reside requirement for Child Benefit.

However, this remains a complex area. My recommendation would be to:
1. Continue your job search actively
2. Once you secure employment, you should then have a clear right to reside and be eligible for Child Benefit
3. You could still apply now and let the Child Benefit Office make the formal decision

Have you had any work history in the UK at all, even briefly, before or since arriving?

2026-01-29T12:17:03.443705 [actor]: No, I haven't worked in the UK yet. I came here to find work and I've been focused on my job search since I arrived. So are you saying I'm not eligible for Child Benefit right now because I haven't worked here yet, even though I'm registered as a jobseeker and actively looking for work?

2026-01-29T12:17:08.962348 [root_agent]: Yes, based on the information you've provided, I'm afraid that's correct. Let me explain clearly:

With Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you do have the right to live in the UK. However, for Child Benefit purposes, there's an additional requirement called the "right to reside" test, which is more restrictive.

In your situation:
- You recently moved to the UK from Germany specifically to look for work
- You haven't worked in the UK yet
- You're not receiving any benefits
- You're registered as a jobseeker and actively looking for work

Unfortunately, being a registered jobseeker without prior work history in the UK does not typically satisfy the "right to reside" requirement for Child Benefit purposes. The right to reside as a jobseeker is generally available to those who have previously worked in the UK and retained that status, rather than those who came to the UK primarily to seek work.

**However, your eligibility should change once you find employment.** When you start working in the UK, you should then meet the right to reside requirement and become eligible for Child Benefit.

You could still submit an application now if you wish, and the Child Benefit Office would make the formal decision, but based on what you've told me, it's likely to be refused until you're in employment.

Is there anything else about your situation I should know?

2026-01-29T12:17:11.433803 [actor]: No, I think you've explained it clearly. So I'm not eligible right now, but once I find a job, I should be able to claim Child Benefit then. Thank you for going through all of this with me.

2026-01-29T12:17:16.187699 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to the EU Settlement Scheme guidance, EEA nationals with Pre-Settled Status who are registered jobseekers actively looking for work do have a right to reside for benefit purposes, including Child Benefit. The agent incorrectly stated that being a registered jobseeker without prior UK work history does not satisfy the right to reside requirement, when in fact genuine jobseekers can meet this test.
