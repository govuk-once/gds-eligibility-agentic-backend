2026-01-29T12:26:33.425980 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:26:35.493631 [actor]: Yes, I do. My son Zahid is 15 years old. The thing is, he doesn't live with me - he lives with his aunt. But I do send money to help with his costs, about £15 a week.

2026-01-29T12:26:37.672610 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand the living arrangements better.

**Does your son Zahid live with his aunt because he's in full-time non-advanced education or approved training, or is there another reason for this arrangement?**

2026-01-29T12:26:39.952953 [actor]: No, it's not because of education or training. He just lives with his aunt - that's the arrangement we have. But like I said, I contribute £15 a week towards his costs. And actually, my mother - Zahid's grandmother - also sends £15 a week to the aunt for Zahid's expenses.

2026-01-29T12:26:41.539389 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is helpful information.

**Does Zahid's aunt currently claim Child Benefit for him, or does anyone else claim it for him?**

2026-01-29T12:26:43.333056 [actor]: No, the aunt doesn't claim Child Benefit for him. Nobody else is claiming it either - that's why I'm asking if I can claim it.

2026-01-29T12:26:46.009694 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. I need to understand a bit more about your contribution to Zahid's upbringing.

**Besides the £15 per week you send, are you involved in making decisions about Zahid's care, such as his education, health, or general welfare?**

2026-01-29T12:26:48.534950 [actor]: Well, I do what I can, but since he lives with his aunt, she handles most of the day-to-day decisions. I send the money regularly to help support him, and I keep in touch. My main contribution is the financial support - the £15 a week I send to his aunt for his care.

2026-01-29T12:26:50.736663 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. I need to understand who has the primary responsibility for Zahid's day-to-day care.

**Would you say that Zahid's aunt is the person who has the main responsibility for him - meaning she's the one who looks after him on a daily basis, provides his home, and makes most of the decisions about his upbringing?**

2026-01-29T12:26:53.312632 [actor]: Yes, that's right. His aunt is the one who looks after him day-to-day, provides his home, and handles most of the decisions about his upbringing. I contribute financially - the £15 weekly - and my mother also sends £15 a week to help with his costs. So together we're sending £30 a week to support him.

2026-01-29T12:26:55.128010 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me ask one more important question:

**Are you and Zahid both currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:26:56.725550 [actor]: Yes, we're both living in the UK. I'm here and Zahid is living with his aunt here in the UK as well.

2026-01-29T12:27:01.181798 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, I can now assess your eligibility for Child Benefit.

**Unfortunately, you are not eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid.**

Here's why:

Child Benefit is paid to the person who is **responsible for the child**. This means the person who the child lives with and who has the main day-to-day responsibility for looking after them.

In your situation:
- Zahid lives with his aunt
- His aunt has the main day-to-day responsibility for him
- His aunt provides his home and makes most decisions about his upbringing
- Your contribution is financial (£15 per week)

**The person who would be eligible to claim Child Benefit is Zahid's aunt**, as she is the one who is responsible for him in the way the rules require.

The fact that you and your mother contribute financially toward his costs doesn't change this - Child Benefit goes to the person who has the main caring responsibility and who the child lives with.

If Zahid's aunt wishes to claim Child Benefit, she would be the eligible person to do so.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-29T12:27:04.038914 [actor]: But wait - I'm contributing £15 a week and my mother is contributing another £15 a week. That's £30 total going towards Zahid's care. Doesn't that count for anything? I thought if you were contributing at least the amount of Child Benefit towards the child's costs, you could claim it even if the child lives with someone else?

2026-01-29T12:27:08.881120 [root_agent]: That's a very good question, and I understand why you might think that. Let me clarify the rules around this.

**Even though you and your mother together contribute £30 per week (which is around the amount of Child Benefit), this doesn't change the eligibility rules.**

The key principle is that Child Benefit goes to **the person who is responsible for the child** - meaning the person the child lives with and who has the main day-to-day care responsibility.

Financial contribution alone doesn't establish responsibility for Child Benefit purposes. The rules focus on who is actually looking after the child day-to-day, not who is paying money towards their costs.

Since Zahid lives with his aunt and she has the main responsibility for him, she is the one who would be eligible to claim - regardless of the financial contributions you and your mother are making.

Your financial support is certainly valuable and helps with Zahid's upbringing, but under Child Benefit rules, **the aunt remains the eligible person** because she has him living with her and is responsible for his day-to-day care.

Does this make sense, or do you have any other questions about this?

2026-01-29T12:27:11.355112 [actor]: I see. So even though between me and my mother we're contributing £30 a week - which is more than the Child Benefit amount - because Zahid lives with his aunt and she's the one doing the day-to-day caring, she's the only one who can claim it? There's no way for me to claim it based on our financial contributions?

2026-01-29T12:27:16.142686 [root_agent]: **That's exactly right.**

Even though you and your mother together are contributing £30 a week toward Zahid's costs (which does exceed the Child Benefit amount), **there is no way for you to claim Child Benefit based on financial contributions alone**.

The rules are clear that Child Benefit goes to the person who:
- The child lives with, AND
- Who has the main day-to-day responsibility for the child

Since Zahid lives with his aunt and she provides his day-to-day care, **only she is eligible to claim Child Benefit for him**. Financial contribution, no matter how substantial, doesn't create eligibility if you don't have the child living with you and aren't responsible for their day-to-day care.

So to be absolutely clear: **No, there is no way for you to claim Child Benefit for Zahid under these circumstances.**

If the aunt wanted to claim Child Benefit for Zahid, she would be the eligible person to do so.

Is there anything else I can help clarify about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T12:27:18.719374 [actor]: No, I think I understand now. It's disappointing, but I get it - the aunt is the one who can claim because Zahid lives with her. Thank you for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T12:27:23.273898 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, a person can claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with them if they contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit (or the amount they would get) towards the child's care. Since the user contributes £15/week and their mother contributes £15/week (totaling £30), which exceeds the Child Benefit rate, the user should be eligible to claim even though the child lives with the aunt.
