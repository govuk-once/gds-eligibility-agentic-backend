2026-01-29T12:31:04.094549 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who you are responsible for?

2026-01-29T12:31:05.922311 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Rashid. He's 17 years old and still lives with us at home.

2026-01-29T12:31:07.991971 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Rashid normally live with you, and are you responsible for him? By "responsible for," I mean are you the person who is mainly looking after him - for example, providing his food, clothing, and generally caring for him day-to-day?

2026-01-29T12:31:10.309960 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. He lives with us - me and my wife - in our house. We provide for him, his food, clothing, everything he needs. He's still our son living under our roof, so yes, we're responsible for him.

2026-01-29T12:31:13.072091 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Is Rashid currently in full-time non-advanced education or approved training? By this I mean, is he still in school, college studying for qualifications like A-levels or equivalent, or doing an approved training course?

2026-01-29T12:31:14.699713 [actor]: Yes, he is. He's doing his A-Levels at the moment, still in full-time education.

2026-01-29T12:31:17.372034 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Now I need to ask: are you and your wife both in the UK, or does at least one of you normally live in the UK? And do you (or your wife) have the right to reside in the UK - for example, are you a British citizen, have settled status, or have another immigration status that gives you the right to live here?

2026-01-29T12:31:19.082169 [actor]: Yes, we're both here in the UK. We live here normally, and yes, we have the right to reside here.

2026-01-29T12:31:20.832929 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Rashid? This could be another family member or someone else who looks after him.

2026-01-29T12:31:22.629934 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming for him. Just us - we're his parents and he lives with us.

2026-01-29T12:31:28.075114 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Rashid. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Rashid, age 17) who lives with you
✓ You are responsible for him - providing his care, food, and clothing
✓ He is under 20 and in full-time non-advanced education (doing A-Levels)
✓ You and your wife live in the UK and have the right to reside here
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

You can claim Child Benefit for Rashid until he turns 20, as long as he remains in full-time non-advanced education or approved training.

One thing to be aware of: if either you or your wife has an individual income over £60,000 a year, you may need to pay some or all of the Child Benefit back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge when you do your tax return. However, you can still claim it if you're eligible.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:31:31.045538 [actor]: Oh, that's good to hear. But actually, there's something I should mention - Rashid got married recently. His wife is also 17 and she's moved in with us now. Does that change anything? Can I still claim for him even though he's married?

2026-01-29T12:31:35.032949 [root_agent]: That's an important detail, thank you for mentioning it. Let me think about this carefully.

Actually, this does affect Rashid's eligibility. Under the Child Benefit rules, a young person is not considered a "qualifying young person" if they are married or in a civil partnership, even if they are under 20 and still in full-time education.

So unfortunately, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Rashid** because he is married, even though he's only 17, still lives with you, is in full-time education, and you're responsible for him.

I'm sorry this isn't the answer you were hoping for. The marriage status does make a difference to the eligibility in this case.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T12:31:37.587879 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but I understand. No, I think that answers my question. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T12:31:41.990967 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent initially correctly identified eligibility based on the basic criteria, but then incorrectly stated that marriage disqualifies a young person from Child Benefit. According to GOV.UK guidance, a child under 20 in full-time non-advanced education can still qualify for Child Benefit even if married, as long as they meet the other criteria (living with the claimant, in approved education, etc.). The agent gave incorrect information about the marriage exclusion rule.
