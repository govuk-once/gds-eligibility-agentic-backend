2026-01-29T12:24:53.492542 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you:

**Do you have a child or children that you are responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:24:55.062936 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Sarah. She's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T12:24:56.982780 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now, let me ask you:

**Does Sarah normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount towards her upkeep as someone she lives with?**

2026-01-29T12:24:59.075335 [actor]: No, Sarah doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother. But I do contribute to her upkeep - every 4 weeks I buy a large bulk order of groceries and clothes for Sarah that costs £120, and I deliver them to her mother.

2026-01-29T12:25:01.253096 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail.

To assess this further, I need to ask:

**Does Sarah's mother also contribute financially to Sarah's upkeep, and if so, do you know approximately how much she spends on Sarah?**

2026-01-29T12:25:03.762181 [actor]: Well, yes, her mother obviously contributes - she's the one Sarah lives with, so she pays for everything day-to-day like housing, food, school things, and all that. I'm not exactly sure how much she spends, but she's the main carer so I'd imagine it's quite a bit more than what I contribute.

2026-01-29T12:25:05.668611 [root_agent]: Thank you for being honest about that.

Based on what you've told me, let me ask one more important question:

**Is Sarah's mother currently claiming Child Benefit for Sarah?**

2026-01-29T12:25:07.833513 [actor]: I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. I think she probably is, but we don't really discuss that sort of thing. Why do you ask?

2026-01-29T12:25:12.576136 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me explain why this matters.

Based on what you've shared, I need to let you know that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sarah** in this situation. Here's why:

To be eligible for Child Benefit when a child doesn't live with you, you must contribute **at least the same amount** towards the child's upkeep as the person the child lives with. From what you've described, Sarah's mother is the main carer and pays for housing, daily food, school expenses, and other day-to-day costs, which is considerably more than the £120 you contribute every 4 weeks.

Additionally, only **one person** can claim Child Benefit for the same child. If Sarah's mother is already claiming (which is likely as the main carer), then you cannot also claim.

The person who can claim Child Benefit is generally the one who:
- The child lives with, OR
- Contributes at least as much as the person the child lives with

In your case, Sarah's mother would be the eligible person to claim.

**Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit or your situation?**

2026-01-29T12:25:16.372684 [actor]: No, that makes sense. Thank you for explaining it to me. I understand now that because Sarah lives with her mother and her mother pays more towards her upkeep, I wouldn't be eligible to claim. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T12:25:18.521616 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent concluded I was not eligible, but the expected outcome was "Eligible" - the agent failed to properly assess the contribution requirement or explore whether the mother was actually claiming the benefit.
