2026-01-29T12:31:43.879984 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children who you are responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:31:46.428601 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Kelly. She's 16 and just finished her GCSEs in June. She's been accepted into college to start her A-levels in September, but I'm a bit worried because she's not actually in school right now - it's August, so she's on the summer break. Does that affect my Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:31:49.106861 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about Kelly. That's a very common situation, and the summer break between finishing GCSEs and starting college is important to understand.

To help assess your eligibility properly, I need to ask:

**Are you Kelly's parent, or do you have parental responsibility for her?**

(For example, are you her mother, father, or someone else who has legal responsibility for her care?)

2026-01-29T12:31:50.850738 [actor]: Yes, I'm her mother - my name's Joan. I have full parental responsibility for Kelly. She lives with me.

2026-01-29T12:31:52.563805 [root_agent]: Thank you, Joan. That's helpful information.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:31:54.134925 [actor]: Yes, I am. We both live in the UK.

2026-01-29T12:31:56.321056 [root_agent]: Great, thank you Joan.

Now, let me ask about Kelly's education status:

**When Kelly starts her A-levels in September, will she be studying full-time (more than 12 hours per week of supervised study)?**

2026-01-29T12:31:58.274643 [actor]: Yes, she will be studying full-time at college when she starts in September. It's a proper full-time A-level course.

2026-01-29T12:32:00.264250 [root_agent]: Thank you, Joan. That's very helpful.

Let me ask one more important question:

**Does Kelly live with you, or does she live with someone else (such as another parent or guardian)?**

2026-01-29T12:32:02.117880 [actor]: She lives with me. It's just the two of us at home.

2026-01-29T12:32:07.109553 [root_agent]: Thank you, Joan. I have enough information now to assess your eligibility.

**Good news - you should be eligible for Child Benefit for Kelly.**

Here's why:

✓ You are Kelly's mother with parental responsibility
✓ Kelly lives with you in the UK
✓ Kelly is 16 and will be in full-time approved education (A-levels) starting in September

Importantly, regarding your concern about the summer break: **Child Benefit continues during the summer holidays between finishing GCSEs and starting college/sixth form.** You don't lose entitlement just because she's on her summer break right now.

Your Child Benefit for Kelly can continue until:
- She turns 20 (as long as she remains in approved full-time education or training), OR
- She leaves full-time education, whichever comes first

So you can continue to claim Child Benefit through the summer and once she starts her A-levels in September.

**Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?**

2026-01-29T12:32:10.003612 [actor]: Oh, that's such a relief! I was really worried that I might lose the benefit during the summer gap. Thank you so much for clarifying that - it's very helpful to know that the benefit continues through the holidays between her finishing GCSEs and starting college. I don't have any other questions, you've been very clear. Thank you!

2026-01-29T12:32:14.361724 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Joan is eligible for Child Benefit for her 16-year-old daughter Kelly, correctly identified that the benefit continues during the summer break between GCSEs and college, and provided accurate information about eligibility criteria including that Child Benefit can continue until age 20 if the child remains in approved full-time education.
