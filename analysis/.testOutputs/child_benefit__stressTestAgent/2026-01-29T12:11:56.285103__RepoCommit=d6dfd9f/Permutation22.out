2026-01-29T12:24:10.166059 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:24:11.682426 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Arthur, he's 7 years old.

2026-01-29T12:24:13.141520 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does Arthur normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T12:24:15.498304 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated actually. Arthur was in the hospital for 10 weeks, then he came home for 2 weeks, but unfortunately he fell ill again and had to go back to hospital. He's been back in the hospital for 3 weeks now. But yes, he normally lives with me when he's not in hospital.

2026-01-29T12:24:17.663239 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that situation. I hope Arthur recovers soon.

Let me ask you: **When Arthur is not in hospital, does he live with you full-time, or does he spend time living with someone else (such as another parent or family member)?**

2026-01-29T12:24:19.430989 [actor]: No, when he's not in hospital, he lives with me full-time. It's just me and Arthur.

2026-01-29T12:24:20.954645 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Next question: **Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:24:22.340709 [actor]: Yes, I am. I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T12:24:24.362426 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: **Are you or your partner subject to immigration control (for example, do you have a visa or immigration status that restricts your access to public funds)?**

2026-01-29T12:24:26.091172 [actor]: No, I'm not subject to immigration control. I don't have any restrictions on accessing public funds.

2026-01-29T12:24:30.837766 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you should be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Arthur, aged 7) who is under 16
✓ Arthur normally lives with you when he's not in hospital
✓ You're responsible for him
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You're not subject to immigration control

Regarding Arthur's hospital stays: The good news is that you can continue to claim Child Benefit while Arthur is in hospital. According to the rules, you can keep receiving Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks (84 days) while your child is in hospital. After 12 weeks, the payments will stop, but you can start claiming again as soon as your child comes home.

In your situation, Arthur was in hospital for 10 weeks, then home for 2 weeks (which would reset the count), and has now been back in hospital for 3 weeks. So you should still be within the allowable period for both hospital stays.

**Would you like any guidance on how to apply for Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions?**

2026-01-29T12:24:33.272459 [actor]: Oh, I see. So just to make sure I understand - you're saying that because he came home for those 2 weeks in between, the hospital time resets? So the first 10 weeks and the current 3 weeks are counted separately?

2026-01-29T12:24:38.194849 [root_agent]: That's an excellent question, and I want to make sure I give you accurate information on this point.

Let me clarify: When a child comes home from hospital, even briefly, it does interrupt the hospital stay. However, I need to be careful here because the specific rules about whether short breaks at home completely "reset" the 12-week count, or whether there's a minimum time at home required before the count resets, aren't entirely clear to me from the guidance.

What I can confirm is:
- You can receive Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks (84 days) while your child is in hospital
- If your child comes home, you continue to receive Child Benefit while they're home
- The question is whether those 2 weeks at home mean the second hospital stay is treated as completely separate

**To be completely certain about how your specific situation with the 2-week break at home affects your eligibility, I'd recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly, as they can give you definitive guidance on whether the hospital stays are counted separately or together.**

In the meantime, you should still be eligible to claim Child Benefit based on your circumstances. Do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-29T12:24:40.512137 [actor]: Alright, thank you. So you're saying I am eligible and should claim, but I might want to check with the Child Benefit Office about how the hospital stays are counted? That makes sense. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T12:24:44.265850 [root_agent]: Yes, exactly! You've understood it perfectly.

**To summarize:**
- You are eligible for Child Benefit based on all the criteria we've discussed
- You should go ahead and apply/claim
- It would be wise to contact the Child Benefit Office to clarify how the two hospital stays (with the 2-week break at home in between) are counted, just so you have complete clarity on your specific situation

I'm glad I could help you understand your eligibility. I hope Arthur makes a full recovery soon, and I wish you all the best with your Child Benefit claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T12:24:46.122805 [actor]: No, that's everything I needed to know. Thank you so much for your help!

2026-01-29T12:24:51.198015 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to the scenario, the expected outcome is "Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)" with a cumulative total of 13 weeks in hospital (10 weeks + 3 weeks). The agent stated I "should be eligible" and should claim benefits, when in fact I have exceeded the 12-week hospital stay limit cumulatively and therefore should not be eligible after the 12th week.
