2026-01-29T12:28:48.089254 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:28:49.775058 [actor]: Yes, I do have a child that I'm responsible for. I'm the one who fills out the Child Benefit form and the payments come into my bank account.

2026-01-29T12:28:51.396456 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Does your child normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T12:28:52.970052 [actor]: Yes, my child lives with me and my wife.

2026-01-29T12:28:55.449277 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now, let me ask you an important question about your income:

**Do you or your wife have an individual income over £60,000 a year?**

(This is important because if either of you earns over this amount, it may affect your Child Benefit eligibility or require you to pay some of it back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.)

2026-01-29T12:28:56.865790 [actor]: Well, I earn £18,000 a year, but my wife Emily earns £65,000 a year.

2026-01-29T12:29:01.689975 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you are eligible for Child Benefit** because:

- You have a child under 16 (or under 20 in approved education/training)
- You are responsible for the child
- The child lives with you

However, there's an important consideration: Since your wife earns £65,000 per year (which is over £60,000), **you will need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge**.

When either partner in a household earns over £50,000, the higher earner must pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through their tax return. Since your wife earns £65,000, she would need to pay back the full amount of Child Benefit received through this tax charge.

You have two options:
1. Still claim Child Benefit but your wife pays back the full amount via Self Assessment tax return
2. Opt out of receiving the payments (but still register for Child Benefit to protect your child's National Insurance record)

**Do you have any questions about the High Income Child Benefit Charge, or is there anything else you'd like to know about your eligibility?**

2026-01-29T12:29:06.673148 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that I am eligible for Child Benefit since I have a qualifying child who lives with me, and correctly explained that my wife Emily would need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge since her income of £65,000 exceeds the £50,000 threshold, which matches the expected outcome.
