2026-01-29T12:13:45.414462 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:13:47.256940 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. I have a daughter, Sofia. She's 18 years old.

2026-01-29T12:13:49.559510 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about Sofia.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is Sofia currently in approved education or training?**

(This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or similar approved courses.)

2026-01-29T12:13:51.436461 [actor]: No, she's not in any education or training. She left school two years ago and now works as a receptionist.

2026-01-29T12:13:54.377655 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia**.

Here's why: Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they are in approved education or training. Since Sofia is 18 and is not in approved education or training, she falls outside the eligibility criteria.

**Do you have any other children under 16, or under 20 who are in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T12:13:55.932022 [actor]: No, Sofia is my only child.

2026-01-29T12:13:58.825561 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on our conversation, **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** because:

- Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training
- Your daughter Sofia is 18 years old and is not currently in approved education or training
- She is working as a receptionist, which means she doesn't meet the criteria for the extended age eligibility

If Sofia's circumstances change in the future and she enters approved education or training before she turns 20, you may become eligible at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T12:14:00.600957 [actor]: No, that's clear. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T12:14:04.470103 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because their daughter Sofia is 18, not in approved education or training, and is working, which means she doesn't meet the criteria (children must be under 16, or under 20 if in approved education/training).
