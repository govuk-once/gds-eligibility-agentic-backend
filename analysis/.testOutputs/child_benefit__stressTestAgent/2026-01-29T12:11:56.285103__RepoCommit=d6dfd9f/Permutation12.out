2026-01-29T12:18:27.992808 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

(Please note that for Child Benefit purposes, this includes children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)

2026-01-29T12:18:29.681731 [actor]: I have an 18-year-old son, Liam. He lives with me and he's studying for his A-levels.

2026-01-29T12:18:32.628199 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your 18-year-old son Liam who is studying for his A-levels may qualify, as Child Benefit can be paid for young people under 20 who are in approved education or training.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you the person primarily responsible for Liam? In other words, are you the main person who looks after him and meets his everyday needs?**

2026-01-29T12:18:35.095573 [actor]: Yes, I am. He lives with me and I'm the one who looks after him day to day. His father isn't involved - they're estranged.

2026-01-29T12:18:37.230321 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like you are the main person responsible for Liam's care.

Now I need to ask you:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:18:38.727590 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T12:18:41.750103 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Next question:

**Do you have what's called "Right to Reside" in the UK? This generally means you are a UK or Irish citizen, have settled status, or have another immigration status that gives you the right to live here permanently or access public funds?**

2026-01-29T12:18:43.423585 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK citizen.

2026-01-29T12:18:45.901056 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

One more important question:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year?**

(If you have a partner, I'm referring to whoever has the higher income between the two of you)

2026-01-29T12:18:47.654232 [actor]: No, I don't have a partner and my income is well below £60,000.

2026-01-29T12:18:52.274760 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Liam, aged 18) who is in approved education (studying for A-levels)
✓ You are the person primarily responsible for him
✓ He lives with you
✓ You live in the UK and are a UK citizen
✓ Your income is below £60,000

Since Liam is under 20 and is in approved education or training (his A-levels qualify), you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him.

**Important note:** Child Benefit can continue until the 31st August after a young person turns 16, or beyond that if they stay in approved education or training, but it stops when they turn 20 or leave approved education/training, whichever comes first.

You can apply for Child Benefit if you haven't already done so. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:18:54.298589 [actor]: Oh, I forgot to mention - Liam has been claiming Universal Credit in his own right to help with his living costs. Does that affect anything?

2026-01-29T12:18:58.521301 [root_agent]: That's an important detail, thank you for mentioning it. Let me think about this carefully.

**Does Liam receive any benefits in his own name, such as Universal Credit, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, or Income Support?**

I need to confirm this because if a young person is claiming certain benefits in their own right, it can affect Child Benefit eligibility. The fact that he's claiming Universal Credit in his own name is significant and may impact whether you can receive Child Benefit for him.

Can you confirm that he is definitely claiming Universal Credit in his own name (not as part of your household claim)?

2026-01-29T12:19:00.414713 [actor]: Yes, that's right - he's claiming Universal Credit in his own name, not as part of my claim. He needed it to help with his personal living costs while he's studying.

2026-01-29T12:19:04.387645 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that important detail.

I need to inform you that **this does affect your eligibility for Child Benefit.**

If Liam is claiming Universal Credit in his own name (or certain other benefits like Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance), then unfortunately **you cannot claim Child Benefit for him**, even though he's under 20 and in approved education.

The rules state that if a young person is receiving these benefits in their own right, they are treated as being responsible for themselves, and therefore Child Benefit cannot be paid for them.

So based on this additional information, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam** while he continues to claim Universal Credit in his own name.

I'm sorry this isn't the answer you were hoping for. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-29T12:19:06.439972 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing but I understand. No, I think that answers my question. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T12:19:10.155160 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent initially told me I was eligible for Child Benefit before learning about Liam's Universal Credit claim, which constitutes giving incorrect information during the conversation, even though the agent later corrected this after I provided additional information.
