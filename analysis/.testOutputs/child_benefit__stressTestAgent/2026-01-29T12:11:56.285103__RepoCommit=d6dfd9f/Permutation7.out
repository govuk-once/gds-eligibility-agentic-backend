2026-01-29T12:15:13.020583 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T12:15:14.548121 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T12:15:16.162948 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Do you live in the UK, or are you a UK resident for tax purposes?

2026-01-29T12:15:17.996531 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T12:15:19.556259 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Is your son living with you, or is he living with someone else?

2026-01-29T12:15:21.230431 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. My son Jack was placed in local authority care about 3 months ago. But he does come home to stay with me every weekend - he arrives Friday evening and leaves Sunday evening.

2026-01-29T12:15:24.361332 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this is a complex situation.

Since Jack is in local authority care but visits you on weekends, I need to ask: Do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards the cost of looking after Jack? This could be through regular payments or contributions to his care.

2026-01-29T12:15:26.247898 [actor]: Yes, I do contribute towards Jack's care. I make sure to support him financially as well as having him home every weekend.

2026-01-29T12:15:28.180528 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

One more important question: Are you currently receiving any other benefits or payments specifically for Jack from the local authority or any other source because he's in care?

2026-01-29T12:15:29.914105 [actor]: No, I'm not receiving any other benefits or payments from the local authority for Jack being in care.

2026-01-29T12:15:33.895174 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you should be eligible for Child Benefit** for Jack. Here's why:

1. ✓ Jack is under 16 years old (he's 14)
2. ✓ You live in the UK
3. ✓ Even though Jack is in local authority care, he comes to stay with you regularly (every weekend)
4. ✓ You're contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards his care
5. ✓ You're not receiving other payments from the local authority for him

According to the eligibility rules, you can still claim Child Benefit for a child in care if they regularly stay with you and you contribute to their upkeep - which is exactly your situation.

**You should apply for or continue claiming Child Benefit for Jack.**

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility or the application process?

2026-01-29T12:15:37.572599 [actor]: No, that's very helpful. Thank you for clarifying that for me. I'm glad to know I can still claim Child Benefit even though Jack is in care but comes home on weekends. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T12:15:39.870394 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user is eligible for Child Benefit under the exception for children in care who regularly stay with the claimant, correctly verified all necessary conditions including the contribution requirement, and provided the correct outcome matching the expected "Eligible (via Exception)" scenario.
