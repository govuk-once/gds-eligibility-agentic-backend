2026-01-29T12:37:36.987790 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or young person who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:37:38.935213 [actor]: Yes, I have a daughter. She's 8 years old, but she's been in hospital for 14 weeks now. I visit her every single day and spend hours with her to keep her company.

2026-01-29T12:37:41.653539 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I'm sorry to hear your daughter has been in hospital.

The length of time a child is in hospital can affect Child Benefit eligibility, so I need to understand your situation better.

**Next question: Does your daughter normally live with you when she's not in hospital?**

2026-01-29T12:37:43.926294 [actor]: Yes, she normally lives with me at home. It's just because of her medical condition that she's been in the hospital for so long. But like I said, I'm there every day with her.

2026-01-29T12:37:45.901048 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Your regular visits and the fact she normally lives with you are important factors.

Let me ask you this: **Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your daughter, or are you asking about making a new claim?**

2026-01-29T12:37:47.701264 [actor]: I'm currently receiving Child Benefit for her, but I'm worried because she's been in hospital for so long now - 14 weeks. I wanted to check if I'm still eligible or if there's something I need to know.

2026-01-29T12:37:50.063911 [root_agent]: That's a very sensible question to check. The length of time your daughter has been in hospital is indeed relevant to your Child Benefit.

Let me ask you: **Is the hospital or local authority paying anything towards the cost of your daughter's care or accommodation while she's in hospital?**

2026-01-29T12:37:52.347751 [actor]: No, it's just NHS hospital care. They provide everything she needs while she's there - her meals, clothes, everything really. But no one is paying me anything for her care, if that's what you mean.

2026-01-29T12:37:56.845194 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. That's helpful information.

Now, based on what you've told me, I need to let you know something important about your Child Benefit eligibility:

**When a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks (84 days) in a row, and the hospital or local authority is providing for the child's needs (such as accommodation, meals, and clothing), Child Benefit usually stops.**

Since your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks now, and the hospital is providing for her needs, this means your Child Benefit eligibility has been affected.

However, there is an exception: **You can continue to receive Child Benefit if you're regularly spending at least one full day per week with your child in hospital.** This could be made up of shorter visits that add up to at least one full day each week.

**My question to you is: When you visit your daughter every day and spend hours with her, do those visits add up to at least one full day (24 hours or more) per week in total?**

2026-01-29T12:37:59.341163 [actor]: Oh yes, definitely! I visit her every single day for hours. I'd say I easily spend well over a full day's worth of time with her each week - probably more like 30 or 40 hours a week actually. I'm there from morning until evening most days because I want to be with her and keep her company during this difficult time.

2026-01-29T12:38:03.159860 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail. That's very clear.

Based on everything you've told me, here's the good news:

**You ARE still eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter.**

Even though she's been in hospital for more than 12 weeks and the hospital is providing for her needs, you meet the important exception to the rule: you're spending well over one full day per week with her (you're spending 30-40 hours per week, which is far more than the required minimum).

This regular, substantial time you're spending with your daughter means you can continue to receive Child Benefit throughout her hospital stay.

**You should continue to receive your Child Benefit payments as normal.** There's no need for you to take any action or worry about your eligibility being affected.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T12:38:05.761879 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you. I was worried I might lose it because she's been in hospital so long, but I'm relieved to hear that as long as I keep visiting her regularly like I have been, I can still receive the Child Benefit. Thank you for explaining it all to me.

2026-01-29T12:38:09.569159 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to government guidance, when a child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks and the hospital is providing accommodation and maintenance, Child Benefit stops - the exception about spending one full day per week applies only to children in care/looked after by local authorities, not to children in hospital.
