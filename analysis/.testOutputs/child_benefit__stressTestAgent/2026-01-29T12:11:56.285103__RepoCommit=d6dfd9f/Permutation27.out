2026-01-29T12:27:25.289016 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Are you responsible for raising a child who is under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T12:27:27.199997 [actor]: Hi, yes I am. I have a baby called Mia. I'm 15 and I live with my parents but I want to claim for Mia myself.

2026-01-29T12:27:29.886461 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a baby called Mia and you're 15 years old living with your parents.

Let me ask you an important question: **Are you the main person responsible for Mia - meaning are you the one who is primarily looking after her day-to-day?**

This includes things like feeding her, making sure she has what she needs, and being responsible for her care.

2026-01-29T12:27:32.238665 [actor]: Yes, I am. I'm the one who looks after Mia - I feed her, change her, and take care of her every day. My parents help me out sometimes, but I'm the main one responsible for her.

2026-01-29T12:27:35.104918 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's clear you're doing a lot to care for Mia.

Now, an important question about your living situation: **Do you or your parents receive Child Benefit for you (since you're 15 and still a child yourself)?**

This is important because it affects whether you can claim Child Benefit for Mia.

2026-01-29T12:27:36.850061 [actor]: Um, I'm not completely sure, but I think my parents probably do get Child Benefit for me since I'm still 15 and living with them. Does that mean I can't claim for Mia?

2026-01-29T12:27:40.006162 [root_agent]: That's a very important piece of information. Let me think through this carefully based on the rules.

Since you're 15 years old and your parents are likely receiving Child Benefit for you, this does create a specific situation. According to the eligibility rules, only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. 

However, **you can still claim Child Benefit for Mia even though you're a child yourself and your parents are claiming for you.** The key factor is that you are the main person responsible for Mia.

Let me ask you another question to continue the assessment: **Do you or Mia usually live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:27:41.989969 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. I've always lived here with my parents and Mia lives here with us too.

2026-01-29T12:27:44.155378 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's good - living in the UK is an important part of eligibility.

Now I need to ask: **Is Mia living with you full-time, or does she spend time living with someone else (for example, her other parent)?**

2026-01-29T12:27:45.833207 [actor]: No, Mia lives with me full-time. She's with me all the time here at my parents' house.

2026-01-29T12:27:48.090029 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Let me ask you: **Is Mia currently in hospital or in any kind of local authority care?**

2026-01-29T12:27:49.978494 [actor]: No, she's not. Mia is healthy and she's here at home with me.

2026-01-29T12:27:52.690929 [root_agent]: That's good to hear that Mia is healthy and at home with you.

Now I need to ask about your income situation: **Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 a year?**

This is important because there's a High Income Child Benefit Charge that may apply if someone in your household earns above this amount.

2026-01-29T12:27:54.386687 [actor]: No, I don't have a partner and I don't work - I'm still in school. So I definitely don't earn anywhere near £60,000.

2026-01-29T12:27:58.973501 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Based on what you've told me, let me summarize your situation:

✓ You are the main person responsible for Mia
✓ Mia is under 16 (she's a baby)
✓ You both live in the UK
✓ Mia lives with you full-time
✓ Mia is not in hospital or local authority care
✓ You don't have an income over £60,000

**You appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Mia.** Even though you're 15 years old yourself and your parents may be claiming Child Benefit for you, you can still make your own claim for your child because you are the person responsible for her.

The fact that you're under 16 yourself doesn't prevent you from claiming Child Benefit for Mia - what matters is that you're the main person looking after her.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the claiming process?

2026-01-29T12:28:04.381011 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a 15-year-old parent can claim Child Benefit for their own child even while their parents claim Child Benefit for them, correctly identifying that only the responsibility for the child matters for eligibility purposes.
