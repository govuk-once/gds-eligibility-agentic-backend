2026-01-29T12:25:21.050162 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T12:25:22.470677 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Tom, who's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T12:25:24.601016 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does Tom normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards looking after him?**

2026-01-29T12:25:26.433942 [actor]: Well, he normally lives with me, but actually he's been away at a residential school for the past 10 weeks. The local council is paying for it because he has severe behavioral needs.

2026-01-29T12:25:28.499700 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that detail. This is an important situation to understand properly.

Next question: **Does Tom come home to stay with you during school holidays, or does he remain at the residential school during holiday periods as well?**

2026-01-29T12:25:30.128398 [actor]: He comes home during the school holidays. It's just during term time that he's at the residential school.

2026-01-29T12:25:32.511614 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful information.

Next question: **Are you responsible for Tom or contributing to the cost of supporting him while he's at the residential school, even though the local council is paying the fees?**

(For example, do you buy him clothes, provide pocket money, or contribute in other ways to his upkeep?)

2026-01-29T12:25:34.748188 [actor]: Yes, of course! I still buy all his clothes, give him pocket money, and pay for things he needs. I'm still his mum and responsible for him - the council just pays for the school fees.

2026-01-29T12:25:37.032119 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that - it's clear you're still very much responsible for Tom's care.

Next question: **Are you currently living in the UK, or are you a Crown servant (such as a civil servant or member of the armed forces) or their partner posted overseas?**

2026-01-29T12:25:38.690157 [actor]: Yes, I'm living in the UK.

2026-01-29T12:25:40.965957 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you.

Next question: **Is there anyone else who might also be claiming Child Benefit for Tom, such as his other parent or another family member?**

2026-01-29T12:25:42.459391 [actor]: No, there's no one else claiming for him. It's just me.

2026-01-29T12:25:46.837734 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you should be eligible for Child Benefit** for Tom. Here's why:

✓ Tom is under 16 years old (he's 14)
✓ He normally lives with you and comes home during school holidays
✓ You remain responsible for him and contribute to his costs (clothes, pocket money, etc.)
✓ You're living in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

The fact that Tom is in a residential school paid for by the local council during term time doesn't affect your eligibility, as long as:
- He's still considered to be living with you (which he is - he comes home for holidays)
- You're still responsible for him (which you are - you're buying his clothes, giving pocket money, etc.)

You should be able to claim Child Benefit for Tom. If you haven't already claimed, you can apply online or by post. If you're already receiving it, you should continue to be eligible.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:25:48.574637 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T12:25:53.522705 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to official guidance, Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks when a child is in local authority care in residential accommodation, even if the parent maintains contact and contributes to costs. Since Tom has been at the residential school for 10 weeks with the local council paying, the agent should have informed the mother she is eligible until week 12, after which eligibility ceases.
