2026-01-29T12:14:06.558329 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T12:14:08.201190 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Lucas. He's 10 years old.

2026-01-29T12:14:09.666708 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Does Lucas normally live with you?

2026-01-29T12:14:11.978590 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me. He lives with his ex-wife, Jenny. We're divorced, but I do contribute money towards Lucas's upkeep - I send Jenny £150 every month specifically for his food and clothes.

2026-01-29T12:14:13.661413 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. This is an important detail.

Let me ask: Does Jenny currently claim Child Benefit for Lucas?

2026-01-29T12:14:15.154637 [actor]: No, she doesn't claim Child Benefit for Lucas.

2026-01-29T12:14:17.622760 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask another important question:

Even though Lucas doesn't live with you full-time, do you contribute to the cost of providing for him in other ways beyond the £150 monthly payment? For example, do you pay for things like his school uniform, toys, outings, or other expenses directly?

2026-01-29T12:14:19.819206 [actor]: Well, the £150 I send each month is specifically for his food and clothes. That's my main contribution to his upkeep. I transfer it to Jenny so she can use it for those things for Lucas.

2026-01-29T12:14:21.962872 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Let me ask one more question to complete my assessment:

Do you have Lucas stay with you at all, even if it's just for weekends, holidays, or certain days of the week?

2026-01-29T12:14:23.799495 [actor]: No, he doesn't stay with me. He lives full-time with Jenny. I just send the money each month to help with his expenses.

2026-01-29T12:14:28.152558 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Unfortunately, based on your circumstances, you are not eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas.**

Here's why:

Child Benefit is generally paid to the person who the child lives with. Since Lucas lives full-time with your ex-wife Jenny, she would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for him - even though she's currently not claiming it.

The fact that you contribute £150 monthly towards Lucas's upkeep (for food and clothes) doesn't change the eligibility in this case, because Lucas doesn't live with you or stay with you regularly.

However, Jenny should consider claiming Child Benefit for Lucas if she isn't already doing so, as she appears to be eligible since Lucas lives with her full-time.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T12:14:34.109549 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because the child (Lucas) lives full-time with the ex-wife Jenny, and Child Benefit is generally paid to the person the child lives with, not simply to someone who contributes financially but doesn't have the child living with them.
