2026-01-29T12:12:28.633332 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T12:12:30.953613 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have a daughter who's 17, and she's studying full-time for her A-levels at sixth-form college.

2026-01-29T12:12:33.183497 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your daughter may qualify since she's in approved education, even though she's 17.

Next question: **Does your daughter normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards looking after her?**

2026-01-29T12:12:34.768066 [actor]: Yes, she lives with me. It's just the two of us at home in London.

2026-01-29T12:12:36.807228 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Next question: **Are you responsible for your daughter? This means you're the main person looking after her - for example, you make decisions about her upbringing, provide for her daily needs, and she depends on you financially.**

2026-01-29T12:12:38.730406 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm her father and I'm responsible for everything - her upbringing, her daily needs, all her expenses. She depends on me completely.

2026-01-29T12:12:40.821063 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Do you usually live in the UK? In other words, is the UK your main home where you normally reside?**

2026-01-29T12:12:42.295060 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. London is my home, where I normally reside.

2026-01-29T12:12:44.217061 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: **Are you or your daughter subject to immigration control? For example, do you have a visa condition that says you have "no recourse to public funds"?**

2026-01-29T12:12:45.669661 [actor]: No, we're not subject to immigration control. There are no visa conditions or restrictions like that.

2026-01-29T12:12:47.896932 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Next question: **Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your daughter, or is anyone else in a position where they could also claim for her (for example, if she spends equal time living with another parent or guardian)?**

2026-01-29T12:12:49.767154 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for her. She lives with me full-time, and I'm a single father, so there's no other parent or guardian in the picture who could claim.

2026-01-29T12:12:52.750788 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One final question: **Are you aware that if you (or your partner, if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year, you may need to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge? Does this apply to your situation?**

(Note: You can still claim Child Benefit even if you earn over this amount, but there may be a tax charge to pay back.)

2026-01-29T12:12:54.602710 [actor]: I'm single, so there's no partner. My income is £40,000 a year, so I'm under that £60,000 threshold.

2026-01-29T12:12:59.064805 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

**Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ You have a 17-year-old daughter who is in full-time approved education (studying A-levels at sixth-form college), so she qualifies as she's under 20 and in approved education or training

✓ She lives with you and you're responsible for her

✓ You live in the UK

✓ You're not subject to immigration control

✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

✓ Your income is under £60,000, so you won't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge

**You should be able to claim Child Benefit for your daughter.** The benefit will continue until she turns 20, or until she stops being in approved education or training, whichever comes first.

If you haven't already claimed, you can apply online or by post. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:13:00.856998 [actor]: No, that's everything I needed to know. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T12:13:04.926191 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria including the daughter's age and educational status (17 and in full-time A-level education), confirmed residence and responsibility, verified no immigration restrictions, ensured no duplicate claims exist, and noted the income was below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
