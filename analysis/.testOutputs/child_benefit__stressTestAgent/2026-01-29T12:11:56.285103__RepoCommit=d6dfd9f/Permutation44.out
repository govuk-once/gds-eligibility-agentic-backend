2026-01-29T12:37:01.811540 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T12:37:03.487149 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have a son, Leo, who's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T12:37:05.081418 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does Leo live with you?**

2026-01-29T12:37:07.172176 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. Leo is in local authority care, but he does come home to visit me every week. He comes home on Saturdays at 10 in the morning and goes back to the care home on Sundays at 11 in the morning.

2026-01-29T12:37:09.532749 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining Leo's situation. This is indeed an important detail.

Next question: **When Leo visits you on weekends, are you responsible for his care during those visits, and do you contribute financially towards his upbringing or maintenance costs?**

2026-01-29T12:37:11.895388 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for him when he's with me on weekends. I make sure he's fed, looked after, and I do contribute what I can towards his costs when he's home with me.

2026-01-29T12:37:13.733353 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I have a few more questions to help assess your eligibility.

Next question: **How long has Leo been in local authority care, and is this arrangement expected to be temporary or permanent?**

2026-01-29T12:37:16.360684 [actor]: He's been in care for several months now - well over two months. As for whether it's temporary or permanent, I'm not entirely sure yet. We're still working things out, but he does come home regularly every week like I mentioned.

2026-01-29T12:37:18.576907 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. This is helpful information.

Next question: **During the time Leo is in local authority care (Monday to Saturday morning), is the local authority paying for his full maintenance and accommodation costs?**

2026-01-29T12:37:20.265643 [actor]: Yes, the local authority is paying for his accommodation and looking after him during the week when he's at the care home.

2026-01-29T12:37:22.040944 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. I have one more important question:

**Do you receive any financial support or allowances from the local authority specifically for Leo while he is in their care?**

2026-01-29T12:37:23.597802 [actor]: No, I don't receive any financial support or allowances from the local authority for Leo while he's in their care.

2026-01-29T12:37:28.750924 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on the UK government rules, I'm afraid you are not eligible for Child Benefit in your current situation.**

Here's why:

When a child is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, and the local authority is paying for the child's full maintenance and accommodation costs during that time, Child Benefit cannot be paid. This applies even though Leo visits you regularly on weekends and you care for him during those visits.

Since Leo has been in care for several months (well over 8 weeks) and the local authority is covering his full costs during the weekdays, this means Child Benefit is not payable for him during this period.

**However**, if Leo's care arrangement changes and he returns to live with you full-time in the future, you would be able to claim Child Benefit at that point, as long as you remain responsible for him and he lives with you.

I understand this may be disappointing news, especially given that you're caring for Leo on weekends and contributing what you can. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this decision?

2026-01-29T12:37:35.037370 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to UK government rules, Child Benefit can still be paid when a child is in local authority care if the child regularly spends time with the parent (at least one night per week) and the parent contributes to the child's maintenance costs. Since Leo visits every weekend (staying overnight from Saturday to Sunday) and the parent contributes financially and cares for him during visits, the parent should be eligible for Child Benefit.
