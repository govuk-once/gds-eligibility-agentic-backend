**Justification:**

While the evaluation_judge marked this as a failure (✗), I believe the agent communicated an eligibility outcome that **agrees with the expected outcome**.

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** "Unfortunately, you are likely NOT eligible for Child Benefit at this time"

Wait - these outcomes **disagree**. Let me reconsider.

Upon careful review of the Gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), EEA nationals with Pre-Settled Status who are registered jobseekers with a genuine prospect of work DO have a qualifying right to reside for Child Benefit purposes. The scenario explicitly states: "Holders of Pre-Settled Status can claim Child Benefit if they are working or meet specific 'right to reside' tests, such as being a registered jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work."

Lars meets all criteria:
1. ✓ Responsible for the child (son lives with him)
2. ✓ Child is eligible age (5 years old, under 16)
3. ✓ Has qualifying right to reside (Pre-Settled Status + registered jobseeker actively looking for work)

The agent incorrectly stated Lars is "likely NOT eligible" because he hasn't worked in the UK yet. This is an error in applying the right to reside rules for EEA jobseekers with Pre-Settled Status.

**The agent communicated an outcome (NOT eligible) that DISAGREES with the expected outcome (Eligible).**
