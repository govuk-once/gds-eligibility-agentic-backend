2026-01-28T20:38:45.616623 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T20:38:47.422806 [actor]: child benefit 6 year old not livng with me temporarly grandma looking after

2026-01-28T20:38:50.079088 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. I understand you have a 6-year-old child who is temporarily living with their grandma.

Let me ask you: Are you still responsible for the child, meaning do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards the child's upkeep (or would contribute that amount if you weren't paying Child Benefit)?

2026-01-28T20:38:51.751507 [actor]: yes im responsbile had surjery cant look after right now

2026-01-28T20:38:53.510219 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. I understand you're responsible for your child and they're temporarily with their grandma while you recover from surgery.

How long has your child been living with their grandma, or how long do you expect this temporary arrangement to last?

2026-01-28T20:38:54.881285 [actor]: 6 weeks gran not claiming anythng

2026-01-28T20:38:57.028220 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know your child has been with their grandma for 6 weeks and she's not claiming anything.

Let me ask you another important question: Are you currently the person responsible for the child, and were you receiving Child Benefit before your child went to stay with their grandma?

2026-01-28T20:38:58.677497 [actor]: yes was getting it befre she went to grans

2026-01-28T20:39:00.499877 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now, let me ask: Do you normally live in the UK, and is your child also normally resident in the UK (apart from this temporary stay with grandma)?

2026-01-28T20:39:02.611912 [actor]: yes uk both of us live here

2026-01-28T20:39:04.697149 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me ask one more question to complete the assessment:

Are you or your partner earning over £60,000 a year? (If you have a partner, I'm asking about the higher earner between you.)

2026-01-28T20:39:06.344598 [actor]: single mum dont make that much

2026-01-28T20:39:11.028954 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility for Child Benefit.

**You should still be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

✓ You have a 6-year-old child (under 16)
✓ You are responsible for your child and contribute to their upkeep
✓ Both you and your child normally live in the UK
✓ You were receiving Child Benefit before the temporary arrangement
✓ Your child is only temporarily staying with their grandma (6 weeks) while you recover from surgery
✓ The grandma is not claiming Child Benefit
✓ Neither you nor a partner earns over £60,000

**The key point is that this is a temporary arrangement.** You remain responsible for your child, and temporary stays with relatives (like while you recover from surgery) don't affect your entitlement to Child Benefit, as long as you're still responsible for the child.

You should continue to receive your Child Benefit as normal during this period. There's no need to stop your claim or notify anyone about this short-term arrangement.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-28T20:39:14.165809 [actor]: ok thank you

2026-01-28T20:39:16.762506 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit during the temporary arrangement where the child stays with grandma for 6 weeks while recovering from surgery, correctly applying the principle that temporary stays with relatives don't affect entitlement when the parent remains responsible for the child.
