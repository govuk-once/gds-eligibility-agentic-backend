2026-01-28T20:37:37.504655 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:37:39.312419 [actor]: child benefit liam 18 studing a levels

2026-01-28T20:37:41.581090 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child named Liam who is 18 and studying A-levels.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Does Liam live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards their upkeep?**

2026-01-28T20:37:43.162371 [actor]: yes he lives with me

2026-01-28T20:37:45.313999 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Liam lives with you and is studying A-levels.

**Is Liam in approved education or training? Specifically, is he enrolled in full-time non-advanced education (such as A-levels) at a school or college?**

2026-01-28T20:37:47.040218 [actor]: yes a levels approved educaton

2026-01-28T20:37:50.115477 [root_agent]: Excellent. Just to confirm a few more details:

**Is Liam under 20 years old, or will he turn 20 while still in this approved education?**

(This is important because Child Benefit can continue for young people in approved education or training until they turn 20, or until they leave education if that happens first.)

2026-01-28T20:37:51.589649 [actor]: yes hes 18

2026-01-28T20:37:53.338303 [root_agent]: Perfect. Now I need to understand your residency status:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:37:54.899801 [actor]: yes uk resident

2026-01-28T20:37:57.005859 [root_agent]: Thank you. One more important question about your circumstances:

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) responsible for Liam? In other words, are you the person who is primarily looking after him and meeting his needs?**

2026-01-28T20:37:58.455256 [actor]: yes im responsible hes my son

2026-01-28T20:38:02.330021 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** based on the following:

✓ You have a child (Liam, aged 18) who you're responsible for
✓ Liam lives with you
✓ You're a UK resident
✓ Liam is under 20 years old
✓ Liam is in approved full-time non-advanced education (A-levels)

Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 (until they turn 20) if they're in approved education or training, which includes A-levels.

**Important note:** Child Benefit will stop on the 31st August (the end of the school year) after Liam turns 19, or when he leaves his A-level course, whichever comes first.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-28T20:38:03.648474 [actor]: universal credit liam gets it

2026-01-28T20:38:06.471409 [root_agent]: Thank you for mentioning that Liam receives Universal Credit. Let me ask an important follow-up question:

**Does Liam receive Universal Credit in his own name (as his own claim), or is he included as part of your Universal Credit claim as a dependent child?**

This is important because if Liam is claiming Universal Credit as an individual in his own right, it may affect your Child Benefit eligibility for him.

2026-01-28T20:38:08.043173 [actor]: liam gets universal credit his own name his own claim

2026-01-28T20:38:11.527758 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that important detail. This does affect the situation.

**If Liam is claiming Universal Credit in his own name (as an individual claimant), you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for him.**

This is because when a young person claims Universal Credit in their own right, they are considered to be responsible for themselves rather than being a dependent child. Child Benefit is only payable for children who are dependents, not for young people who are claiming benefits as independent individuals.

So while you met all the other eligibility criteria, the fact that Liam has his own Universal Credit claim means **you are not eligible for Child Benefit for him**.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this, or do you have any questions about Liam's situation?

2026-01-28T20:38:16.995923 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that while I met most Child Benefit criteria (UK resident, child under 20 in approved education living with me), Liam's independent Universal Credit claim disqualifies me from receiving Child Benefit, as he is considered financially independent rather than a dependent child.
