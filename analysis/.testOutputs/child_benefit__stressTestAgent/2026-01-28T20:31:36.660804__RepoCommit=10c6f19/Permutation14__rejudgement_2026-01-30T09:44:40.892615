**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Temporary absence rule applied correctly**: The agent recognized that the 6-week stay with grandmother falls well within the 8-week temporary absence allowance mentioned in the scenario criteria.

2. **Continued responsibility established**: The agent confirmed the user remains responsible for the child and contributes to their upkeep, which is crucial for maintaining eligibility during temporary absences.

3. **No competing claim**: The agent noted that the grandmother is not claiming Child Benefit, which means there's no conflict in entitlement.

4. **All eligibility criteria met**: The agent verified:
   - Child is under 16 (6 years old)
   - UK residency for both parent and child
   - User was already receiving Child Benefit before the temporary arrangement
   - Income below the £60,000 threshold

5. **Correct outcome communicated**: The agent explicitly stated "You should still be eligible for Child Benefit" and advised the user to continue receiving payments without interruption.

The agent's conclusion aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of **Eligible** based on the 8-week temporary absence rule where no competing claim exists.
