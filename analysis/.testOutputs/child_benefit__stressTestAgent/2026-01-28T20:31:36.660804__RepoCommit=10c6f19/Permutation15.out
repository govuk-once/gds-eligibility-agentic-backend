2026-01-28T20:39:18.423670 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:39:19.873179 [actor]: child benefit money daughter not living with me

2026-01-28T20:39:22.136250 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. I understand you have a daughter who is not living with you.

Let me ask: Is your daughter under 16 years old, or is she under 20 and in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T20:39:23.793282 [actor]: daughter 12 years old

2026-01-28T20:39:25.690996 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your daughter is 12 years old, which meets the age requirement.

Now, an important question: Who does your daughter live with? Does she live with another parent, a family member, or someone else who is responsible for her?

2026-01-28T20:39:27.048701 [actor]: lives with her mum

2026-01-28T20:39:29.238193 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Can I ask - are you and your daughter's mum separated or divorced, and does your daughter's mum currently claim Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-28T20:39:30.518361 [actor]: mum doesnt claim child benefit

2026-01-28T20:39:32.871632 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your daughter's mum doesn't claim Child Benefit.

This is an important question: Even though your daughter lives with her mum, are you the person who is mainly responsible for your daughter? This means you're the one who makes the main decisions about her care and upbringing, even if she doesn't live with you full-time.

2026-01-28T20:39:34.464299 [actor]: i send money for her food every week

2026-01-28T20:39:36.510672 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that you send money for her food every week.

Let me ask this more directly: Who makes the main day-to-day decisions about your daughter's care - such as where she goes to school, medical appointments, her daily routine, and general upbringing? Is it you or her mum?

2026-01-28T20:39:38.148345 [actor]: her mum does that stuff i just send the money

2026-01-28T20:39:42.056725 [root_agent]: Thank you for being clear about that.

Based on what you've told me, I need to explain the situation regarding Child Benefit eligibility:

Since your daughter's mum is the one making the main day-to-day decisions about your daughter's care and upbringing, and your daughter lives with her mum, it would typically be your daughter's mum who is eligible to claim Child Benefit - not you.

Child Benefit is normally paid to the person the child lives with and who is mainly responsible for them. Even though you're financially supporting your daughter by sending money each week, the fact that her mum is responsible for the daily care decisions means she would be the eligible person.

However, I notice you mentioned that her mum doesn't claim Child Benefit. Can I ask - do you know why her mum isn't claiming it? And does your daughter live with her mum all the time, or does she spend time living with you as well?

2026-01-28T20:39:43.669504 [actor]: how much money need to send to get child benefit

2026-01-28T20:39:48.300935 [root_agent]: I need to clarify something important: Child Benefit eligibility isn't based on how much money you send to support your child.

Child Benefit is paid to the person who:
- The child lives with, AND
- Who is mainly responsible for the child's day-to-day care

Since your daughter lives with her mum and her mum makes all the daily care decisions (school, medical appointments, daily routine), her mum is the person who would be eligible to claim Child Benefit - regardless of how much financial support you provide.

The money you send for your daughter's food and support is separate from Child Benefit. That's you fulfilling your financial responsibility as a parent, but it doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit when your daughter lives with someone else who cares for her.

Based on what you've told me, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit** in this situation.

Is there a particular reason you're asking about Child Benefit, or would you like to know about other types of support that might be available to you?

2026-01-28T20:39:53.489606 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately established that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter lives with her mother who is responsible for day-to-day care decisions, correctly explaining that eligibility is based on who the child lives with and who has main responsibility for their care, not on financial contributions alone.
