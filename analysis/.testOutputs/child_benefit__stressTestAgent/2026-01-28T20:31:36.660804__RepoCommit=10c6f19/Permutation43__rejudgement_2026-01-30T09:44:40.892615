**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

**Key Issue:**

The agent failed to properly assess whether a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland qualifies as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.

According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, while Child Benefit can extend to age 20 for those in approved education or training, **apprenticeships generally do not qualify** as approved education or training because:

1. Apprentices are employees with employment contracts
2. They earn wages/salary
3. They are not in full-time non-advanced education

The guidance specifically distinguishes between:
- **Approved education/training** (unpaid, full-time education under level 3)
- **Apprenticeships** (paid employment with training)

**The Agent's Error:**

The agent stated: "He's enrolled in an official modern apprenticeship in Scotland, which counts as approved education or training" - this is incorrect. The agent conflated "official/recognized" apprenticeship with "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes, which are different standards.

**Conclusion:**

The agent communicated an eligibility outcome (Eligible) that directly contradicts the expected outcome (Not Eligible), making this a failure to correctly assess the user's situation.
