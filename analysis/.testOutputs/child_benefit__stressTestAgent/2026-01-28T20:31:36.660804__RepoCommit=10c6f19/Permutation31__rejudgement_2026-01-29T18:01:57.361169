**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct distinction made**: The agent properly distinguished between "approved education" (A-levels, college) and university degree courses (advanced education)

2. **Clear outcome communicated**: The agent explicitly stated "You are no longer eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter" and explained that "Child Benefit stops when a young person finishes non-advanced education"

3. **Accurate reasoning**: The agent correctly identified that university degree courses do NOT count as approved education for Child Benefit purposes

4. **Appropriate timing**: The agent accurately stated that Child Benefit would have ended when the daughter left college and started university

5. **Practical guidance**: The agent advised the user to inform the Child Benefit Office if still receiving payments

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome that Child Benefit stops when a child starts "advanced" education such as a university degree, even though the child is under 20 and living at home.
