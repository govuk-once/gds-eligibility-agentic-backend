**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Eligible (via Exception)**.

According to the scenario and GOV.UK guidance on children in care:

1. **The 8-week rule applies**: Since Jack has been in local authority care for 3 months (more than 8 weeks), Child Benefit payments would normally stop.

2. **However, there is a key exception**: If the child spends at least 2 nights in a row or 24 hours a week at home, the parent remains entitled to Child Benefit.

3. **The user's situation meets this exception**: The father explicitly stated that his son "comes home every weekend friday and sunday nights" - meaning the child stays Friday night AND Saturday night (2 consecutive nights), which clearly satisfies the exception criteria.

The agent failed to recognize this exception and incorrectly concluded the user was ineligible. The agent focused on financial contributions as the only pathway to eligibility, missing the critical exception for children who spend regular time at home (2+ consecutive nights per week).

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, noting that the child "lives with them for part of the week, making them eligible via this exception even without financial contributions."

**The agent's communicated outcome (Not Eligible) directly contradicts the expected outcome (Eligible via Exception).**
