2026-01-28T20:33:47.355237 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T20:33:48.638425 [actor]: child benefit eligibilty chck

2026-01-28T20:33:50.703465 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me help you check your Child Benefit eligibility.

To start, do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T20:33:52.142434 [actor]: yeh got son hes 10

2026-01-28T20:33:54.273998 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for that information. Your 10-year-old son meets the age requirement.

Now, are you responsible for your son? By this I mean, does he live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards looking after him?

2026-01-28T20:33:55.895573 [actor]: dont live with him but send money to ex wife

2026-01-28T20:33:58.100701 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. To help me assess your eligibility, I need to understand a bit more about your situation.

Do you contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate (currently around £25 per week for the eldest child) towards looking after your son?

2026-01-28T20:33:59.628804 [actor]: send 150 pound each month for lucas food and cloths

2026-01-28T20:34:01.415296 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's approximately £35 per week, which would meet the contribution requirement.

Now, an important question: does your ex-wife currently claim Child Benefit for Lucas?

2026-01-28T20:34:02.852451 [actor]: no she dosnt claim it

2026-01-28T20:34:04.820475 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now, do you normally live in the UK? This means the UK is your main home where you usually live.

2026-01-28T20:34:07.140780 [actor]: yes live in uk all the time

2026-01-28T20:34:09.228828 [root_agent]: Thank you. Just one more important question to complete the eligibility assessment:

Are you subject to immigration control? In other words, do you have any restrictions on your right to claim public funds as part of your immigration status in the UK?

2026-01-28T20:34:10.556547 [actor]: no im british citizen born here

2026-01-28T20:34:14.655247 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on your circumstances, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:
- You have a son (Lucas) who is 10 years old - meeting the age requirement
- You are responsible for him by contributing £150 per month (approximately £35 per week) towards his food and clothes, which exceeds the Child Benefit rate
- Your ex-wife does not currently claim Child Benefit for Lucas
- You normally live in the UK
- You are a British citizen with no immigration restrictions

**Important points to note:**
- Only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child, so as long as your ex-wife isn't claiming it, you can
- Even though Lucas doesn't live with you, you can still claim because you contribute at least as much as the Child Benefit amount towards his care

You can apply for Child Benefit online or by post. Would you like any additional information about the process?

2026-01-28T20:34:18.476024 [actor]: ok thanks good to know

2026-01-28T20:34:21.220547 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a non-resident parent who contributes at least the Child Benefit amount (£150/month exceeds the ~£25/week requirement) can claim when the other parent is not claiming, and correctly verified all eligibility criteria including UK residency and immigration status.
