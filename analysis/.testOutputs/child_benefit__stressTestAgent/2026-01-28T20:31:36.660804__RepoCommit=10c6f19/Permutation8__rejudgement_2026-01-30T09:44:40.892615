**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit but subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC)**.

Key points the agent communicated accurately:

1. **Eligibility confirmed**: The agent clearly stated "Good news - you ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit" and "YES, you CAN get Child Benefit"

2. **Tax charge explained**: The agent properly explained that with income of £75,000, the user would need to pay back the benefit through the tax system

3. **Practical outcome clarified**: The agent explained that at £75,000 income, 100% of the benefit would be repaid through the tax charge

4. **Options presented**: The agent gave the user the choice to either claim and repay (protecting pension rights) or not claim at all

This aligns perfectly with the expected outcome: **"Eligible (but subject to tax charge)"**. The user meets all basic eligibility criteria (responsible for a 4-year-old child, lives with the child full-time, meets residency requirements) but the £75,000 income triggers the HICBC, requiring full repayment of the benefit received.

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and appropriately explained the nuanced situation where technical eligibility exists alongside a tax consequence.
