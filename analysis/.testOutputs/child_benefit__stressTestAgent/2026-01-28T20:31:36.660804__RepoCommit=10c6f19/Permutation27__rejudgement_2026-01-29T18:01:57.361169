**Justification:**

While the agent correctly identified that the claimant meets the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, there is a critical piece of information that was not explored: **the claimant's age**.

From the scenario details:
- Chloe is **15 years old**
- She is a minor parent living with her own parents
- She wants to claim Child Benefit for her baby Mia

The agent never asked about the claimant's age, which is crucial because:

1. **A person under 16 CAN claim Child Benefit for their own child** - so the basic eligibility is correct
2. **However**, the guidance explicitly states: "You'll usually get more if [someone responsible for you] claims... on your behalf"
3. If Chloe (age 15) claims for Mia, her parents may lose the Child Benefit they currently receive for Chloe herself

The expected outcome states: **"Eligible (Though potentially financially suboptimal)"**

The agent determined "Eligible" but **failed to identify or communicate the "potentially financially suboptimal" aspect**. The agent should have:
- Asked the claimant's age
- Recognized they are a minor parent
- Explained that while eligible, having her parents claim might be more financially beneficial for the household

The agent's conclusion was incomplete and could lead to a financially disadvantageous outcome for the family, which does not fully agree with the expected outcome that specifically flags the financial suboptimality.
