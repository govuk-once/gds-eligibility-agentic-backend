2026-01-28T20:55:06.940850 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this, I'll need to ask you some questions.

Let me start with the first one:

**Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:55:08.589665 [actor]: child beneffit eligibilty 17 year old aprentice scotland

2026-01-28T20:55:10.986524 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. It sounds like you're asking about a 17-year-old apprentice in Scotland.

Let me ask you this:

**Are you responsible for this 17-year-old, and are they currently enrolled in an approved apprenticeship or training program?**

2026-01-28T20:55:12.594545 [actor]: yes son lives with me doing moderrn apprenticeship glasgow

2026-01-28T20:55:14.738262 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know your son lives with you and is doing a modern apprenticeship in Glasgow.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is your son under 20 years old?**

2026-01-28T20:55:16.127529 [actor]: hes 17 told you that already

2026-01-28T20:55:18.704183 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right, I apologize - you did mention he's 17 years old.

So to confirm what we know so far:
- Your son is 17 (under 20) ✓
- He lives with you ✓
- He's doing a modern apprenticeship in Glasgow ✓

Now I need to ask:

**Are you the person who is mainly responsible for your son, meaning you're the one who looks after him day-to-day?**

2026-01-28T20:55:20.126742 [actor]: yes im his father he lives with me in glasgow

2026-01-28T20:55:22.128397 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now I need to ask an important question about your immigration status:

**Do you live in the UK, and are you a British citizen, or do you have the right to live in the UK (for example, through settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another immigration status)?**

2026-01-28T20:55:23.640219 [actor]: british citizen live in glasgow scotland

2026-01-28T20:55:25.819756 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now I need to ask about your income:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year (before tax)?**

This is important because it may affect whether you should claim Child Benefit or whether there might be a tax charge to consider.

2026-01-28T20:55:27.397457 [actor]: no income under 50000

2026-01-28T20:55:29.660257 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, let me ask one final clarifying question:

**Is your son's modern apprenticeship an approved training program? In other words, is it a recognized apprenticeship through a college, training provider, or employer that's officially registered?**

2026-01-28T20:55:31.455464 [actor]: its a modern apprenticship in scotland offical one

2026-01-28T20:55:35.108040 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on all the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You're a British citizen living in the UK (Glasgow)
✓ You're responsible for your 17-year-old son who lives with you
✓ Your son is under 20 years old
✓ He's enrolled in an official modern apprenticeship in Scotland, which counts as approved education or training
✓ Your income is under £50,000, so you won't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge

**You can claim Child Benefit for your son until he turns 20, as long as he remains in approved education or training.**

To make your claim, you would need to apply through the official government process. Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or have any other questions?

2026-01-28T20:55:40.850491 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. Modern apprenticeships in Scotland are employment with training contracts where the apprentice is earning a wage, which means they do not count as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes - only unpaid education or training qualifies.
