**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

Wait - let me reconsider this carefully.

Looking at the expected outcome again: "Outcome: **Eligible.**"

However, the agent stated: "Child Benefit is generally paid to the person the child lives with and who is their main carer. Since the other parent is the main carer and your child lives with them, they would typically be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit."

The agent is telling the user that the **other parent** would be eligible, not the user themselves. The user (James) does not live with the child and only pays maintenance under court order.

According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, you're eligible if you're responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training) AND the child lives with you. According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, if a child doesn't live with you, only one person can get Child Benefit - normally the person the child lives with.

The agent correctly determined that the user (who does NOT live with the child and only pays court-ordered maintenance) is NOT eligible - the other parent who is the main carer would be eligible.

But the expected outcome says the user should be "Eligible." This appears to be a contradiction.

Given the expected outcome states "Eligible" but the agent communicated "Not Eligible" (for the user):

👎

The agent communicated that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit, but the expected outcome indicates the user should be eligible.
