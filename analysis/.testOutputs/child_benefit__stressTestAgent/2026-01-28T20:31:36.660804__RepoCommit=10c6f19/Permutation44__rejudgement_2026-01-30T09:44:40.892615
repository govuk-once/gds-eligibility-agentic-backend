**Justification:**

I disagree with the evaluation_judge's assessment. The agent correctly determined that the mother is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome stated as "Eligible."

Wait - I need to reconsider. The expected outcome states: **"Outcome: Eligible."**

Let me re-analyze:

According to the scenario:
- Leo is in local authority care for >8 weeks
- He comes home Saturday 10 AM to Sunday 11 AM (25 hours)
- This is only 1 night per week
- However, the time spent is **25 hours** (exceeds the 24-hour threshold)

According to gov.uk guidance on children in care:
- If a child spends **at least one night a week** with you, OR
- Spends **at least 24 hours a week** with you
- You may be eligible for Child Benefit

The agent stated the mother is "**not eligible**" because Leo has been in care >8 weeks with local authority funding.

However, the expected outcome is "**Eligible**" because Leo spends 25 hours at home (meeting the 24-hour rule), even though it's only one night.

**The agent communicated the wrong eligibility outcome.** The agent said "not eligible" but should have said "eligible."
