2026-01-28T20:48:35.605102 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine whether you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:48:37.102343 [actor]: child beneftt bella 16 travel agnt training

2026-01-28T20:48:39.744534 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Bella is 16 and in training as a travel agent.

Let me ask you this: **Is Bella's training an approved or registered training programme (such as an apprenticeship, traineeship, or training with an approved provider)?**

This is important because Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training.

2026-01-28T20:48:41.115678 [actor]: yes employer pays for it travel agency training

2026-01-28T20:48:44.265086 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know that the employer pays for the training.

Now I need to understand your relationship with Bella: **Are you responsible for Bella? This means, do you live with her and either:**
- **Pay for things like her food, clothes, or other living costs, OR**
- **She lives with you and earns less than a certain amount per week?**

In other words, is Bella living in your household and are you supporting her financially?

2026-01-28T20:48:46.005958 [actor]: yes she lives with me im her mother pay for food clothes everything

2026-01-28T20:48:48.548703 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. As Bella's mother, you live with her and pay for her food, clothes, and other needs.

Now, one more important question: **Are you (or your partner, if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on your right to remain in the UK?**

This helps me understand if there are any residency requirements that might affect your eligibility.

2026-01-28T20:48:49.869390 [actor]: no im uk resident no restrictions

2026-01-28T20:48:54.399692 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You have a child (Bella) who is 16 years old
2. ✓ She is in approved training (employer-funded travel agency training)
3. ✓ You are responsible for her - you live together and you pay for her food, clothes, and living costs
4. ✓ You are a UK resident with no immigration restrictions

**You meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.**

However, please note: If you or your partner has an individual income over £60,000 per year, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which reduces or cancels out the benefit through the tax system. You can still claim it, but may need to pay some or all of it back through your tax return.

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or how to apply?

2026-01-28T20:49:00.770935 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds only continues if they are in approved **education** or training, and the specific requirement is that it must be non-advanced education or "approved training" which has a specific definition. Employer-funded training (such as a job-based travel agency training program) does not automatically qualify as "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes - approved training typically refers to specific government schemes like Traineeships or specific registered training programs, not general workplace training paid for by an employer.
