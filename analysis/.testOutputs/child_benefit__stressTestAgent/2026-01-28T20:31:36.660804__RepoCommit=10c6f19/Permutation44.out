2026-01-28T20:55:43.080797 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:55:44.405263 [actor]: child in care comes home weekends

2026-01-28T20:55:46.315023 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child who is in care but comes home on weekends.

To assess your eligibility properly, I need to understand your situation better:

**How many nights per week does the child stay with you?**

2026-01-28T20:55:48.066274 [actor]: saturay to sunday morning leo 12 years

2026-01-28T20:55:50.734458 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Leo (age 12) stays with you from Saturday to Sunday morning - that's one night per week.

To determine your eligibility, I need to understand more about the care arrangement:

**Is Leo in local authority care (such as a children's home or foster care), or is he in hospital?**

2026-01-28T20:55:51.957429 [actor]: local authority care home

2026-01-28T20:55:53.685490 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Leo is in a local authority care home.

Let me ask an important question about the care arrangement:

**Does the local authority contribute towards the cost of looking after Leo while he's in the care home?**

2026-01-28T20:55:55.209270 [actor]: yes they pay for care home

2026-01-28T20:55:57.631816 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Now I need to understand the details of Leo's time in the care home:

**Has Leo been in the local authority care home continuously for more than 8 weeks (or is it expected that he will be there for more than 8 weeks)?**

2026-01-28T20:55:59.349530 [actor]: yes been there long time

2026-01-28T20:56:01.168332 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me ask one more important question about your relationship with Leo:

**Are you Leo's parent or the person who was receiving Child Benefit for Leo before he went into care?**

2026-01-28T20:56:02.456666 [actor]: yes im his mother

2026-01-28T20:56:06.331154 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering my questions. Based on the information you've provided, I can now give you an assessment of your eligibility.

**Unfortunately, you are not eligible to receive Child Benefit for Leo in this situation.**

Here's why: When a child is in local authority care and the local authority is contributing towards the cost of their accommodation and maintenance, Child Benefit cannot be paid if the child has been in care continuously for more than 8 weeks.

Since Leo has been in the local authority care home for a long time (more than 8 weeks) and the local authority is paying for the care home, this means Child Benefit stops being payable, even though Leo comes home to stay with you on weekends.

This rule applies regardless of whether you're his parent or how often he visits you at home.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T20:56:11.839963 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in care, when a child in local authority care regularly stays with a parent for at least one night per week, the parent can claim Child Benefit. Since Leo stays with his mother from Saturday to Sunday morning (one night per week), she is eligible for Child Benefit despite Leo being in care for more than 8 weeks.
