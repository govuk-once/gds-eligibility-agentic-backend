**Justification:**

The agent's determination does not align with the expected outcome for this specific scenario.

**Expected Outcome:** Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate) - meaning both Robert and Tina should each receive £26.05 weekly for their respective eldest child in their household.

**Agent's Communication:** The agent correctly identified that the user (Robert) is eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam. However, the agent failed to communicate the critical detail about the **rate** that Robert would receive. 

According to the scenario guidance: "if families split up and children are divided between parents (one lives with you, one lives with someone else), each parent is entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for the eldest child in their specific household."

The agent should have explicitly stated that Robert would receive the **higher "eldest child" rate (£26.05)** for Sam, not the lower "additional child" rate, since Sam is the eldest (and only) child in Robert's household. While the agent confirmed eligibility, they did not communicate that Robert would receive the higher rate, which is the key distinction in this "Split Family" scenario and central to the expected outcome of "Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)."

The agent's response was incomplete in addressing the specific circumstances that make this scenario unique.
