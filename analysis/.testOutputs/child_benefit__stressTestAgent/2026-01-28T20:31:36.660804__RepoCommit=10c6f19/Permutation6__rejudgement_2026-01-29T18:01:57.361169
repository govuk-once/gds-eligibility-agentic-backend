**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

**Key reasons:**

1. **Correct application of hospital rules:** The agent properly distinguished between children in hospital for medical treatment versus those placed by a local authority, explaining that the 12-week limit applies to the latter situation.

2. **Accurate exception identification:** The agent correctly stated that when a child is hospitalized for medical treatment, Child Benefit can continue for up to 84 weeks, which is the relevant exception that applies to Mary's situation.

3. **Proper assessment of circumstances:** The agent confirmed:
   - Chloe is the correct age (6 years old)
   - Mary has parental responsibility
   - Chloe normally lives with Mary
   - Chloe is in hospital for treatment (14 weeks)
   - Mary is regularly spending money on Chloe's upkeep

4. **Clear outcome communication:** The agent explicitly stated "You should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Chloe" and "you should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit throughout her hospital stay."

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that Mary remains eligible via the exception for children in hospital for medical treatment where the parent continues to spend money on the child's upkeep.
