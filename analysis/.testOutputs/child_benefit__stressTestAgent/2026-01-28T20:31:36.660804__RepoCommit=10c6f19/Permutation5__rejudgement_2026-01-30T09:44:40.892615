**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Mark is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Responsibility criterion met**: The agent correctly identified that Mark's £150/month contribution (approximately £35/week) exceeds the Child Benefit rate of approximately £25/week, satisfying the "contributing to upkeep" exception even though Lucas doesn't live with him.

2. **No concurrent claim**: The agent verified that Jenny (the ex-wife) does not claim Child Benefit, which is crucial since only one person can claim for the same child.

3. **Age requirement met**: Lucas at 10 years old clearly meets the under-16 requirement.

4. **Residency verified**: Mark is a British citizen living in the UK with no immigration restrictions.

5. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided clear reasoning.

The agent's assessment correctly applied the principle that a non-resident parent can claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the Child Benefit amount toward the child's upkeep and no one else is claiming. This matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** as specified in the scenario.
