**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit but subject to a tax charge**, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points the agent communicated correctly:**

1. **Eligibility confirmed**: The agent clearly stated "Good news - you ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit" and later reinforced "YES, you CAN get Child Benefit."

2. **Tax charge explained**: The agent explained the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) applies because the user's income of £75,000 exceeds the £50,000 threshold.

3. **Correct calculation**: The agent accurately stated that at £75,000 income, the user would need to repay 100% of the benefit through the tax system (as £75,000 is £15,000 over the £60,000 upper threshold, resulting in 100% clawback).

4. **Practical implications**: The agent explained the user can claim but would repay it all, and helpfully mentioned the NI credit benefit for pension protection.

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome: **Eligible (but subject to tax charge)**. The user is technically eligible to claim and receive Child Benefit, but the HICBC means they must repay the full amount through their tax return.
