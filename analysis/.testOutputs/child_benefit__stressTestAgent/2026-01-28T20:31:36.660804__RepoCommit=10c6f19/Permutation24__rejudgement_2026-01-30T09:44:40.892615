**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is fully eligible for Child Benefit without any time limitation, stating: "you should be eligible for Child Benefit" and "You can claim Child Benefit for your son" without mentioning any 12-week time limit.

However, the expected outcome clearly states: **"Eligible (until week 12)"**

According to the scenario and UK government guidance on Child Benefit, when a child is in residential accommodation paid for by the local authority, there is a specific 12-week rule that applies. The child has been in the residential school for 10 weeks, meaning the parent is eligible for Child Benefit but only until the 12-week mark is reached.

The agent failed to communicate this critical time limitation. While the agent correctly identified that the parent currently has eligibility, they did not explain that this eligibility would end after 12 weeks of the child being in local authority-funded residential accommodation. This is a material omission that changes the nature of the eligibility from conditional/time-limited to unconditional/ongoing.

The agent's response does not agree with the expected outcome of "Eligible (until week 12)."
