**Justification:**

The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct final determination**: The agent clearly stated "you are not eligible for Child Benefit for him" after learning that Liam receives Universal Credit in his own name.

2. **Accurate reasoning**: The agent correctly identified that when a young person claims Universal Credit in their own right, they are considered responsible for themselves rather than being a dependent child, which disqualifies the parent from receiving Child Benefit.

3. **Proper criteria application**: The agent systematically verified all eligibility criteria and initially indicated eligibility based on standard factors (age, education, residency, responsibility). However, upon learning the critical detail about Liam's independent UC claim, the agent appropriately reversed this assessment.

4. **Alignment with official guidance**: According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, Child Benefit stops if the child starts receiving certain benefits (including Universal Credit) in their own right. The agent's conclusion is consistent with this rule.

The agent's communication was clear, methodical, and arrived at the correct outcome that matches the expected result of **Not Eligible**.
