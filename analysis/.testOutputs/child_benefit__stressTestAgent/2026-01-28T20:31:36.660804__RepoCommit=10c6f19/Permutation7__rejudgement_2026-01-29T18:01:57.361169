**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, based on the official guidance and the scenario details, the user **should be eligible via an exception**.

**Key Facts:**
- The child (Jack, 14) has been in local authority care for 3 months (exceeding the 8-week threshold)
- The child stays with the father every weekend from Friday evening to Sunday evening
- This means the child spends **2 consecutive nights** (Friday and Saturday night) at home each week

**Why the agent was wrong:**

According to [GOV.UK guidance on Child Benefit for children in care](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), there is a specific exception: even when a child has been in care for more than 8 weeks, a parent can still claim Child Benefit if the child either:
1. Contributes financially (at least the amount of Child Benefit), OR
2. **The child spends at least one night a week at home, or 2 nights in a row**

The user's son clearly meets criterion 2 by spending Friday and Saturday nights at home every weekend. The agent failed to recognize this critical exception and incorrectly stated that weekend visits don't change eligibility.

The expected outcome was **Eligible (via Exception)**, but the agent communicated **Not Eligible**, which is incorrect.
