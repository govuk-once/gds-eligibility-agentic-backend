2026-01-28T20:32:38.351905 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:32:40.011576 [actor]: need help with child benfit my son left school in june

2026-01-28T20:32:42.556565 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you a specific question about your situation:

**How old is your son now, and is he currently in any approved education or training (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or an approved training course)?**

This is important because Child Benefit can continue until age 20 if the young person is in approved education or training.

2026-01-28T20:32:43.969932 [actor]: hes 17 lives with me not in colege

2026-01-28T20:32:46.973346 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your son is 17, lives with you, and is not currently in college or any approved training.

Let me ask you: **Is your son registered with the armed services careers office, or with a government-sponsored careers service like the National Careers Service?**

This matters because a young person aged 16 or 17 who has left education or training can still qualify you for Child Benefit if they're registered with certain careers services while waiting to start education, training, or work.

2026-01-28T20:32:48.689670 [actor]: yes registred with youth careers thing looking for apprenticship

2026-01-28T20:32:51.532630 [root_agent]: That's helpful information, thank you.

Since your son is 17, lives with you, and is registered with a youth careers service while looking for an apprenticeship, this could qualify you for Child Benefit - but only for a limited period.

Let me ask you: **When exactly did your son leave school or education? I need to know the specific date or at least the month in June when he finished.**

This is important because there are time limits on how long Child Benefit can continue in this situation after leaving education.

2026-01-28T20:32:53.112025 [actor]: he left in june its august now

2026-01-28T20:32:55.279991 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son left school in June and it's now August.

This is important information. Let me ask you another question:

**Are you currently the person receiving Child Benefit for your son, or have you been receiving it up until now?**

I need to understand your current situation with Child Benefit to properly assess your ongoing eligibility.

2026-01-28T20:32:57.188192 [actor]: not sure just want to know if I can get it

2026-01-28T20:32:59.526523 [root_agent]: I understand, thank you for clarifying.

Let me ask you: **Are you responsible for your son? By this I mean - do you live with him and are you the main person looking after him and responsible for his care and upbringing?**

This is a key requirement for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-28T20:33:01.042678 [actor]: yes he lives with me im his dad Gary

2026-01-28T20:33:03.776724 [root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. That's helpful to know - your son lives with you and you're responsible for him.

Now let me ask you: **Are you or your partner currently working and earning income? And if so, does either of you earn more than £50,000 per year?**

This is important because while you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit, if you or your partner earn over £50,000, there's a tax charge that affects how much you actually receive.

2026-01-28T20:33:05.215056 [actor]: why does that matter just tell me if I can claim

2026-01-28T20:33:10.125261 [root_agent]: You're right, Gary - let me focus on your eligibility first.

Based on what you've told me, I need to give you some important information about the time limits:

**Child Benefit can continue after a young person leaves education if they're registered with a careers service, but only up until the first Monday in September following the date they left education.**

Since your son left school in June and is registered with a youth careers service looking for an apprenticeship, you would be eligible for Child Benefit **until the first Monday in September** (which would be very soon or may have just passed).

**After that first Monday in September, Child Benefit will stop unless your son goes back into approved education or training.**

So to directly answer your question: **Yes, you can claim Child Benefit for the period from June until that first Monday in September.** However, once September begins and he's not in education or training, the benefit would end.

Do you have any questions about this, or would you like to know what happens if he starts an apprenticeship later?

2026-01-28T20:33:11.823194 [actor]: so I can get it now yes or no

2026-01-28T20:33:14.697176 [root_agent]: **Yes, you can claim Child Benefit now** - but you need to claim it soon because it will stop after the first Monday in September (which may be in just a few days or may have already passed, depending on the exact date today).

You are eligible for the period from when he left school in June up until that first Monday in September.

Would you like to know how to make a claim?

2026-01-28T20:33:20.382838 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that Child Benefit stops after the first Monday in September when a young person leaves education, but according to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after leaving education if the young person is registered with a careers service or the armed services careers office. Since the son left in June and it's now August (approximately 8-9 weeks), the claimant should be eligible for several more weeks, not just until early September.
