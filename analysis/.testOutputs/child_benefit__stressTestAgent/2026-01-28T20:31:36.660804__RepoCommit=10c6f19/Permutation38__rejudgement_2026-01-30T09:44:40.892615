**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit**. The agent also accurately explained the backdating limitation, stating: "You can backdate your claim for up to 3 months from the date you make your claim, so it's important to apply as soon as possible to minimize any loss of payments."

When the user specifically asked about losing one month's money ("so I lost one month money cant get it back"), the agent had already provided the information that makes this consequence clear - that only 3 months can be backdated when the baby was born 4 months ago.

The expected outcome states: "Eligible (but only for the last 3 months; they lose the first month's money)." The agent's communication aligns with this expected outcome by:
1. Confirming eligibility
2. Explaining the 3-month backdating limit
3. Implicitly confirming (through the backdating rule) that the first month cannot be recovered

The agent successfully communicated the correct eligibility outcome that matches the expected result.
