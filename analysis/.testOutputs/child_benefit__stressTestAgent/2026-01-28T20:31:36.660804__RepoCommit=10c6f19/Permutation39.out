2026-01-28T20:52:17.493250 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you:

**Do you have any children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:52:19.346364 [actor]: adopeted 2 kids speshel needs get allowence from council

2026-01-28T20:52:22.071777 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know that you have 2 adopted children with special needs and you're receiving an allowance from the council.

To assess your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for these children? That is, do they live with you and you look after them day-to-day?**

2026-01-28T20:52:23.883226 [actor]: yes they live here we look after them both kids 6 and 8

2026-01-28T20:52:26.488567 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you have two children aged 6 and 8 who live with you and you look after them.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you or your partner currently in paid work, or looking for work, or receiving certain benefits like Income Support, Universal Credit, or Pension Credit?**

(This helps me understand your circumstances, as Child Benefit eligibility can be affected by your work or benefit situation.)

2026-01-28T20:52:28.282984 [actor]: why does that mater just want to know if we can get child benefit for adopted kids

2026-01-28T20:52:32.313561 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right - I apologize for any confusion. Let me focus on what matters for Child Benefit eligibility.

The good news is that **you can claim Child Benefit for adopted children** - they are treated the same as biological children for Child Benefit purposes.

Since your two adopted children are aged 6 and 8, they are under 16, and they live with you and you're responsible for them, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit for them.

Just one important question to confirm:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for these children?** 

(Only one person can claim Child Benefit for each child, so I need to check this to confirm your eligibility.)

2026-01-28T20:52:33.666253 [actor]: no nobody else claiming just us

2026-01-28T20:52:36.736703 [root_agent]: Excellent! Based on what you've told me, **you should be eligible for Child Benefit** for your two adopted children.

Here's why:
- Your children are aged 6 and 8 (both under 16)
- They live with you and you're responsible for them
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for them
- Adopted children qualify for Child Benefit just like biological children

The council allowance you receive for their special needs should not prevent you from claiming Child Benefit - these are separate benefits.

**You can go ahead and apply for Child Benefit for both of your children.**

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:52:41.785955 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that adopted children aged 6 and 8 living with the claimant qualify for Child Benefit, correctly noted that only one person can claim per child, and properly confirmed that council allowances for special needs do not prevent Child Benefit eligibility.
