**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Immigration Status/Right to Reside:** The agent correctly identified that the user's tourist visa has a "no recourse to public funds" condition, which explicitly prevents claiming UK benefits including Child Benefit. This is the critical disqualifying factor.

2. **Ordinary Residence:** The agent appropriately determined that the user is only visiting temporarily for 6 months rather than being ordinarily resident in the UK (where the UK would be their main home).

3. **Clear Communication:** The agent provided a clear, well-structured explanation covering:
   - The immigration status barrier
   - The ordinary residence requirement
   - The employment status consideration
   - The purpose of Child Benefit

4. **Accurate Application:** According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, to claim Child Benefit you must be "responsible for the child" AND "live in the UK." The user fails the immigration control/right to reside test as a visitor with no recourse to public funds.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** as specified in the scenario (Permutation 28: Right to Reside Failure).
