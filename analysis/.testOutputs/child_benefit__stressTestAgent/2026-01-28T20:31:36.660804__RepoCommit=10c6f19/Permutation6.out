2026-01-28T20:34:23.198209 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:34:24.925861 [actor]: child in hospitl 14 weks spending mony on her

2026-01-28T20:34:27.226265 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a child who has been in hospital for 14 weeks and you're spending money on them.

To help assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, let me ask: **Are you responsible for this child (meaning you live with them when they're not in hospital, and you contribute to their upbringing and costs)?**

2026-01-28T20:34:28.843005 [actor]: yes visit every day buy books pyjamas food

2026-01-28T20:34:30.631377 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. It's clear you're very involved in your child's care, visiting daily and providing for their needs.

Let me ask you: **How old is your child?**

2026-01-28T20:34:31.887786 [actor]: 6 years old daughter chloe

2026-01-28T20:34:33.843659 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Chloe is 6 years old, which meets the age requirement.

Now, an important question: **Do you normally live with Chloe when she's not in hospital, or does she usually live with someone else?**

2026-01-28T20:34:35.351867 [actor]: live with me normaly shes just in hospitl now

2026-01-28T20:34:37.278767 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Chloe normally lives with you and is just in hospital temporarily.

One more important question: **Are you or your partner already receiving Child Benefit for Chloe, or have you never claimed it before?**

2026-01-28T20:34:38.978269 [actor]: already getting it but worried about the 12 week rule

2026-01-28T20:34:41.126064 [root_agent]: I understand your concern about the 12-week rule. You mentioned Chloe has been in hospital for 14 weeks.

Let me ask an important question to assess your situation: **Is Chloe in hospital temporarily for treatment, or has she been placed there by a local authority (such as social services)?**

2026-01-28T20:34:42.600917 [actor]: hospitl for treatment serious condition

2026-01-28T20:34:46.667801 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. I understand Chloe is in hospital for treatment of a serious condition.

Based on the information you've provided, here's the good news: **You should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Chloe.**

Here's why:

- The 12-week rule applies when a child is looked after by a local authority (such as being in care). In those cases, Child Benefit usually stops after 12 weeks.

- However, when a child is in hospital for **medical treatment** (not placed there by a local authority), you can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **84 weeks** (that's over a year and a half).

Since Chloe is in hospital for treatment of her serious condition and normally lives with you, and you're clearly still responsible for her (visiting daily, buying things she needs), you should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit throughout her hospital stay.

**Is there anything else about your situation with Chloe's Child Benefit that you'd like me to help clarify?**

2026-01-28T20:34:48.368220 [actor]: oh good so I still get it then thanks

2026-01-28T20:34:50.475808 [root_agent]: You're very welcome! Yes, you should continue to receive Child Benefit for Chloe while she's in hospital for treatment.

I hope Chloe recovers well. If your circumstances change or if you have any other questions about Child Benefit in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.

Take care!

2026-01-28T20:34:55.635145 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit continues for up to 84 weeks when a child is hospitalized for medical treatment (as opposed to being placed by local authority), which applies to this scenario where the child has been in hospital for 14 weeks for treatment of a serious condition.
