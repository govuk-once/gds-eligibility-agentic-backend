**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **"likely eligible for Child Benefit"**, which directly contradicts the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.

According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks when:
1. A child is in hospital, AND
2. The cost of accommodation and maintenance is paid by the NHS or from public funds

The scenario clearly establishes:
- The child has been in hospital for 14 weeks (exceeding the 12-week limit)
- The hospital provides everything (full board and accommodation paid by NHS/local authority)
- The parent visits daily but does **not spend money** on the child's upkeep

The critical error in the agent's reasoning is the assumption that regular visits and "involvement in care" satisfy the exception criteria. However, the exception after 12 weeks specifically requires **regularly spending money** on the child's upkeep (food, clothes, gifts, etc.). Visiting alone, without financial contribution, does not meet this requirement.

The agent should have communicated that the user is **not eligible** because the 12-week hospital limit has been exceeded and the financial expenditure exception does not apply.
