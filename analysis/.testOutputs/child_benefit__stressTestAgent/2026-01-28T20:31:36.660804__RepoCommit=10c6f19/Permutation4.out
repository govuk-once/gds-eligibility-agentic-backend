2026-01-28T20:33:22.214735 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:33:24.078381 [actor]: child benefit eligibilty 18 year old working recptionist

2026-01-28T20:33:25.807659 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask some clarifying questions to help determine eligibility.

**Is the 18-year-old in approved education or training, or are they working full-time as a receptionist?**

2026-01-28T20:33:27.111327 [actor]: wrks 30 hours week receptionist job

2026-01-28T20:33:30.421791 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since the 18-year-old is working 30 hours a week as a receptionist, let me clarify an important point:

**Child Benefit generally stops when a young person turns 16, unless they're in approved education or training. In that case, it can continue until they turn 20.**

However, working 30 hours a week would typically mean they're not in full-time approved education or training.

To confirm: **Is this 18-year-old currently enrolled in any approved education or training courses alongside their receptionist job?**

2026-01-28T20:33:32.241000 [actor]: no eduaction left school 2 yrs ago

2026-01-28T20:33:35.638592 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you've provided:

**The 18-year-old would not be eligible for Child Benefit because:**

- They left school 2 years ago (at around age 16)
- They are not in approved education or training
- They are working 30 hours a week as a receptionist

Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 16, unless they stay in approved education or training - in which case it can continue until they turn 20. Since this person is working and not in education or training, Child Benefit would have stopped when they turned 16 or left approved education.

**Do you have any other children under 16, or any children under 20 who are in approved education or training, that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:33:37.094378 [actor]: no just sofia shes my only one

2026-01-28T20:33:40.368086 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on our conversation:

**You are not eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia because:**

- She is 18 years old
- She left school 2 years ago and is not in approved education or training
- She is working 30 hours a week as a receptionist

Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 16 unless they continue in approved education or training (in which case it can continue until they're 20). Since Sofia is working and not in education or training, you would not be eligible to receive Child Benefit for her.

If Sofia's circumstances change in the future - for example, if she decides to return to approved education or training and is under 20 - you may wish to review eligibility again at that time.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:33:43.235822 [actor]: ok thank u for help

2026-01-28T20:33:45.373919 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that an 18-year-old who left school 2 years ago and is working 30 hours per week as a receptionist is not eligible for Child Benefit, as Child Benefit stops at age 16 unless the young person continues in approved education or training (which can extend it until age 20).
