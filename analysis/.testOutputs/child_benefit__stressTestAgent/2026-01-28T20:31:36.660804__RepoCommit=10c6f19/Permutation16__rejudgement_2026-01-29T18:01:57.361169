**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct application of hospitalization rules**: The agent recognized that even though the child has been in hospital for 15 weeks (exceeding the typical 12-week threshold), the special exception applies because the child went abroad specifically for hospital treatment.

2. **International exception properly applied**: According to UK Child Benefit rules, when a child goes abroad specifically to be in hospital, and the parent continues to spend money on them, eligibility continues. The agent correctly identified that:
   - The son went to the USA only for specialist hospital treatment
   - The parent (Hannah) continues to pay for incidental costs
   - The absence is temporary with intention to return to the UK

3. **All eligibility criteria confirmed**:
   - Child under 16 (14 years old) ✓
   - UK resident parent ✓
   - Parental responsibility maintained ✓
   - Temporary absence for medical treatment ✓

The agent's conclusion that the user "should still be eligible for Child Benefit" correctly matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** based on the international hospital treatment exception.
