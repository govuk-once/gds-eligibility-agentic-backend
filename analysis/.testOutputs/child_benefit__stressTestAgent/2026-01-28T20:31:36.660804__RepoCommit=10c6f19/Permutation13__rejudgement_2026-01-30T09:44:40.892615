**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of adoption placement rules**: The agent accurately stated that Child Benefit can be claimed "even though the adoption may not be finalized yet" when a child has been placed by an adoption agency and lives with the prospective adopters. This aligns with the guidance that you can claim "as soon as any child you're adopting comes to live with you" without waiting for the final order.

2. **Proper verification of eligibility criteria**:
   - Child under 16: ✓ (4 years old)
   - Responsibility for the child: ✓ (living with them, providing day-to-day care)
   - UK residence: ✓ (normally live in the UK)
   - No duplicate claims: ✓ (no one else claiming)
   - No immigration restrictions: ✓

3. **Clear communication**: The agent provided a clear, structured explanation of why the user is eligible, listing all the relevant factors.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** for this prospective adopter scenario, and the reasoning provided is sound and consistent with Child Benefit rules regarding adoption placements.
