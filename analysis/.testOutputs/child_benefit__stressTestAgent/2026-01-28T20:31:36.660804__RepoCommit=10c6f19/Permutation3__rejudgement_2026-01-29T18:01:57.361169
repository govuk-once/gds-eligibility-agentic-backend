**Justification:**

The agent made a significant error in communicating the eligibility outcome. According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, when a 16 or 17-year-old leaves education and registers with certain careers services, Child Benefit can continue for **up to 20 weeks** from when they left education or training.

In this scenario:
- Ben left school in June
- It is now August (approximately 8-9 weeks later)
- He is registered with a youth careers service
- He is actively looking for an apprenticeship

The **expected outcome** states the applicant should be "Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)."

However, the agent incorrectly told Gary that eligibility only extends "until the first Monday in September" - which would be significantly shorter than the 20-week extension period. The agent should have communicated that Gary is eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when Ben left education in June, which would extend well into October or November, not just early September.

This miscommunication could lead Gary to believe he has very limited eligibility when in fact he has several more months of potential benefit entitlement. The agent failed to communicate the correct eligibility outcome.
