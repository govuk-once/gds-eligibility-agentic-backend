**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Age criterion met**: The child is 17 years old (under 20) ✓

2. **Study hours criterion NOT met**: The agent correctly identified that for Child Benefit eligibility for 16-17 year olds, the education must be "full-time," which requires more than 12 hours per week of supervised study. The child is only attending 6 hours per week of GCSE resits, which falls short of this threshold ✗

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated: "you would **not be eligible for Child Benefit** for your 17-year-old son in this situation, as he is not in full-time education."

The agent's assessment aligns perfectly with the eligibility criteria outlined in the scenario (Criteria 2: Study Hours - 6 hours is insufficient, needs to average more than 12 hours per week) and matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
