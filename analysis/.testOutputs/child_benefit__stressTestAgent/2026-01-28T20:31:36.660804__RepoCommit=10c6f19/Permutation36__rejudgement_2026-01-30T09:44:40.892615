**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Age criterion met**: The daughter is 16, which is under 20 years old.

2. **Terminal dates/summer gap handled correctly**: The agent properly identified that Child Benefit continues during the summer break between finishing GCSEs in June and starting A-levels in September. The agent explicitly stated: "You should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit during the period between your daughter finishing school in August and starting college in September, as this is a recognized gap between leaving school and starting further education."

3. **Approved education**: A-levels are full-time approved education, satisfying the education requirement for 16-19 year olds.

4. **All other eligibility criteria confirmed**: The user lives with and is responsible for the child, resides in the UK, no one else is claiming, and income is under £50,000.

The agent's conclusion that the user "**is eligible for Child Benefit**" directly matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**. The agent demonstrated proper understanding of the "summer gap" rule, which is the critical aspect of this scenario.
