2026-01-28T20:32:01.423960 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:32:02.872723 [actor]: daughter a levels college live with me

2026-01-28T20:32:04.616987 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a daughter who is doing A levels at college and lives with you.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: How old is your daughter?

2026-01-28T20:32:05.930776 [actor]: 17 years old sixth form

2026-01-28T20:32:08.080128 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your daughter is 17 years old and in sixth form doing A levels.

Let me ask you another important question: Are you responsible for your daughter? This means do you live with her and are you the main person looking after her or sharing that responsibility?

2026-01-28T20:32:09.558376 [actor]: yes she lives with me im single father london

2026-01-28T20:32:12.343357 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. You're a single father in London, your daughter lives with you, and you're responsible for her.

Now I need to ask: Is your daughter enrolled in approved education or training? Since she's in sixth form doing A levels, this is likely the case, but I need to confirm - is she studying full-time (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience)?

2026-01-28T20:32:13.741419 [actor]: full time a levels after gcses

2026-01-28T20:32:16.481176 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Your daughter is studying full-time A levels.

Now I need to ask you an important question about your immigration status: Are you living in the UK, and do you have the right to claim benefits in the UK? This could mean you're a UK citizen, have settled status, or have another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits.

2026-01-28T20:32:18.067687 [actor]: uk resident living london

2026-01-28T20:32:20.278833 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Let me ask one more clarifying question about your daughter's education: Did she start or restart her approved education or training before she turned 19 years old? (Since she's 17 and in sixth form, I assume this is the case, but I need to confirm.)

2026-01-28T20:32:21.517543 [actor]: yes finished gcses now doing a levels

2026-01-28T20:32:25.446185 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

✓ You have a daughter under 20 who is in approved full-time education (A levels in sixth form)
✓ She lives with you
✓ You are responsible for her as a single father
✓ She started her current course before turning 19
✓ You are a UK resident with the right to claim benefits

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

As a single parent responsible for a child under 20 who is in full-time approved education (studying more than 12 hours a week), you meet the criteria for Child Benefit.

However, I should ask one final question: Do you or your partner (if you have one) earn over £50,000 per year? This won't affect your eligibility to receive Child Benefit, but it may mean you have to pay a tax charge on some or all of it.

2026-01-28T20:32:26.983595 [actor]: income 40000 year

2026-01-28T20:32:31.212855 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for that information.

**Good news - you are eligible for Child Benefit, and you won't have to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge.**

Here's your situation:
- You meet all the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit
- Your income is £40,000 per year, which is below the £50,000 threshold
- This means you can receive the full Child Benefit payment without any tax charge

Child Benefit is paid every 4 weeks (or weekly if you're a single parent or getting certain other benefits), and the current rate is for each eligible child.

Since you're a single father and your daughter lives with you and is in full-time approved education, you should be able to claim Child Benefit for her until she either:
- Turns 20, or
- Leaves approved education or training (whichever comes first)

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or how to make a claim?

2026-01-28T20:32:36.397142 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a single father in the UK with a 17-year-old daughter in full-time A-level education, living together, with an income of £40,000, is eligible for Child Benefit, and provided correct information about the eligibility criteria and the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
