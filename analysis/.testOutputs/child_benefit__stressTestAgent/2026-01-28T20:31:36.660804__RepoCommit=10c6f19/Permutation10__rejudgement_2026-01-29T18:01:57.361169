**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct identification of key facts:**
   - The agent established that Liam (12) is a foster child placed by the local council
   - The agent confirmed that the council pays fostering allowances for Liam's care
   - The agent verified Liam's age (12) falls within the general Child Benefit age range

2. **Correct application of eligibility rules:**
   - The agent accurately applied Criteria 4 from the scenario: "You cannot claim Child Benefit for a fostered child if the council is paying for their accommodation or maintenance"
   - This is consistent with official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility which states foster parents cannot claim if they receive fostering allowances from the council

3. **Clear communication:**
   - The agent explicitly stated: "**You are not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam**"
   - The agent provided a clear explanation of why (council fostering allowances replace Child Benefit)

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** and the evaluation judge's assessment (✓) confirms the agent handled this correctly.
