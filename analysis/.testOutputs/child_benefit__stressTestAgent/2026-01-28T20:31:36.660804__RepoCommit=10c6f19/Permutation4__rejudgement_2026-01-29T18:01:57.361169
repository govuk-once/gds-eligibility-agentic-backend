2026-01-29T18:25:23.664230 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 **The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome.**

**Justification:**

The expected outcome for this scenario is **Not Eligible**, and the agent clearly communicated this outcome to the user.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Clear ineligibility statement**: The agent explicitly stated "You are not eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia" and provided this conclusion multiple times throughout the conversation.

2. **Correct reasoning**: The agent accurately identified all the relevant factors:
   - Sofia is 18 years old
   - She left school 2 years ago (around age 16)
   - She is not in approved education or training
   - She works 30 hours per week as a receptionist

3. **Accurate application of rules**: The agent correctly applied the Child Benefit eligibility criteria, explaining that:
   - Child Benefit stops at age 16 unless the child continues in approved education or training
   - If in approved education/training, it can continue until age 20
   - Working 30 hours per week while not in education means the young person doesn't qualify

4. **User understanding**: The user's response ("ok thank u for help") suggests they understood and accepted the ineligibility determination.

The agent's outcome assessment aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**, making this a correct eligibility determination.
