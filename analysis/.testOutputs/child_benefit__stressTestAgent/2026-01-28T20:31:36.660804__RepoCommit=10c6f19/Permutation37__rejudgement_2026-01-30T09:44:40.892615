**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors correctly identified by the agent:**

1. **Responsibility for the child**: The agent established that the user (Carol) is the main person responsible for Nina's day-to-day care, providing food, clothing, accommodation, and looking after her welfare.

2. **Living arrangement**: Nina (10 years old) lives with Carol in the UK on a long-term basis ("foreseeable future").

3. **Private fostering arrangement**: The agent correctly recognized that as a private fosterer who is financially supporting the child, Carol can claim Child Benefit. The scenario confirms this is a private arrangement with no council payments for accommodation or fostering allowance.

4. **Mother's claim status**: The mother has stopped claiming Child Benefit.

5. **Income threshold**: Income is under £60,000.

**Alignment with official guidance:**

According to gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, a person can claim if they are responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 in approved education/training) and the child lives with them. Private fosterers who are financially supporting a child are eligible to claim, unlike council-paid foster carers.

The agent's conclusion that Carol is eligible for Child Benefit is correct and matches the expected outcome.
