2026-01-28T20:41:03.170602 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:41:04.785971 [actor]: child benfit eligiblity son studing a levels turnd 20 last week

2026-01-28T20:41:07.351328 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a son who is studying A-levels and turned 20 last week.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Is your son still enrolled in and actively attending his A-level course, and is this an approved full-time non-advanced education or training course?**

(A-levels are generally considered approved education, but I need to confirm he's still actively studying.)

2026-01-28T20:41:09.023043 [actor]: yes still doing a levels full time startes september still going

2026-01-28T20:41:11.183799 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Your son is still in full-time A-level education which started in September and is ongoing.

Now I need to ask: **Are you the person who is primarily responsible for your son, or does he live with you?**

(This helps determine if you're the person who should be claiming Child Benefit for him.)

2026-01-28T20:41:12.555371 [actor]: yes im his dad he lives with me im raj

2026-01-28T20:41:14.592182 [root_agent]: Thank you, Raj. That's helpful information.

Now I need to ask: **Do you normally live in the UK?**

(This is important for Child Benefit eligibility as there are residency requirements.)

2026-01-28T20:41:15.842449 [actor]: yes live in uk always have

2026-01-28T20:41:20.357045 [root_agent]: Thank you, Raj. Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

✓ You have a son who turned 20 last week
✓ He's studying A-levels full-time (started in September and still ongoing)
✓ You're his dad and he lives with you
✓ You normally live in the UK

**Good news**: You should still be eligible for Child Benefit for your son, even though he's turned 20, because he's in approved full-time education (A-levels are approved non-advanced education).

However, there is one important point: **Child Benefit can continue until the 31st August following a child's 20th birthday, as long as they remain in approved education or training.**

Since your son turned 20 last week and is still studying A-levels, you can continue to receive Child Benefit until the end of August (when the current academic year ends), provided he continues in his studies.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-28T20:41:21.848477 [actor]: ok so i get it until august then

2026-01-28T20:41:24.105032 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct, Raj. You should continue to get Child Benefit until the 31st August, as long as your son remains in his full-time A-level education.

After 31st August, Child Benefit will stop, even if he continues studying, because that's the cut-off point after a young person turns 20.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:41:25.707929 [actor]: no thats all i needed to know thanks

2026-01-28T20:41:27.244722 [root_agent]: You're very welcome, Raj! I'm glad I could help clarify your Child Benefit situation. Take care!

2026-01-28T20:41:32.153320 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. Child Benefit stops on the child's 20th birthday, not on the 31st August following the birthday. Since the son turned 20 last week, the claimant is no longer eligible for Child Benefit.
