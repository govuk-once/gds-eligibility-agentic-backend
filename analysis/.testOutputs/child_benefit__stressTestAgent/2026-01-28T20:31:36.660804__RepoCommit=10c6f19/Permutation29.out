2026-01-28T20:46:47.280953 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking you the first question:

**Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:46:48.815541 [actor]: child 17 not in colege or wrking

2026-01-28T20:46:51.807649 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old child who is not in college or working.

Let me ask you this:

**Is your 17-year-old child registered with a careers service or with Connexions (or equivalent youth support service), and are they waiting to start an approved course of education or training?**

This is important because a young person aged 16-19 can still qualify for Child Benefit if they're enrolled in approved education or training, or in certain circumstances while waiting to start such a course.

2026-01-28T20:46:53.102643 [actor]: finished gcses last year no training nothing

2026-01-28T20:46:57.076431 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your child finished their GCSEs last year and is not in any training or education.

Based on the eligibility rules for Child Benefit, I need to inform you that:

**A child aged 17 who has left full-time education or approved training is generally not eligible for Child Benefit.** Child Benefit typically stops when a young person turns 16, unless they remain in approved education or training - in which case it can continue until they turn 20.

Since your 17-year-old finished their GCSEs last year and is not currently in college, training, or approved education, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for this child.

However, let me ask: **Do you have any other children under 16 years old, or any other children under 20 who are in approved education or training?**

This is important because you might still be eligible for Child Benefit for other children in your household.

2026-01-28T20:46:58.285909 [actor]: no just jordan

2026-01-28T20:47:01.541012 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. So Jordan is your only child, and they are 17, finished GCSEs last year, and is not currently in college, training, or working.

Based on the Child Benefit eligibility rules, **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** because:

- Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 16, unless they stay in approved education or training
- Since Jordan is 17 and not in approved education or training, they don't meet the eligibility criteria

However, it's worth noting that if Jordan decides to return to education or start an approved training course in the future, you may be able to claim Child Benefit again (as long as they're under 20 when they start).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T20:47:06.187723 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a 17-year-old who finished GCSEs last year and is not in approved education or training does not qualify for Child Benefit, as the benefit stops at 16 unless the young person continues in approved education or training until age 20.
