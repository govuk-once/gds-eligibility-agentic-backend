2026-01-28T20:43:09.572463 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:43:11.685216 [actor]: child in hosptal arthur 7 yrs old

2026-01-28T20:43:13.854032 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have Arthur who is 7 years old and is currently in hospital.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for Arthur - meaning do you normally live with him and are you responsible for his care and upbringing?**

2026-01-28T20:43:15.329907 [actor]: yes he my son i responsible for him

2026-01-28T20:43:17.190690 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Arthur is your son and you're responsible for him.

Now I need to ask:

**Is Arthur expected to be in hospital for more than 12 weeks, or is he in hospital for less than 12 weeks?**

2026-01-28T20:43:19.381335 [actor]: he been in hosptal 10 weeks then came home 2 weeks then went back in 15 days ago now been there 3 weeks

2026-01-28T20:43:21.424653 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details about Arthur's hospital stays.

To clarify the situation, I need to ask:

**During the 2 weeks when Arthur came home between hospital stays, was he living with you at home during that time?**

2026-01-28T20:43:22.782560 [actor]: yes he was home with me for 2 weeks

2026-01-28T20:43:24.341295 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Arthur was home with you during those 2 weeks.

Now I need to ask:

**Do you normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:43:25.591238 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T20:43:27.568526 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you live in the UK.

One more important question:

**Are you the only person responsible for Arthur, or does someone else also have parental responsibility for him (such as a partner or ex-partner)?**

2026-01-28T20:43:29.266574 [actor]: im only one responsible for arthur

2026-01-28T20:43:33.542596 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you should be eligible for Child Benefit** for Arthur. Here's why:

✓ Arthur is 7 years old (under 16)
✓ You are responsible for him as his parent
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are the only person responsible for him

Regarding Arthur's hospital stays: The good news is that you can continue to claim Child Benefit while Arthur is in hospital. The rules state that:

- You can keep receiving Child Benefit for up to **12 weeks** if your child is in hospital
- When Arthur came home for those 2 weeks, this would have **broken the 12-week period**, meaning the count restarted when he went back into hospital
- Since he's currently been in hospital for 3 weeks (which is less than 12 weeks), you remain eligible

**Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-28T20:43:35.097808 [actor]: ok thankyou so i can get child benfit

2026-01-28T20:43:39.613643 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated I remain eligible because the 2-week period at home "broke the 12-week period" and the count restarted, meaning only 3 weeks count toward the 12-week limit. However, according to the rules, breaks at home of less than 4 weeks do not reset the count - the hospital periods should be added together (10 weeks + 3 weeks = 13 weeks cumulative), which exceeds the 12-week threshold, making me ineligible after the 12th cumulative week.
