**Justification:** The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct outcome communicated**: The agent clearly stated "you should be eligible for Child Benefit" for both adopted children

2. **Accurate reasoning**: The agent properly identified that:
   - Adopted children qualify for Child Benefit the same as biological children
   - Both children (aged 6 and 8) are under 16
   - The claimants have responsibility for the children
   - No one else is claiming for these children

3. **Crucial distinction made**: The agent correctly noted that "The council allowance you receive for their special needs should not prevent you from claiming Child Benefit - these are separate benefits." This is the critical distinction between an Adoption Allowance (which does NOT disqualify Child Benefit eligibility) and a Fostering Allowance (which would disqualify it)

4. **Clear actionable guidance**: The agent concluded with "You can go ahead and apply for Child Benefit for both of your children"

The agent's assessment matches the expected outcome that George and Helen are eligible for Child Benefit despite receiving an Adoption Allowance from the Local Authority.
