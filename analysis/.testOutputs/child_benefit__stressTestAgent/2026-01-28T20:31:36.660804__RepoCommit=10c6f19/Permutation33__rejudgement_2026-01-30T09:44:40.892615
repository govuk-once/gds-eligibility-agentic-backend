**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

The critical error lies in the agent's assessment of Bella's training program. The agent stated that "employer-funded travel agency training" qualifies as "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes. However, according to the eligibility criteria on gov.uk:

- Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds continues only if they are in **approved education or training**
- "Approved training" has a specific definition and typically refers to government-recognized schemes such as Traineeships or programs registered with approved providers
- **Training that is paid for by an employer does not qualify as "approved training"** for Child Benefit purposes

The scenario explicitly states: "The eligibility criteria specify that education counts as 'approved' only if it is **not paid for by an employer**."

When the user stated "employer pays for it travel agency training," this should have been the key indicator that Bella's training does **not** meet the criteria for approved training, making the mother **not eligible** for Child Benefit.

The agent's conclusion that the user "appears to be eligible" directly contradicts the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**, representing a failure to correctly apply the Child Benefit eligibility rules.
