**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct identification of age criterion**: The agent recognized that Jordan (17) is over 16, so the basic age criterion doesn't apply.

2. **Correct assessment of education/training status**: The agent properly identified that Jordan is not in approved education or training, having finished GCSEs last year and currently being NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training).

3. **Correct application of extension rules**: The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can continue past age 16 only if the young person remains in approved education or training (until age 20), which Jordan does not meet.

4. **Clear communication of outcome**: The agent explicitly stated: "**you are not eligible for Child Benefit**" and provided clear reasoning.

5. **Alignment with expected outcome**: The expected outcome states "Not Eligible" because Jordan:
   - Is over 16 (fails Criteria 1)
   - Is not in approved education or training (fails Criteria 2)
   - Has not registered with careers services or similar programs (fails Criteria 3 - extension eligibility)

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome perfectly, and the communication was clear, accurate, and well-reasoned.
