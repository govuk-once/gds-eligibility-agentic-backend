2026-01-28T20:40:29.274648 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for bringing up a child who is under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:40:30.766213 [actor]: need help with child benfit eligable

2026-01-28T20:40:32.380559 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me help you determine your eligibility for Child Benefit.

First question: **Are you responsible for bringing up a child who is under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:40:33.897578 [actor]: yes got 2 kids age 8 and 10

2026-01-28T20:40:35.458368 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have two children aged 8 and 10, which means they meet the age requirement.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:40:36.857755 [actor]: no live in germany

2026-01-28T20:40:39.481863 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. This is an important factor for Child Benefit eligibility.

To clarify further: **Are you working in the UK, or do you pay UK National Insurance contributions?**

(There are some circumstances where you might still be eligible for UK Child Benefit even while living abroad, particularly if you have certain connections to the UK through work or National Insurance.)

2026-01-28T20:40:41.109323 [actor]: british armed forces posted germany

2026-01-28T20:40:43.129731 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Being a member of the British Armed Forces posted in Germany is very relevant.

Let me ask: **Are you currently serving as a member of HM Forces (British Armed Forces) on an overseas posting?**

This is important because members of the Armed Forces posted abroad may still be eligible for UK Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T20:40:44.512934 [actor]: yes serving hm forces overseas posting

2026-01-28T20:40:46.963196 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that. Members of HM Forces on overseas postings can be eligible for UK Child Benefit.

Now, let me ask: **Are the children living with you (or primarily in your care) in Germany?**

This helps determine if you're the person responsible for the children and therefore the one who should claim Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T20:40:48.491214 [actor]: wife and kids living with me on base germany

2026-01-28T20:40:50.867466 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for that information.

One final question to complete the eligibility assessment: **Are you or your wife receiving any similar child benefit payments from Germany or any other country for these children?**

(This is important because you generally cannot receive child benefit from two different countries for the same children at the same time.)

2026-01-28T20:40:52.450218 [actor]: no not recieving any german benefits or other country benefits

2026-01-28T20:40:56.410612 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for UK Child Benefit**.

Here's why:
- You have two children aged 8 and 10 (under 16)
- You are responsible for bringing them up and they live with you
- You are a member of HM Forces on an overseas posting in Germany
- You are not receiving similar benefits from Germany or any other country

Members of the British Armed Forces posted abroad are treated as resident in the UK for Child Benefit purposes, which means you should be eligible to claim even though you're living in Germany.

You can apply for Child Benefit for both of your children. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T20:41:01.438057 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a British Armed Forces member serving on an overseas posting in Germany with two children aged 8 and 10 living with them, and not receiving benefits from another country, is eligible for UK Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible."
