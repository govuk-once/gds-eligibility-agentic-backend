**Expected Outcome:** Eligible

**Agent's Communication:** The agent stated: "Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**."

**Analysis:**

The scenario involves Ali and Zara who have had Maya (4 years old) placed with them by an adoption agency. The child lives with them, though the final adoption order hasn't been granted yet.

According to the criteria provided in the scenario:
- **Criteria 1 (Responsibility):** Yes - Maya lives with them
- **Criteria 2 (Adoption Status):** The guidance explicitly states "You can claim Child Benefit **as soon as any child you're adopting comes to live with you**. You do not have to wait for the final order."

The agent correctly:
1. Established the child (age 4) lives with them and they're responsible for her care
2. Confirmed UK residency
3. Verified no one else is claiming
4. Checked immigration status
5. **Crucially, the agent specifically noted: "Since the child has been placed with you by an adoption agency, you can claim Child Benefit even though the adoption may not be finalized yet."**

This directly aligns with the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility which states you can claim as soon as an adopted child comes to live with you.

**Conclusion:** The agent communicated an eligibility outcome of "Eligible" which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."
