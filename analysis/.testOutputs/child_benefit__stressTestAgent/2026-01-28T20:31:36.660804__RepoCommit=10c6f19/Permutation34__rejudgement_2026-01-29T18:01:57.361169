**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit beyond the 12-week custody period, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct rule application**: The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can continue for up to 12 weeks when a child is in custody, but stops after that period if the child remains in custody.

2. **Clear communication of ineligibility**: The agent explicitly stated "you may NOT be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit after the first 12 weeks" and later confirmed "After 12 weeks of your son being in custody, you would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit while he remains in custody."

3. **Accurate calculation**: The agent correctly identified that with 10 weeks already elapsed and a 6-month sentence, the child would remain in custody well beyond the 12-week threshold, making the claimant ineligible for continued payments.

4. **Appropriate guidance**: The agent properly advised the user to contact HMRC to report the change and avoid overpayments.

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome that the claimant is not eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit once the 8-week (or in the agent's explanation, 12-week) custody threshold is exceeded.
