**Justification:**

The agent communicated that Raj is **still eligible** for Child Benefit until 31st August, stating: "You should continue to get Child Benefit until the 31st August, as long as your son remains in his full-time A-level education."

However, according to the expected outcome and UK Child Benefit rules, eligibility **ceases on the 20th birthday**. The gov.uk guidance clearly states that Child Benefit stops when a child turns 20, even if they are still in approved education or training.

Since Dev turned 20 last week, Raj is **not eligible** for Child Benefit from that point forward. The agent's communication of continued eligibility until August directly contradicts the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)."

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, noting that "Child Benefit stops on the child's 20th birthday, not on the 31st August following the birthday."
