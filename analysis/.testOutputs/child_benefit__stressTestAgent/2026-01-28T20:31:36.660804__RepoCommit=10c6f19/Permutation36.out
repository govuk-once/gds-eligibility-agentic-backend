2026-01-28T20:50:38.665702 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess this.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:50:40.372463 [actor]: daughter 16 finsihed school august not in educaton worried

2026-01-28T20:50:43.090530 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 16-year-old daughter who finished school in August and is not currently in education or training.

Let me ask you this: **Is your daughter currently registered with a careers service or with Connexions (or equivalent service), and is she waiting to start an approved course of education or training?**

This is important because there can be a short extension period for Child Benefit in certain circumstances even after finishing school.

2026-01-28T20:50:44.960771 [actor]: no she starting college september accepted already gcses done june

2026-01-28T20:50:48.282555 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying! That's helpful information. So your daughter:
- Finished her GCSEs in June
- Has been accepted to college
- Will be starting college in September

This is good news for Child Benefit eligibility, as approved education can include college courses.

My next question: **What type of course will your daughter be studying at college - is it a full-time course (at least 12 hours per week of supervised study)?**

This is important because for young people aged 16-19, the course needs to be full-time and approved to qualify for Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T20:50:49.769485 [actor]: a levels full time starts septmber yes

2026-01-28T20:50:51.916995 [root_agent]: Excellent! A-levels are approved education and full-time study, so that qualifies.

Now let me ask about you: **Are you responsible for your daughter? This means do you live with her and are you responsible for her care and upbringing?**

2026-01-28T20:50:53.212892 [actor]: yes live together im her mum she lives with me

2026-01-28T20:50:55.410201 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you. So you live with your daughter and are responsible for her.

Next question: **Are you currently living in the UK?**

(Child Benefit generally requires you to be living in the UK, though there are some exceptions for people working abroad or in certain circumstances.)

2026-01-28T20:50:56.840376 [actor]: yes uk live here always

2026-01-28T20:50:59.602729 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Now an important question about your household:

**Is there anyone else in your household who might also be claiming Child Benefit for your daughter, or is anyone else responsible for her?**

(Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child, so I need to check if anyone else might be claiming it.)

2026-01-28T20:51:01.084607 [actor]: no just me only me responsible no one else claiming

2026-01-28T20:51:03.998512 [root_agent]: Thank you. One more important question:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

(This is important because while you can still claim Child Benefit if either of you earns over £50,000, there's a tax charge called the High Income Child Benefit Charge that may apply. If either of you earns over £60,000, the charge effectively cancels out the benefit, though you can still register for Child Benefit to protect your National Insurance record.)

2026-01-28T20:51:05.588721 [actor]: no income under that amount

2026-01-28T20:51:10.007858 [root_agent]: Excellent! Based on all the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's a summary of why you qualify:

✓ You have a daughter under 20 who will be in approved full-time education (A-levels starting in September)
✓ You live with her and are responsible for her
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ Your income is under £50,000, so there's no High Income Child Benefit Charge to worry about

**Important note about the gap period (August to September):** You should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit during the period between your daughter finishing school in August and starting college in September, as this is a recognized gap between leaving school and starting further education.

You can claim Child Benefit online or by post. The payment is currently £24.00 per week for your eldest or only child.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:51:13.175986 [actor]: ok thank you that helps

2026-01-28T20:51:15.776577 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user qualifies for Child Benefit since their daughter will be starting full-time A-level education in September (approved education for ages 16-19), the user is responsible for the child, lives in the UK, no one else is claiming, and their income is under £50,000. The agent also correctly noted that Child Benefit can continue during the gap period between finishing school and starting college.
