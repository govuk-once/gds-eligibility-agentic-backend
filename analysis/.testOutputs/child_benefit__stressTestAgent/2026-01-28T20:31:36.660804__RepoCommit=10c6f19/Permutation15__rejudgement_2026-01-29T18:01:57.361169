**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of living arrangements**: The agent established that the daughter (Emma, 12) lives with her mother, not with the applicant (Mike).

2. **Correct application of responsibility criteria**: The agent properly determined that the mother is the person mainly responsible for the child's day-to-day care and decision-making (school, medical appointments, daily routine).

3. **Correct explanation of eligibility rules**: The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with AND who is mainly responsible for them - not simply based on financial contributions.

4. **Addressed the contribution question appropriately**: When the user asked "how much money need to send to get child benefit," the agent correctly clarified that eligibility isn't based on the amount of money sent, but rather on living arrangements and care responsibility.

5. **Clear final determination**: The agent explicitly stated: "**you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit** in this situation."

The agent's determination aligns perfectly with the scenario: Mike contributes only £10/week (below the £26.05/week threshold), and more importantly, Emma doesn't live with him and he's not responsible for her day-to-day care. Therefore, he does not meet the responsibility criteria for Child Benefit eligibility.
