2026-01-28T20:38:18.861391 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T20:38:20.529000 [actor]: child living with us now adoption agency placed her

2026-01-28T20:38:22.940241 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child who has been placed with you by an adoption agency and is living with you now.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for this child? In other words, are you the person who is mainly looking after them - providing for their day-to-day care, food, clothing, and other needs?

2026-01-28T20:38:24.462047 [actor]: yes we look after her shes 4 moved in our house

2026-01-28T20:38:26.515909 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you're looking after a 4-year-old child who has been placed with you by an adoption agency and lives in your house.

Next question: Do you normally live in the UK? (This means the UK is your main home where you usually reside)

2026-01-28T20:38:27.937313 [actor]: yes live in uk main home

2026-01-28T20:38:29.694844 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask: Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for this same child?

2026-01-28T20:38:30.995311 [actor]: no one else claiming for her

2026-01-28T20:38:32.920597 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question: Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on your right to live in the UK?

2026-01-28T20:38:34.474214 [actor]: no restrictions we live here properly

2026-01-28T20:38:38.003948 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (she's 4 years old)
✓ The child lives with you and you're responsible for her
✓ You normally live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ You have no immigration restrictions

Since the child has been placed with you by an adoption agency, you can claim Child Benefit even though the adoption may not be finalized yet. The key factors are that she lives with you and you're responsible for her care.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for this child. 

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-28T20:38:43.588139 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on all the relevant criteria: the child is under 16, lives with them, they are responsible for her care, they live in the UK, no one else is claiming, and there are no immigration restrictions. The agent also correctly noted that Child Benefit can be claimed for a child placed by an adoption agency even before the adoption is finalized.
