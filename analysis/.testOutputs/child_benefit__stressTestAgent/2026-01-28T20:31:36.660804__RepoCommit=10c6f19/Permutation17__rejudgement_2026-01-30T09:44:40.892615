**Justification:** The agent correctly determined that the user is eligible for UK Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of "Eligible."

The agent properly identified and verified all relevant criteria:
1. The user has two children aged 8 and 10 (both under 16)
2. The user is responsible for bringing up the children
3. While the user lives in Germany (normally disqualifying), they are a member of HM Forces on an overseas posting
4. The children live with the user
5. No similar benefits are being received from Germany or other countries

Most importantly, the agent correctly applied the Crown servant exception - recognizing that members of the British Armed Forces posted abroad are treated as resident in the UK for Child Benefit purposes. This is the key legal principle that makes the user eligible despite living outside the UK.

The agent's final determination that the user "appear[s] to be eligible for UK Child Benefit" directly aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
