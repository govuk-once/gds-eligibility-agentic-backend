**Justification:**

The agent's eligibility determination does not align with the expected outcome for this scenario.

**Expected Outcome:** Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate) - meaning both Robert and Tina should each receive £26.05 weekly for the child living with them.

**Agent's Communication:** The agent correctly identified that the user is eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam (who lives with them), but **failed to communicate that they would receive the higher "Eldest Child" rate of £26.05**.

**Critical Missing Information:**
According to the scenario guidance: "if families split up and children are divided between parents (one lives with you, one lives with someone else), each parent is entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for the eldest child in their specific household."

The agent did not:
1. Explain that the user would receive the higher eldest child rate (£26.05) for Sam
2. Clarify that this applies even though Sam is technically the older sibling overall
3. Mention the split family allowance rule that entitles each parent to the eldest child rate for their household

While the agent correctly confirmed eligibility for Sam, they did not communicate the **complete and correct outcome** regarding the rate structure, which is a fundamental part of the eligibility determination in this split family scenario.
