**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** while Simon is in the secure mental health unit for the 10-week period.

The agent's reasoning aligns with the expected outcome:

1. **Correctly identified the applicable rule**: The agent recognized that a secure mental health unit under the Mental Health Act is treated as hospital/residential accommodation, not custody
2. **Applied the correct time limit**: The agent stated the **12-week rule** applies (not the 8-week rule for custody/care)
3. **Verified continued financial support**: The agent confirmed the claimant continues to pay for Simon's upkeep, which is a requirement for continued eligibility
4. **Correct outcome communicated**: Since the detention is 10 weeks (within the 12-week limit), the agent correctly concluded the claimant "should remain eligible for Child Benefit" during this period

The expected outcome was "Eligible (until week 12)" and the agent communicated exactly this - that Child Benefit continues for up to 12 weeks in such circumstances, and since Simon's stay is 10 weeks, the claimant remains eligible throughout.
