**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Age criterion met**: The child is 17 years old (under 20), so this criterion is satisfied.

2. **Education criterion NOT met**: The critical issue is whether the education qualifies as "full-time approved education." The agent correctly identified that:
   - The course involves only 6 hours per week of supervised study
   - Full-time education requires more than 12 hours per week of supervised study
   - Therefore, 6 hours per week does NOT meet the full-time education requirement

3. **Correct conclusion**: The agent explicitly stated: "you would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit for your 17-year-old son in this situation, as he is not in full-time education."

The agent's assessment is accurate according to the gov.uk eligibility criteria, which states that for 16-19 year olds, the education must be full-time (averaging more than 12 hours per week of supervised study). The agent also helpfully explained that if circumstances change and the son enrolls in full-time education, eligibility could be reconsidered.

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent agrees with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
