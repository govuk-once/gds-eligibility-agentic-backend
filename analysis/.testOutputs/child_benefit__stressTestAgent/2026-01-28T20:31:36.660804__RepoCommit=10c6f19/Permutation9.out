2026-01-28T20:35:58.641193 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:36:00.047950 [actor]: child benefit eligble jobseeker uk

2026-01-28T20:36:02.017490 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you a clear question to start assessing your eligibility:

**Are you responsible for bringing up a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they are in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:36:03.382101 [actor]: yes have son 5 years old

2026-01-28T20:36:05.465268 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for that information. So you have a 5-year-old son, which means the age requirement is met.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:36:07.583039 [actor]: german citisen pre settled status

2026-01-28T20:36:09.672008 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you're a German citizen with pre-settled status.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Do you currently live in the UK?**

(Your immigration status and right to reside in the UK are important factors, but first I need to confirm where you're currently living.)

2026-01-28T20:36:11.299045 [actor]: yes uk looking for work registred

2026-01-28T20:36:13.245639 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you're living in the UK with pre-settled status, you have a 5-year-old son, and you're registered as looking for work.

Next question: **Does your son live with you, or do you have main responsibility for him?**

2026-01-28T20:36:14.606426 [actor]: yes son lives with me

2026-01-28T20:36:17.023027 [root_agent]: Excellent. Your son lives with you and you're responsible for him.

Now I need to ask about your work and residence status: **Are you currently working, or have you worked in the UK previously?**

(This is important because as an EU citizen with pre-settled status, your right to claim Child Benefit may depend on your worker status or other qualifying criteria under the UK's immigration rules.)

2026-01-28T20:36:18.553172 [actor]: not working now unemployed but registerd jobseeker actively looking

2026-01-28T20:36:20.770555 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask one more important question:

**Have you previously worked in the UK before becoming unemployed, or did you come to the UK and register as a jobseeker without having worked here first?**

(This distinction is important because it affects whether you retain worker status and therefore your right to reside for Child Benefit purposes.)

2026-01-28T20:36:22.351806 [actor]: came uk recently registered jobseeker not worked yet

2026-01-28T20:36:24.903549 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is an important detail.

Let me ask: **Are you receiving any other benefits or support in the UK currently, such as Universal Credit or any other payments?**

(This information will help me understand your overall circumstances and eligibility for Child Benefit, as your right to reside and access to benefits as a jobseeker without previous UK work history are key factors.)

2026-01-28T20:36:26.530866 [actor]: no benefits yet just registred jobseeker looking for work

2026-01-28T20:36:31.752185 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all this information. Let me think through your situation carefully.

Based on what you've told me:
- You're a German citizen with pre-settled status
- You have a 5-year-old son living with you in the UK
- You came to the UK recently and registered as a jobseeker
- You haven't worked in the UK yet
- You're not receiving any other benefits

**Unfortunately, you are likely NOT eligible for Child Benefit at this time.**

Here's why: To claim Child Benefit, you must have a "right to reside" in the UK. While you have pre-settled status, being a jobseeker alone (without having previously worked in the UK) does not generally provide a sufficient right to reside for the purposes of claiming Child Benefit. Jobseekers typically need to have been workers in the UK first to retain that status for benefit purposes.

**However**, this is a complex area of immigration and benefits law. I strongly recommend that you:
- Speak to a benefits advisor or citizens advice bureau who can assess your specific circumstances in detail
- Once you start working in the UK, you should become eligible for Child Benefit

Does this make sense, or do you have any other questions?

2026-01-28T20:36:33.469090 [actor]: ok understand not eligble now thanks for help

2026-01-28T20:36:36.430353 [root_agent]: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify your situation.

Just to summarize: once you find work in the UK, your circumstances will change and you should become eligible for Child Benefit. At that point, you can apply and it's worth doing so because Child Benefit can be backdated.

Good luck with your job search, and I hope you find employment soon!

If you have any other questions in the future, feel free to ask.

2026-01-28T20:36:42.031143 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to Gov.uk guidance, EEA citizens with pre-settled status who are registered jobseekers and genuinely seeking work have a right to reside for Child Benefit purposes - they do not need to have worked in the UK first. The agent incorrectly stated that jobseekers must have previously worked in the UK to be eligible.
