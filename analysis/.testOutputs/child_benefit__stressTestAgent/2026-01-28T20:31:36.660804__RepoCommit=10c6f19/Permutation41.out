2026-01-28T20:53:23.113882 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:53:25.263934 [actor]: child benfit two kids not living with me pay money every week

2026-01-28T20:53:27.976471 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have two children who don't live with you, and you pay money every week (which sounds like maintenance payments).

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for the children in any of these ways - do the children stay with you regularly, or do you contribute to the cost of looking after them in ways beyond just the weekly payments you mentioned?

2026-01-28T20:53:29.778380 [actor]: yeh i pay 40 pounds evry week for both kids ben and jery thats my contribushun

2026-01-28T20:53:31.898140 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you pay £40 every week for Ben and Jerry - that's your contribution to their care.

Now I need to ask: Do Ben and Jerry live with you at all, or do they live full-time with someone else (such as their other parent or another carer)?

2026-01-28T20:53:33.367447 [actor]: they live with ex partner not with me i just pay the money

2026-01-28T20:53:35.126092 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Ben and Jerry live full-time with your ex-partner, and you contribute £40 per week towards their care.

Let me ask you this: Does your ex-partner currently claim Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry?

2026-01-28T20:53:36.653119 [actor]: dont know bout that just want to know if i can get it because i pay for them

2026-01-28T20:53:39.146741 [root_agent]: I understand you want to know if you can claim Child Benefit because you're paying towards their care.

Let me ask an important question: Do you have any contact or arrangement where Ben and Jerry stay with you at all - for example, do they stay overnight with you on weekends or during holidays, or do they only live with your ex-partner?

2026-01-28T20:53:40.613515 [actor]: no they dont stay with me just live with ex i send the 40 pounds

2026-01-28T20:53:44.625990 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So to summarise: Ben and Jerry live full-time with your ex-partner, they don't stay with you at all, and you send £40 per week as your contribution.

Based on the rules for Child Benefit eligibility, I need to explain something important to you:

**You are not eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry.**

Here's why: Child Benefit can only be claimed by one person for each child, and it goes to the person who the child **lives with**. Since Ben and Jerry live full-time with your ex-partner and don't live with you, your ex-partner is the person who can claim Child Benefit for them.

The fact that you contribute financially through your £40 weekly payments is important for child maintenance, but it doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit when the children don't live with you.

Is there anything else about this that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T20:53:46.631584 [actor]: but i red online that if you pay enuf for the child you can claim it even if they dont live with you how much do i need to pay

2026-01-28T20:53:51.075317 [root_agent]: I understand why that might be confusing, but I need to clarify this important point for you.

**That information isn't correct.** Child Benefit eligibility is not based on how much money you pay towards a child's care.

The key rule is: Child Benefit is paid to the person the child **lives with**. It doesn't matter how much you contribute financially - if the children don't live with you, you cannot claim Child Benefit for them.

The only exception would be if you and your ex-partner shared care of Ben and Jerry - meaning they lived with both of you for significant periods of time (for example, splitting their time between both homes). In that case, only one of you could still claim, but you'd need to decide between you who claims it.

Since Ben and Jerry live full-time with your ex-partner and don't stay with you at all, your ex-partner is the eligible person to claim Child Benefit, not you.

Does that make sense, or would you like me to explain anything further?

2026-01-28T20:53:53.314239 [actor]: no i defintely saw it says you can claim if you contribte at least the amunt of the child benfit how much is child benfit for 2 kids then

2026-01-28T20:53:58.541901 [root_agent]: I understand you believe you've seen that information, but I need to be very clear with you:

**That is not correct according to the official UK government rules for Child Benefit.**

There is no rule that says you can claim Child Benefit by paying an amount equal to or more than the Child Benefit amount. Child Benefit eligibility is based on the child living with you, not on how much money you contribute.

However, to answer your question about the amounts: Child Benefit is currently:
- £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child
- £16.95 per week for each additional child

So for two children (Ben and Jerry), that would be £42.55 per week total.

But again - even though you pay £40 per week which is close to this amount, this does **not** make you eligible to claim Child Benefit. The children must live with you to be eligible.

Where did you see this information that suggested you could claim based on payment amount? It's possible there's been a misunderstanding about what you read.

2026-01-28T20:54:00.513657 [actor]: so ben gets 25.60 and jery gets 16.95 i pay 40 so i pay more than jerrys amunt can i claim for jerry then

2026-01-28T20:54:04.897661 [root_agent]: No, I'm sorry but that's not how it works.

You cannot claim Child Benefit for Jerry (or Ben) based on the amount you pay. **Child Benefit is not divided between children in that way for eligibility purposes.**

Let me be very clear about the rule:

**To claim Child Benefit for a child, that child must live with you.** It doesn't matter:
- How much you pay towards their care
- Whether you pay more than their individual Child Benefit amount
- Whether you want to claim for just one child or both

Since Jerry lives with your ex-partner full-time and does not live with you, you cannot claim Child Benefit for Jerry.

The £25.60 and £16.95 amounts are simply how much Child Benefit pays out - they don't determine who is eligible to claim. Eligibility is based on where the child lives.

Your ex-partner, who Ben and Jerry live with, is the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for both children.

Do you understand this rule now?

2026-01-28T20:54:06.939446 [actor]: i think you are wrong i will call hmrc becaus i definately read you can claim if you pay enough even if child not living with you maybe different rules for fathers

2026-01-28T20:54:12.201281 [root_agent]: I understand you want to double-check this information, and calling HMRC is absolutely your right - they can confirm what I'm telling you directly.

However, I want to be very clear: **There are no different rules for fathers versus mothers when it comes to Child Benefit.** The rules are the same regardless of whether you're the mother, father, or another carer.

The rule is consistent: **Child Benefit goes to the person the child lives with**, regardless of:
- Gender (mother or father)
- How much you pay in maintenance
- Any other financial contributions

I've checked the official UK government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, and there is no provision that allows someone to claim Child Benefit based on paying maintenance when the child doesn't live with them.

By all means, please do contact HMRC to confirm this - it's good to verify information. Their number for Child Benefit queries is 0300 200 3100. They will tell you the same thing, but it's completely reasonable for you to want to hear it directly from them.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this?

2026-01-28T20:54:14.180660 [actor]: ok so if i understand you are saying i cant claim any child benfit for ben or jerry because they live with ex even tho i pay 40 pounds a week is that right

2026-01-28T20:54:17.757045 [root_agent]: Yes, that's exactly right. I'm glad we've clarified this.

**You cannot claim Child Benefit for Ben or Jerry because they live with your ex-partner, even though you pay £40 per week towards their care.**

The key points are:
- Child Benefit can only be claimed by the person the child lives with
- Your £40 weekly payments are important as child maintenance, but they don't make you eligible for Child Benefit
- Only your ex-partner (who Ben and Jerry live with) can claim Child Benefit for them

Your financial contribution through the £40 per week is separate from Child Benefit - it's about supporting your children, which is important, but it's not the same thing as being eligible to claim the benefit.

If you do want to double-check this with HMRC directly, you're welcome to call them on 0300 200 3100.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-28T20:54:19.667017 [actor]: no thats all i understand now not eligble

2026-01-28T20:54:23.458294 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user cannot claim Child Benefit for either child (Ben or Jerry) because they live full-time with the ex-partner, and correctly clarified that Child Benefit eligibility is based on where the child lives, not on maintenance payments made, even when the user persistently challenged this with incorrect information.
