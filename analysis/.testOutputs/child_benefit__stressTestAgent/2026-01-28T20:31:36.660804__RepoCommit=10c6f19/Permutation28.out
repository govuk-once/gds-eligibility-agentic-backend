2026-01-28T20:46:20.296943 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T20:46:21.705162 [actor]: child benefit eligble us citizen visitng uk son 5 years

2026-01-28T20:46:23.887932 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you're a US citizen visiting the UK and you have a 5-year-old son.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you currently living in the UK, and if so, do you have permission to remain in the UK (such as a visa or settled status)?

2026-01-28T20:46:25.539243 [actor]: got 6 month tourist viza here with son

2026-01-28T20:46:27.818909 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. You're in the UK on a 6-month tourist visa with your son.

Let me ask: Is your son living with you, and are you responsible for his care and upbringing while you're in the UK?

2026-01-28T20:46:29.221827 [actor]: yes son living with me im the mum taking care of him

2026-01-28T20:46:31.071179 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now, an important question: Are you or your son ordinarily resident in the UK? In other words, is the UK your main home where you normally live, or are you just visiting temporarily on your tourist visa?

2026-01-28T20:46:32.381802 [actor]: just visiting for 6 months not working

2026-01-28T20:46:34.504567 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask one more important question to complete the assessment:

Do you or your son receive any UK benefits or tax credits, or are you subject to immigration control that restricts your access to public funds?

2026-01-28T20:46:35.829164 [actor]: no recorse to public funds on my visa

2026-01-28T20:46:40.006765 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, I'm afraid **you are not eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:

1. **Immigration status**: Your visa has a "no recourse to public funds" condition, which means you cannot claim most UK benefits, including Child Benefit.

2. **Ordinary residence**: You're visiting the UK temporarily on a 6-month tourist visa rather than living here as your main home. To claim Child Benefit, you generally need to be ordinarily resident in the UK (meaning the UK is your main home).

3. **Not working**: You've also mentioned you're not working in the UK, which means you wouldn't meet the criteria for workers from abroad who might be eligible in certain circumstances.

Child Benefit is designed for people who are settled in the UK or have the right to access public funds. As a US citizen on a tourist visa with no recourse to public funds, you wouldn't qualify for this benefit during your stay.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-28T20:46:43.273998 [actor]: ok thanks understand not eligble

2026-01-28T20:46:45.268983 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that as a US citizen on a 6-month tourist visa with "no recourse to public funds" and not ordinarily resident in the UK, I am not eligible for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
