**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Child in care >8 weeks**: The agent correctly identified that the child has been in local authority care for 10 weeks, exceeding the 8-week threshold.

2. **Contribution requirement**: The agent properly assessed that when a child is in care for more than 8 weeks, the parent can still claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount toward the child's upkeep.

3. **Spousal contribution exception**: Crucially, the agent correctly applied the rule that contributions from a spouse/partner living in the same household count toward meeting this requirement. The husband pays £30/week, which exceeds the Child Benefit rate (£25.60 for eldest/only child).

4. **Parental responsibility**: The agent confirmed the user is the child's mother, establishing parental responsibility.

The agent's conclusion that the user "should be eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit" is accurate and matches the expected outcome. The agent demonstrated proper understanding of the spousal contribution exception, which is the critical factor in this scenario.
