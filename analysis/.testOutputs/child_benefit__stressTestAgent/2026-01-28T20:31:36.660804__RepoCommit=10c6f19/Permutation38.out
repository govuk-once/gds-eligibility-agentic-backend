2026-01-28T20:51:50.322021 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:51:52.194061 [actor]: bby born 4 months ago forgot to cliam

2026-01-28T20:51:54.071710 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information! So you have a baby who was born 4 months ago - congratulations!

Let me ask you the next question to assess your eligibility:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:51:55.691736 [actor]: yes uk live here now

2026-01-28T20:51:57.804962 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming you live in the UK.

Now, let me ask you:

**Are you the person responsible for the child? This means you live with the child and are responsible for paying for things like their food, clothing, and housing.**

2026-01-28T20:51:59.373703 [actor]: yes we look after baby pay for evrything

2026-01-28T20:52:01.667361 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year? This includes salary, pension income, and other taxable income before tax is deducted.**

2026-01-28T20:52:03.176738 [actor]: no income under that

2026-01-28T20:52:04.975817 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me ask one more important question:

**Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on accessing public funds as part of your immigration status in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:52:06.392459 [actor]: no we can access evrything no restrictions

2026-01-28T20:52:10.287466 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions!

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 4-month-old baby)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are responsible for the child and pay for their needs
✓ Neither you nor your partner earns over £50,000 per year
✓ You have no immigration restrictions on accessing public funds

**Good news:** You mentioned you forgot to claim when your baby was born 4 months ago. You can backdate your claim for up to 3 months from the date you make your claim, so it's important to apply as soon as possible to minimize any loss of payments.

You should apply for Child Benefit now. The application process involves completing a claim form and providing your child's birth certificate.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T20:52:13.187351 [actor]: so I lost one month money cant get it back

2026-01-28T20:52:15.445402 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately informed the user they are eligible for Child Benefit and correctly explained that claims can only be backdated for up to 3 months, meaning the user has lost the first month's benefit since their baby was born 4 months ago.
