2026-01-28T20:51:17.440736 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:51:19.060109 [actor]: child benefit eligibilty nina 10 yrs old livs with me now

2026-01-28T20:51:20.835733 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child named Nina who is 10 years old and lives with you now.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:51:22.242336 [actor]: yes uk

2026-01-28T20:51:24.490258 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. So Nina is 10 years old, lives with you, and you're in the UK.

Next question: **Are you the main person responsible for Nina? By this I mean, are you the person who is primarily caring for her day-to-day?**

2026-01-28T20:51:26.040775 [actor]: mothers frend best frend nina stays becaus mother ill

2026-01-28T20:51:28.222998 [root_agent]: I understand - you're the mother's best friend and Nina is staying with you because her mother is ill.

This is an important detail. Let me ask: **Is this a temporary arrangement while Nina's mother is ill, or is Nina living with you on a more permanent or long-term basis?**

2026-01-28T20:51:29.528873 [actor]: forseeable futur not temporary

2026-01-28T20:51:31.319618 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Nina is living with you for the foreseeable future, not just temporarily.

Let me ask: **Is Nina's mother currently claiming Child Benefit for her, or has the mother stopped claiming it?**

2026-01-28T20:51:32.676736 [actor]: mother stoped claiming

2026-01-28T20:51:34.536301 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Nina's mother has stopped claiming Child Benefit.

Next question: **Are you the person who is mainly responsible for Nina's day-to-day care - meaning you're providing her with food, clothing, a home, and looking after her welfare?**

2026-01-28T20:51:35.877795 [actor]: yes providing food clothng home looking after nina

2026-01-28T20:51:38.043283 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you. So you are providing Nina's day-to-day care including food, clothing, a home, and looking after her.

One more important question: **Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year, or do you expect to earn over £60,000 this year?**

2026-01-28T20:51:39.422704 [actor]: no income under 60000

2026-01-28T20:51:43.145465 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Nina. Here's why:

✓ Nina is 10 years old (under 16)
✓ She lives with you in the UK
✓ You are responsible for her day-to-day care (providing food, clothing, home, and looking after her)
✓ This is a long-term arrangement for the foreseeable future
✓ Nina's mother has stopped claiming Child Benefit
✓ Your income is under £60,000

Since you're the person Nina lives with and you're responsible for her care on a long-term basis, you can claim Child Benefit for her even though you're not her parent - the key is that you're the main person looking after her.

**Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-28T20:51:48.207802 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that as the main caregiver providing day-to-day care for Nina (10 years old) on a long-term basis in the UK, with the mother having stopped claiming, and with income under £60,000, the individual is eligible for Child Benefit even though they are not the parent.
