2026-01-29T18:24:34.952126 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user **remains eligible for Child Benefit** while Simon is in the secure mental health unit. The agent's reasoning was sound:

1. **Correct classification**: The agent properly identified that a secure NHS mental health unit falls under hospital/residential accommodation rules rather than custody rules.

2. **Correct time limit applied**: The agent correctly cited the **12-week rule** that applies to children in hospital or care facilities, stating: "you can usually continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **12 weeks** if you continue to contribute to their upkeep."

3. **Correct application**: The agent properly applied this rule to the specific case, noting that Simon's 10-week stay is **within the 12-week period**, and therefore eligibility continues.

4. **All criteria verified**: The agent confirmed all relevant criteria - the child's age (15), normal residence with the claimant, continued financial support, UK residence, and that no one else is claiming.

The expected outcome was "Eligible (until week 12)" and the agent communicated exactly this outcome, explaining that eligibility continues for the 10-week period because it falls within the 12-week allowance for children in hospital/care facilities when the claimant continues to support them.
