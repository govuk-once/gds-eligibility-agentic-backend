**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Responsibility Criteria Met**: The agent correctly identified that the user has taken on responsibility for Nina's day-to-day care, providing food, clothing, accommodation, and looking after her welfare.

2. **Living Arrangement**: Nina (10 years old, under 16) lives with the user in the UK on a long-term basis ("foreseeable future").

3. **Private Fostering Recognition**: The agent appropriately recognized that even though the user is not Nina's parent but rather the mother's best friend, they can still claim Child Benefit as the primary caregiver. This aligns with the private fostering scenario where the council is not paying for accommodation.

4. **Mother's Claim Stopped**: The agent verified that Nina's mother has stopped claiming Child Benefit, avoiding double-claiming issues.

5. **Income Threshold**: The agent confirmed income is under £60,000, ensuring no High Income Child Benefit Charge complications.

The agent's conclusion that the user "can claim Child Benefit for her even though you're not her parent - the key is that you're the main person looking after her" is correct and consistent with the eligibility rules for private fostering arrangements where the carer is financially supporting the child.
