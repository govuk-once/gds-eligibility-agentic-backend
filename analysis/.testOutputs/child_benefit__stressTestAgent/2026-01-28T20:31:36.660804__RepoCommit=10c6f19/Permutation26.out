2026-01-28T20:45:22.185764 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:45:23.725426 [actor]: yeh i send money for my son evry week he lives with his ant

2026-01-28T20:45:25.655306 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand your situation better.

**Does your son normally live with you, or does he live with his aunt full-time?**

2026-01-28T20:45:27.323813 [actor]: he lives with ant full time dont live with me

2026-01-28T20:45:29.492929 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is important information.

**Are you the person who is mainly responsible for your son - meaning do you have the main day-to-day responsibility for him, even though he lives with his aunt?**

2026-01-28T20:45:30.968133 [actor]: i send 15 pound evry week for him

2026-01-28T20:45:33.101869 [root_agent]: I understand you send money regularly, which shows you're supporting your son financially. However, I need to clarify something specific about responsibility.

**Is it your aunt or you who has the main day-to-day care and responsibility for your son - for example, who makes decisions about his daily routine, schooling, and general welfare?**

2026-01-28T20:45:34.694371 [actor]: ant does the day to day stuff i just send the money

2026-01-28T20:45:36.634747 [root_agent]: Thank you for being clear about that. Based on what you've told me, let me ask one more important question:

**Has your aunt claimed Child Benefit for your son, or do you know if she plans to claim it?**

2026-01-28T20:45:38.024249 [actor]: no she dosnt claim it

2026-01-28T20:45:40.036964 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you this:

**Even though your son lives with your aunt, would you say that you still have the main responsibility for him overall - for example, do you make the major decisions about his upbringing, or does your aunt make those decisions?**

2026-01-28T20:45:41.414515 [actor]: ant makes the desicions i just send the money

2026-01-28T20:45:46.249176 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, I need to give you an honest assessment.

**You are not eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation.**

Here's why: Child Benefit is paid to the person who is responsible for the child and who the child normally lives with. Since your son lives full-time with your aunt and she has the main day-to-day responsibility and makes the decisions about his care and upbringing, she would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit - not you.

The fact that you send money to support your son is commendable and shows you care, but financial support alone doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit when someone else has the main caring responsibility and the child lives with them.

**Your aunt should consider claiming Child Benefit** if she hasn't already, as she appears to be the eligible person based on having your son living with her and being responsible for his day-to-day care.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-28T20:45:52.206111 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, a person can claim Child Benefit even if the child doesn't live with them, provided they contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit towards the child's upkeep (currently £25.60/week for the eldest child). Since the user pays £15/week and the aunt is not claiming, the user may still be eligible to claim, making the agent's blanket statement "You are not eligible" incorrect.
