**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors correctly identified by the agent:**

1. **Age criterion met**: The daughter is 17 years old (under 20)

2. **Approved training criterion met**: The agent correctly recognized that Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales can qualify as "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes

3. **Training allowance vs wages**: The agent properly distinguished that receiving a "training allowance" rather than "wages" keeps the young person within the approved training category

4. **Hours requirement met**: The training is 12+ hours per week, meeting the threshold for approved education/training

5. **Responsibility criterion met**: The daughter lives with the mother in Cardiff

**Critical reasoning:**

The agent demonstrated understanding of the regional exception for Wales. While apprenticeships that pay wages typically disqualify someone from Child Benefit, Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales funded by the Welsh Government are treated as approved training when:
- They are unpaid or provide only training allowances/expenses
- They meet the 12+ hours per week requirement

The agent's conclusion that the user "should be eligible for Child Benefit" correctly matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
