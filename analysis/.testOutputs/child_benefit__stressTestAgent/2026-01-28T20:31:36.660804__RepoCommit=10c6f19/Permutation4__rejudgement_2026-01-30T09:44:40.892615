**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Child's age and education status**: Sofia is 18 years old, left school 2 years ago, and is not enrolled in any approved education or training

2. **Employment status**: Sofia works 30 hours per week as a receptionist, which disqualifies her from the education/training extension of Child Benefit

3. **Eligibility rules applied correctly**: The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops at age 16 unless the young person continues in approved education or training (which can extend eligibility until age 20)

4. **Clear communication**: The agent provided a clear, unambiguous determination that the user is "not eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia"

The agent's assessment is consistent with UK Child Benefit rules as outlined in the official guidance, which states that Child Benefit continues for children under 20 only if they remain in approved education or training. Since Sofia left school at approximately 16, is not in any educational program, and is working 30 hours per week, she does not meet the criteria for extended eligibility.
