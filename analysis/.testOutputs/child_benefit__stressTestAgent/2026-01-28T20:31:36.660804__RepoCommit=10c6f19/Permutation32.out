2026-01-28T20:48:10.827818 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:48:12.557908 [actor]: child benefit 17 year old colege

2026-01-28T20:48:14.749830 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. So you have a 17-year-old who is in college.

To help determine your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for this 17-year-old? By this I mean, does the child live with you and do you financially support them?

2026-01-28T20:48:16.188747 [actor]: son lives with me goes colege

2026-01-28T20:48:18.541160 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son lives with you and goes to college.

Now I need to understand a bit more about his education. Is your son studying full-time at college, and is he enrolled in what's called "approved education or training"? This typically means courses up to and including A-levels or equivalent qualifications.

2026-01-28T20:48:19.858290 [actor]: 6 hours week gcse resits

2026-01-28T20:48:21.921822 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son is doing 6 hours per week of GCSE resits.

To clarify eligibility, I need to ask: Is this 6 hours per week course his only form of education or training, or is he also enrolled in other courses or qualifications at the same time?

2026-01-28T20:48:23.774443 [actor]: just the gcses 6 hours

2026-01-28T20:48:28.582906 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So your son is only doing 6 hours per week of GCSE resits.

Let me reflect on this information against the eligibility criteria. For a young person aged 16 or 17, they must be in **full-time non-advanced education or approved training** for you to continue receiving Child Benefit.

The key requirement is that the education must be full-time. Generally, full-time education means more than 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience.

Since your son is only doing 6 hours per week of GCSE resits, this would **not** meet the full-time education requirement.

Based on the information you've provided, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** for your 17-year-old son in this situation, as he is not in full-time education.

However, if his circumstances change - for example, if he enrolls in a full-time course (typically more than 12 hours per week) - you could then become eligible and should reapply or inform Child Benefit of the change.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-28T20:48:31.603162 [actor]: ok thanks

2026-01-28T20:48:33.708350 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that 6 hours per week of GCSE resits does not meet the full-time education requirement (which is more than 12 hours per week of supervised study) for a 17-year-old to qualify for Child Benefit, and correctly concluded that I am not eligible.
