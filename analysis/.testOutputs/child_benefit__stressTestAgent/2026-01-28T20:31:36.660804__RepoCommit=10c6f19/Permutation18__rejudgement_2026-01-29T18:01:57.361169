**Justification:**

The agent communicated that Raj would remain eligible for Child Benefit until 31st August, stating: "You should continue to get Child Benefit until the 31st August, as long as your son remains in his full-time A-level education."

However, according to the expected outcome and UK Child Benefit rules, **eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday itself**. The scenario explicitly states: "Once a child turns 20, they are no longer eligible for Child Benefit, even if they are still finishing their course."

Since Dev turned 20 last week, Raj is **no longer eligible** for Child Benefit as of that birthday. The agent's statement that benefits would continue until August 31st is incorrect. The agent should have communicated that eligibility ended on the 20th birthday (last week), making Raj **Not Eligible** going forward.

The agent's eligibility outcome (eligible until August) does **not agree** with the expected outcome (not eligible - eligibility ceased on 20th birthday).
