2026-01-27T22:03:09.038159 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed to correctly identify the exception that applies in this case. According to the scenario, if the married child lives with the parent and the parent is not financially supporting the spouse (or if the spouse is also in education/dependent), the parent can still claim Child Benefit. The expected outcome was "Eligible (via Exception)" but the agent incorrectly stated the claimant would not be eligible.
