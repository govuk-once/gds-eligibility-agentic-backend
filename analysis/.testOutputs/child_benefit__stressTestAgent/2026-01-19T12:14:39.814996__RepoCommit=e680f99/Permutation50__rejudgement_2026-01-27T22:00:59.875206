The agent correctly determined eligibility by verifying all required criteria - the 16-year-old daughter is in an approved training program (No One Left Behind through Skills Development Scotland), lives with the parent, the parent is a UK resident, and their income is below the threshold. The outcome matches the expected "Eligible" determination.
