First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:30:33.561123 [actor]: I need to understand more about your situation to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Based on your brief message, I'll need to engage with you as if I were a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-19T12:30:34.982138 [root_agent]: I understand you're mentioning children, an ex-partner, and payments. To clarify your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand your specific situation better.

Do you have responsibility for raising a child or children who live with you?

2026-01-19T12:30:38.421647 [root_agent]: I understand there may be a situation involving your ex-partner and regular payments. To determine your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to understand your specific circumstances.

Does the child or children currently live with you most of the time?

2026-01-19T12:30:39.381184 [actor]: children with ex give money 40 pounds week

2026-01-19T12:30:42.723216 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on what you've shared, it seems the children live with your ex-partner and you provide financial support of £40 per week.

In this case, since the children don't live with you, you would not normally be eligible to claim Child Benefit. Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who the child lives with.

The person who has the children living with them (your ex-partner in this case) would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit, as they have the main responsibility for the children's care.

Is there any formal family-based arrangement or court order regarding the care of the children that might affect this situation?

2026-01-19T12:30:43.776260 [actor]: ben 10 jerry 8 give money every week

2026-01-19T12:30:47.071991 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing those details. I understand that Ben is 10 years old and Jerry is 8 years old, and you give money every week for them.

Based on the UK government rules for Child Benefit, since the children (Ben and Jerry) don't live with you, you wouldn't typically be eligible to claim Child Benefit for them. Child Benefit is usually paid to the person who has the main day-to-day responsibility for the children.

If you're providing financial support through a private arrangement with your ex-partner, this is separate from the Child Benefit system.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of how Child Benefit works when children live with an ex-partner?

2026-01-19T12:30:47.992680 [actor]: pay 40 pounds

2026-01-19T12:30:50.994720 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you pay £40. 

Based on what you've shared so far, since Ben and Jerry (ages 10 and 8) live with your ex-partner and you provide financial support of £40 per week, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for them.

In the UK, Child Benefit is paid to the person who has main responsibility for the child or children and who they live with. In your situation, your ex-partner would likely be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit since the children live with them.

Your weekly payments are a separate arrangement and don't affect the Child Benefit eligibility rules.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to explain?

2026-01-19T12:30:54.899862 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that since the children live with the ex-partner, the user would not be eligible for Child Benefit as it's paid to the person who has main responsibility for the children.
