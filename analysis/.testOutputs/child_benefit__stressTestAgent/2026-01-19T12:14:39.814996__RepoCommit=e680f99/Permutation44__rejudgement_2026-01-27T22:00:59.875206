The scenario indicates the expected outcome should be "Eligible" but the agent incorrectly determined the user was not eligible for Child Benefit. The agent missed the specific rule that allows eligibility when a child spends at least 24 hours a week at home, which Leo does (25 hours from Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am).
