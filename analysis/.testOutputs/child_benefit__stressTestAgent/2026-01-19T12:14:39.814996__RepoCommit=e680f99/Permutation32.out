2026-01-19T12:27:07.057804 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T12:27:07.972087 [actor]: child son 17 in college few hours pete

2026-01-19T12:27:09.071799 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To better understand your situation, may I ask if you are the person who is primarily responsible for your 17-year-old son?

2026-01-19T12:27:09.872310 [actor]: yes father single parent

2026-01-19T12:27:11.571839 [root_agent]: I understand you're a single parent caring for your 17-year-old son. Is your son currently in approved education or training? (This would include things like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or similar approved courses)

2026-01-19T12:27:12.390323 [actor]: gcse resit college

2026-01-19T12:27:13.643547 [root_agent]: Thank you. GCSE resits at college would qualify as approved education.

Could you tell me if your son normally lives with you in the UK?

2026-01-19T12:27:14.546115 [actor]: home with me yes games a lot

2026-01-19T12:27:16.147862 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son lives with you in the UK.

Regarding eligibility based on age and education, may I ask if your son's GCSE resit course involves at least 12 hours per week of supervised study?

2026-01-19T12:27:17.081173 [actor]: six hours college rest home gaming

2026-01-19T12:27:19.585180 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since your son is studying for GCSE resits but only attending college for six hours per week (which is less than the 12 hours of supervised study required), I need to check one more point to determine eligibility.

Is your son currently registered or looking for work with your local careers service or Connexions? (This can sometimes allow eligibility to continue)

2026-01-19T12:27:20.425707 [actor]: no just games home

2026-01-19T12:27:25.197687 [root_agent]: I understand your situation better now. Based on the information you've provided:

After careful consideration of the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, I need to inform you that your 17-year-old son doesn't appear to meet the current requirements. Child Benefit can typically be claimed for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. 

While your son is doing GCSE resits, the course needs to involve at least 12 hours per week of supervised study to qualify as approved education. Since he's only attending college for six hours per week and is not registered with a careers service, he doesn't meet the education requirement for Child Benefit eligibility.

If your son's circumstances change - for example, if his course hours increase to 12+ hours per week, or if he registers with a careers service - you may want to reassess his eligibility at that time.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other potential support that might be available to you?

2026-01-19T12:27:27.147895 [actor]: I see not eligible no money for pete

2026-01-19T12:27:29.944168 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit eligibility for a 17-year-old requires at least 12 hours of supervised study per week or registration with careers services, neither of which the son meets.
