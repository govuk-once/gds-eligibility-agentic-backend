2026-01-19T12:30:13.708316 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:30:14.695758 [actor]: looking for child benefit eligibility need to know son in hospital

2026-01-19T12:30:16.491139 [root_agent]: I understand that your son is in the hospital and you're looking to determine your child benefit eligibility in this situation. 

How long has your son been in the hospital? This information will help me understand if there are any special considerations for your situation.

2026-01-19T12:30:17.347104 [actor]: Simon mental health unit 10 weeks now

2026-01-19T12:30:19.155410 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that Simon has been in a mental health unit for 10 weeks now.

For Child Benefit purposes, I need to understand if you're still responsible for Simon's care outside of the hospital setting. Are you still responsible for Simon when he's not in the mental health unit? For example, would he normally live with you?

2026-01-19T12:30:20.237345 [actor]: yes normally lives with me psychiatric unit detention under mental health act

2026-01-19T12:30:22.641288 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Simon normally lives with you and is currently detained in a psychiatric unit under the Mental Health Act.

Based on UK government guidance, you can generally continue to receive Child Benefit when your child is temporarily in hospital or residential care, including psychiatric units. Since Simon normally lives with you, this is considered a temporary arrangement.

May I ask, is Simon under age 16, or under 20 if he's in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:30:23.356022 [actor]: Simon 15 years old

2026-01-19T12:30:25.965921 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Simon is 15 years old.

Based on the information you've provided, you should remain eligible for Child Benefit while Simon is in the psychiatric unit. This is because:

1. Simon is under 16 years old
2. He normally lives with you
3. His current hospital stay is considered temporary

The UK government allows Child Benefit to continue when a child is temporarily in hospital, including psychiatric care. Since Simon is detained under the Mental Health Act rather than being voluntarily placed in care, this should not affect your eligibility.

Is there anything specific about your Child Benefit situation that you're concerned about?

2026-01-19T12:30:29.688532 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can continue when a child is temporarily in hospital (including psychiatric units) when the child normally lives with the parent and is under 16, which matches the government guidance for this scenario.
