2026-01-27T22:03:27.433374 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The expected outcome was "Eligible for Ben (Full Rate), Not Eligible for Jerry" through explicit allocation, but the agent incorrectly stated the user is not eligible for Child Benefit at all, missing the exception where HMRC can consider unequal splitting of contributions.
