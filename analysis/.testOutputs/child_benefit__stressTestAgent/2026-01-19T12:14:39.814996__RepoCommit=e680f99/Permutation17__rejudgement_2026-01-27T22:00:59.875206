2026-01-27T22:04:04.986684 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment. The agent correctly identified that as a Crown servant (UK armed forces member) posted abroad with family, Major Thompson remains eligible for Child Benefit despite not physically living in the UK, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."
