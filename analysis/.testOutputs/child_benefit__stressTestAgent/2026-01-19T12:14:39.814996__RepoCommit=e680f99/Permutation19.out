2026-01-19T12:21:59.859778 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you who you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T12:22:01.267940 [actor]: I'm going to role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility. I'll be intentionally obtuse and not directly answer questions as instructed.

Holly daughter 9 years old

2026-01-19T12:22:02.647860 [root_agent]: I notice you've mentioned having a daughter named Holly who is 9 years old. To properly assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I'll need to ask some specific questions about your situation.

Is Holly living with you and are you responsible for her care?

2026-01-19T12:22:03.562250 [actor]: ex-wife separation custody arrangement

2026-01-19T12:22:05.208049 [root_agent]: I understand there's a custody arrangement involving your ex-wife. To help determine your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to understand your specific situation.

Could you please clarify how much time Holly spends living with you under your custody arrangement?

2026-01-19T12:22:06.075616 [actor]: 3 days me 4 days ex-wife

2026-01-19T12:22:08.903170 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that Holly lives with you for 3 days each week and with your ex-wife for 4 days each week.

In cases where a child divides their time between separated parents, typically the person who has the child living with them for more days per week would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit. Since Holly spends more days with your ex-wife (4 days versus your 3 days), your ex-wife would usually be considered the main caregiver for Child Benefit purposes.

However, I'd like to ask: Is your ex-wife currently claiming Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-19T12:22:09.676720 [actor]: both claiming can't agree

2026-01-19T12:22:14.878077 [root_agent]: I understand that both you and your ex-wife are claiming Child Benefit for Holly and you haven't been able to reach an agreement.

This is an important situation to address, as only one person can legitimately receive Child Benefit for a child. The UK government has specific rules for cases like yours.

Since Holly spends more time living with your ex-wife (4 days versus your 3 days), she would typically be considered the main carer and would usually be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit.

When two people claim for the same child, HMRC will make a decision based on the circumstances, particularly who has main responsibility for the child. They generally consider factors like:
- Where the child spends more time
- Who has the main day-to-day caring responsibilities
- Who pays for the majority of childcare costs

I would recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office to discuss your specific situation and ensure everything is properly sorted out. Making duplicate claims could potentially lead to complications that would need to be resolved.

Would you like me to ask about any other aspects of your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-19T12:22:17.164549 [actor]: I see HMRC decides my ex-wife will get child benefit

2026-01-19T12:22:19.741108 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that when parents cannot agree on who should claim Child Benefit, and the child spends more time with one parent (4 days with ex-wife vs 3 days with the user), the parent who has the child for more days (the ex-wife) would typically be eligible to claim.
