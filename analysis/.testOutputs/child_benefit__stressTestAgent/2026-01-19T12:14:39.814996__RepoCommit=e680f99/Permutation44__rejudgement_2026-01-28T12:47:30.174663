2026-01-28T12:49:52.370109 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the user was not eligible for Child Benefit, when according to the expected outcome, the user should be eligible. The agent failed to identify that children who spend at least 24 hours a week at home (which Leo does with 25 hours from Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am) may qualify for Child Benefit even when in local authority care for more than 8 weeks.
