2026-01-19T12:18:17.273576 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:18:19.830807 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand you have a 5-year-old child and may be job seeking, with some connection to both Germany and the UK.

Are you currently living in the UK with your 5-year-old child?

2026-01-19T12:18:22.202719 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have Pre-Settled Status in the UK, your son Hans lives with you, and you're looking for work.

To clarify about your son Hans - is he living with you in the UK right now?

2026-01-19T12:18:24.514018 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you and Hans live together at a UK address.

Are you responsible for Hans's care? By this I mean, do you provide for his day-to-day care and support?

2026-01-19T12:18:27.222009 [root_agent]: I understand that you are Hans's father and you take care of him - feeding him, clothing him, and managing his schooling.

Given the information you've shared, there's one more important question: Does anyone else receive Child Benefit payments for Hans already?

2026-01-19T12:18:28.032823 [actor]: no payments nobody else claim

2026-01-19T12:18:31.457306 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Hans.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have Pre-Settled Status in the UK
- Your 5-year-old son Hans lives with you at a UK address
- You are responsible for his care (feeding, clothing, and schooling)
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

It appears you would likely be eligible for Child Benefit. As someone with Pre-Settled Status who is living in the UK and responsible for a child under 16, you generally meet the basic eligibility requirements.

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to fill out and submit a Child Benefit claim form (CH2). Would you like me to explain more about the application process or any other aspects of Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T12:18:34.853732 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly assessed that someone with Pre-Settled Status living in the UK with responsibility for their 5-year-old child would be eligible for Child Benefit, which is correct according to gov.uk guidelines.
