2026-01-19T12:19:54.337143 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First question: Are you responsible for a child under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:19:55.174412 [actor]: child Noah six

2026-01-19T12:19:56.347932 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you have a six-year-old child named Noah.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask: Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-19T12:19:57.150409 [actor]: uk resident yes

2026-01-19T12:19:58.945853 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK resident.

Next question: Are you primarily responsible for Noah's care? This typically means Noah lives with you or you pay towards their upkeep at least equal to the weekly rate of Child Benefit.

2026-01-19T12:19:59.775985 [actor]: noah grandmother surgery recovering

2026-01-19T12:20:01.423088 [root_agent]: I understand Noah is with his grandmother while recovering from surgery. 

To clarify your situation better: Is this a temporary arrangement while Noah recovers, or is Noah permanently living with his grandmother?

2026-01-19T12:20:02.250663 [actor]: temporary six weeks

2026-01-19T12:20:04.095229 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since this is a temporary arrangement for six weeks while Noah recovers, and you remain primarily responsible for Noah, this shouldn't affect your Child Benefit eligibility.

Next question: Are there any immigration conditions that restrict your access to public funds or benefits in the UK?

2026-01-19T12:20:04.773844 [actor]: no restrictions

2026-01-19T12:20:06.073041 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming there are no immigration restrictions.

Next question: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T12:20:07.176209 [actor]: single mum no job now

2026-01-19T12:20:10.400799 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. As a single mother currently without employment, your income would be below the threshold where Child Benefit might be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You're responsible for a child under 16 (Noah, age 6)
- You're a UK resident
- The temporary arrangement with Noah staying with his grandmother doesn't change your primary responsibility
- You have no immigration restrictions
- Your income is below the threshold that would affect Child Benefit

It appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit. You would be able to receive £24.00 per week for Noah as your eldest or only child.

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T12:20:12.110785 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know I'm eligible for Child Benefit. This is helpful to know while Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother during my recovery from surgery.

2026-01-19T12:20:14.806753 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the user is eligible for Child Benefit since Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother, and the user remains primarily responsible for Noah's care.
