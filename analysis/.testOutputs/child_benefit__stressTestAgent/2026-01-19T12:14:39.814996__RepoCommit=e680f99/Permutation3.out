2026-01-19T12:15:24.526130 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T12:15:25.955911 [actor]: Child benefit

2026-01-19T12:15:27.035972 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK.

Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T12:15:27.787344 [actor]: Ben lives with me

2026-01-19T12:15:29.022751 [root_agent]: I understand that Ben lives with you. To help determine your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to ask a few more questions.

How old is Ben?

2026-01-19T12:15:29.704034 [actor]: 17

2026-01-19T12:15:31.698704 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Ben is 17, I need to ask about his education status to determine your eligibility.

Is Ben in approved education, such as A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or similar approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:15:32.953148 [actor]: Not in college looking for job

2026-01-19T12:15:36.398241 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Ben at this time. Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. Since Ben is 17 and not in approved education or training, he doesn't meet the eligibility criteria.

If Ben starts approved education or training before his 19th birthday, you could become eligible again. Approved education generally means at least 12 hours a week of supervised study in courses like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or other qualifying education programs.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T12:15:37.227304 [actor]: Left school in June registered with careers service

2026-01-19T12:15:40.675595 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that additional information. This changes my assessment.

If Ben left school in June and is registered with the careers service, he may qualify under what's called "extension period" rules. Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after a young person leaves approved education if they're registered with a careers service, Connexions, local authority support service, or similar organization.

Given this information, you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Ben during this extension period (up to 20 weeks from when he left school in June). I would recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office to confirm your specific situation and to ensure you receive any benefits you're entitled to.

Would you like to know what information you might need when contacting the Child Benefit Office?

2026-01-19T12:15:41.475537 [actor]: So am I eligible for child benefit?

2026-01-19T12:15:44.424230 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, yes, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Ben, but only for a limited time.

Since Ben is 17, left school in June, and is registered with the careers service, you should be eligible for Child Benefit under the extension period rules. This extension typically lasts for up to 20 weeks after a young person leaves approved education.

This means you can continue receiving Child Benefit during this transition period while Ben is registered with the careers service and looking for work. However, this is a temporary extension, not an ongoing eligibility.

I would recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly to confirm your specific situation and the exact end date of your eligibility period.

2026-01-19T12:15:48.046062 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that the user would be eligible for Child Benefit for their 17-year-old son under the extension period rules since he left school in June and is registered with careers service.
