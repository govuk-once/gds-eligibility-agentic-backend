2026-01-28T12:49:39.197411 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the father was not eligible for Child Benefit. According to the exception rule, if the married child (Rashid) lives with the claimant and depends on them (which appears to be the case), the parent can often retain eligibility, especially if they are not financially supporting the spouse or the spouse is also dependent.
