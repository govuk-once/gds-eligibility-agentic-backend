2026-01-19T12:29:02.247071 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you several questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:29:04.172859 [actor]: I need to understand your situation to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me respond to the agent's question as instructed in your role.

Child Nina living with me now. Friend's daughter. Mother sick.

2026-01-19T12:29:05.901156 [root_agent]: I understand that you currently have a child named Nina living with you, who is your friend's daughter, because her mother is sick. 

To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old Nina is?

2026-01-19T12:29:06.863595 [actor]: Nina 10 years old. Staying with me long time.

2026-01-19T12:29:09.054943 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Nina is 10 years old and staying with you for what seems to be an extended period.

Since this appears to be an arrangement where you're caring for someone else's child, I need to understand the formal nature of this arrangement. Has Nina's mother officially transferred responsibility for Nina to you, or do you have any formal arrangement in place (such as fostering, special guardianship, etc.)?

2026-01-19T12:29:10.364087 [actor]: Private arrangement. Nina mother my best friend. Local council knows. Not getting money from council.

2026-01-19T12:29:12.775499 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining. I understand this is a private arrangement where you're caring for your best friend's daughter Nina, and the local council is aware of the situation, but you're not receiving any financial support from them.

To determine your eligibility for Child Benefit in this situation, I need to know if you're the main person caring for Nina on a day-to-day basis? This would include things like providing meals, clothing, and making decisions about her care and schooling.

2026-01-19T12:29:13.689813 [actor]: Yes feeding Nina. Buying clothes. Taking school. Everything now.

2026-01-19T12:29:16.711318 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on what you've shared, since you're providing day-to-day care for Nina - including feeding her, buying her clothes, taking her to school, and handling all her daily needs - you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for her.

In situations where someone is caring for a friend's child, the person who has the child living with them and is responsible for their day-to-day care can typically claim Child Benefit, even if it's through a private arrangement.

One more question: Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Nina, such as her mother?

2026-01-19T12:29:17.647977 [actor]: Don't know. Mother too sick now. Hospital long time.

2026-01-19T12:29:22.233600 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that Nina's mother is seriously ill and has been in the hospital for a long time, and you're not sure if she's currently claiming Child Benefit for Nina.

Based on what you've told me, since you're providing full-time care for Nina and are responsible for her day-to-day needs, you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for her. When a child goes to live with someone else, the person who has the child living with them can usually claim Child Benefit.

What I would recommend is that you apply for Child Benefit for Nina. In your application, you should explain the circumstances - that you're caring for your friend's child while the mother is seriously ill in hospital. If Nina's mother is currently receiving Child Benefit, the payments to her would typically stop when you make your claim.

To apply, you'll need to fill out a Child Benefit claim form (CH2). Would you like me to explain more about the application process or is there something specific about your eligibility that you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-19T12:29:24.891042 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know I can get child benefit. Where get form apply?

2026-01-19T12:29:26.854266 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that as the person providing day-to-day care for a friend's child, the user would be eligible to claim Child Benefit even under a private arrangement.
