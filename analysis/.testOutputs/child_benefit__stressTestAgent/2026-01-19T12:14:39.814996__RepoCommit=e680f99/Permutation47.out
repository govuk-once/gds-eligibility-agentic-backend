2026-01-19T12:34:00.916958 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you several questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:34:02.402754 [actor]: I need to role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. According to the context, I'm James who doesn't live with his child but pays £50 weekly for maintenance due to a court order.

child benefit court order pay child not living with me

2026-01-19T12:34:04.388525 [root_agent]: I notice there may be some confusion. I'm here to help you understand your specific situation regarding Child Benefit eligibility. 

Based on what you've mentioned, it seems you don't live with your child and you're paying £50 weekly for maintenance due to a court order.

To clarify your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask - is anyone else (such as the other parent) currently claiming Child Benefit for this child?

2026-01-19T12:34:05.309260 [actor]: other parent gets money for child court ordered payments £50 weekly

2026-01-19T12:34:08.191197 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that the other parent is receiving Child Benefit for your child, and you're making court-ordered maintenance payments of £50 weekly.

In this situation, since the child is not living with you and the other parent is already claiming Child Benefit, you would typically not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for the same child. Child Benefit is usually paid to the person the child lives with.

The maintenance payments you're making as ordered by the court are separate from Child Benefit entitlement.

However, I'd like to ask: Do you have any other children who live with you that you might be claiming Child Benefit for?

2026-01-19T12:34:09.397662 [actor]: forced to pay shouldn't have to is other parent eligible if I'm paying

2026-01-19T12:34:12.695193 [root_agent]: I understand your concern about making maintenance payments while the other parent receives Child Benefit.

To clarify: The court-ordered maintenance payments you're making (£50 weekly) and Child Benefit eligibility are separate matters under UK law. 

Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who the child lives with, regardless of maintenance payments. So if your child lives primarily with the other parent, they would generally be eligible for Child Benefit even though you're making maintenance payments.

The maintenance payments you're required to make are determined by the court based on your legal obligations to support your child financially, while Child Benefit is a separate government benefit designed to help with the costs of raising a child.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of how these systems work together?

2026-01-19T12:34:13.607009 [actor]: not fair paying money child not living with me can I claim

2026-01-19T12:34:18.179289 [root_agent]: I understand your frustration about the situation. It can certainly feel unfair when you're making payments but don't have the child living with you.

To directly answer your question: Generally, you cannot claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with you, even if you're making maintenance payments. Under UK rules, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with, as they're considered to have the day-to-day responsibility for caring for the child.

The maintenance payments you make through the court order are legally separate from Child Benefit eligibility. They're meant to contribute to your child's upbringing costs, while Child Benefit is a state benefit to help with child-raising expenses.

There are some exceptional circumstances where you might be eligible, such as if you're paying for your child's accommodation or maintenance while they're in education or training. 

Would it help if I explained more about these exceptions or if there are any other support options available to you as a non-resident parent?

2026-01-19T12:34:21.587412 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that when a child lives with one parent, that parent is typically eligible for Child Benefit, regardless of maintenance payments made by the non-resident parent.
