2026-01-28T12:49:17.213560 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly determined the user was not eligible for Child Benefit. According to gov.uk guidance, a person can claim Child Benefit if they pay an amount at least equal to the Child Benefit rate toward the child's maintenance. The combined contributions from Mo and the grandmother (£30/week) exceed the Child Benefit rate (£25.60), making Mo eligible to claim, but the agent repeatedly stated only the aunt could claim.
