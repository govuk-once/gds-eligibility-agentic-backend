2026-01-19T12:30:56.972918 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I need to ask you several questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:30:58.021044 [actor]: I'm going to role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

child 17 cardiff apprenticeship

2026-01-19T12:31:00.056534 [root_agent]: I understand you have a 17-year-old child in Cardiff who is doing an apprenticeship.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to know: Is your child's apprenticeship considered an approved education or training program? (Approved education typically includes A-levels, NVQs, and many apprenticeships where unpaid training makes up a significant part of the program.)

2026-01-19T12:31:00.862620 [actor]: foundation apprenticeship wales government funded

2026-01-19T12:31:02.798898 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Foundation apprenticeships in Wales that are government-funded are typically considered approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

My next question is: Are you responsible for this 17-year-old child? By "responsible," I mean do they normally live with you and you provide for their care?

2026-01-19T12:31:05.761075 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your daughter Sian lives with you.

Next question: Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year individually? This is important because while you may still be eligible for Child Benefit, those earning over £50,000 may be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge, with the benefit effectively tapering off completely at £60,000.

2026-01-19T12:31:08.436816 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that you work part-time in a shop. 

Next question: Does anyone else (such as another parent or guardian) receive Child Benefit for this child already?

2026-01-19T12:31:09.366457 [actor]: just me and sian mother

2026-01-19T12:31:13.348441 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're Sian's mother and it's just you and her in the household.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have a 17-year-old daughter named Sian who lives with you
- She is in a government-funded foundation apprenticeship in Wales (which counts as approved education)
- You work part-time in a shop (suggesting your income is likely below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold)
- You're the only parent/guardian in the household

From this, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit. As your daughter is under 20 and in approved education/training, and you're responsible for her care, you meet the main eligibility criteria.

Would you like me to explain how to apply for Child Benefit or provide any additional information about the benefit?

2026-01-19T12:31:17.143388 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information throughout the conversation and correctly determined eligibility for Child Benefit for a 17-year-old in an approved apprenticeship living with their parent.
