2026-01-19T12:26:03.600807 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you several questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:26:05.994202 [root_agent]: I'll help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit while visiting the UK with your son.

Are you and your son normally living in the UK? Or are you just visiting temporarily?

2026-01-19T12:26:06.739543 [actor]: tourist visa 6 months

2026-01-19T12:26:09.998472 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared, it appears you're visiting the UK on a tourist visa for 6 months with your son.

To be eligible for Child Benefit in the UK, you generally need to have the right to reside in the UK and consider the UK your main home (be "normally living" in the UK). Visitors on tourist visas are typically not considered to be normally living in the UK.

Since you're visiting temporarily on a tourist visa rather than residing in the UK permanently, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit during your stay.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available during your visit?

2026-01-19T12:26:13.168152 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that tourists on visitor visas are not eligible for Child Benefit as they are not considered to be "normally living" in the UK.
