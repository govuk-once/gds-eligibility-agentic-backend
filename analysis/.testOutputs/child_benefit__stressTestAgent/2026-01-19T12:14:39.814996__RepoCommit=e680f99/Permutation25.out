2026-01-19T12:24:18.816337 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First question: Are you responsible for a child under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:24:19.920716 [actor]: Leo care local authority 10 weeks husband pays £30 weekly

2026-01-19T12:24:21.851318 [root_agent]: I understand that this is regarding Leo, who is in local authority care for 10 weeks, and there's a payment of £30 weekly being made by your husband.

Since Leo is in local authority care, this affects Child Benefit eligibility. Let me ask: Is this local authority care arrangement temporary or permanent?

2026-01-19T12:24:22.815715 [actor]: temporary Leo 5 years old

2026-01-19T12:24:24.586762 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Leo is 5 years old and the local authority care arrangement is temporary.

For temporary care arrangements, Child Benefit rules can vary. How long has Leo been in local authority care so far? (The exact duration is important as it affects your eligibility)

2026-01-19T12:24:25.443343 [actor]: 10 weeks care no income husband pays

2026-01-19T12:24:27.611131 [root_agent]: I understand Leo has been in temporary local authority care for 10 weeks, he's 5 years old, and your husband is making payments of £30 weekly.

When a child is in local authority care, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks. However, since you mentioned your husband is making regular payments toward Leo's care, this might affect your eligibility.

Let me ask: Before Leo went into care, were you receiving Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-19T12:24:28.362652 [actor]: yes benefit before care

2026-01-19T12:24:30.831909 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you were receiving Child Benefit for Leo before he went into care.

Based on the UK government rules, when a child goes into local authority care, Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks. Since Leo has been in care for 10 weeks, your Child Benefit would normally have stopped.

However, since your husband is making regular contributions of £30 weekly toward Leo's care, this shows you're still contributing financially to his upbringing. This is an important factor.

Let me ask: Are you expecting Leo to return to live with you after this temporary care arrangement ends?

2026-01-19T12:24:31.741925 [actor]: yes return home husband pays £30 weekly

2026-01-19T12:24:36.059752 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Leo will return home after this temporary care arrangement and that your husband pays £30 weekly towards his care.

Based on the information you've provided and the UK government rules:

1. Since Leo is expected to return home (the care is temporary)
2. Your husband is making regular financial contributions (£30 weekly) toward Leo's care
3. You were previously receiving Child Benefit before Leo went into care

You may still be eligible for Child Benefit despite Leo being in local authority care for more than 8 weeks. The fact that you're maintaining financial support is important.

I would recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly to explain your specific situation, including the temporary nature of the care and the regular payments you're making. They can make a final determination based on your full circumstances and may be able to continue your payments or restore them when Leo returns home.

2026-01-19T12:24:39.706112 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that while Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks when a child is in local authority care, the regular financial contributions being made by the husband (£30 weekly) and the temporary nature of the care arrangement mean the person may still be eligible.
