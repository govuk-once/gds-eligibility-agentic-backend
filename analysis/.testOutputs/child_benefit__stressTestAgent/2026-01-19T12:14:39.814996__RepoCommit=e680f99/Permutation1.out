2026-01-19T12:14:41.975477 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:14:42.964265 [actor]: child 8 years old live with us

2026-01-19T12:14:44.624133 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have an 8-year-old child living with you. 

Is this child someone you're responsible for raising? By this I mean, do you provide a home for them and arrange and pay for their day-to-day care?

2026-01-19T12:14:45.609066 [actor]: yes my son Leo

2026-01-19T12:14:46.827674 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Leo is your son and that you're responsible for raising him. 

Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-19T12:14:47.632121 [actor]: Manchester family

2026-01-19T12:14:49.306624 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you live in Manchester, which is in the UK. 

Now I need to ask about immigration status. Do you have the right to live in the UK? This could be because you're a British citizen, have settled status, pre-settled status, or have another form of leave to remain.

2026-01-19T12:14:50.218636 [actor]: UK national born here

2026-01-19T12:14:51.553094 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK national born in the UK.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) earn over £60,000 per year in taxable income?

2026-01-19T12:14:52.574215 [actor]: husband teacher £35,000 me part-time £15,000

2026-01-19T12:14:56.952401 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since your combined household income is £50,000 (£35,000 + £15,000), which is below the £60,000 threshold, you would be eligible for the full Child Benefit payment.

If your household income had been between £50,000 and £60,000, you would have been eligible but would need to pay back some of the benefit through a tax charge. Since your income is exactly at £50,000, you should be eligible for the full amount without any tax charge.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have responsibility for your 8-year-old son, Leo
- You live in the UK (Manchester)
- You're a UK national
- Your household income is £50,000, which is below the Higher Income Child Benefit Charge threshold

You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. You can claim this benefit by filling out the CH2 claim form, which you can get online from GOV.UK, or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T12:14:59.075129 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know I'm eligible for Child Benefit. Will apply for CH2 form.

2026-01-19T12:15:00.821082 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about the parent's eligibility for Child Benefit based on having an 8-year-old child they're responsible for, living in the UK as a UK national, and having household income below the threshold that would require paying back some benefits through tax.
