According to the linking rule, when a child returns to hospital within 28 days (Arthur returned after 15 days), the hospital stays are linked and count as one continuous stay. The combined stay of 13 weeks (10 weeks + 3 weeks) exceeds the 12-week limit, making the user not eligible for Child Benefit.
