2026-01-27T22:03:11.384274 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that the jobseeker period is 6 months (182 days), when the correct time limit for a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status is only 91 days. Since Hans has been unemployed for 95 days (exceeding this limit) with no imminent job offer, the correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible (Expired)."
