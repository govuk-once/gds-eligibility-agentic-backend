2026-01-27T22:02:22.011264 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that an intermediate apprenticeship in England qualifies for Child Benefit. According to UK rules, government-funded apprenticeships in England are disqualifying events for Child Benefit, unlike staying in approved education. The correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
