2026-01-19T17:19:24.381036 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. To do this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for one or more children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T17:19:25.675299 [actor]: I'll help by playing the role of someone inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

daughter 16 years old lives with me

2026-01-19T17:19:27.582827 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Since your 16-year-old daughter lives with you, I need to know about her education status.

Is your 16-year-old daughter in approved education or training? (This generally includes things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved courses)

2026-01-19T17:19:28.383790 [actor]: training travel agent job

2026-01-19T17:19:30.361963 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

For your 16-year-old daughter's training as a travel agent, I need to understand if this is an approved education or training program for Child Benefit purposes.

Is her travel agent training part of an approved course such as an NVQ (up to level 3), BTEC, or other qualification that is recognized as approved education or training by the government?

2026-01-19T17:19:31.290223 [actor]: company pays training her new job

2026-01-19T17:19:35.381316 [root_agent]: I understand that your daughter is being trained by a company as part of her new job. 

Based on this information, it sounds like your daughter is in paid employment rather than in approved education or training as defined for Child Benefit purposes. Generally, paid employment or on-the-job training provided by an employer doesn't qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit eligibility.

Child Benefit typically continues until a child turns 16, or until they're 20 if they remain in approved education (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3) or approved training that is unpaid.

Since your daughter appears to be in paid employment with training provided by her employer, you may not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for her. 

May I ask if you have any other children under 16 or in approved education/training that you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T17:19:36.222583 [actor]: not paid job training course paid by employer

2026-01-19T17:19:38.578354 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. This is an important distinction.

If your daughter is on a training course that is paid for by an employer but she is not being paid herself (not in paid employment), then I need to understand more about the nature of this training.

Is this training course one that is recognized as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes? Examples would include courses like NVQs up to level 3, BTECs, or other similar qualifications that are unpaid and approved by the government.

2026-01-19T17:19:39.507755 [actor]: travel agent course employer pays

2026-01-19T17:19:41.825276 [root_agent]: Thank you for the additional information. 

I need to determine specifically what type of travel agent course this is to assess eligibility. For Child Benefit purposes, the course needs to be an "approved" education or training program.

Is your daughter's travel agent course leading to a recognized qualification such as an NVQ (up to level 3), BTEC, or another government-approved qualification? Or is it more of an internal company-specific training program?

2026-01-19T17:19:42.783387 [actor]: local travel agency hired her pays for training

2026-01-19T17:19:44.749140 [root_agent]: I understand that a local travel agency has hired your daughter and is paying for her training. 

To determine your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to clarify: Is your daughter receiving a wage or salary from this travel agency while she's being trained? Or is she in an unpaid training position where only the training costs are covered by the employer?

2026-01-19T17:19:45.614169 [actor]: employed by agency they pay training course

2026-01-19T17:19:48.883189 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since your daughter is employed by the travel agency (meaning she has an employment relationship with them), this would generally be considered employment rather than "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.

Child Benefit typically stops when a child leaves approved education or training, which usually happens when they start working. Even though the employer is paying for training courses as part of her job, this would still be classified as employment.

Based on this information, you would likely not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for your 16-year-old daughter, as she appears to be in employment rather than approved full-time education or training as defined by the Child Benefit rules.

Do you have any other children under 16, or between 16-20 who are in approved education or training, that you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T17:19:52.616579 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit would not continue for a 16-year-old who is employed by a travel agency, even if the employer pays for their training, as this doesn't qualify as approved education or training under Child Benefit rules.
