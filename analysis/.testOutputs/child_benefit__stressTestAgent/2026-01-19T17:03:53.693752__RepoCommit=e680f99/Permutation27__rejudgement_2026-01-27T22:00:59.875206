The agent correctly determined that as a 15-year-old parent, the user is eligible to claim Child Benefit for their baby Mia, while acknowledging that this might not be the most financially optimal arrangement compared to having the grandparents claim. The agent accurately explained all eligibility factors and payment scenarios without providing any incorrect information.
