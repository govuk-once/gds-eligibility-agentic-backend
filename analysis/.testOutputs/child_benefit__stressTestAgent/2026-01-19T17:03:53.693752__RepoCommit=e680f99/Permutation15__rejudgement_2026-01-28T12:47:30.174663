2026-01-28T12:49:01.175351 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent incorrectly communicated eligibility when the user was not eligible. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" and while the agent initially stated this correctly, they later incorrectly suggested the user might be eligible despite contributions (£10/week) being well below the required minimum (£26.05/week) to qualify as responsible for the child.
