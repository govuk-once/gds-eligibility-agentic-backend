2026-01-19T17:17:37.881399 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To do this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T17:17:39.972514 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand your situation better.

Is Jordan your child, and are they currently 17 years old?

2026-01-19T17:17:40.806599 [actor]: Yes my son 17 living with me

2026-01-19T17:17:42.438966 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Jordan is your 17-year-old son who lives with you.

Since you mentioned he left school, could you tell me what Jordan is doing now? For example, is he in any form of education, training, or employment?

2026-01-19T17:17:43.364545 [actor]: Left school last year finished GCSEs not working not in college

2026-01-19T17:17:46.565951 [root_agent]: I understand that Jordan is 17, left school last year after finishing his GCSEs, and is currently not working or in college.

Based on UK government rules, to be eligible for Child Benefit for a child aged 16-19, they need to be in approved education or training. Since Jordan is not currently in education, training, or registered with a careers service, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for him.

Child Benefit typically continues for children aged 16-19 only if they're in approved education (like A-levels or equivalent) or approved training programs. 

If Jordan decides to return to education or start an approved training program before his 20th birthday, you could become eligible again and should consider applying at that time.

2026-01-19T17:17:47.638641 [actor]: No child benefit then ok

2026-01-19T17:17:49.577970 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit requires children aged 16-19 to be in approved education or training, which Jordan is not.
