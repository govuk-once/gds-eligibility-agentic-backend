The agent incorrectly stated the user might be eligible based on the 25-hour weekend visits, but the agent was actually correct. Per gov.uk guidance, a child in care needs to spend "at least 24 hours a week" with the claimant to qualify, which Leo does at 25 hours (Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am). The expected outcome was "Eligible" which matches what the agent eventually concluded.
