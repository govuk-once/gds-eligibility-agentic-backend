2026-01-19T17:20:37.627653 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To do this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T17:20:38.729314 [actor]: child 16 finished GCSEs

2026-01-19T17:20:39.747822 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To understand your situation better, is this 16-year-old child living with you?

2026-01-19T17:20:40.669949 [actor]: yes lives with me college september

2026-01-19T17:20:42.549062 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that your 16-year-old child who has finished their GCSEs lives with you and will be starting college in September.

Is your child planning to attend approved education (like A-levels, T-levels, or other full-time education) or training when they start college in September?

2026-01-19T17:20:43.366666 [actor]: A levels starting college

2026-01-19T17:20:44.829497 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year in individual adjusted net income?

2026-01-19T17:20:45.675268 [actor]: no money problems single parent

2026-01-19T17:20:47.051126 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. 

Do you have the right to live in the UK (for example, you're a UK national or have settled status or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme)?

2026-01-19T17:20:47.951442 [actor]: UK citizen born here

2026-01-19T17:20:52.002844 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK citizen born in the UK.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have a 16-year-old child who has finished GCSEs and will be starting A-levels at college in September
- Your child lives with you
- You're a single parent with an income below £60,000
- You are a UK citizen

I can confirm that you should be eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit can continue for children aged 16-19 if they stay in approved education, which includes A-levels. Since your child is continuing their education in September with A-levels, you would remain eligible.

If you're not already claiming Child Benefit for this child, you can apply online through the GOV.UK website or by filling in a CH2 form. If you're already receiving it, the payments should continue as long as your child remains in approved education.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T17:20:55.709981 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a 16-year-old continuing with A-level education in September, correctly noting that the parent qualifies as a UK citizen with a child in approved education.
