2026-01-19T17:22:10.125933 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First question: Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T17:22:11.022142 [actor]: adoption allowance special needs kids 6 and 8

2026-01-19T17:22:12.399349 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. To better understand your situation regarding Child Benefit eligibility for your special needs adopted children ages 6 and 8, I need to ask some specific questions.

Are you responsible for these adopted children who are living with you?

2026-01-19T17:22:13.288847 [actor]: yes they live with me got adoption allowance from council

2026-01-19T17:22:14.647049 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that the children live with you and that you receive adoption allowance from the council.

Are both children under 16 years old? (I can see you mentioned they are 6 and 8, but I just need to confirm this for eligibility purposes.)

2026-01-19T17:22:15.436143 [actor]: 6 and 8 yes brother and sister

2026-01-19T17:22:17.092405 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that the children are 6 and 8 years old and they are siblings.

Do you normally live in the UK? (This is relevant for Child Benefit eligibility.)

2026-01-19T17:22:17.998054 [actor]: live in Leeds for 10 years

2026-01-19T17:22:19.512412 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in Leeds and have been there for 10 years.

Do you have the right to reside in the UK? (This could include being a UK citizen, having settled or pre-settled status, or another immigration status that gives you the right to live in the UK.)

2026-01-19T17:22:20.245447 [actor]: british citizen born here

2026-01-19T17:22:23.114524 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a British citizen born in the UK.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you meet the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit:

- You're responsible for two adopted children aged 6 and 8 who live with you
- The children are under 16
- You live in the UK (Leeds for 10 years)
- You are a British citizen with the right to reside in the UK

You should be eligible to claim Child Benefit. However, I should note that if either you or your partner has an individual income over £50,000 per year, you may have to pay back some of the benefit in the form of the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Would you like me to ask about your income to check if this might affect your Child Benefit payment?

2026-01-19T17:22:26.279918 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that someone with adopted children aged 6 and 8 living with them in the UK who is a British citizen is eligible for Child Benefit, which aligns with gov.uk guidelines.
