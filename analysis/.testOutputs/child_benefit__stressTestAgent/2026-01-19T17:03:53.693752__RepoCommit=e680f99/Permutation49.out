2026-01-19T17:26:10.509212 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:26:12.166317 [actor]: I need to roleplay as a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the instructions to be deliberately obtuse, answer like I'm using search terms, and not directly answer questions.

my son Tom job training course employer pays

2026-01-19T17:26:13.679188 [root_agent]: I notice you've mentioned your son Tom who is on a job training course paid by an employer. This helps, but I need to gather more specific information to determine your eligibility for Child Benefit.

How old is your son Tom?

2026-01-19T17:26:14.576091 [actor]: son 17 years old computer coding

2026-01-19T17:26:16.712957 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that your son is 17 years old and is doing computer coding. 

Is this computer coding course approved education or training? By approved, I mean is it a qualifying course recognized by the UK education system (such as A-levels, NVQs, or other approved training)?

2026-01-19T17:26:17.508532 [actor]: future employer pays course fees agreement join company after

2026-01-19T17:26:19.545806 [root_agent]: I understand your son's course fees are being paid by a future employer with an agreement to join the company afterward.

To determine if this qualifies for Child Benefit, I need to confirm if this training is considered "approved education or training" under UK government guidelines. 

Is this computer coding training part of an apprenticeship program, a traineeship, or another government-recognized training scheme?

2026-01-19T17:26:20.515516 [actor]: not apprenticeship just coding course employer pays no salary now job later

2026-01-19T17:26:22.949373 [root_agent]: I understand it's not an apprenticeship, but rather a coding course paid for by an employer with a job promised afterward, but no salary during the training.

For Child Benefit purposes, I need to determine if this course qualifies as approved education or training. 

Is this coding course provided by a recognized educational institution like a college, or is it a private training program? Also, is the course full-time (at least 12 hours of supervised study per week)?

2026-01-19T17:26:23.865033 [actor]: private company training program 20 hours weekly

2026-01-19T17:26:26.079128 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. The training is through a private company for 20 hours weekly.

To determine Child Benefit eligibility for a 17-year-old, the education or training needs to be "approved" under UK guidelines. Generally, approved education includes courses at schools or colleges, or training courses approved by the Department for Education.

Is your son living with you at your home while doing this training program?

2026-01-19T17:26:26.927988 [actor]: lives home with me

2026-01-19T17:26:28.409155 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son lives at home with you.

Since your son is 17 and living with you, the next question is important for determining Child Benefit eligibility: 

Has your son completed education up to A-level or equivalent before starting this private training program?

2026-01-19T17:26:29.217558 [actor]: finished GCSEs only

2026-01-19T17:26:32.628501 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know your son has finished his GCSEs only.

Based on the information you've provided:
- Your son is 17 years old
- He lives with you at home
- He has completed his GCSEs
- He is now in a private company training program for 20 hours weekly
- The training is paid for by a future employer (with no current salary)

Since your son is under 20 and in what appears to be full-time training (over 12 hours per week), you may be eligible for Child Benefit. However, there's a key question about whether this specific private company training program qualifies as "approved education or training" under UK government guidelines.

Do you know if this private training program is recognized or approved by a UK education authority or the Department for Education?

2026-01-19T17:26:33.364930 [actor]: not government approved just employer agreement

2026-01-19T17:26:37.817864 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that the training program is not government-approved and is just based on an employer agreement.

Unfortunately, for Child Benefit eligibility for a child aged 16 or over, they must be in "approved education or training" as defined by UK government guidelines. Approved education or training typically includes:

- A-levels or similar qualifications at a school or college
- T levels
- Scottish Highers
- NVQs and other vocational qualifications up to level 3
- Home education (if it started before age 16)
- Traineeships in England

Since your son's private company training program is not government-approved, it doesn't appear to meet the criteria for approved education or training required for Child Benefit eligibility.

Based on this information, you would likely not be eligible for Child Benefit for your 17-year-old son in this specific situation. 

Do you have any other children you're responsible for who might qualify for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T17:26:40.046456 [actor]: I understand now. No other children just Tom.

2026-01-19T17:26:41.614742 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that Child Benefit eligibility for a 17-year-old requires approved education or training, which the private company training program does not qualify for.
