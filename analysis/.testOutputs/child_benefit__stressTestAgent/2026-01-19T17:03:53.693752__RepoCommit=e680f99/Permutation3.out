2026-01-19T17:04:32.026925 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. To assess your eligibility properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:04:32.874608 [actor]: child benefit son left school

2026-01-19T17:04:33.966128 [root_agent]: I understand your son has left school. To help determine your Child Benefit eligibility, may I ask how old your son is currently?

2026-01-19T17:04:34.700023 [actor]: he is 17

2026-01-19T17:04:36.520557 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son is 17 and has left school, I need to understand his current situation better.

Is your son in any approved education or training program now? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, T levels, or other approved courses.

2026-01-19T17:04:37.319564 [actor]: looking for apprenticeship

2026-01-19T17:04:40.714631 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since your son is 17 and has left school but is currently looking for an apprenticeship (rather than actively participating in one), I need to understand this situation carefully.

Based on UK government rules, Child Benefit typically continues for children under 20 who are in approved education or training. When a young person leaves approved education or training and is just looking for opportunities (like an apprenticeship), they generally no longer qualify for Child Benefit.

However, there is sometimes a grace period where payments can continue for a short time while a young person is registered for work or training with an approved body.

May I ask if your son is registered with any education or training provider, or with a careers service, local authority, or similar organization while looking for his apprenticeship?

2026-01-19T17:04:41.445107 [actor]: careers service

2026-01-19T17:04:44.078223 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son is registered with a careers service while looking for an apprenticeship, there may be a possibility of continued Child Benefit for a limited period.

Child Benefit can sometimes continue for up to 20 weeks if your child is registered with a careers service, local authority, or other training provider while looking for work or training. This is known as an "extension period."

Has your son been registered with the careers service immediately after leaving education, and for approximately how long has he been looking for an apprenticeship?

2026-01-19T17:04:44.943352 [actor]: left school in June

2026-01-19T17:04:46.276285 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that your son left school in June. To understand your situation better:

Is your son officially registered with the careers service, and if so, when did he register with them after leaving school in June?

2026-01-19T17:04:47.213445 [actor]: registered with youth careers service

2026-01-19T17:04:50.784370 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son is registered with the youth careers service. This is important information.

Based on the UK government rules, your son may qualify for continued Child Benefit under the extension period (up to 20 weeks) since he is:
1. 17 years old
2. Has left approved education (school) in June
3. Is registered with the youth careers service
4. Is actively looking for an apprenticeship

The 20-week extension period typically begins immediately after leaving education. Since he left school in June, you may still be within this extension period depending on the exact date and the current month.

To be completely certain about your eligibility, may I ask if you've received any notification from the Child Benefit Office about stopping your payments, or if you've informed them about your son leaving school?

2026-01-19T17:04:51.711243 [actor]: it's august

2026-01-19T17:04:55.451196 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that it's currently August. Since your son left school in June and it's now August, you are likely still within the 20-week extension period for Child Benefit.

If your son left school in June and immediately registered with the youth careers service, the extension period would run for up to 20 weeks from when he left school (approximately from June until October/November, depending on the exact date in June).

Based on this information, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit during this extension period, as long as:
1. Your son remains registered with the youth careers service
2. He continues to look for work or training (like an apprenticeship)
3. He hasn't yet turned 18 (though the extension would continue even if he turns 18 during this period)

Have you informed the Child Benefit Office about your son leaving school and registering with the careers service?

2026-01-19T17:04:59.383616 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about the 20-week extension period for Child Benefit when a 17-year-old has left school (June) and is registered with a careers service while looking for an apprenticeship.
