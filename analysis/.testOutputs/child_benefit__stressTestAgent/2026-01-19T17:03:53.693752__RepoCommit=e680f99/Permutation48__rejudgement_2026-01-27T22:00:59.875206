2026-01-27T22:02:11.130294 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent initially gave incorrect information, stating the user was eligible when HNC courses (advanced education) don't qualify for Child Benefit. Although the correction came from the user, not the agent, the agent still failed to provide the correct outcome without this prompting.
