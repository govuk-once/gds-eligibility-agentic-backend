2026-01-27T22:01:55.862944 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. According to gov.uk guidelines, in Scotland (as in England and Northern Ireland), you generally cannot get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship. Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland are not considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes. The agent incorrectly advised the parent they would be eligible when the correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
