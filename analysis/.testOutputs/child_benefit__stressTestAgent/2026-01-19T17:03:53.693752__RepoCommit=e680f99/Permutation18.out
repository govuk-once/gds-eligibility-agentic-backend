2026-01-19T17:10:54.269662 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T17:10:56.843445 [root_agent]: I notice you've mentioned "child dev school," but I need to understand your situation a bit more clearly to determine your Child Benefit eligibility.

Could you confirm if you are responsible for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:10:59.430362 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that you have a son who is developing through A-levels.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask if your son is under 20 years of age and currently in approved education (such as A-levels)?

2026-01-19T17:11:00.354288 [actor]: dev studying a levels, turned 20 last month

2026-01-19T17:11:03.128080 [root_agent]: I understand your son is studying A-levels but has recently turned 20 last month. 

Based on UK government rules, Child Benefit typically stops on August 31st following a child's 16th birthday unless they stay in approved education or training. However, once they turn 20, they no longer qualify even if they're still studying.

Since your son has now turned 20, I'm afraid you would no longer be eligible for Child Benefit for him, even though he is still studying A-levels.

Would you like me to provide any additional information about this?

2026-01-19T17:11:04.297025 [actor]: no child benefit then?

2026-01-19T17:11:06.643865 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately informed the user that Child Benefit stops once a child turns 20, even if they are still in approved education or training such as A-levels.
