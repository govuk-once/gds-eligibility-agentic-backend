While they eventually acknowledged financial contributions may allow a claim if the child's caretaker hasn't claimed, they stated the contributions from the father and grandmother together (£15+£15=£30) could be considered, but initially spent most of the conversation incorrectly stating only the aunt would be eligible regardless of financial support.
