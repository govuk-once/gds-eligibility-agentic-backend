2026-01-19T17:14:53.444455 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To determine this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T17:14:54.876229 [actor]: I need to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit by playing the role of a user according to the scenario provided.

child benefit eligibility child in care

2026-01-19T17:14:56.826454 [root_agent]: I understand you're interested in determining Child Benefit eligibility specifically for a child in care. Let me help you understand this situation.

If a child is in care (such as foster care or residential care arranged by a local authority), this affects Child Benefit eligibility. 

May I ask if you have a child who is currently in care? This will help me provide you with the most accurate information about your potential eligibility.

2026-01-19T17:14:57.763883 [actor]: local authority care 10 weeks son Leo

2026-01-19T17:15:00.631082 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son Leo is in local authority care for 10 weeks. 

For Child Benefit purposes, if your child is in local authority care temporarily, the rules depend on the duration of care and whether you still contribute to their maintenance.

In the case where your child is in local authority care for less than 12 weeks (as in your situation with 10 weeks), you can usually continue to receive Child Benefit if you were eligible before they went into care.

May I ask if you were receiving Child Benefit for Leo before he went into local authority care?

2026-01-19T17:15:01.546239 [actor]: applied before care husband pays £30 weekly

2026-01-19T17:15:05.834318 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. I understand that you applied for Child Benefit before Leo went into care, and your husband contributes £30 weekly toward Leo's maintenance.

Based on this information, you should remain eligible for Child Benefit during the 10-week period that Leo is in local authority care because:

1. The placement is temporary (less than 12 weeks)
2. You applied for Child Benefit before Leo went into care
3. Your family is still contributing to Leo's maintenance through the weekly payments

This aligns with the UK government's rules that allow Child Benefit to continue during temporary periods in care, especially when the parent maintains financial support and the care period is expected to be short-term (under 12 weeks).

Is there anything specific about your Child Benefit claim that you'd like me to clarify further?

2026-01-19T17:15:06.700189 [actor]: no income myself stepfather payments

2026-01-19T17:15:11.274521 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that additional information. I understand that you have no personal income and Leo's stepfather is making the maintenance payments.

This additional information doesn't change your eligibility for Child Benefit in this situation. Child Benefit is not income-dependent for the basic claim (though there is a High Income Child Benefit Charge that may affect families where an individual earns over £50,000, but that doesn't appear to apply in your case).

Since:
1. Leo is only in local authority care temporarily (10 weeks)
2. The family is still maintaining financial support (£30 weekly from your husband/Leo's stepfather)
3. You applied for Child Benefit before Leo went into care

You should remain eligible to receive Child Benefit during this period. The fact that your husband is Leo's stepfather doesn't affect this eligibility, as step-parents can claim Child Benefit if they're responsible for a child.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit claim during this period?

2026-01-19T17:15:15.236547 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that a parent remains eligible for Child Benefit when their child is in temporary local authority care for less than 12 weeks (in this case 10 weeks), especially when the family continues to contribute financially to the child's maintenance.
