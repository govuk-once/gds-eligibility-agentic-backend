2026-01-19T17:08:27.430207 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit based on the UK government's rules. To do this, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:08:28.715849 [actor]: I need to act as a UK resident seeking information about child benefit eligibility. I'll be intentionally obtuse and speak like I'm entering search terms into a search engine, as instructed.

2026-01-19T17:08:29.927399 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about child benefit in relation to your son Liam who's in school. Let me ask you some specific questions to help determine eligibility.

How old is your son Liam?

2026-01-19T17:08:30.763078 [actor]: liam 18 doing a levels

2026-01-19T17:08:32.042274 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Liam is 18 years old and studying A levels. 

Is Liam living with you? Or in other words, are you responsible for Liam?

2026-01-19T17:08:32.985262 [actor]: lives with me mother jessica

2026-01-19T17:08:35.020679 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Liam lives with you and his mother Jessica.

Since Liam is 18 and studying A levels (which is approved education), and he lives with you, you may be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To confirm your eligibility further, I need to ask: Are you or Jessica receiving Child Benefit for Liam currently, or is anyone else claiming for him?

2026-01-19T17:08:36.280754 [actor]: no benefit jessica mother me son

2026-01-19T17:08:38.802521 [root_agent]: I understand that no one is currently claiming Child Benefit for Liam, and you're confirming that Jessica is Liam's mother and you're his father.

Since Liam is 18 and in approved education (A levels), lives with you, and no one is currently claiming Child Benefit for him, you may be eligible to claim.

One more important question: Is either your or Jessica's individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T17:08:39.687313 [actor]: no income liam universal credit

2026-01-19T17:08:43.319755 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that neither you nor Jessica has an income over £60,000, and you receive Universal Credit.

Based on the information you've provided:

1. Liam is 18 and studying A levels (approved education)
2. Liam lives with you and Jessica (his parents)
3. No one is currently claiming Child Benefit for him
4. Neither you nor Jessica has an income over £60,000

It appears that you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Liam. Since Liam lives with both parents, either you or Jessica can claim, but not both. Usually, it makes sense for the person who spends the most time caring for Liam to claim.

To apply for Child Benefit, you would need to fill out a CH2 form. Would you like me to explain more about how the application process works?

2026-01-19T17:08:44.012760 [actor]: liam gets universal credit himself

2026-01-19T17:08:48.168543 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important clarification. I understand that Liam receives Universal Credit himself.

This is an important detail. Since Liam is 18 and receiving Universal Credit in his own right, this may affect Child Benefit eligibility. 

When a young person aged 16-19 claims certain benefits themselves (including Universal Credit), they are generally considered to be supporting themselves, which would make them ineligible to be included in a Child Benefit claim.

Based on this information:
- Liam is 18, in approved education (A levels)
- Liam lives with you and Jessica
- Liam claims Universal Credit in his own name

It appears that you would likely not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Liam because he receives Universal Credit himself. When a child or young person gets benefits in their own right, they're usually considered to be supporting themselves, which affects Child Benefit eligibility.

Would you like me to explain if there are any exceptions to this rule or alternative support you might be eligible for?

2026-01-19T17:08:49.025684 [actor]: so not eligible for child benefit?

2026-01-19T17:08:52.146313 [root_agent]: That's correct. Based on the information you've provided, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam.

The main reason is that Liam is receiving Universal Credit in his own right. When a young person (even one in approved education) receives benefits in their own name, such as Universal Credit, they are considered to be supporting themselves financially. This makes them ineligible to be included in a Child Benefit claim.

Child Benefit can generally continue for children in approved education up to age 20, but not when they are claiming their own benefits like Universal Credit.

If Liam's circumstances change - for example, if he stops claiming Universal Credit - then the eligibility for Child Benefit could be reassessed.

2026-01-19T17:08:53.775112 [actor]: I understand I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since my son Liam gets Universal Credit himself.

2026-01-19T17:08:56.117635 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Child Benefit cannot be claimed for a young person who receives Universal Credit in their own right, even if they are under 20 and in approved education.
