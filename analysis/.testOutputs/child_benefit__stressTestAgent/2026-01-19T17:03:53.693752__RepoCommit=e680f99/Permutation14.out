2026-01-19T17:09:28.371268 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To provide you with accurate information, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:09:29.349259 [actor]: Noah 6 years old living grandmother temporary

2026-01-19T17:09:30.927407 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that Noah, who is 6 years old, is temporarily living with his grandmother. To better understand your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to clarify your relationship to Noah.

Are you Noah's parent or legal guardian?

2026-01-19T17:09:31.838040 [actor]: I'm his mother Sophie

2026-01-19T17:09:33.710375 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Sophie. I understand you're Noah's mother. To continue assessing your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to understand more about the current living arrangement.

Is the arrangement with Noah living with his grandmother considered temporary? And do you still have main responsibility for Noah even though he's temporarily staying with his grandmother?

2026-01-19T17:09:34.616844 [actor]: recovering from surgery grandmother looking after 6 weeks

2026-01-19T17:09:37.846435 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining the situation, Sophie. I understand that Noah is staying with his grandmother temporarily for 6 weeks while you're recovering from surgery.

In this case, since this is a temporary arrangement and you remain Noah's mother with main responsibility for him, you would still be eligible to continue receiving or apply for Child Benefit for Noah.

Child Benefit can generally continue to be paid to the main person responsible for a child even during temporary periods when they are staying with someone else, such as a relative. This temporary care arrangement while you recover from surgery wouldn't typically affect your eligibility.

Would you like me to provide information on how to apply for Child Benefit if you haven't already, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-19T17:09:39.370565 [actor]: I see. Thank you for confirming that I'm still eligible for Child Benefit while Noah stays with his grandmother temporarily during my recovery from surgery.

2026-01-19T17:09:42.086561 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility because in a temporary arrangement where the child lives elsewhere (in this case with the grandmother for 6 weeks) while the parent recovers from surgery, the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit as they still maintain main responsibility for the child.
