The agent correctly determined eligibility for Child Benefit based on the daughter Fiona being 16 and enrolled in the "No One Left Behind" programme in Scotland, which qualifies as approved training. The agent verified all relevant eligibility criteria including UK residency, the child living with the parent, UK nationality, and income below the threshold.
