According to the rules, a child who has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks (in this case 14 weeks) is not eligible unless the parent regularly spends money on the child's upkeep. The user clearly stated they don't spend any money as "hospital provides everything" and they just visit daily, which doesn't meet the expenditure exception criteria.
