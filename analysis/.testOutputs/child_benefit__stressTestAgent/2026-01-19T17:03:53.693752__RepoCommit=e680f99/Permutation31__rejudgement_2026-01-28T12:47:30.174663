2026-01-28T12:47:31.912101 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the parent is eligible for Child Benefit. University degrees are considered "advanced education" not "approved education", and Child Benefit stops when a child begins advanced education such as a university degree course.
