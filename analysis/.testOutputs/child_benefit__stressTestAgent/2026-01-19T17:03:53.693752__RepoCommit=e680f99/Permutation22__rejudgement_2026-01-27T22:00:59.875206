2026-01-27T22:01:27.918147 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. According to the "Linking Rule," since Arthur returned to the hospital within 28 days (after 15 days), his hospital stays should be linked and counted cumulatively. With 10 weeks initial stay plus 3 weeks current stay, Arthur has been in hospital for 13 weeks total, exceeding the 12-week limit. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)" but the agent incorrectly stated Jenny was eligible.
