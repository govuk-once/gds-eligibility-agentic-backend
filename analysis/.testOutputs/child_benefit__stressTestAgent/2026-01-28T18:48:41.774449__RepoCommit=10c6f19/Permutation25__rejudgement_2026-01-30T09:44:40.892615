**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Child in care duration:** Leo has been in local authority care for 10 weeks (exceeds the 8-week threshold that would normally make someone ineligible)

2. **Contribution requirement:** The agent correctly identified that to remain eligible when a child has been in care for more than 8 weeks, contributions must be made that at least equal the Child Benefit rate

3. **Spousal contribution:** Critically, the agent accepted that the **husband's payment of £30/week counts** toward meeting this requirement. The agent stated: "Your husband is paying £30 per week to the foster carer, and the current Child Benefit rate for an only child is £25.60 per week. Since he's paying at least the Child Benefit rate toward the cost of looking after Leo, you should be able to continue claiming Child Benefit."

4. **Amount verification:** £30/week exceeds the £25.60 Child Benefit rate for an eldest/only child, satisfying the upkeep requirement

The agent's conclusion aligns with the scenario's expected outcome that recognizes a partner's contributions count as the applicant's contribution when they are married/civil partners living together. The agent communicated eligibility clearly and with appropriate reasoning.
