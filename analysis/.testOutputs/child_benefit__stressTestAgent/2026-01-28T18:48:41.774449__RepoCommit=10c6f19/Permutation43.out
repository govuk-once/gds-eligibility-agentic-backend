2026-01-28T19:17:02.728331 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:17:07.831184 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old who is an apprentice in Scotland.

To help determine eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is your 17-year-old in approved education or training? Specifically, is their apprenticeship an approved qualification that is not at an advanced level (such as Scottish Vocational Qualifications level 3 or below)?**

2026-01-28T19:17:12.380129 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Your son is doing a modern apprenticeship in Glasgow and lives with you.

To assess eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand more about the apprenticeship:

**Is your son receiving a wage or salary for his modern apprenticeship, and if so, is he working 24 hours or more per week?**

This is important because there are specific rules about young people in paid work versus approved education or training.

2026-01-28T19:17:17.457143 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son gets paid for his apprenticeship and works full time.

This is an important point: if your son is working full-time (24 hours or more per week) and receiving a wage, he would generally not qualify you for Child Benefit, even though he's under 20.

However, let me ask one more clarifying question to be certain:

**Is your son registered with a careers service or receiving certain benefits like Income Support or Universal Credit while doing this apprenticeship?**

This exception could potentially affect eligibility.

2026-01-28T19:17:25.014774 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to give you this assessment:

**You would NOT be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.**

Here's why: Child Benefit can be claimed for young people aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training. However, if a young person is working and being paid for 24 hours or more per week, they don't qualify - even if they're doing training as part of their work.

Since your son is:
- 17 years old
- Working full-time (which typically means 24+ hours per week)
- Receiving a wage for his modern apprenticeship
- Not registered with careers services or receiving qualifying benefits

He falls outside the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

The key distinction is that paid employment of 24+ hours per week, even when it includes training elements like a modern apprenticeship, doesn't count as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.

**Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this decision?**

2026-01-28T19:17:30.404058 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a 17-year-old in a paid modern apprenticeship working full-time (24+ hours per week) does not qualify their parent for Child Benefit, as paid work of 24 or more hours per week excludes eligibility even when training is involved.
