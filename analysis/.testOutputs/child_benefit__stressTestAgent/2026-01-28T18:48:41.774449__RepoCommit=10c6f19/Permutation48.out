2026-01-28T19:20:05.163436 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:20:06.842186 [actor]: child benefit 18 year old collge

2026-01-28T19:20:08.830833 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context! Let me ask you a specific question to understand your situation better:

**Is your 18-year-old currently enrolled in approved education or training (such as college, sixth form, or certain vocational courses)?**

2026-01-28T19:20:10.471457 [actor]: hnc course started collge

2026-01-28T19:20:13.103664 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. An HNC course at college would typically count as approved education.

Let me ask you the next question: **Are you the person responsible for the 18-year-old? In other words, do they live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards their upkeep if they don't live with you?**

2026-01-28T19:20:14.728708 [actor]: yes they live with me

2026-01-28T19:20:16.868061 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask: **Are you or your partner currently receiving Child Benefit for this 18-year-old, or would this be a new claim?**

2026-01-28T19:20:18.552597 [actor]: new cliam want to know if eligble

2026-01-28T19:20:20.780925 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me ask an important question about their education:

**Did your 18-year-old start their HNC course before they turned 20 years old?**

(This is important because to be eligible for Child Benefit, the young person must have started their approved education or training before turning 20.)

2026-01-28T19:20:22.487494 [actor]: yes they are 18 startd this year

2026-01-28T19:20:24.978375 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now let me ask: **Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for this 18-year-old?**

(Only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child, so it's important to know if someone else might already be receiving it for them.)

2026-01-28T19:20:26.410310 [actor]: no one else claming just me

2026-01-28T19:20:28.451401 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for that information.

Let me ask one more question: **Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on accessing public funds as part of your visa or immigration status in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:20:29.950784 [actor]: no we are uk residnts born here

2026-01-28T19:20:34.803480 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your 18-year-old. Here's why:

✓ Your child is 18 (under 20)
✓ They started their HNC course before turning 20
✓ They live with you (you're responsible for them)
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for them
✓ You're a UK resident with no immigration restrictions

**You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit.**

However, please be aware of one important point: If you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which reduces or eliminates the benefit through the tax system. You can still claim, but you might have to pay some or all of it back through your tax return.

Would you like any clarification on anything, or do you have any other questions about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:20:40.597981 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on the child being 18, enrolled in an HNC course (approved education) started before age 20, living with the claimant, no one else claiming, and UK residency with no immigration restrictions. The agent also appropriately mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge caveat for incomes over £60,000.
