**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Sophie is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Temporary absence provision**: The agent correctly applied the 8-week rule for temporary absences. Noah has been with his grandmother for 6 weeks and will stay for approximately 2 more weeks (total 8 weeks), which falls within the permitted timeframe.

2. **Continued responsibility**: The agent properly identified that Sophie remains responsible for Noah - she continues to pay for his food, clothing, and other needs even while he's staying with his grandmother.

3. **No competing claim**: The agent confirmed that the grandmother is not claiming Child Benefit, which is crucial. According to the rules, you usually continue to get Child Benefit for 8 weeks after your child goes to live with someone else, provided no one else claims.

4. **Medical emergency context**: The agent recognized this as a legitimate temporary arrangement due to Sophie's surgery recovery, not a permanent change in living arrangements.

5. **Normal residence**: The agent established that Noah normally lives with Sophie and this is only a temporary situation.

The agent's conclusion that Sophie should continue receiving Child Benefit without interruption is correct and matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
