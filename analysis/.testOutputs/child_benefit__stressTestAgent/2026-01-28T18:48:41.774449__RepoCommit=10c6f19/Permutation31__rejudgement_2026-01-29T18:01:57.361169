**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of advanced education:** The agent properly identified that a university degree is considered "advanced education" rather than "approved education"

2. **Clear eligibility determination:** The agent explicitly stated "you would not be eligible for Child Benefit" for the daughter

3. **Accurate reasoning:** The agent explained that Child Benefit can continue until age 20 only for non-advanced education (like A-levels), but stops when advanced education (university degree) begins

4. **Proper application of rules:** The agent correctly applied the distinction between approved education (which allows Child Benefit until age 20) and advanced education (which does not)

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and reached the correct conclusion that matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** based on the daughter starting a university degree.
