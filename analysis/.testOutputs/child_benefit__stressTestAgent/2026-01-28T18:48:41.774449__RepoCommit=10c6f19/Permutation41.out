2026-01-28T19:15:12.465705 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:15:14.488301 [actor]: child benefit two kids ex partner contributes £40 week

2026-01-28T19:15:16.633115 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have two children and your ex-partner contributes £40 per week.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Do the children live with you, or do they live with your ex-partner?**

2026-01-28T19:15:18.500980 [actor]: kids live with ex partner i pay the £40

2026-01-28T19:15:21.690046 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So the children live with your ex-partner, and you pay £40 per week to them.

This is an important distinction for Child Benefit eligibility. Generally, Child Benefit is paid to the person who is primarily responsible for the child - usually the person the child lives with.

Let me ask you this:

**Are you asking about your own eligibility to claim Child Benefit, or are you asking whether your ex-partner (who the children live with) would be eligible?**

2026-01-28T19:15:23.526845 [actor]: want to claim myself i pay £40 contributng

2026-01-28T19:15:26.333205 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you want to claim Child Benefit yourself.

I need to understand your situation better. Child Benefit is normally paid to the person the child lives with, but there are some circumstances where someone else might be eligible.

**Even though the children live with your ex-partner, are you the main person responsible for the children in any way - for example, do the children spend significant time living with you, or are there any other care arrangements where you look after them regularly?**

2026-01-28T19:15:28.018383 [actor]: no they live with ex full time but i contribute £40 every week for both kids

2026-01-28T19:15:32.574800 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me be clear about the situation based on what you've told me:

- The children live with your ex-partner full-time
- You do not have the children living with you
- You contribute £40 per week towards their costs

Based on the Child Benefit rules, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation**. 

Child Benefit is paid to the person who is responsible for the child, which generally means the person the child lives with. Since your children live with your ex-partner full-time and you don't have them living with you, your ex-partner would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.

The fact that you contribute financially through maintenance payments doesn't make you eligible to claim Child Benefit yourself - it's about who the child lives with and who has day-to-day responsibility for them.

**Your ex-partner should be the one to claim Child Benefit for the two children, if they haven't already done so.**

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T19:15:34.945698 [actor]: but i read can claim if contribute enough what is enough for 2 kids ben 10 jerry 8

2026-01-28T19:15:39.757952 [root_agent]: Thank you for that question. I understand your concern, and let me clarify this important point.

I need to be very clear here: **there is no provision in the Child Benefit rules that allows you to claim Child Benefit simply because you contribute financially to your children's costs, regardless of the amount you pay.**

Child Benefit eligibility is based on:
- The child living with you, OR
- You being responsible for the child (which means having day-to-day care and responsibility)

Financial contributions through maintenance or child support payments do not make you eligible to claim Child Benefit when the children live full-time with the other parent.

The £40 per week you contribute is important for supporting your children, but it doesn't create eligibility for Child Benefit under the government rules.

**Where did you read that you could claim if you contribute enough?** This would help me understand if there's been any confusion or misinformation, as this is not part of the official Child Benefit eligibility criteria.

2026-01-28T19:15:41.340212 [actor]: gov.uk child benefit contributons equal split ben jerry payment amounts

2026-01-28T19:15:47.127858 [root_agent]: Thank you for mentioning that you saw something about equal splits and payment amounts on gov.uk.

Let me clarify what this actually refers to, as I think there may be some confusion:

If **both parents share care of the children relatively equally** - meaning the children spend roughly equal amounts of time living with each parent (for example, alternating weeks or a similar arrangement) - then both parents could potentially be eligible to claim Child Benefit, but only one person can actually receive the payment at any time. In such cases, parents might agree to split or alternate who claims it.

However, based on what you've told me:

**Your children live with your ex-partner full-time** - they don't spend time living with you in an equal or shared care arrangement.

So let me ask you directly:

**Do Ben and Jerry spend substantial periods of time actually living in your home - for example, do they stay with you for several nights a week, alternating weeks, or any similar shared living arrangement?**

2026-01-28T19:15:50.088560 [actor]: no full time ex partner but £40 week both kids how much needed qualify

2026-01-28T19:15:54.609668 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that again. I need to be absolutely clear with you:

**There is no amount of money that you can pay that would make you eligible for Child Benefit when the children do not live with you.**

Child Benefit is **not** based on how much money you contribute. It doesn't matter if you pay £40, £400, or any other amount per week - financial contributions alone do not create eligibility.

**Child Benefit eligibility is only based on:**
- The child living with you, OR
- You having the child living with you and being responsible for them

Since Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner full-time and do not live with you at all, **you cannot claim Child Benefit regardless of your financial contributions**.

Your £40 per week is child maintenance/support, which is separate from Child Benefit. Your ex-partner, as the person the children live with, is the one who should claim Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry.

Is there anything else I can help clarify about this?

2026-01-28T19:15:56.698512 [actor]: hmrc unequal split allocation ben 26.05 jerry remaining ask hmrc

2026-01-28T19:16:02.523581 [root_agent]: I understand you're mentioning specific amounts and references to HMRC and unequal splits, but I need to be very clear with you:

**The amounts you're mentioning (£26.05 for Ben, and a remaining amount for Jerry) sound like they could be the actual Child Benefit payment rates, not contribution amounts that would make you eligible.**

For reference, Child Benefit is currently paid at:
- One rate for the eldest/only child
- A different (lower) rate for additional children

However, this is **what Child Benefit pays out** to the eligible person - it's not about what you pay in.

Let me ask you directly:

**Has HMRC actually told you that you can claim Child Benefit in your situation, or are you interpreting information you've seen?**

If HMRC has given you specific guidance about your personal circumstances, that would be important to know. But based on the standard eligibility rules and what you've told me (children live full-time with ex-partner, you don't have them living with you), you would not be eligible regardless of your £40 weekly contribution.

Would you like me to explain the actual Child Benefit payment rates, or is there something specific HMRC has told you about your case?

2026-01-28T19:16:05.057556 [actor]: guidance says can ask hmrc unequal splitting i request 26.05 ben 13.95 jery from my £40

2026-01-28T19:16:10.729417 [root_agent]: I understand now what you're asking about, but I need to clarify an important misunderstanding:

**"Unequal splitting" of Child Benefit is NOT about splitting your £40 maintenance payment.**

When the government guidance mentions splitting Child Benefit, it refers to situations where:
- **Both parents have the children living with them** in a shared care arrangement
- Both could technically claim, but only one person can receive the actual Child Benefit payment at a time
- Parents might agree to split or alternate who receives the Child Benefit payment from the government

This is about **splitting the Child Benefit payment that comes FROM the government**, not splitting your maintenance contribution.

**In your situation:**
- The children live full-time with your ex-partner
- You do not have a shared care arrangement
- You are not eligible to claim Child Benefit at all
- Therefore, there is nothing for HMRC to split between you and your ex-partner

Your £40 weekly payment is child maintenance (separate from Child Benefit). Your ex-partner should claim the Child Benefit, and they would receive approximately £26.05 for Ben and £17.25 for Jerry directly from the government.

Does this clarify the distinction?

2026-01-28T19:16:12.814986 [actor]: so not eligble then for child benefit?

2026-01-28T19:16:15.999926 [root_agent]: **That's correct - you are not eligible for Child Benefit.**

Based on everything you've told me:
- Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner full-time
- They do not live with you
- You do not have shared care of them

**You cannot claim Child Benefit in this situation.** The financial contributions you make (the £40 per week) do not create eligibility for Child Benefit.

**Your ex-partner is the one who should claim Child Benefit** for Ben and Jerry, as they are the person the children live with and who has day-to-day responsibility for them.

I hope this has clarified your situation. Is there anything else I can help you with?

2026-01-28T19:16:22.301283 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit when the children live full-time with the ex-partner, correctly explaining that financial contributions alone do not create eligibility and that Child Benefit is based on who the child lives with and has day-to-day responsibility for them.
