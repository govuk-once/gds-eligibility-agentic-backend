**Justification:**

The expected outcome states: **"Outcome: Eligible."**

However, the agent concluded that **the user (James) is NOT eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "Based on what you've told me, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit."

While the agent's reasoning is technically correct according to UK Child Benefit rules (Child Benefit goes to the person the child lives with, not the non-resident parent paying maintenance), the agent communicated that **James is ineligible**, which directly contradicts the expected outcome of "Eligible."

The evaluation_judge's reasoning appears to reinterpret "Eligible" as referring to the ex-partner's eligibility rather than James's eligibility. However, the scenario explicitly frames James as the subject ("James does not live with his child... He argues he shouldn't be eligible"), and the natural reading of "Outcome: Eligible" in this context would mean James should be found eligible.

The agent determined James is **not eligible**, which does not agree with the expected outcome of **"Eligible."**
