**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

**Key Issue:**

The critical factor here is that Bella's training course is **paid for by her employer** (the local travel agency). According to the Child Benefit eligibility criteria on gov.uk, approved education or training does **not** include courses that are paid for by an employer. 

The agent asked whether the training was full-time and whether the user was responsible for Bella, which are relevant questions. However, the agent **failed to properly assess** whether employer-funded training qualifies as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.

**What the agent should have done:**

The agent should have recognized that:
- Employer-paid training does not count as approved education or training
- This is explicitly stated in the eligibility criteria
- Therefore, Bella does not qualify under the "under 20 and in approved education or training" extension

**Conclusion:**

Since Bella is 16 and her employer-funded training does not qualify as approved education or training, she only qualifies if she's under 16 (which she is not - she IS 16, and the under-16 criterion means "up to their 16th birthday"). The agent should have communicated that the user is **Not Eligible** for Child Benefit. The agent's conclusion directly contradicts the expected outcome.
