2026-01-28T18:51:31.100726 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T18:51:32.675452 [actor]: child benefit lucas 10 years old son

2026-01-28T18:51:35.868436 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a son, Lucas, who is 10 years old.

Now I need to ask: Are you responsible for Lucas? This means do you live with him and are you the person who looks after him day-to-day (for example, providing his food, clothes, and paying for things he needs)?

2026-01-28T18:51:37.808835 [actor]: dont live with him send money jenny every month 150 pounds for food cloths

2026-01-28T18:51:40.528453 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you don't live with Lucas, but you send £150 every month to Jenny (I assume this is Lucas's other parent or carer) for his food and clothes.

To help determine your eligibility, I need to ask: Does Lucas live with Jenny, and is she the person who is mainly responsible for looking after him on a day-to-day basis?

2026-01-28T18:51:42.034942 [actor]: yes lucas lives with jenny shes his mum my ex wife

2026-01-28T18:51:46.155982 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Lucas lives with his mum, Jenny (your ex-wife), and she is the one who looks after him day-to-day.

Based on the Child Benefit rules, only one person can get Child Benefit for a child, and this is normally the person the child lives with and who is responsible for them.

Since Jenny is the person Lucas lives with and who is responsible for his day-to-day care, she would be the one who is eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas, not you.

However, let me ask: Do you have Lucas living with you for any period of time, or does he only live with Jenny?

2026-01-28T18:51:47.996679 [actor]: no only with jenny but she doesnt claim child benifit i want to claim it

2026-01-28T18:51:52.678559 [root_agent]: I understand that Jenny doesn't currently claim Child Benefit and you'd like to claim it yourself.

However, I need to clarify an important point: Child Benefit is paid to the person who is responsible for the child, which means the person the child lives with and who looks after them day-to-day.

Since Lucas lives with Jenny and she is responsible for his day-to-day care, she is the person who would be eligible to claim Child Benefit - not you, even if she chooses not to claim it.

The fact that you send money to support Lucas is important and shows you're contributing to his upbringing, but Child Benefit rules are based on who the child lives with and who has day-to-day responsibility for them.

Let me ask: Is there any arrangement where Lucas stays with you regularly, such as shared custody or regular overnight stays?

2026-01-28T18:51:54.819912 [actor]: no but i pay more than child benefit amount 150 pounds month doesnt that count for responsibilty

2026-01-28T18:52:00.397232 [root_agent]: I understand your point - you're contributing £150 per month towards Lucas's care, which is more than the Child Benefit amount. However, I need to explain how the eligibility works.

Child Benefit eligibility is not based on who pays the most money or who contributes financially. It's specifically based on who the child **lives with** and who is **responsible for their day-to-day care** - meaning things like getting them ready for school, taking them to appointments, cooking their meals, and being there with them.

Financial support through maintenance payments, while very important, doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit if the child doesn't live with you.

Since Lucas lives with Jenny full-time and she provides his day-to-day care, only she would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, even if she currently chooses not to.

Based on the information you've provided, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas because he doesn't live with you.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T18:52:02.547885 [actor]: ok so not eligible then even tho i pay for him

2026-01-28T18:52:06.223535 [root_agent]: That's correct. Based on what you've told me, you are **not eligible** for Child Benefit for Lucas, even though you pay £150 per month to support him.

The key reason is that Child Benefit can only be claimed by the person who:
- The child lives with, AND
- Who is responsible for the child's day-to-day care

Since Lucas lives with Jenny and she looks after him day-to-day, only she would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him.

Your financial contributions through the monthly payments are important for Lucas's wellbeing, but they don't make you eligible for Child Benefit under the current rules.

If Jenny wanted to, she could claim Child Benefit for Lucas, but that would be her decision to make.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this matter?

2026-01-28T18:52:12.057134 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit eligibility is based on who the child lives with and who provides day-to-day care, not on financial contributions, and correctly concluded that the user is not eligible since Lucas lives with Jenny who provides his day-to-day care.
