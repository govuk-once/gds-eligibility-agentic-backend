2026-01-28T18:54:03.316791 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T18:54:05.099977 [actor]: child benefit german pre settled status jobseeker son 5 yrs

2026-01-28T18:54:07.323384 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I can see you have a 5-year-old son, you have German pre-settled status, and you're a jobseeker.

Let me ask you a clarifying question:

**Are you currently responsible for your son - meaning, does he live with you and do you look after him?**

2026-01-28T18:54:09.116513 [actor]: yes son lives with me look after him evry day

2026-01-28T18:54:11.445535 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son lives with you and you look after him every day.

Now I need to understand your residency status better:

**You mentioned you have German pre-settled status - can you confirm whether you are currently living in the UK, and if so, do you have the right to reside in the UK?**

2026-01-28T18:54:12.906244 [actor]: living in uk yes have pre settled status eu settlement scheme

2026-01-28T18:54:15.516635 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're living in the UK and have pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Is your son under 16 years old, or if he's 16 or over, is he under 20 and in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T18:54:17.226282 [actor]: son is 5 years old

2026-01-28T18:54:19.688848 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming your son is 5 years old.

Now I need to ask:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your son, or does your son live with anyone else who might be claiming it for him?**

2026-01-28T18:54:21.266749 [actor]: no one else claiming just me looking after him

2026-01-28T18:54:23.179412 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else is claiming Child Benefit for your son.

Let me ask one more important question:

**Is your son currently in hospital or in local authority care for more than 12 weeks?**

2026-01-28T18:54:24.582647 [actor]: no son not in hospital not in care

2026-01-28T18:54:28.548745 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 5-year-old son)
✓ Your son lives with you and you're responsible for him
✓ You're living in the UK with pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme (which gives you the right to reside in the UK)
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for your son
✓ Your son is not in hospital or care for an extended period

Your pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme means you have a right to reside in the UK, which satisfies the residency requirement for Child Benefit.

**You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for your son.** 

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T18:54:34.178641 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on all the relevant criteria: having a child under 16, being responsible for the child who lives with them, having pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme (which provides right to reside), no one else claiming for the child, and the child not being in hospital or care for extended periods.
