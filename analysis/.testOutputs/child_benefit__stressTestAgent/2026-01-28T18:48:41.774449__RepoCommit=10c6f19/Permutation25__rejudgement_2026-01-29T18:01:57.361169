**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Beatrice is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Child in care duration (>8 weeks):** The agent appropriately recognized that Leo has been in local authority care for 10 weeks, which exceeds the 8-week threshold where special contribution rules apply.

2. **Contribution requirement:** The agent correctly identified that to maintain eligibility when a child is in local authority care beyond 8 weeks, contributions must be made at least equal to the Child Benefit rate (£25.60 for the eldest/only child).

3. **Spousal contribution:** The agent properly accepted that the husband's £30/week payment to the foster carer counts toward meeting the contribution requirement. While the agent could have been more explicit about the legal principle that a spouse's contributions count as the applicant's contributions (when married/civil partners living together), the agent reached the correct conclusion.

4. **Verification of amount:** The agent confirmed that £30/week exceeds the required £25.60 threshold, satisfying the upkeep requirement.

The agent's determination of eligibility is consistent with the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit for children in care, which allows continued eligibility when appropriate contributions are made. The evaluation judge also marked this as correct (✓).
