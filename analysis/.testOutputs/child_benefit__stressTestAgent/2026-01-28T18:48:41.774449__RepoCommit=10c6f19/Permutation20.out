2026-01-28T19:00:43.488689 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T19:00:45.375083 [actor]: granddaughter 14 lives with me

2026-01-28T19:00:48.221773 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old granddaughter living with you.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for your granddaughter? This means do you provide for her financially and make decisions about her care and upbringing?

2026-01-28T19:00:50.010059 [actor]: yes pay for evrything parents cant care for her

2026-01-28T19:00:52.471799 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It sounds like you're taking full responsibility for your granddaughter since her parents can't care for her.

Next question: Do you normally live in the UK? This means the UK is your main home where you usually reside.

2026-01-28T19:00:54.119429 [actor]: uk yes live here

2026-01-28T19:00:56.220125 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now I need to ask about your granddaughter's parents.

Do either of your granddaughter's parents currently claim Child Benefit for her, or are they living with you and your granddaughter?

2026-01-28T19:00:57.871381 [actor]: no they dont claim anything dont contribute money

2026-01-28T19:01:00.240507 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. One more important question:

Are your granddaughter's parents able to look after her themselves? In other words, is there a specific reason why she lives with you rather than with them - such as they're unable or unwilling to care for her?

2026-01-28T19:01:02.076865 [actor]: unable to care for her thats why shes with me

2026-01-28T19:01:06.521449 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

✓ Your granddaughter is 14 years old (under 16)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are responsible for her - you pay for everything and make decisions about her care
✓ She lives with you
✓ Her parents are unable to care for her and don't claim Child Benefit for her
✓ You are providing for her because her parents cannot

Under UK rules, you can claim Child Benefit for a child you're responsible for, even if they're not your own child. This applies when you're looking after someone else's child because the parents are unable to care for them.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the claiming process?

2026-01-28T19:01:12.858794 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the grandparent is eligible for Child Benefit based on the correct criteria: the child is under 16, lives with the grandparent in the UK, the grandparent is responsible for the child, and the parents are unable to care for her and don't claim Child Benefit themselves.
