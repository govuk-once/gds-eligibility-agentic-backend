**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not currently eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Accurate application of the 8-week rule**: The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit continues for up to 8 weeks while a child is in custody, but stops after that period.

2. **Correct timeline assessment**: When the user confirmed Mark had been in custody for 10 weeks, the agent properly concluded that Child Benefit would have stopped after week 8, meaning the user is not currently eligible.

3. **Clear communication of current status**: The agent explicitly stated "Not eligible now" and confirmed the user's understanding: "Not eligible now - because he's been in custody for more than 8 weeks."

4. **Appropriate future guidance**: While the agent also mentioned eligibility could be reinstated when Mark returns home, this doesn't contradict the current ineligibility status—it's accurate forward-looking advice.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that the user is **Not Eligible** for Child Benefit at the present time due to Mark having been in custody for longer than the 8-week threshold.
