**Justification:**

The agent communicated an **incorrect eligibility outcome**. 

According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 20, even if they are still in approved education or training. The relevant rule states: "Payments stop on 31 August on or after their 16th birthday if they leave education or training. Payments stop on their 20th birthday if they stay in approved education or training."

In this scenario:
- Dev turned 20 last week (middle of the current term)
- He is still studying A-levels full-time (finishing in June)

**Expected Outcome:** Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** The agent told Raj he "should still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Dev" and that payments would continue "until the end of August this year."

The agent's response directly contradicts the eligibility rules. Child Benefit should have stopped on Dev's 20th birthday last week, not continue until August. The agent misapplied the terminal date rule, which applies to those under 20 who finish their courses, but does not extend eligibility beyond the 20th birthday.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error.
