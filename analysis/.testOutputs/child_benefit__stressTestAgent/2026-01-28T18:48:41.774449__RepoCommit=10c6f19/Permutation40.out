2026-01-28T19:14:36.400650 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:14:37.947877 [actor]: son 15 years old securre unit mental health act

2026-01-28T19:14:40.607191 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a 15-year-old son who is in a secure unit under the Mental Health Act.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Does your son normally live with you, or is he expected to return to live with you once he leaves the secure unit?**

This is important because children in hospital or care facilities can still count toward Child Benefit eligibility depending on the circumstances.

2026-01-28T19:14:42.203661 [actor]: he lives with me been in unit 10 weeks now

2026-01-28T19:14:44.700604 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son normally lives with you and has been in the secure unit for 10 weeks.

Let me ask you this:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your son, or are you applying for it for the first time?**

This will help me understand your situation better and provide accurate guidance about your eligibility.

2026-01-28T19:14:46.388297 [actor]: I recieve it already worried it will stop

2026-01-28T19:14:48.675145 [root_agent]: I understand your concern. Let me ask you an important question to assess your situation:

**Is the secure unit where your son is staying run by the NHS or a local authority, or is it a private facility?**

This distinction is important because it affects how Child Benefit is treated when a child is in hospital or care.

2026-01-28T19:14:50.217708 [actor]: nhs unit detaned under mental health act sectioned

2026-01-28T19:14:52.729063 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's very helpful to know.

Now, let me ask you:

**Do you continue to contribute to your son's upkeep while he is in the NHS secure unit - for example, by providing clothing, toiletries, or other items for him, or by visiting him regularly?**

This is relevant to your Child Benefit entitlement while he's in hospital care.

2026-01-28T19:14:54.550956 [actor]: yes visit him every week bring clothes and stuff

2026-01-28T19:14:56.808233 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. That's very helpful.

Let me ask you one more question:

**Are you the person who is primarily responsible for your son - meaning, is there anyone else (such as another parent or guardian) who is also claiming or could claim Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T19:14:58.322935 [actor]: no just me im single parent only me

2026-01-28T19:15:03.715313 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, let me give you some good news:

**You should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit for your son.**

Here's why:

1. Your son is under 16 and normally lives with you
2. He is in an NHS secure unit (which is classed as hospital care under the Mental Health Act)
3. You continue to contribute to his upkeep by visiting weekly and providing clothing and other items
4. You are his sole parent and the only person claiming for him

**Important:** When a child is in hospital (including secure NHS units), you can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **84 days (12 weeks)** while they're there, as long as you continue to contribute to their upkeep - which you are doing.

Since your son has been in the unit for 10 weeks, you still have 2 weeks remaining within this 84-day period. 

**If his stay extends beyond 12 weeks**, you should contact the Child Benefit Office to discuss your situation, as there may be additional considerations for children detained under the Mental Health Act.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-28T19:15:05.425356 [actor]: ok thank you understand now

2026-01-28T19:15:10.082052 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit continues for children in NHS hospital care (including secure units) for up to 84 days (12 weeks) when the parent contributes to their upkeep, correctly calculated that 2 weeks remained of the 12-week period since the child had been there 10 weeks, and appropriately advised contacting the Child Benefit Office if the stay extends beyond 12 weeks.
