**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Age Criterion Met**: The child (John, 17) is under 20 years old.

2. **Education Criterion Not Met**: The agent properly identified that 6 hours per week of supervised study does not constitute "full-time" education. According to the eligibility rules, approved education for children aged 16-19 must be full-time, typically requiring at least 12 hours per week of supervised study.

3. **Clear Communication**: The agent explicitly stated: "this would not meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit" and explained that "Six hours per week would not be considered full-time education."

4. **Accurate Application of Rules**: The agent correctly applied the standard that children aged 16-19 must be in "full-time approved education or training" and noted that 6 hours falls short of the typical 12-hour minimum threshold.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome (Not Eligible) as specified in the scenario, where the part-time nature of John's studies (6 hours versus the required 12+ hours) disqualifies him from Child Benefit coverage.
