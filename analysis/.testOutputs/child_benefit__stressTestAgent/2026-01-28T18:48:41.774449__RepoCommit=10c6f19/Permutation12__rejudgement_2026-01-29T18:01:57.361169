**Justification:**

The agent determined the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, but this contradicts the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.

According to the scenario details (Permutation 12), the critical factor is that the 18-year-old (Liam) "has successfully claimed Universal Credit in his own right to help with his personal living costs."

The rules explicitly state under **Criteria 2: Child's Benefit Status**: "you stop getting Child Benefit if the child starts getting **Universal Credit** (or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right."

While the agent correctly verified that:
- The child is under 20
- The child is in approved education (A-levels)
- The applicant is responsible for the child
- No immigration issues exist

The agent **failed to ask** whether the 18-year-old was claiming any benefits in their own right, specifically Universal Credit. This was a critical omission. The user mentioned "universal credit" in their very first message ("child benfit univeral credit a levels 18 year old"), which should have prompted the agent to explore whether the young person was claiming UC themselves.

Since the 18-year-old is claiming Universal Credit in their own right, the applicant is **Not Eligible** for Child Benefit, which contradicts the agent's determination of eligibility.
