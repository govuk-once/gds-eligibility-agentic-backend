2026-01-28T18:55:36.894963 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T18:55:38.506139 [actor]: child benfit univeral credit a levels 18 year old

2026-01-28T18:55:40.349009 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you a specific question to help assess your eligibility:

**Do you have an 18-year-old who is currently studying A-levels or in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T18:55:41.908793 [actor]: yes studying a levels lives with me

2026-01-28T18:55:44.227108 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Now I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for this 18-year-old? By this, I mean do you live with them and are you the person who is primarily responsible for their care?**

2026-01-28T18:55:45.902250 [actor]: yes they live with me already said that

2026-01-28T18:55:48.253067 [root_agent]: You're right, apologies for repeating that question. Let me move on to the next important question:

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on your right to reside in the UK?**

2026-01-28T18:55:49.967504 [actor]: no immigration im uk resident

2026-01-28T18:55:51.800405 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Let me ask you another important question:

**Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for this same 18-year-old?**

2026-01-28T18:55:53.622616 [actor]: no just me claiming

2026-01-28T18:55:56.432460 [root_agent]: Thank you. One more important question:

**Is your 18-year-old in full-time approved education or training (not higher education like university)?** 

Just to clarify - A-levels would typically count as approved education, but I need to confirm they haven't left education and that they're studying full-time.

2026-01-28T18:55:58.247642 [actor]: yes a levels full time approved education

2026-01-28T18:56:03.243420 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You have an 18-year-old child living with you
2. ✓ You are responsible for them
3. ✓ They are studying A-levels full-time (which is approved education)
4. ✓ They are under 20 years old
5. ✓ You are a UK resident with no immigration restrictions
6. ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child

**Important to note:** Child Benefit can continue until your child turns 20, as long as they remain in approved full-time education or training (like A-levels). However, it will stop when they turn 20, or when they leave approved education or training - whichever comes first.

If you're not already receiving Child Benefit for this child, you can make a claim. If you are already receiving it, it should continue as long as the conditions above remain met.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T18:56:08.653844 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that an 18-year-old studying A-levels full-time qualifies for Child Benefit (as approved education for those under 20), correctly gathered all necessary information, and provided accurate guidance about the continuation until age 20 or when leaving education.
