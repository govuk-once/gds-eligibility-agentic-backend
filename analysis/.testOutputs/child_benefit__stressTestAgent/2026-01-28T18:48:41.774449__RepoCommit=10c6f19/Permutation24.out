2026-01-28T19:03:38.138275 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:03:39.655700 [actor]: son 14 yrs old scool

2026-01-28T19:03:41.759369 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old son who is in school.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Does your son normally live with you?**

2026-01-28T19:03:43.374087 [actor]: council paid residental scool 10 weeks now

2026-01-28T19:03:46.074296 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son is at a council-paid residential school and has been there for 10 weeks.

Let me ask you an important follow-up question:

**Does your son come home to stay with you during school holidays and/or at weekends?**

2026-01-28T19:03:47.784105 [actor]: behavioral needs severe cant manage at home

2026-01-28T19:03:50.250823 [root_agent]: I understand - your son has severe behavioral needs and you can't manage him at home, which is why he's in residential care.

Let me ask you this:

**Are you still contributing to the costs of supporting your son, even though he's in residential care? For example, are you paying towards his upkeep or buying things he needs?**

2026-01-28T19:03:51.720013 [actor]: no local council pays everything

2026-01-28T19:03:54.303965 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me ask one more important question to assess your eligibility:

**Is your son expected to be in this residential care placement for more than 12 weeks in total?**

(This is an important factor in determining Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in local authority care.)

2026-01-28T19:03:55.759949 [actor]: dont know how long maybe more

2026-01-28T19:04:00.901769 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me assess your situation based on what you've told me.

Based on the current circumstances, I need to inform you that **you are likely not eligible for Child Benefit** while your son remains in this residential care arrangement. Here's why:

**Key factors affecting your eligibility:**

1. Your son is in local authority-funded residential care
2. The local council is paying for everything - you're not contributing to his costs
3. He doesn't come home during holidays or weekends
4. The placement may last more than 12 weeks

**Why this affects eligibility:**

When a child is looked after by the local authority (in care), and the local authority is paying for their accommodation and maintenance, you generally cannot claim Child Benefit. This is because you are not responsible for the child in the way that Child Benefit requires.

**However, I have one final question:**

**Did you have an agreement with the local authority about the placement, and do you still have parental responsibility for your son?**

This could be relevant if the situation changes in the future.

2026-01-28T19:04:02.660034 [actor]: yes still parent still responsible educational placement behavioral needs

2026-01-28T19:04:06.605894 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that important point - you still have parental responsibility and this is an educational placement for his behavioral needs, rather than your son being "in care" in the traditional sense.

This is an important distinction. Let me ask you:

**When the residential school placement was arranged, did the local authority or the school give you any information about whether you should continue claiming Child Benefit, or did they tell you to stop claiming it?**

(The distinction between a child being in residential school for educational/behavioral needs versus being formally "looked after" by the local authority can affect Child Benefit eligibility, so I want to make sure I give you the correct guidance.)

2026-01-28T19:04:08.181993 [actor]: no info nothing just need help with eligibilty

2026-01-28T19:04:12.899702 [root_agent]: Thank you for your patience. Based on everything you've told me, let me provide you with a clearer assessment:

**You may still be eligible for Child Benefit**, but there are important factors to consider:

**Why you might still be eligible:**
- You retain parental responsibility
- This is an educational placement for behavioral needs (not traditional "care")
- Your son is still under 16 and in education

**The critical question is:** Has the local authority formally taken your son into care, or is this purely an educational placement that they're funding to meet his special educational needs?

**If this is a special educational placement** (like a residential special school) where you still have full parental responsibility and he hasn't been taken into care, you would typically remain eligible for Child Benefit.

**If the local authority has formally taken him into care** (even temporarily), you would not be eligible while he's in that care.

**My question to you:**

**Has the local authority issued any formal care orders, or is your son simply attending a residential school that they fund as part of meeting his educational needs?**

2026-01-28T19:04:14.643928 [actor]: no care order just residental scool for behavioral needs council funding

2026-01-28T19:04:19.919937 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification - that's very helpful and important information.

**Good news: Based on what you've told me, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

**Your situation:**
- No care order has been issued
- You retain full parental responsibility
- Your son is in a residential school funded by the council to meet his behavioral/educational needs
- He's under 16 and in education

**This means:** When a child is in a residential school for educational purposes (even if funded by the local authority), and there's no care order in place, the parent typically remains eligible for Child Benefit. The child is not considered to be "looked after" by the local authority - they're simply receiving educational provision.

**What you should do:**

If you're not already claiming Child Benefit, you should apply for it. If you are already claiming and someone has told you to stop, you should contact the Child Benefit Office to explain your situation.

**Do you have any other questions about your eligibility, or would you like to know how to apply or contact the Child Benefit Office?**

2026-01-28T19:04:21.516233 [actor]: ok so im eligble then?

2026-01-28T19:04:24.910630 [root_agent]: **Yes, based on the information you've provided, you should be eligible for Child Benefit.**

To summarize why:
- Your 14-year-old son is in education (residential school)
- There is no care order in place
- You still have parental responsibility
- The council funding is for educational/behavioral needs, not because he's in local authority care

**If you're not currently claiming Child Benefit, you should apply for it.**

**If you are already claiming and have been told to stop, you should contact the Child Benefit Office to explain that your son is in a residential school for educational purposes with no care order in place.**

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T19:04:31.663816 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, when a child is in residential care or hospital for more than 12 weeks, Child Benefit eligibility ends - even if it's for educational purposes and even without a care order. The child has been in residential school for 10 weeks with uncertain duration ("maybe more"), meaning eligibility would only continue until week 12, not indefinitely as the agent stated.
