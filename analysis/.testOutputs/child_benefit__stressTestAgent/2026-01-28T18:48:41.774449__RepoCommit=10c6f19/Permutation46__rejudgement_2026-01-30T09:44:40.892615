**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined the user was eligible for Child Benefit. Here's why this is wrong:

**The Critical Error:**
The agent failed to recognize the **91-day time limit** for jobseekers claiming Child Benefit. According to UK rules, people with pre-settled status who are claiming as jobseekers can only maintain their "right to reside" for Child Benefit purposes for **91 days**. 

**The User's Situation:**
- The user has been unemployed and looking for work for **95 days**
- This is **4 days beyond the 91-day limit**
- The user has no job offer or "genuine prospect of work" mentioned
- Therefore, their right to reside for benefit purposes has **expired**

**Expected Outcome:** Not Eligible (Expired)

**Agent's Determination:** Eligible ✓

The agent's assessment directly contradicts the expected outcome. While the agent correctly verified the user was registered with Jobcentre Plus and had pre-settled status, it completely missed the critical time limitation that applies to jobseekers. After 91 days without securing employment or having a genuine job prospect, the right to reside for Child Benefit purposes expires, making the user **not eligible**.

The original evaluation judge (✗) was correct to mark this as a failure, and the agent communicated an incorrect eligibility outcome.
