2026-01-28T19:09:20.404697 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T19:09:21.887994 [actor]: bella 16 training travel agent

2026-01-28T19:09:25.040601 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have Bella who is 16 and in training to be a travel agent.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: **Is Bella's training approved education or training? For example, is it full-time (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience), or is it an apprenticeship?**

2026-01-28T19:09:26.504825 [actor]: employer pays course local travel agency

2026-01-28T19:09:28.736841 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. It sounds like Bella is doing training through a local travel agency where the employer pays for the course.

To determine if this qualifies as approved education or training, I need to ask: **Is Bella's training full-time (meaning more than 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience), or is she on a registered apprenticeship?**

2026-01-28T19:09:30.289552 [actor]: full time training course not apprenticship

2026-01-28T19:09:32.594164 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Bella is on a full-time training course (not an apprenticeship) paid for by her employer at a local travel agency.

Now I need to ask: **Are you responsible for Bella? This means, do you live with her and are you the person who is mainly responsible for her care?**

2026-01-28T19:09:34.363526 [actor]: yes live with her im her mother

2026-01-28T19:09:36.409555 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. So you live with Bella and you're her mother, which means you're responsible for her.

Now I need to ask: **Do you normally live in the UK? This means the UK is your main home and you spend most of your time here.**

2026-01-28T19:09:37.828757 [actor]: yes uk resident

2026-01-28T19:09:40.420964 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you're a UK resident living with Bella, your 16-year-old daughter who is on a full-time training course.

Now I need to ask: **What is your immigration status? Are you a UK or Irish citizen, do you have settled status, pre-settled status, or do you have a different immigration status?**

This is important because eligibility for Child Benefit depends on your right to reside in the UK and access to public funds.

2026-01-28T19:09:42.115659 [actor]: uk citizen

2026-01-28T19:09:44.410064 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that you're a UK citizen.

Now I have one more important question: **Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Bella, or does Bella live with anyone else who might be responsible for her?**

2026-01-28T19:09:45.774383 [actor]: no just me claiming nobody else

2026-01-28T19:09:49.516306 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

- You have a child (Bella) who is 16 years old
- Bella is in full-time training (more than 12 hours per week), which qualifies as approved education or training
- You are responsible for Bella - you're her mother and live with her
- You normally live in the UK
- You are a UK citizen (so you have the right to reside and access public funds)
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Bella

You can claim Child Benefit for Bella until she turns 20, as long as she remains in approved education or training.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, or would you like guidance on how to apply?**

2026-01-28T19:09:56.223472 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes typically means courses of non-advanced education (below degree level) at schools or colleges, not employer-paid workplace training. Full-time work-based training paid for by an employer does not automatically qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes unless it meets specific criteria such as being part of a registered course. The agent should have verified whether the training course qualifies under the approved education definition rather than assuming any full-time training automatically qualifies.
