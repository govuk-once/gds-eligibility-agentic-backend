2026-01-28T19:19:43.249612 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:19:45.195671 [actor]: child not living with me tho pays 50 week maintenence court order said i have to

2026-01-28T19:19:47.456494 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child who doesn't live with you, and you pay £50 per week maintenance under a court order.

**Does your child live with someone else who is their main carer (such as their other parent, a family member, or guardian)?**

2026-01-28T19:19:48.850327 [actor]: yes child lives with ex partner

2026-01-28T19:19:51.164882 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since your child lives with your ex-partner who is their main carer, the general rule is that **Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with** - so in this case, that would typically be your ex-partner.

However, I need to ask a follow-up question to be thorough:

**Is your ex-partner currently claiming Child Benefit for your child?**

2026-01-28T19:19:52.981098 [actor]: dont know if ex claiming or not just know court made me pay

2026-01-28T19:19:57.248469 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me explain your situation:

**Based on what you've told me, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit** because:

- Child Benefit is normally paid to the person the child lives with and who is responsible for them on a day-to-day basis
- Your child lives with your ex-partner, so they would be the eligible person to claim

The fact that you pay child maintenance (even under a court order) doesn't affect Child Benefit eligibility - these are two separate things. Child Benefit goes to the main carer, while maintenance payments are a separate financial arrangement.

**However, if your ex-partner is not claiming Child Benefit, they should consider doing so, as they appear to be eligible.** Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T19:20:02.812455 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with (the ex-partner as main carer), not to the non-resident parent paying maintenance, which aligns with the expected "Eligible" outcome referring to the ex-partner's eligibility rather than the user's eligibility.
