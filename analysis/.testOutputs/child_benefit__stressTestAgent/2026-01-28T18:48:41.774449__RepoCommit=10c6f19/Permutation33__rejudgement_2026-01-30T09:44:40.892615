**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

The critical error lies in the agent's interpretation of "approved education or training." According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, approved education or training must meet specific criteria. Crucially, the guidance states that training **paid for by an employer** does not qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

In this case:
- Bella is 16 years old
- She is on a training course to become a travel agent
- The course is **fully paid for by her employer** (the local travel agency)
- The course is not a standard government apprenticeship

The agent asked whether the training was full-time and confirmed it was, but failed to properly assess whether employer-funded training qualifies as "approved education or training." The agent should have recognized that employer-paid training does not meet the criteria for Child Benefit eligibility.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, noting that "Full-time work-based training paid for by an employer does not automatically qualify as 'approved education or training' for Child Benefit purposes."

Therefore, the agent communicated an **incorrect eligibility outcome** (eligible instead of not eligible), which does not agree with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
