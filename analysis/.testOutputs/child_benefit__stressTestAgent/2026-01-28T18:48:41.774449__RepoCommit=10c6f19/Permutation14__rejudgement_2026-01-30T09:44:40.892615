**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Sophie remains **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Temporary absence within 8-week rule**: The child has been away for 6 weeks with an expected total of 8 weeks. Under UK Child Benefit rules, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 8 weeks when a child temporarily lives elsewhere, provided no one else claims it.

2. **No competing claim**: The grandmother is not claiming Child Benefit, which is crucial. The 8-week continuation rule applies specifically when no one else makes a claim.

3. **Ongoing responsibility**: Sophie continues to be financially responsible for Noah (paying for food, clothing, and other needs), demonstrating she remains the responsible person.

4. **Temporary medical circumstance**: The arrangement is clearly temporary due to Sophie's surgery recovery, not a permanent change in living arrangements.

5. **Normal residence**: Noah normally lives with Sophie; this is just a temporary arrangement.

The agent accurately applied the temporary absence provisions and correctly concluded that Sophie should continue receiving Child Benefit without interruption. This matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
