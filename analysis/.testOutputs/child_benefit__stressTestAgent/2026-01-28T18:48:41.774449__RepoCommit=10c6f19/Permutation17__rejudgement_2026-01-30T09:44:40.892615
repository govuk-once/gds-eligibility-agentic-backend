**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors correctly identified by the agent:**

1. ✓ Two children aged 8 and 10 (both under 16)
2. ✓ Children live with the applicant as part of the household
3. ✓ Applicant is responsible for the children
4. ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for them
5. ✓ **Crucially: The applicant is a member of the British Armed Forces (Crown servant) posted to Germany**

The agent specifically and correctly identified that as a member of the UK armed forces posted abroad, the applicant remains eligible for UK Child Benefit despite living in Germany. This is the critical exception that applies in this scenario, as confirmed by UK government guidance that Crown servants (including armed forces personnel) posted overseas can claim Child Benefit.

The agent's conclusion of eligibility matches the expected outcome: **Eligible**.
