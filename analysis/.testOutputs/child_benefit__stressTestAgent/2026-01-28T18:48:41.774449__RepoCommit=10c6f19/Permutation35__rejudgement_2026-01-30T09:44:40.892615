**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the father is **not eligible** to claim Child Benefit for Rashid solely because Rashid is married. The agent stated: "you cannot usually get Child Benefit for a child or young person who is married or in a civil partnership" and concluded "the father would NOT be eligible."

However, according to the expected outcome, this case should result in **Eligible (via Exception)**. 

The key facts are:
- Rashid (17) is married
- He lives with his parents in their household
- He is still in full-time approved education (A-Levels)
- His wife (also 17) has moved into the parents' house
- The parents are supporting Rashid

According to GOV.UK guidance on Child Benefit, while marriage generally disqualifies a young person from Child Benefit, there is an **exception**: if the married child still lives with the claimant and depends on them financially, AND the spouse is also dependent (or in full-time education), the claimant can retain eligibility.

The agent failed to identify or apply this exception. The agent acknowledged the word "usually" in their response but did not explore whether an exception applied despite gathering relevant information (Rashid lives at home, wife also lives there, wife is 17, Rashid is in full-time education).

The agent's communicated outcome (Not Eligible) does **not** agree with the expected outcome (Eligible via Exception).
