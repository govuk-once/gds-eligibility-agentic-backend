**Justification:**

The agent determined the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and the specific scenario provided, the correct determination should be **not eligible**.

The critical missing information is that the 18-year-old (Liam) is claiming **Universal Credit in his own right**. According to the eligibility criteria and the scenario background:

- **Criteria 2** explicitly states: "You stop getting Child Benefit if the child starts getting **Universal Credit** (or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right."

The agent failed to ask whether the 18-year-old was receiving any benefits in their own right, which is a crucial eligibility criterion. While the agent correctly verified:
- The child's age (18, under 20)
- Living arrangement (lives with parent)
- Education status (A-levels, approved full-time education)
- No immigration issues
- No duplicate claims

The agent missed the disqualifying factor that makes the applicant **not eligible**: the child receiving Universal Credit in their own right.

The expected outcome is **Not Eligible**, but the agent communicated the outcome as **Eligible**. Therefore, the agent did **not** communicate an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome.
