2026-01-28T18:49:15.148194 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T18:49:16.646116 [actor]: daughter 17 live with me studing a levels

2026-01-28T18:49:18.987501 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old daughter living with you who is studying A-levels.

Let me ask you: Are you responsible for your daughter? This means you're the one who looks after her day-to-day and pays for things like her food, clothes, and somewhere to live?

2026-01-28T18:49:20.785334 [actor]: yes pay for evrything food clothes rent bills she lives here

2026-01-28T18:49:22.923321 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Now, let me ask you: Are you or your daughter currently living in the UK?

2026-01-28T18:49:24.411422 [actor]: london we live in london

2026-01-28T18:49:26.650819 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Living in London means you're in the UK.

Now I need to ask: Do you have the right to live in the UK? For example, are you a UK citizen, or do you have settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another immigration status that allows you to live here?

2026-01-28T18:49:28.046055 [actor]: uk citizen born here

2026-01-28T18:49:30.899013 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for that information.

Now let me ask about your daughter's education: Is she studying A-levels at a school or college that's approved for these purposes? And is she enrolled in full-time education or an approved training course?

2026-01-28T18:49:32.485085 [actor]: sixth form colege full time a levels

2026-01-28T18:49:34.675286 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. A sixth form college offering full-time A-levels would qualify.

Let me ask: Is your daughter under 20 years old? (I know you mentioned she's 17, but I need to confirm this for the assessment.)

2026-01-28T18:49:36.171218 [actor]: yes shes 17 under 20

2026-01-28T18:49:38.149013 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask: Does anyone else also claim Child Benefit for your daughter, or does she live with anyone else who might be claiming it for her?

2026-01-28T18:49:39.907312 [actor]: no just me shes with me nobody else claims

2026-01-28T18:49:42.838379 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me ask one more question: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year? This is important because it may affect whether you need to pay a tax charge on the Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T18:49:44.539895 [actor]: single father earn 40000 no partner

2026-01-28T18:49:49.172718 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a daughter under 20 (she's 17)
✓ She's living with you in the UK (London)
✓ You're responsible for her - paying for her food, clothes, rent, and bills
✓ She's in full-time approved education (A-levels at sixth form college)
✓ You're a UK citizen with the right to live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ Your income is £40,000, which is below the £60,000 threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply

Your daughter can continue to be covered by Child Benefit until she turns 20, as long as she remains in full-time approved education or training.

If you haven't already claimed, you can apply for Child Benefit. If you're already claiming, you should be able to continue receiving it under these circumstances.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T18:49:50.950682 [actor]: ok thank you got my answer

2026-01-28T18:49:55.713400 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria (child under 20 in approved full-time education, living with claimant who is responsible for the child, UK residency and citizenship, no duplicate claims, and income below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold) and provided the correct outcome that matches the expected "Eligible" result.
