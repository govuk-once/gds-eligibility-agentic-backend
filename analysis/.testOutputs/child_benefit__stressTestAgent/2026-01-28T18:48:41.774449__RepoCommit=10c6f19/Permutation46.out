2026-01-28T19:18:56.987030 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask: **Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:18:58.623867 [actor]: child benefit eligable pre setteld status no job 95 days

2026-01-28T19:19:00.500544 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you some clarifying questions to assess your eligibility properly.

**First, can you confirm: Do you have pre-settled status in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:19:01.858793 [actor]: yes pre setteld status looking for work

2026-01-28T19:19:03.990399 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you have pre-settled status and are looking for work.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: **Do you have a child or children who normally live with you, or for whom you are responsible?**

2026-01-28T19:19:05.448131 [actor]: yes have child

2026-01-28T19:19:07.000800 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now I need to understand more about your child's situation.

**Does your child normally live with you in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:19:08.462837 [actor]: yes child lives with me

2026-01-28T19:19:11.328421 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask another important question:

**Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for this child, or does anyone else have an equally strong claim to be responsible for the child (for example, does the child spend equal time living with another parent or guardian)?**

2026-01-28T19:19:12.783939 [actor]: no one else claiming only me responsable

2026-01-28T19:19:14.439879 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now I need to ask about your child's age:

**How old is your child?**

2026-01-28T19:19:15.840679 [actor]: child is 8 years old

2026-01-28T19:19:17.593656 [root_agent]: Thank you. One more question about your child:

**Is your child currently in full-time non-advanced education or approved training, or are they under 16 years old?**

2026-01-28T19:19:19.138564 [actor]: child is 8 so under 16

2026-01-28T19:19:21.365229 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Now, regarding your immigration status - you mentioned you have pre-settled status and are looking for work. Let me ask:

**Have you been in the UK for at least 3 months since obtaining your pre-settled status?**

2026-01-28T19:19:23.029727 [actor]: been looking for work 95 days now unemployed

2026-01-28T19:19:24.949991 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me clarify to make sure I understand correctly:

**Have you been physically living in the UK for at least 3 months (approximately 90 days) since you obtained your pre-settled status?**

2026-01-28T19:19:26.471029 [actor]: yes been in uk more than 3 months

2026-01-28T19:19:28.540986 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. One final important question:

**Are you currently registered as a jobseeker and actively looking for work with the relevant UK authorities (such as being registered with Jobcentre Plus or another employment service)?**

2026-01-28T19:19:29.968003 [actor]: yes registred jobseeker jobcentre plus

2026-01-28T19:19:34.561517 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 who lives with you
✓ You are responsible for the child and no one else is claiming Child Benefit for them
✓ You have pre-settled status in the UK
✓ You have been in the UK for more than 3 months
✓ You are registered as a jobseeker with Jobcentre Plus and actively looking for work

People with pre-settled status who are genuinely seeking work and registered with Jobcentre Plus have the right to reside in the UK, which satisfies the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

**You can apply for Child Benefit** for your 8-year-old child. The fact that you are currently unemployed does not prevent you from claiming Child Benefit - it is not means-tested and is available regardless of your income or employment status.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:19:41.313110 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. I stated I had been looking for work for 95 days (approximately 3 months), but the eligibility rules require those with pre-settled status to have worked in the UK for at least 3 months before claiming Child Benefit - being registered as a jobseeker for 95 days while unemployed does not satisfy the "right to reside" requirement for someone with pre-settled status who has no employment history in the UK.
