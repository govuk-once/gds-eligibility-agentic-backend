2026-01-29T18:19:12.029549 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The expected outcome is that the user is **Eligible** for Child Benefit. The agent explicitly concluded: "**you are eligible to claim Child Benefit now**" and confirmed "You do not need to wait for the adoption court order to be finalized."

The agent's reasoning was sound and aligned with UK Child Benefit rules for prospective adopters:

1. The agent correctly identified that the child (Maya, age 4) has been placed with the applicants by an adoption agency and lives in their home
2. The agent confirmed the applicants are responsible for the child's care and upbringing
3. The agent properly applied the rule that Child Benefit can be claimed **as soon as a child being adopted comes to live with the applicants** - without waiting for the final adoption order
4. The agent verified all other eligibility criteria (UK residence, no duplicate claims, child's status)

The agent's final determination of eligibility is correct and matches the expected outcome. The communication was clear, accurate, and properly addressed the user's specific question about whether they could claim before the court order is finalized.
