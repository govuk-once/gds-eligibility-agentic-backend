**Justification:**

The agent determined that Kevin is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and the official guidance, Kevin should be **eligible**.

**Key Analysis:**

1. **Contribution Amount:** Kevin contributes £120 every 4 weeks for groceries and clothes, which averages to **£30 per week**. This exceeds the Child Benefit rate of £26.05 per week (for the eldest/only child).

2. **Regularity of Contribution:** Kevin makes regular contributions every 4 weeks. According to gov.uk guidance on "child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else," contributions can be made as a **lump sum to cover a set period**, not just weekly payments.

3. **Mother Not Claiming:** The mother explicitly stated she is not claiming Child Benefit, which is a crucial factor.

4. **Contribution Equals/Exceeds Benefit Rate:** Kevin's contributions (£30/week equivalent) meet the threshold of contributing "at least the amount of Child Benefit" for the child.

**Agent's Error:**

The agent focused too heavily on:
- Physical custody (daughter living with mother)
- Decision-making responsibility (mother makes decisions)

The agent failed to properly assess whether Kevin's regular financial contributions of at least the Child Benefit amount would qualify him under the rules for when a child lives elsewhere but a parent contributes at least the equivalent amount.

**Conclusion:** The agent communicated an outcome of "not eligible" when the expected outcome is "eligible," therefore this is a **failure** (👎).
