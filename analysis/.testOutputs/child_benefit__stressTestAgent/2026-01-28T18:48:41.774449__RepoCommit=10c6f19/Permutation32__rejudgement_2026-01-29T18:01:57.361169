**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Age criteria met but insufficient:** The child (John, 17) falls within the 16-19 age range where Child Benefit can continue, but only if in approved full-time education.

2. **Study hours assessment:** The agent correctly identified that 6 hours per week does not meet the threshold for "full-time" education. The agent specifically noted that "at least 12 hours per week in supervised study" is typically required, which aligns with the government's criteria that approved education must average more than 12 hours per week of supervised study or tuition.

3. **Clear outcome communicated:** The agent explicitly stated "this would not meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit" and provided a clear rationale based on the insufficient study hours.

4. **Accurate application of rules:** The agent correctly applied the principle that for 16-19 year olds, full-time approved education is required, and 6 hours of GCSE resits does not qualify as such.

The agent's assessment matches the expected outcome that John's father Pete is **not eligible** for Child Benefit due to insufficient supervised study hours.
