**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit**, which aligns with the expected outcome. More importantly, the agent accurately explained the backdating limitation:

1. The agent clearly stated that "Child Benefit can be backdated for up to 3 months from the date you claim"
2. When the user specifically asked about losing 1 month's payment, the agent confirmed: "Yes, unfortunately that's correct...Since your baby is 4 months old, you would lose 1 month of payments"
3. The agent emphasized claiming the last 3 months and explained they would "lose 1 month of payments"

This communication precisely matches the expected outcome: **Eligible (but only for the last 3 months; they lose the first month's money).**

The agent demonstrated clear understanding of the backdating rules and effectively communicated both the eligibility and the specific limitation to the user.
