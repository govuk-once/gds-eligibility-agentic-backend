**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit**, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of hospital rules**: The agent recognized that normally Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks in hospital, but correctly identified the exception applies here.

2. **Proper exception criteria**: The agent accurately determined that because the parent (Mary) is spending £30/week on the child's upkeep (books, pyjamas, special food), which exceeds the Child Benefit amount, the exception to the 12-week hospital rule applies.

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "You should be eligible for Child Benefit" and explained the reasoning, including the key point about the hospital stay exception.

4. **Accurate fact-gathering**: The agent asked appropriate questions to establish:
   - Child's age (6, under 16) ✓
   - Parental responsibility ✓
   - Hospital duration (14 weeks, >12 weeks) ✓
   - Regular spending on child's upkeep (£30/week) ✓
   - UK residency ✓

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that Mary retains eligibility beyond the 12-week limit due to her regular spending on Chloe's upkeep while in hospital.
