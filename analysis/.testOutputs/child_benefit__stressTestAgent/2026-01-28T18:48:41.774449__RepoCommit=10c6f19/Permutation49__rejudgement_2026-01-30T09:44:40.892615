**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Child's age:** Tom is 17 years old, which means he falls into the 16-19 age category where Child Benefit eligibility depends on being in approved education or training.

2. **Course status:** The user eventually confirmed that Tom's computer coding course is "not approved education" - specifically stating "employer agreement course tom joins after not approved education."

3. **Exclusion criteria met:** According to gov.uk guidance, courses done "with an employer's agreement - for example, to get a job" are explicitly excluded from approved education. This matches Tom's situation exactly - he's doing a coding course paid for by a future employer with an agreement to join them afterwards.

4. **Agent's conclusion:** The agent correctly concluded: "You are not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation" because Tom's course is not approved education.

5. **Verification:** The evaluation_judge also marked this as correct (✓), noting the agent "appropriately concluded that I am not eligible."

The agent persisted appropriately in gathering necessary information, and ultimately reached the correct eligibility determination that matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
