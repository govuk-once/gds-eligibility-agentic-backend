**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible (Though potentially financially suboptimal)."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Eligibility correctly established**: The agent verified all the necessary criteria:
   - Child (Mia) is under 16
   - User is responsible for the child and lives with them
   - User lives in the UK
   - No one else is claiming for the child

2. **Age consideration handled appropriately**: The agent acknowledged that while the claimant is 15 years old, there is no specific age restriction preventing them from claiming Child Benefit as a parent.

3. **Financial suboptimality addressed**: The agent did mention that "it's often the grandparents (your parents) who claim Child Benefit, especially if they're providing financial support for both you and Mia," which touches on the financial comparison aspect without denying eligibility.

4. **Clear final answer**: When directly asked "so am i eligibile yes or no," the agent gave a clear "Yes, you are eligible" response and properly explained why.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome that Chloe is eligible to claim Child Benefit for Mia, even though it may not be the most financially optimal arrangement for the family as a whole.
