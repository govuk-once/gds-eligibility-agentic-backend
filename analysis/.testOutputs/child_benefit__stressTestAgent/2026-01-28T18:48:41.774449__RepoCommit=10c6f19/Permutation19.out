2026-01-28T18:59:56.058851 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T18:59:57.848434 [actor]: child benefit hollie 9 years old me and ex both look after

2026-01-28T19:00:01.088346 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 9-year-old child named Hollie, and both you and your ex-partner look after her.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand the care arrangements better:

**Does Hollie live with you, or does she live with your ex-partner, or does she split her time between both of your homes?**

2026-01-28T19:00:02.710982 [actor]: she stays with me 3 days and ex 4 days we both buy cloths and food

2026-01-28T19:00:05.261929 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Hollie spends 3 days with you and 4 days with your ex-partner, and you both contribute to her clothing and food.

This is an important situation because when a child's time is split between parents, only one person can claim Child Benefit.

My next question: **Are you or your ex-partner currently claiming Child Benefit for Hollie?**

2026-01-28T19:00:06.850938 [actor]: we both submitted claim cant agree who shoud get it

2026-01-28T19:00:11.455896 [root_agent]: I understand - you've both submitted claims and can't agree on who should receive it.

When parents can't agree and both submit claims, HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) will make a decision based on their rules. Generally, the person who has main responsibility for the child receives Child Benefit. When care is shared relatively equally (as in your situation), HMRC typically considers factors like:

- Who the child spends more time with
- Who is the main provider of day-to-day care

Since Hollie stays with your ex-partner for 4 days and with you for 3 days, HMRC would likely award Child Benefit to your ex-partner as Hollie spends slightly more time there.

However, let me ask: **Do you live in the UK?** (This is important for basic eligibility)

2026-01-28T19:00:12.919886 [actor]: yes uk both of us

2026-01-28T19:00:17.866342 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you both live in the UK.

Based on the information you've provided, here's the situation:

**You would be eligible for Child Benefit** in terms of the basic criteria - you're responsible for a child under 16, you live in the UK, and you contribute to Hollie's care.

**However**, only one person can actually receive Child Benefit for Hollie. Since you've both submitted claims and can't agree, HMRC will decide who gets it. They typically award it to the person the child spends more time with - in this case, that would likely be your ex-partner since Hollie stays there 4 days versus 3 days with you.

Let me ask one more important question that affects how much Child Benefit can be received:

**Do either you or your ex-partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

(This is important because it affects whether the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies)

2026-01-28T19:00:19.609676 [actor]: what happens if hmrc decides ex gets it can i apeal

2026-01-28T19:00:25.044222 [root_agent]: That's a good question about appealing HMRC's decision.

Yes, if HMRC decides your ex-partner should receive the Child Benefit, you do have options:

- You can **challenge their decision** if you disagree with it
- You would need to explain why you believe you should be the one to receive it (for example, if circumstances show you actually provide the main day-to-day care despite the 3/4 day split)

However, I should mention that appeals typically succeed when there's a clear case that the wrong decision was made based on the facts.

Before we discuss appeals further, let me complete the eligibility assessment:

**Do either you or your ex-partner earn more than £50,000 per year individually?**

This is important because if either of you earns over this amount, there's a tax charge that applies which reduces or eliminates the benefit of receiving Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T19:00:26.633314 [actor]: no neither of us earn over 50000

2026-01-28T19:00:31.309986 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful to know - it means neither of you would face the High Income Child Benefit Charge, so whoever receives the Child Benefit would get the full amount without any tax implications.

To summarize your situation:

**Your eligibility:** You meet the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit - you're responsible for a 9-year-old child, you live in the UK, you contribute to her care, and you don't earn over £50,000.

**The issue:** Only one person can claim for Hollie. Since you both submitted claims and she spends 4 days with your ex and 3 days with you, HMRC will likely award it to your ex-partner as the person with whom Hollie spends more time.

**What happens next:** HMRC will contact both of you with their decision about who will receive the Child Benefit.

Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit eligibility or the process?

2026-01-28T19:00:33.089325 [actor]: ok so ex probly gets it bcause 4 days thx

2026-01-28T19:00:35.884056 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct - your ex-partner will probably get it because Hollie stays there 4 days compared to 3 days with you. HMRC typically awards Child Benefit to whoever the child spends the most time with when parents share care.

You're welcome! If you have any other questions about Child Benefit in the future, feel free to ask.

Take care!

2026-01-28T19:00:41.442824 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that while the claimant meets the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, HMRC would likely award it to the ex-partner because the child spends 4 days there versus 3 days with the claimant, correctly applying the principle that only one person can claim and the benefit typically goes to the person with whom the child spends more time.
