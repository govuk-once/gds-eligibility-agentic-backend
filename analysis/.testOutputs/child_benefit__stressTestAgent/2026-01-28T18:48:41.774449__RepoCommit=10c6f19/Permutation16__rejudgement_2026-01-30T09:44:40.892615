**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit for 12 weeks** but not beyond that period. However, the expected outcome is **Eligible** (without the 12-week limitation).

According to the gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital or care (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), there is a specific exception for children who go abroad **specifically for hospital treatment**. The guidance states that if a child only went abroad to be in hospital, Child Benefit can continue as long as the parent is still responsible for them and contributing to their costs.

In this scenario:
- Oliver (14) went to the USA specifically for specialist hospital treatment for a rare condition
- Hannah remains in the UK but pays for his incidental costs and visits when possible
- The child went abroad solely for medical treatment, not for any other reason

The agent incorrectly applied the general 12-week hospital rule, which applies to children in hospital **in the UK**. The agent failed to recognize or apply the international exception that allows Child Benefit to continue beyond 12 weeks when a child goes abroad specifically for hospital treatment and the parent continues to support them financially.

Therefore, the agent's communicated outcome (eligible for only 12 weeks) does **not** agree with the expected outcome (eligible without the 12-week limitation).
