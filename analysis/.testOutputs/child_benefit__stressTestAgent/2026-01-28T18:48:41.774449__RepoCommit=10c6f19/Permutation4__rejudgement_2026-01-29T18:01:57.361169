**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Reasoning:**
1. The daughter is 18 years old and left school 2 years ago
2. She is currently working 30 hours per week as a receptionist
3. She is not in any approved education or training

The agent accurately explained that:
- Child Benefit stops at age 16 unless the child remains in approved education or training
- Education/training can extend eligibility up to age 20
- Since the daughter left school and is working full-time (30 hours/week), she does not meet the criteria

According to gov.uk guidance, young people aged 16-19 can only qualify if they are in approved education or training, and even then, working 24+ hours per week typically disqualifies them. The agent's assessment that the user is **not eligible** is correct and matches the expected outcome.
