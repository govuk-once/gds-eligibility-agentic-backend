**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user (Robert) is **eligible for Child Benefit for Sam** at the higher "eldest child" rate. 

Key points supporting this assessment:

1. **Correct eligibility determination**: The agent properly identified that Robert meets all criteria for Child Benefit (responsible for Sam, Sam is under 16, lives in UK, UK citizen, Sam lives with him full-time, no one else claiming).

2. **Alignment with expected outcome**: The expected outcome states "Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)" - meaning both Robert (for Sam) and Tina (for Ella) should each receive the higher eldest child rate. The agent explicitly addressed this by stating: "Just to be clear: Tina would separately be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ella, since Ella lives with her full-time."

3. **Correct application of split family rules**: According to the permutation guidance, when families split and children are divided between parents, each parent is entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for the eldest child in their specific household. While the agent didn't mention the specific rate amount, they correctly identified that Robert would receive Child Benefit for Sam and Tina would separately receive it for Ella.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that both parents are eligible, each receiving benefits for their respective child.
