2026-01-28T19:12:26.795463 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T19:12:28.491123 [actor]: child benefit eligibility 10 year old living with me now

2026-01-28T19:12:31.134702 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 10-year-old child living with you now.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for this child? By this I mean, do you look after the child and pay towards their upbringing (for example, food, clothes, or pocket money)?

2026-01-28T19:12:32.938469 [actor]: yes pay for everything food clothes school stuff child lives here

2026-01-28T19:12:35.037914 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Next question: Are you or your partner currently receiving Child Benefit for this child already? In other words, is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for this 10-year-old?

2026-01-28T19:12:36.820505 [actor]: no not getting it childs mum sick thats why here

2026-01-28T19:12:40.113329 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. So the child's mother is unwell and that's why the child is now living with you, and no one is currently claiming Child Benefit for this child.

To help assess your eligibility further, I need to ask: What is your relationship to this child? For example, are you the child's parent, grandparent, other family member, or friend?

2026-01-28T19:12:41.773105 [actor]: mums best frend child staying with me

2026-01-28T19:12:44.172297 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that - so you're the mother's best friend and the child is staying with you while the mother is unwell.

This is important information. Can you tell me: Is this a temporary arrangement while the mother recovers, or is this expected to be a longer-term or permanent living situation for the child?

2026-01-28T19:12:45.922819 [actor]: foreseeable futur dont know how long mum illness

2026-01-28T19:12:48.087267 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So the child is staying with you for the foreseeable future while the mother deals with her illness, though you're not sure how long that will be.

Let me ask: Do you live in the UK (England, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland)?

2026-01-28T19:12:49.525399 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T19:12:51.769077 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now, an important question: Does the child's mother still have parental responsibility for the child, or has this been transferred to you through any formal arrangement (such as a special guardianship order, child arrangements order, or similar legal arrangement)?

2026-01-28T19:12:53.792845 [actor]: no just privat arangement mum still parent council knows about it

2026-01-28T19:12:56.343966 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So it's a private arrangement between you and the mother, she still has parental responsibility, and the council is aware of the situation.

This is helpful to know. One more question about the living arrangements: Is the mother living at a different address from you and the child, or is she also living in your household?

2026-01-28T19:12:59.219627 [actor]: mum different adress child here with me

2026-01-28T19:13:01.305724 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So the mother lives at a different address and the child is living with you.

Let me ask: Do you know if the child's mother is currently claiming Child Benefit for this child, even though the child is now living with you?

2026-01-28T19:13:02.985747 [actor]: no nobody claiming it alredy said that

2026-01-28T19:13:05.460718 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right, I apologize for asking that again - you did already tell me that no one is currently claiming Child Benefit for this child.

Let me ask a different question: Are you getting any financial support from the child's mother towards the child's costs, or are you covering all the expenses yourself?

2026-01-28T19:13:07.174769 [actor]: covering evrything myself no money from mum

2026-01-28T19:13:09.638198 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. So you're covering all the child's expenses yourself without any financial support from the mother.

One final important question: Do you or your partner have an immigration status that would prevent you from claiming benefits? In other words, do you have the right to claim benefits in the UK (for example, are you a British citizen, have settled status, or have another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits)?

2026-01-28T19:13:11.146285 [actor]: british citizen can claim benefits

2026-01-28T19:13:16.043507 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your situation based on what you've told me.

**Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for this child.**

Here's why:

- You have a 10-year-old child living with you (under 16, so within the age limit)
- You are responsible for the child - you're paying for everything they need including food, clothes, and school supplies
- The child is living with you for the foreseeable future
- You live in the UK and are a British citizen with the right to claim benefits
- No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for this child
- The child's mother lives at a different address

Even though you're not the child's parent, you can still claim Child Benefit because you are the person the child is living with and you are responsible for them. The fact that this is a private arrangement (rather than a formal care order) doesn't prevent you from claiming, as long as you meet the criteria of being responsible for the child.

You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit. Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-28T19:13:19.375798 [actor]: ok thank you

2026-01-28T19:13:22.307208 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am eligible for Child Benefit based on the key facts: I have a 10-year-old child living with me, I am responsible for their care and expenses, no one else is claiming for this child, the child lives with me (not the mother), and I am a UK resident with the right to claim benefits. The agent correctly recognized that being the mother's friend rather than a parent does not disqualify me from claiming when I am the person responsible for the child.
