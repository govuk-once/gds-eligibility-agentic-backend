**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Hospital duration exceeded:** The child has been in hospital for 14 weeks, exceeding the 12-week threshold.

2. **No financial contribution:** The user explicitly stated "no hospital provides everything" and is not spending money on the child's upkeep, clothes, food, or gifts.

3. **Free NHS treatment:** The child is receiving free in-patient NHS treatment.

4. **Expenditure exception not met:** According to the scenario, the exception requires "regularly spending money" on the child's upkeep. The user only visits but does not make any financial contribution, so the exception after week 12 is not satisfied.

5. **Agent's conclusion:** The agent clearly stated multiple times that the user is "not currently eligible" and explained that "payments stop after a child has been in hospital for 12 weeks in these circumstances."

The agent provided accurate guidance consistent with [Child Benefit rules for children in hospital](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), correctly identifying that without the required financial contribution, eligibility ceases after 12 weeks of hospitalization with free NHS treatment.
