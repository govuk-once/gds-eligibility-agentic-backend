2026-01-28T18:58:55.647772 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you are responsible for?**

2026-01-28T18:58:57.702529 [actor]: son dev 20 years old studing a levels

2026-01-28T18:59:00.547134 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 20-year-old son named Dev who is studying A Levels.

**Is your son still in approved full-time education or training, and has he been continuously in education since leaving compulsory education at age 16?**

(A Levels would typically count as approved education, but I need to confirm the continuity and that it's full-time non-advanced education.)

2026-01-28T18:59:02.235030 [actor]: yes full time a levels not finished yet

2026-01-28T18:59:04.934548 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you. Since your son is 20 and still in full-time A Level education (which is approved non-advanced education), this could make you eligible.

Now I need to ask about your responsibility for him:

**Does your son live with you, or are you responsible for him in terms of supporting him financially?**

2026-01-28T18:59:06.778702 [actor]: he lives with me i pay for evrything

2026-01-28T18:59:08.585044 [root_agent]: Excellent, that's very helpful information. So your son lives with you and you're financially responsible for him.

Now I need to ask about your own circumstances:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T18:59:09.955658 [actor]: yes in uk raj age 50

2026-01-28T18:59:12.479215 [root_agent]: Thank you, Raj. So you're 50 years old and living in the UK with your 20-year-old son Dev who is studying full-time A Levels, and you're financially supporting him.

Now I need to understand your residency status:

**Are you a UK citizen, or do you have the right to reside in the UK (for example, through settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another immigration status)?**

2026-01-28T18:59:14.010541 [actor]: uk citizen born here

2026-01-28T18:59:17.193410 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for that information.

Now I need to ask about whether anyone else might be claiming Child Benefit for Dev:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your son Dev, or does anyone else have an equal or main responsibility for him (such as his other parent)?**

2026-01-28T18:59:18.624298 [actor]: no just me i claim for him

2026-01-28T18:59:21.200567 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Just to be clear - are you saying that you are **already currently claiming** Child Benefit for Dev, or are you asking whether you **can claim** Child Benefit for him?

This is an important distinction as it affects what guidance I need to give you.

2026-01-28T18:59:22.814525 [actor]: already claiming want to know if still eligible now hes 20

2026-01-28T18:59:26.365098 [root_agent]: Ah, I understand now - you're already claiming Child Benefit and want to know if you can continue to claim now that Dev is 20 years old.

This is an important question. Let me ask:

**When does Dev turn 20, or when did he turn 20? Specifically, I need to know if his 20th birthday fell before or after the 31st of August in the current school year.**

(This matters because Child Benefit can continue until a young person finishes their approved education or training, but there are specific rules about when it stops based on their age and the dates involved.)

2026-01-28T18:59:28.144923 [actor]: he turned 20 last week middle of term

2026-01-28T18:59:31.070385 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Dev turned 20 last week, which means it was during the middle of the current academic term.

One more important question:

**When is Dev expected to finish his A Level course? Will he complete it before the end of August this year, or will his course continue beyond that date?**

(The timing of when the course ends is crucial for determining how long Child Benefit can continue.)

2026-01-28T18:59:32.786534 [actor]: finishes in june this year

2026-01-28T18:59:38.533669 [root_agent]: Thank you, Raj. Based on all the information you've provided, I can now assess your eligibility.

**Good news - you should still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Dev.**

Here's why:

✓ Dev is under 20 and in full-time approved education (A Levels)
✓ He lives with you and you're responsible for him
✓ You're a UK citizen living in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming for him
✓ His course finishes in June this year

**However, please note:** Child Benefit will stop on the **31st August** following Dev finishing his course in June, or when he turns 20, whichever comes first. Since Dev has already turned 20, your Child Benefit will stop at the end of the **terminal date** - which is typically the Monday following his last day of approved education, or 31st August, whichever is earlier.

Since his course finishes in June and he's already 20, your Child Benefit should continue until the end of the summer term (usually the end of August at the latest).

**Is there anything else about your Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?**

2026-01-28T18:59:40.330876 [actor]: ok so i still get it until august then

2026-01-28T18:59:44.379556 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct, Raj. You should continue to receive Child Benefit until the end of August this year (or more precisely, until the terminal date after Dev finishes his A Levels in June).

The payment will stop after that point because:
- Dev will have completed his approved education course
- The terminal date (typically 31st August or the Monday after the course ends) will have passed

So you have a few more months of Child Benefit payments to receive.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?**

2026-01-28T18:59:45.968020 [actor]: no thats all i needed thanks

2026-01-28T18:59:47.813356 [root_agent]: You're very welcome, Raj! I'm glad I could help clarify your Child Benefit eligibility. 

If you have any questions in the future, feel free to ask. Take care!

2026-01-28T18:59:53.501208 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit stops when a young person reaches 20 years of age, even if they are still in approved education or training. Since Dev turned 20 last week (middle of term), the benefit should have ceased on his 20th birthday, not continue until August as the agent stated.
