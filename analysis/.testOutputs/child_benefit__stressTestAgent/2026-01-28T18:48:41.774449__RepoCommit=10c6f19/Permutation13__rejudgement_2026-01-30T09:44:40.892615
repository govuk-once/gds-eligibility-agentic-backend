**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

The agent's assessment was thorough and accurate:

1. **Correct understanding of adoption rules**: The agent correctly informed the user that they do not need to wait for the final adoption court order and can claim Child Benefit as soon as the child is placed with them by the adoption agency.

2. **Proper verification of criteria**: The agent systematically verified all relevant eligibility criteria:
   - Child's age (implicitly confirmed)
   - Responsibility for the child (confirmed - they look after her and she lives with them)
   - UK residence (confirmed)
   - No duplicate claims (confirmed - no one else claiming)
   - Child's immigration status (confirmed - British citizen)

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you are eligible to claim Child Benefit now" and provided a clear explanation of why.

According to [gov.uk guidance](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), you can claim Child Benefit if you're responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 in approved education/training) who normally lives with you. For adoption cases, you can claim as soon as the child is placed with you - you don't need to wait for the legal process to complete.

The agent's conclusion matches both the expected outcome and the official guidance.
