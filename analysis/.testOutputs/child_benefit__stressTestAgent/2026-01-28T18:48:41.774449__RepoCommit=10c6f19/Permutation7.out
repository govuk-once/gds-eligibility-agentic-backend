2026-01-28T18:52:48.931704 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T18:52:50.911399 [actor]: son 14 yrs old weekend visits fridays to sundays

2026-01-28T18:52:53.407723 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old son who visits you on weekends from Friday to Sunday.

To assess your eligibility, I need to understand your living arrangements better:

**Does your son live with you for the majority of the time, or does he primarily live with someone else (such as another parent or guardian) during the week?**

2026-01-28T18:52:55.075962 [actor]: son in care local authority 3 months now

2026-01-28T18:52:58.024400 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So your 14-year-old son has been in local authority care for 3 months, and you have weekend visits with him from Fridays to Sundays.

This is an important detail for determining eligibility. Let me ask:

**Does the local authority pay for the full cost of looking after your son while he is in care, or do you contribute towards his care costs?**

2026-01-28T18:53:00.592373 [actor]: he comes home evry weekend friday nite saturday nite then leaves sunday

2026-01-28T18:53:02.851357 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. I understand your son comes home every weekend (Friday night and Saturday night, leaving on Sunday).

To assess your situation properly, I still need to know:

**Is the local authority paying for the full cost of your son's care during the week, or are you required to contribute towards those costs?**

2026-01-28T18:53:04.964748 [actor]: weekends home two nights fridy saturdayy

2026-01-28T18:53:07.795169 [root_agent]: I understand - your son stays with you for two nights every weekend (Friday and Saturday nights).

I still need to understand the financial arrangements to properly assess your eligibility:

**Does the local authority cover all the costs of looking after your son while he's in their care during the week, or do you have to pay something towards his care?**

2026-01-28T18:53:09.249334 [actor]: local authority pays for care

2026-01-28T18:53:11.337955 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that the local authority pays for your son's care.

Now I need to understand one more important detail:

**Before your son went into local authority care 3 months ago, were you receiving Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T18:53:12.818232 [actor]: need to know if eligible now

2026-01-28T18:53:15.256854 [root_agent]: I understand you want to know about your eligibility now.

Based on the information you've provided, let me ask you one final question to give you an accurate assessment:

**When your son stays with you on Friday and Saturday nights each weekend, are you responsible for providing for him during those visits (such as food, care, and supervision)?**

2026-01-28T18:53:16.715329 [actor]: yes provide food care weekends

2026-01-28T18:53:21.623585 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

Based on the rules for Child Benefit when a child is in local authority care:

**You are NOT eligible for Child Benefit in your current situation.**

Here's why:

When a child is in local authority care and the local authority pays the full cost of looking after them, you cannot claim Child Benefit for that child - even if the child comes to stay with you regularly at weekends.

The key factor is that the local authority is paying for your son's care during the week. Weekend visits, even regular ones where you provide food and care, don't change this eligibility rule.

**However**, if your circumstances change in the future - for example, if your son comes back to live with you full-time or if you start contributing to the costs of his care - your eligibility could be different, and you would need to reassess at that time.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T18:53:27.522017 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, there is an exception where a child in local authority care can still qualify for Child Benefit if they live with the claimant for at least one night per week on a regular basis - this person has their son staying two nights every weekend, which meets this exception criterion.
