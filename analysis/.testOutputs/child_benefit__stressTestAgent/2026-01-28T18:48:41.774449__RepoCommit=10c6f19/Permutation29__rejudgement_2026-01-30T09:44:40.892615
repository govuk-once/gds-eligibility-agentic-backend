2026-01-30T10:03:19.221673 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent systematically gathered the relevant information:
- The child is 17 years old (over 16)
- The child finished GCSEs last year and is not currently in college or any approved education/training
- The child has not registered with any careers service or similar program

The agent correctly applied the Child Benefit eligibility rules by explaining that:
1. Child Benefit normally stops at age 16
2. It can continue until age 20 only if the young person is in approved education or training
3. Since Jordan (the 17-year-old) is not in education/training and hasn't registered with a careers service, the parent is not eligible

This assessment aligns perfectly with the expected outcome that Jordan does not meet Criteria 2 (not in approved education/training) or Criteria 3 (does not qualify for the 20-week extension as he hasn't registered with a careers service). The agent clearly communicated "you would not be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided accurate reasoning based on the gov.uk eligibility criteria.
