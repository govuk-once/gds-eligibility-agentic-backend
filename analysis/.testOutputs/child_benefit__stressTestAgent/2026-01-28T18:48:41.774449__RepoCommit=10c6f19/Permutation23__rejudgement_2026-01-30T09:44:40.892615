**Justification:**

The agent determined the user was **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the scenario details and HMRC guidance, the user **should be eligible**.

**Key Analysis:**

1. **Contribution Amount:** The user contributes £120 every 4 weeks, which equals £30/week average. This exceeds the Child Benefit threshold of £26.05/week.

2. **HMRC Guidance on Contributions:** According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, a person who doesn't live with the child can claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the Child Benefit rate to the child's upkeep. The guidance explicitly allows for **lump sum contributions** covering a set period.

3. **Mother Not Claiming:** The user confirmed the mother is not claiming Child Benefit, which removes the "only one person can claim" barrier.

4. **Agent's Error:** The agent incorrectly focused on who makes day-to-day decisions and who the child lives with, rather than properly assessing whether the financial contribution met the threshold when the primary caregiver isn't claiming.

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible
**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Not Eligible

The agent failed to recognize that sufficient regular financial contributions (£30/week equivalent) can establish eligibility when the person the child lives with is not claiming the benefit.
