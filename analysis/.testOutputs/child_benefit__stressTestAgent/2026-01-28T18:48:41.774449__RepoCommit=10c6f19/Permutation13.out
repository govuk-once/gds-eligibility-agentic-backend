2026-01-28T18:56:10.773855 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child (or children) who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T18:56:12.431564 [actor]: child living with us adopting not final yet

2026-01-28T18:56:15.381726 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child living with you and the adoption isn't finalized yet.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for this child? This means, are you the main person who looks after them and pays towards their upbringing (such as food, clothes, and pocket money)?**

2026-01-28T18:56:17.394940 [actor]: yes we look after child she lives in our home now adoption agency placed her with us

2026-01-28T18:56:20.324955 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like the child has been placed with you by an adoption agency and you're looking after her in your home.

Let me ask the next important question:

**Do you or your partner normally live in the UK, or are you a Crown servant (such as a diplomat or member of HM Forces) or a pension scheme member of the European Union, European Economic Area or Switzerland?**

2026-01-28T18:56:21.762390 [actor]: uk live here always

2026-01-28T18:56:23.854143 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you live in the UK.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you or your partner currently receiving Child Benefit for this child, or is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-28T18:56:25.633630 [actor]: no one claiming want to know if we can claim now or wait for court order

2026-01-28T18:56:29.732919 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important question. Let me think through this carefully based on the eligibility rules.

From what you've told me, you have a child placed with you by an adoption agency, she lives in your home, you're responsible for her care and costs, you live in the UK, and no one else is claiming Child Benefit for her.

**Based on the rules, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit now - you don't need to wait for the final court order.** The key criteria are that you're responsible for the child and they normally live with you, which is your situation.

However, I need to ask one more question to be thorough:

**Is the child a British citizen, or does she have a right to live in the UK (through settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or similar)?**

2026-01-28T18:56:31.417476 [actor]: she is british lives here

2026-01-28T18:56:35.177638 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Based on all the information you've provided, **you are eligible to claim Child Benefit now**. You do not need to wait for the adoption court order to be finalized.

Here's why you're eligible:

✓ The child is under 16 (or under 20 in education/training)
✓ You are responsible for her - you look after her and pay for her upbringing
✓ She lives with you (placed by the adoption agency)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ She is British
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

The fact that the adoption isn't yet finalized doesn't prevent you from claiming. What matters is that you're responsible for the child and she normally lives with you, which is your current situation.

You can go ahead and apply for Child Benefit now. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-28T18:56:40.659048 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user can claim Child Benefit before the adoption is finalized, as long as the child is placed with them by an adoption agency, lives with them, and they are responsible for the child's care - all of which were confirmed in this case.
