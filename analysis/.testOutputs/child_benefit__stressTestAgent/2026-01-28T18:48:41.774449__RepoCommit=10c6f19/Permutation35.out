2026-01-28T19:10:41.723647 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:10:43.455232 [actor]: rashid 17 still doing a levels

2026-01-28T19:10:45.835291 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child named Rashid who is 17 and still doing A Levels - that's good, as children under 20 who are in approved education or training can qualify.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:10:47.412782 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T19:10:50.041635 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. You live in the UK and have a 17-year-old doing A Levels.

Next question:

**Is Rashid living with you, or are they living with someone else (for example, at a boarding school, with another parent, or with another family member)?**

2026-01-28T19:10:51.748284 [actor]: rashid lives with us at home

2026-01-28T19:10:53.706211 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Rashid lives with you at home and is doing A Levels.

Next question:

**Are you the person who is mainly responsible for Rashid? In other words, are you the one who looks after them on a day-to-day basis?**

2026-01-28T19:10:55.561245 [actor]: yes we look after him his father

2026-01-28T19:10:57.310976 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you and Rashid's father look after him.

Let me ask:

**Are you Rashid's mother or father?**

2026-01-28T19:10:58.802586 [actor]: father wants to claim for rashid

2026-01-28T19:11:01.075508 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Rashid's father wants to claim.

An important question:

**Does Rashid's mother also live in the same household with you and Rashid?**

(This is important because when two people live together and are both responsible for a child, only one person can claim Child Benefit for that child.)

2026-01-28T19:11:02.663381 [actor]: yes mother lives here too

2026-01-28T19:11:05.236675 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since both mother and father live in the same household with Rashid, only one of you can claim Child Benefit for him.

Let me ask another important question:

**Do you or Rashid's mother currently receive Child Benefit for Rashid, or has either of you claimed it in the past?**

2026-01-28T19:11:06.848068 [actor]: father wants claim now

2026-01-28T19:11:08.800490 [root_agent]: I understand the father wants to claim now. Let me clarify:

**Is anyone currently receiving Child Benefit for Rashid at the moment - either the mother or anyone else?**

2026-01-28T19:11:10.227144 [actor]: no one claiming currently

2026-01-28T19:11:12.891376 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one is currently claiming Child Benefit for Rashid.

One more important question:

**Do either you (the father) or Rashid's mother have immigration status that allows you to claim benefits in the UK? For example, are you British citizens, have settled status, or have another immigration status that gives you access to public funds?**

2026-01-28T19:11:14.396136 [actor]: british citizens yes

2026-01-28T19:11:16.663436 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that you're British citizens.

Let me ask one final question to complete the assessment:

**Does Rashid live with you all the time, or does he spend significant time living elsewhere (for example, in a care home, hospital, or with another family member for extended periods)?**

2026-01-28T19:11:18.294532 [actor]: rashid wife lives here too she moved in

2026-01-28T19:11:20.033896 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information - so Rashid's wife also lives in the household.

Just to clarify something important:

**Is Rashid married?**

2026-01-28T19:11:21.653364 [actor]: yes rashid married his girlfriend shes 17 too

2026-01-28T19:11:24.283313 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important information. This is a significant detail.

Let me ask:

**When did Rashid get married?**

(This is important because marriage or civil partnership can affect Child Benefit eligibility, as married young people are generally treated differently under the rules.)

2026-01-28T19:11:25.886740 [actor]: recently got married

2026-01-28T19:11:27.941832 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to understand a bit more about Rashid's education:

**Is Rashid still enrolled in and actively attending his A Level courses now, after getting married?**

2026-01-28T19:11:29.436928 [actor]: yes still doing a levels at college

2026-01-28T19:11:31.976794 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Let me ask one more question about his education:

**Is the A Level course that Rashid is doing considered "approved education or training"? In other words, is it a full-time course (at least 12 hours per week of supervised study) at a school or college?**

2026-01-28T19:11:33.710902 [actor]: full time a levels yes

2026-01-28T19:11:38.946241 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me provide you with my assessment based on what you've told me.

**Assessment:**

Based on the information you've provided, there is an important factor that affects eligibility:

**Rashid is married.** Under Child Benefit rules, you cannot usually get Child Benefit for a child or young person who is married or in a civil partnership, even if they are under 20 and still in full-time approved education or training.

**Therefore, the father would NOT be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Rashid because Rashid is married.**

The other criteria are met:
- Rashid is under 20
- He's in full-time approved education (A Levels)
- He lives with you
- You're responsible for him
- You're British citizens living in the UK

However, the marriage disqualifies him from Child Benefit coverage, regardless of his age or educational status.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this decision?

2026-01-28T19:11:44.914380 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that Rashid is not eligible for Child Benefit because he is married, determining the outcome as "Not Eligible." However, the expected outcome is "Eligible (via Exception)," indicating there is an exception to the marriage rule that applies in this case.
