2026-01-28T18:58:18.873894 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T18:58:20.359909 [actor]: child benfit germany army

2026-01-28T18:58:23.133967 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask a relevant question based on this:

**Are you currently living in Germany as a member of the UK armed forces, or are you living in Germany for another reason?**

This is important because your eligibility for UK Child Benefit can depend on your circumstances while living abroad.

2026-01-28T18:58:24.546142 [actor]: posted germany base wife kids

2026-01-28T18:58:27.358211 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you're posted to a base in Germany with your wife and children.

Let me ask you this:

**Are you a member of the UK armed forces (or a Crown servant) who is posted to Germany, or is your spouse the one serving in the UK armed forces?**

This distinction is important for determining your eligibility for UK Child Benefit while stationed abroad.

2026-01-28T18:58:28.932484 [actor]: im in armed forces british

2026-01-28T18:58:30.959381 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for clarifying that you're in the British armed forces.

Now let me ask:

**How many children do you have, and are they all under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T18:58:32.513735 [actor]: 2 kids 8 and 10

2026-01-28T18:58:34.554043 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you have 2 children aged 8 and 10.

Let me ask you this important question:

**Are both children living with you (or your wife) as part of your household in Germany?**

2026-01-28T18:58:36.217814 [actor]: yes live with us base germany

2026-01-28T18:58:38.314732 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both children live with you on the base in Germany.

Let me ask you:

**Are you or your wife responsible for the children - meaning you're supporting them financially and making decisions about their upbringing?**

2026-01-28T18:58:39.683399 [actor]: yes we responsible for them

2026-01-28T18:58:41.911133 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

One more important question:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for these two children - for example, a former partner or another family member?**

2026-01-28T18:58:43.517160 [actor]: no one else claiming

2026-01-28T18:58:47.553615 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit!**

Here's why:

✓ You have 2 children aged 8 and 10 (both under 16)
✓ The children live with you as part of your household
✓ You and your wife are responsible for them
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for them
✓ You're a member of the UK armed forces posted to Germany

**Importantly, as a member of the British armed forces posted abroad, you can still claim UK Child Benefit even though you're living in Germany.** The UK government allows service personnel and Crown servants working abroad to claim Child Benefit.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for both of your children. Would you like to know anything else about your eligibility or the application process?

2026-01-28T18:58:53.445377 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that UK armed forces personnel posted abroad (in this case Germany) remain eligible for Child Benefit, and correctly verified all necessary criteria: children under 16, living with the claimant, claimant is responsible for them, and no one else is claiming.
