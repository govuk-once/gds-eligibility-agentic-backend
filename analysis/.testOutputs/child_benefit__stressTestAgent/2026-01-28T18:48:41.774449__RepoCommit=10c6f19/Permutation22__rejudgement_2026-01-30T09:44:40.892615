**Justification:**

The agent made a critical error in applying the "linking rule" for hospital stays under Child Benefit eligibility rules.

**The Facts:**
- Arthur (7 years old) was in hospital for 10 weeks
- He was discharged and home for 2 weeks (15 days based on scenario)
- He was readmitted and has now been in hospital for 3 weeks
- Total cumulative hospital time: 13 weeks
- The hospital covers all costs during his stays

**The Linking Rule:**
According to gov.uk guidance, if a child returns to hospital within 28 days of being discharged, the hospital stays are "linked" and count cumulatively toward the 12-week limit. Since Arthur returned after only 15 days (2 weeks), the stays must be linked: 10 weeks + 3 weeks = 13 weeks total.

**The Agent's Error:**
The agent stated: "because he's been coming home between hospital stays (he was home for 2 weeks between admissions), each hospital stay would likely be counted separately rather than as one continuous period."

This is incorrect. The agent failed to apply the 28-day linking rule and wrongly concluded that Jenny remains eligible for Child Benefit.

**Expected Outcome:**
Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week) - Jenny would have lost eligibility after Arthur's cumulative 12th week in hospital (which occurred during his current 3-week readmission).

**Conclusion:**
The agent communicated that Jenny is eligible when she should actually be ineligible after the 12th cumulative week. This does not agree with the expected outcome.
