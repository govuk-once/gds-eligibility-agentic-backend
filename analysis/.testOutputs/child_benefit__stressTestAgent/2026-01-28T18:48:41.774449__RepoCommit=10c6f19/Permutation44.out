2026-01-28T19:17:32.990528 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:17:34.708141 [actor]: child in care 12 years old visits weekends

2026-01-28T19:17:37.139815 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 12-year-old child who is in care but visits you on weekends.

Let me ask you an important follow-up question:

**Is the child living in care arranged by the local council (local authority), or are they living with someone else through a private arrangement?**

2026-01-28T19:17:38.901944 [actor]: local authority care comes home saturday mornings

2026-01-28T19:17:41.939550 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your 12-year-old child is in local authority care and comes home on Saturday mornings.

This is helpful information. Now I need to understand more about the care arrangement:

**Does your child stay with you for the entire weekend, and if so, do they return to care on Sunday evening or Monday morning?**

2026-01-28T19:17:43.646808 [actor]: comes saturday 10am returns sunday 11am

2026-01-28T19:17:45.787159 [root_agent]: Thank you for that detail. So your child comes to stay with you from Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am each week.

Now I need to ask:

**Who currently receives the Child Benefit for this child - is it you, the local authority, or someone else?**

2026-01-28T19:17:48.254666 [actor]: nobody getting it want to know if i can claim

2026-01-28T19:17:50.746313 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that nobody is currently claiming Child Benefit for your child.

This is important information. Now let me ask:

**During the time your child is in local authority care (during the week), are they living in a council-run children's home, with foster carers arranged by the council, or in another type of care arrangement?**

2026-01-28T19:17:52.341864 [actor]: council children home 25 hours home each week

2026-01-28T19:17:55.778214 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details. So your child lives in a council children's home and spends 25 hours at home with you each week.

Let me ask one more important question to assess your eligibility:

**Are you contributing to the cost of looking after your child (for example, paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit would be worth, which is currently the weekly Child Benefit rate)?**

2026-01-28T19:17:57.761709 [actor]: not paying anything for the care

2026-01-28T19:18:02.867650 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Let me now assess your eligibility for Child Benefit based on the information you've provided.

**Assessment:**

Based on what you've told me, **you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit** for your child, but there are some important considerations:

**Why you may be eligible:**
- Your child is under 16 (they're 12 years old)
- Your child spends regular time with you (25 hours per week, including overnight stays on weekends)
- Nobody is currently claiming Child Benefit for this child
- You're not contributing to the cost of their care

**Important points:**
When a child is in local authority care, the general rule is that the local authority can claim Child Benefit. However, if:
- The local authority is not claiming it (which appears to be the case here), AND
- You have the child staying with you regularly

Then you may be able to claim it yourself.

**My recommendation:**
You should apply for Child Benefit and explain your circumstances - that your child is in local authority care but spends 25 hours each week with you. The Child Benefit Office will make the final decision on your eligibility based on your specific situation.

Would you like to know how to apply?

2026-01-28T19:18:04.751203 [actor]: ok thanks for info

2026-01-28T19:18:09.154179 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user may be eligible for Child Benefit given their child is in local authority care but spends 25 hours weekly with them, nobody currently claims the benefit, and appropriately recommended applying while explaining the Child Benefit Office will make the final determination.
