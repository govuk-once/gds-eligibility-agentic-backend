2026-01-28T19:20:42.863928 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:20:44.406176 [actor]: child benefit tom 17 computr course

2026-01-28T19:20:46.617033 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child named Tom who is 17 and doing a computer course.

To help determine eligibility, I need to know: **Is Tom's computer course an approved education or training program? (For example, is it a full-time course at a school, college, or approved training provider?)**

2026-01-28T19:20:48.401661 [actor]: employer paying for course tom will work there after

2026-01-28T19:20:51.579996 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Tom is 17 and doing a computer course paid for by his employer, and he will work there afterwards.

Let me ask you: **Is Tom working full-time for this employer, or is he still in full-time education or approved training as his main activity?**

This is important because for 16-19 year olds, Child Benefit generally only continues if they're in full-time, non-advanced education or approved training, not if they're primarily working.

2026-01-28T19:20:53.122398 [actor]: not paid course only employer pays course fees

2026-01-28T19:20:56.002619 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. So Tom is 17, not being paid for work, and the employer is only paying his course fees.

To assess this properly, I need to understand: **Is this computer course full-time (at least 12 hours per week of supervised study), and is it provided by a school, college, or recognized training provider?**

This matters because for Child Benefit to continue for 16-19 year olds, they typically need to be in approved full-time education or training.

2026-01-28T19:20:57.461222 [actor]: coding course future employer pays tom joins them afterwards

2026-01-28T19:21:00.563771 [root_agent]: Thank you for the additional information. So Tom is doing a coding course, paid for by a future employer, and he'll join them after completing the course.

I need to clarify: **Is this a full-time course (at least 12 hours per week of supervised study) provided by a college, training provider, or educational institution? Or is it more of a work-based training arrangement or apprenticeship with the employer?**

The distinction is important because Child Benefit eligibility depends on whether Tom is in approved education/training versus being in employment or work-based arrangements.

2026-01-28T19:21:02.203450 [actor]: specific computer coding course employer agreement join them after

2026-01-28T19:21:04.917866 [root_agent]: I understand Tom is doing a specific computer coding course with an agreement to join the employer afterwards.

Let me ask this more directly: **How many hours per week is Tom attending this coding course, and is it being delivered by an educational institution (like a college or training provider) or is it being provided directly by the employer?**

This will help me determine if it qualifies as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-28T19:21:06.514235 [actor]: employer pays course fees tom not paid agreement to get job after

2026-01-28T19:21:10.384574 [root_agent]: I understand that the employer is paying the course fees, Tom isn't being paid, and there's an agreement for him to get a job afterwards.

However, I still need to know: **Is the coding course being taught at a college, university, or registered training provider (separate from the employer), or is the training being delivered by the employer themselves at their workplace?**

Also, **how many hours per week does the course involve?**

These details are crucial because for Child Benefit, approved education or training for 16-19 year olds must typically be full-time (12+ hours per week) and provided by an educational institution, not workplace training.

2026-01-28T19:21:11.916690 [actor]: tom 17 computer coding course employer agreed course

2026-01-28T19:21:15.367473 [root_agent]: I appreciate your patience. I understand Tom is 17, doing a computer coding course, and there's an agreement with an employer.

To properly assess eligibility, I really need to know these specific details:

**Where is Tom physically attending this course - is it at a college/training center, or at the employer's workplace?**

This is the key question because:
- If it's at an educational institution (college, training provider), it may qualify as approved education
- If it's workplace-based training with an employer, it typically wouldn't qualify for Child Benefit purposes

Could you clarify where Tom is taking this course?

2026-01-28T19:21:16.936114 [actor]: course with employers agreement to get job afterwards

2026-01-28T19:21:20.169583 [root_agent]: I understand there's an employer agreement, but I need to establish one crucial fact:

**Is Tom attending classes at a college, university, or training center (a separate educational institution), OR is he doing this course at the employer's offices/workplace?**

In other words - when Tom goes to do this coding course each day, where does he physically go?

This distinction is essential because Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds generally only continues if they're in education at a recognized educational institution, not if they're doing employer-based training.

2026-01-28T19:21:21.933922 [actor]: tom taking specific coding course future employer pays course fees

2026-01-28T19:21:24.504782 [root_agent]: I understand the employer is paying for the course, but I need you to answer this specific question:

**When Tom attends this coding course, does he go to a college, university, or training center building - OR does he go to the employer's business premises/office?**

Please tell me the physical location where Tom is taking the course. This is essential information I need to determine Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-28T19:21:26.572097 [actor]: employer agreement tom join them after course finishes

2026-01-28T19:21:30.159034 [root_agent]: I understand there's an agreement for Tom to join the employer after the course, but I've asked several times about where the course is taking place and haven't received a clear answer.

Let me try a different approach: **What is the name of the organization or institution that is delivering/teaching this coding course to Tom?**

For example, is it a college name, a training company name, or is it the employer's company name?

This will help me understand whether this is approved education/training for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-28T19:21:31.656798 [actor]: specific computer coding course employer pays fees not paid

2026-01-28T19:21:35.289326 [root_agent]: I understand you've told me the employer pays the fees and Tom isn't being paid. However, I've been trying to establish one critical piece of information that you haven't directly answered yet.

Let me be very clear: **Is this coding course run by a college, university, or independent training provider (like a coding bootcamp or training company), OR is the course run and delivered by the employer themselves?**

Without knowing WHO is actually running and teaching the course, I cannot determine if Tom qualifies for Child Benefit. This is essential information.

Can you please tell me who is providing/teaching the course?

2026-01-28T19:21:36.941523 [actor]: tom 17 doing course employer agreed get job after

2026-01-28T19:21:40.714430 [root_agent]: I appreciate you're trying to help, but I've now asked the same essential question multiple times in different ways without getting the specific information I need.

To determine Child Benefit eligibility for Tom, I **must** know where and by whom this course is being delivered. 

Let me ask you directly: **Do you not know these details about Tom's course, or are you unable to provide them for some reason?**

If you don't have this information, that's okay - but I would need you to find out:
1. The name of the organization teaching the course
2. Where Tom physically goes to attend the course
3. How many hours per week the course involves

Without these details, I cannot accurately assess whether Tom's situation means you remain eligible for Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T19:21:42.361261 [actor]: employer agreement course tom joins after not approved education

2026-01-28T19:21:47.034332 [root_agent]: Thank you - that's very helpful information! You've clarified that this is **not approved education**.

Based on what you've told me, if Tom is 17 and doing a course that is not approved education or training, then **you would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Tom**.

Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds only continues if they are in full-time approved education or approved training. Since you've confirmed this course is not approved education, Tom would not meet the eligibility criteria.

Before I give you a final assessment, let me ask: **Do you have any other children under 16 (or under 20 in approved education/training) that you're responsible for?**

This matters because you could still be eligible for Child Benefit for other children, even if Tom no longer qualifies.

2026-01-28T19:21:48.613050 [actor]: no just tom not eligible then

2026-01-28T19:21:52.037355 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided:

- Tom is 17 years old
- He is doing a course that is **not approved education**
- You have no other children

**You are not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.**

Child Benefit for young people aged 16-19 only continues if they are in approved full-time education or approved training. Since Tom's course is not approved education, he doesn't meet the criteria, and therefore you cannot claim Child Benefit for him.

If Tom's circumstances change in the future - for example, if he enrolls in approved full-time education at a college or sixth form - you may become eligible again at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:21:53.648839 [actor]: ok thanks understand not eligible

2026-01-28T19:21:57.304313 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent appropriately concluded that I am not eligible for Child Benefit since Tom (age 17) is doing a course that is not approved education, which is required for Child Benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds.
