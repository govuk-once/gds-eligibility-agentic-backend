**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the father is **NOT eligible** to claim Child Benefit for Rashid due to his marriage, stating: "you cannot usually get Child Benefit for a child or young person who is married or in a civil partnership, even if they are under 20 and still in full-time approved education or training."

However, the expected outcome is **Eligible (via Exception)**. 

According to the scenario details, while it's normally true that you cannot claim for a married child, an **exception** applies when:
- The child lives with the claimant
- The claimant is not financially supporting the child's spouse (or the spouse is also in full-time education/dependent)

The transcript clearly establishes:
1. Rashid (17) is married and lives with his parents
2. His wife (17) has moved into the parents' house
3. Rashid is in full-time education (A-Levels)
4. The parents support Rashid

The agent failed to identify or communicate this exception. While the agent correctly identified that marriage typically disqualifies eligibility, they did not explore whether the exception applied in this specific circumstance where both the married child and spouse live with the claimant and are in full-time education.

The agent's communicated outcome (Not Eligible) does **not** agree with the expected outcome (Eligible via Exception).
