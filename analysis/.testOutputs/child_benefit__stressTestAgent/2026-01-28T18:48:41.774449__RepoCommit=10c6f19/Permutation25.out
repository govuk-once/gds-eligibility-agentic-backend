2026-01-28T19:04:34.392061 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:04:36.004753 [actor]: child in care 10 weks husband pays carer

2026-01-28T19:04:38.138752 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify the situation, I need to ask:

**Is your child currently living in local authority care or with a foster carer arranged by the local authority?**

2026-01-28T19:04:39.812386 [actor]: yes local authority 10 weeks husband gives money

2026-01-28T19:04:42.810478 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand your child has been in local authority care for 10 weeks and your husband contributes money.

This is an important question: **Are you (or your husband) paying the local authority or foster carer at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate (or the equivalent of what the local authority pays the foster carer) toward the cost of looking after your child?**

2026-01-28T19:04:44.297442 [actor]: husband pays 30 pounds weekly to carer

2026-01-28T19:04:46.908999 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to understand this a bit better.

**Is the carer your husband is paying a foster carer arranged by the local authority, or is this a private arrangement where your child lives with someone else (not through the local authority)?**

2026-01-28T19:04:48.641088 [actor]: foster carer local authority aranged

2026-01-28T19:04:52.458926 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that it's a local authority arranged foster carer.

Now I need to understand the amount being paid: **Do you know what the current weekly Child Benefit rate is, or what the local authority pays the foster carer per week for looking after your child?**

This is important because to remain eligible for Child Benefit when your child is in local authority foster care, you generally need to be paying at least the Child Benefit rate (currently £25.60 per week for the eldest/only child, or £16.95 for additional children) towards the cost of their care.

2026-01-28T19:04:54.277516 [actor]: dont know rate husband pays 30 week

2026-01-28T19:04:56.755302 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask one more important question to complete the assessment:

**Is the child your only child, or do you have other children?**

This matters because the Child Benefit rate is different for the eldest/only child (£25.60 per week) compared to additional children (£16.95 per week).

2026-01-28T19:04:58.333101 [actor]: only child leo 5 years old

2026-01-28T19:05:03.264693 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you may still be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why: Your husband is paying £30 per week to the foster carer, and the current Child Benefit rate for an only child is £25.60 per week. Since he's paying at least the Child Benefit rate toward the cost of looking after Leo, you should be able to continue claiming Child Benefit.

**However, there's an important point to verify:** The payment needs to be contributing toward the cost of Leo's care. Since your husband is paying £30 per week (which is more than the £25.60 Child Benefit rate), this should meet the requirement.

**My question to you is: Have you already been claiming Child Benefit for Leo before he went into foster care, or would this be a new claim?**

2026-01-28T19:05:06.668398 [actor]: The agent has told me I'm eligible for child benefit, so I should exit the loop as instructed.

2026-01-28T19:05:09.216865 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rule that parents can continue claiming Child Benefit when their child is in local authority foster care if they pay at least the Child Benefit rate towards the cost of care, and correctly identified that the £30 weekly payment exceeds the £25.60 rate for an only child.
