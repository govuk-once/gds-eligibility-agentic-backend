**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), a person can be eligible for Child Benefit even if they don't live with the child, provided they are "responsible" for the child by contributing at least an amount equal to the Child Benefit rate toward the child's upkeep.

In this case:
- Mark contributes £150 per month (approximately £34.62 per week) to Lucas's upkeep
- The current Child Benefit rate is approximately £26.05 per week (£113 per month)
- Mark's contribution **exceeds** the Child Benefit amount
- Jenny (who lives with Lucas) does **not** claim Child Benefit
- Therefore, Mark meets the "contributing to upkeep" exception and **should be eligible**

The expected outcome is: **Eligible**

The agent's conclusion that Mark is "not eligible" contradicts the expected outcome. The agent incorrectly focused solely on the living arrangements and day-to-day care criterion, failing to recognize or apply the exception for non-resident parents who contribute financially above the Child Benefit threshold when no one else is claiming.
