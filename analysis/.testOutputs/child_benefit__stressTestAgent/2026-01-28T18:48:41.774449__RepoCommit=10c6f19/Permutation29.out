2026-01-28T19:07:19.663610 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:07:21.256284 [actor]: child benefit 17 year old not in colege

2026-01-28T19:07:23.398194 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I can see you have a 17-year-old who is not in college.

To help assess your eligibility, let me ask: **Are you responsible for this 17-year-old? That is, do they live with you and do you look after them?**

2026-01-28T19:07:24.968568 [actor]: yes lives with me son finished gcses

2026-01-28T19:07:28.033066 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. So your 17-year-old son lives with you and has finished his GCSEs.

This is important information. Let me ask: **Is your son currently in any approved education or training, such as A-levels, T-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs, or any other qualifying courses?**

(Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training.)

2026-01-28T19:07:29.560893 [actor]: no not in anything finished last year

2026-01-28T19:07:32.598074 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son is 17, finished his GCSEs last year, and is not currently in any education or training.

Let me ask one more important question: **Has your son registered with a careers service or Connexions service (or equivalent), and is he currently looking for work or a training place?**

(This is relevant because there may be circumstances where Child Benefit can continue for a limited time while a young person is registered and seeking work or training.)

2026-01-28T19:07:34.166801 [actor]: no hasn't registered anywhere not doing anything

2026-01-28T19:07:38.457877 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me assess your situation:

Based on what you've told me, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** for your 17-year-old son in his current circumstances.

Here's why:

- Child Benefit normally stops when a young person turns 16
- It can continue until they turn 20 **only if** they're in approved education or training
- Your son is 17, not in any education or training, and hasn't registered with a careers service

**However**, if your son decides to:
- Return to approved education or training (like college, an apprenticeship, or other qualifying courses), or
- Register with a careers service while looking for work or training

Then you may become eligible for Child Benefit again, as long as he's under 20.

Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T19:07:40.359277 [actor]: ok thanks

2026-01-28T19:07:44.240498 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available for a 17-year-old who has finished GCSEs, is not in approved education or training, and has not registered with a careers service, as the benefit stops at 16 unless the young person meets specific criteria for continuation until age 20.
