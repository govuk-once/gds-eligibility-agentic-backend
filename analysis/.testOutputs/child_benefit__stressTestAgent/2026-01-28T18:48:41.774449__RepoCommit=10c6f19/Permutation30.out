2026-01-28T19:07:57.347781 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your child is 14 years old, which meets the age requirement.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:07:58.660829 [actor]: live in uk yes

2026-01-28T19:08:00.804378 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming you live in the UK.

Next question: **Are you the person responsible for the child? This means are you the main person who looks after them and they normally live with you?**

2026-01-28T19:08:02.475397 [actor]: yes im the one who gets the payments in my bank acount

2026-01-28T19:08:05.365923 [root_agent]: I understand you're currently receiving payments, which is helpful to know.

Let me clarify: **Does your child normally live with you in your home, and are you the main person responsible for looking after them day-to-day?**

2026-01-28T19:08:06.751507 [actor]: yes child lives with me i look after them

2026-01-28T19:08:10.075591 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have a 14-year-old child
- You live in the UK
- Your child lives with you
- You are the main person responsible for looking after them

**You are eligible for Child Benefit.**

It sounds like you may already be receiving Child Benefit payments since you mentioned payments going into your bank account. Is there anything specific about Child Benefit that you need help with, or do you have any questions about your current claim?

2026-01-28T19:08:11.662281 [actor]: wiat what about my wifes income she earns more than me

2026-01-28T19:08:14.817608 [root_agent]: Ah, that's an important point to clarify. Thank you for mentioning that.

You can still **claim** Child Benefit regardless of yours or your wife's income. However, there's something called the High Income Child Benefit Charge that may apply.

Let me ask: **Does either you or your wife have an individual income of £60,000 or more per year?**

(Note: This is about individual income, not your combined household income)

2026-01-28T19:08:16.525831 [actor]: i earn 18000 she earns 65000

2026-01-28T19:08:23.600751 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Here's what this means for you:

**You are still eligible to claim Child Benefit.** However, because your wife earns £65,000 (which is over £60,000), the High Income Child Benefit Charge will apply.

This means:
- You can claim and receive Child Benefit payments (currently £25.60 per week for your first/only child)
- However, your wife will need to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the tax system via a Self Assessment tax return
- Since her income is over £60,000, she'll pay back 1% of the Child Benefit for every £200 earned over £50,000
- At £65,000, this means paying back 75% of the Child Benefit received

You have two options:
1. Claim Child Benefit and receive the payments, with your wife paying the charge back through her tax return
2. Claim Child Benefit but opt not to receive the payments (this still protects your National Insurance credits)

**Does your wife currently complete a Self Assessment tax return?**

2026-01-28T19:08:25.293222 [actor]: so i am eligable then? thats what i needed to know

2026-01-28T19:08:28.572201 [root_agent]: **Yes, you are eligible for Child Benefit.**

Based on everything you've told me:
- You have a 14-year-old child who lives with you
- You live in the UK
- You are the main person responsible for your child

You meet all the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

The income question affects whether you have to pay some back through tax, but it doesn't affect your eligibility to claim it.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:08:34.904327 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately established that the user meets all Child Benefit eligibility criteria (has a 14-year-old child, lives in UK, child lives with them, they are responsible for the child) and correctly explained that high income affects the High Income Child Benefit Charge but does not affect eligibility to claim.
