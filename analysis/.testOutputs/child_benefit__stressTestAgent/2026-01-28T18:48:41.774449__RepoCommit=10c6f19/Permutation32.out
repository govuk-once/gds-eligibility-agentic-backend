2026-01-28T19:08:55.858084 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:08:57.479291 [actor]: child at collge gcse resits 6 hrs week

2026-01-28T19:08:59.405438 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child at college doing GCSE resits for 6 hours per week.

To clarify further: **How old is your child?**

2026-01-28T19:09:02.319704 [actor]: 17 years old

2026-01-28T19:09:05.616494 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your child is 17 years old and doing GCSE resits for 6 hours per week at college.

For a child aged 16-19 to qualify for Child Benefit, they need to be in approved education or training. The education must be full-time and non-advanced (like A-levels, Scottish Highers, or NVQ level 3 or below).

Let me ask: **Is your child enrolled in full-time education at the college, or are the 6 hours per week the only education they're doing?**

2026-01-28T19:09:07.202664 [actor]: only 6 hours rest of time at home gaming

2026-01-28T19:09:12.328350 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. 

Based on what you've told me, your child is 17 years old and only attending college for 6 hours per week to do GCSE resits, spending the rest of their time at home.

Unfortunately, **this would not meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit**. For children aged 16-19, they must be in **full-time approved education or training** to qualify. Six hours per week would not be considered full-time education.

Child Benefit for children aged 16-19 typically requires them to be studying for at least 12 hours per week in supervised study (this can include course-related work experience), though the exact definition of "full-time" can vary by institution.

**Is there anything else about your situation you'd like me to help clarify, or do you have any questions about this assessment?**

2026-01-28T19:09:17.857311 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that 6 hours per week of GCSE resits does not constitute full-time education for a 17-year-old, which is required for Child Benefit eligibility for children aged 16-19.
