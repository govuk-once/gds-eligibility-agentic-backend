**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user would be eligible for Child Benefit for the first 12 weeks only, stating: "You can continue to claim Child Benefit while your child is in hospital abroad for up to **12 weeks**. Since you mentioned his treatment will be 15 weeks, you would only be eligible for Child Benefit for the first 12 weeks of his hospital stay abroad."

However, according to the expected outcome and the specific rule provided in the scenario:

**The expected outcome is: Eligible** (without the 12-week limitation)

The critical rule states: "if a child is in hospital **abroad**, and they only went abroad to be in hospital, eligibility continues (provided the parent is still spending money on them)."

The user confirmed:
- The child went abroad specifically for hospital treatment (to the USA for specialist treatment)
- The parent is still paying for costs and visiting
- The parent remains a UK resident

Therefore, under the international exception rule, Hannah should remain eligible for Child Benefit for the entire duration of Oliver's treatment abroad, not just the first 12 weeks. The agent communicated an outcome of partial/limited eligibility (only 12 weeks), which does not agree with the expected outcome of full eligibility.
