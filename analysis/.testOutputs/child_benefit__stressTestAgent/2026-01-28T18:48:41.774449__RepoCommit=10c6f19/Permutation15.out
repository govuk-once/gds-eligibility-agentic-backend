2026-01-28T18:57:23.583743 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T18:57:25.900511 [actor]: child benefit eligabilty daughter not living with me send money for food

2026-01-28T18:57:27.862164 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you a specific question to understand your situation better:

**Does your daughter currently live with you, or does she live with someone else?**

2026-01-28T18:57:29.417552 [actor]: lives with her mum send £10 week for food

2026-01-28T18:57:31.960085 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me ask you this:

**Do you contribute at least the same amount as (or more than) the person your daughter lives with toward the cost of supporting her?**

In other words, does the £10 per week you send match or exceed what her mum spends on supporting her?

2026-01-28T18:57:33.517675 [actor]: send tenner every week for food birthday present once year

2026-01-28T18:57:36.306389 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me ask you:

**How much does your daughter's mum contribute weekly toward supporting your daughter (including accommodation, food, clothing, and other costs)?**

This is important because to be eligible for Child Benefit when your child lives with someone else, you generally need to be contributing at least as much as the person they live with.

2026-01-28T18:57:37.788377 [actor]: dunno just send the £10 week for food costs

2026-01-28T18:57:42.692592 [root_agent]: I understand. Let me explain the situation based on what you've told me:

**Based on the current Child Benefit rules, you would likely not be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.**

Here's why: When a child doesn't live with you, to claim Child Benefit you must be contributing **at least as much** toward the child's costs as the person the child lives with. 

Since your daughter lives with her mum, her mum is covering accommodation, utilities, day-to-day food, clothing, and other living expenses. Your £10 per week contribution (approximately £40 per month) plus an annual birthday present would typically be much less than what her mum is spending to house and care for your daughter.

**In situations where a child lives with one parent, that parent - in this case, your daughter's mum - would normally be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.**

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T18:57:44.652030 [actor]: ok thanks for info

2026-01-28T18:57:48.431090 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that I would not be eligible for Child Benefit because my £10 weekly contribution for food costs would be significantly less than what the mother (who the child lives with) contributes toward housing, utilities, food, clothing, and other living expenses, and eligibility requires contributing at least as much as the person the child lives with.
