2026-01-28T19:18:11.483018 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:18:13.080083 [actor]: daughter 8 years old hospitel 14 weeks

2026-01-28T19:18:15.462849 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have an 8-year-old daughter who has been in hospital for 14 weeks.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you responsible for your daughter? That is, do you live with her (when she's not in hospital) and are you responsible for her care and upbringing?**

2026-01-28T19:18:16.851051 [actor]: yes i visit every day spend hours with her

2026-01-28T19:18:18.785806 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. It's clear you're very involved in your daughter's care.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Do you normally live in the UK (England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland)?**

2026-01-28T19:18:20.261703 [actor]: uk yes live here

2026-01-28T19:18:22.475308 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Now, let me ask you:

**Is your daughter expected to be in hospital for more than 12 weeks in total, or has she already been there for more than 12 weeks?**

2026-01-28T19:18:23.861519 [actor]: 14 weeks already been there

2026-01-28T19:18:26.677042 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Since your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks, I need to ask an important question:

**During the time your daughter has been in hospital, have you been contributing at least the specified weekly amount towards the cost of her care? (The current rate is at least £57.90 per week, though this may vary - you would need to check the current amount.)**

2026-01-28T19:18:28.146896 [actor]: no hospital provides everything

2026-01-28T19:18:30.199414 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you another question to understand your situation better:

**Does your daughter receive free in-patient hospital treatment from the NHS, meaning the NHS is paying for all her hospital care?**

2026-01-28T19:18:31.576154 [actor]: yes nhs free treatment

2026-01-28T19:18:35.966683 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to explain an important point about Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in hospital:

**You may not be eligible to receive Child Benefit while your daughter is in hospital** because:

- She has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks (she's been there for 14 weeks)
- She's receiving free in-patient treatment from the NHS
- You're not contributing at least the required weekly amount towards her care costs

Under UK rules, Child Benefit usually stops after a child has been in hospital for 12 weeks if they're receiving free NHS treatment and you're not making the required financial contribution.

However, let me ask: **Were you receiving Child Benefit before your daughter went into hospital?** If so, you should have been notified about this by the Child Benefit Office.

2026-01-28T19:18:37.702212 [actor]: was receiving before yes they didnt tell me anything

2026-01-28T19:18:42.616591 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is an important situation that needs to be addressed.

Since you were receiving Child Benefit before your daughter went into hospital, and she has now been in hospital for more than 12 weeks receiving free NHS treatment, **your Child Benefit payments should have stopped after the 12-week period**.

You should have been contacted by the Child Benefit Office about this, but it appears you weren't informed.

**Here's what you need to do:**

1. You need to contact the Child Benefit Office immediately to inform them that your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks
2. They will likely stop your payments and may ask you to repay any Child Benefit you received after the 12-week period

**However, let me ask one more important question:**

**Is your daughter expected to come home from hospital soon, or do you know how much longer she will be staying?**

This is important because your Child Benefit can restart once she comes home and is living with you again.

2026-01-28T19:18:44.114793 [actor]: wait so not eligible now?

2026-01-28T19:18:49.589327 [root_agent]: That's correct - based on what you've told me, **you are not currently eligible for Child Benefit** while your daughter remains in hospital.

Here's why:

- Your daughter has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks (14 weeks)
- She's receiving free NHS in-patient treatment
- You're not contributing the required weekly amount (at least £57.90 per week) towards her care costs

**Under UK Child Benefit rules, payments stop after a child has been in hospital for 12 weeks in these circumstances.**

**Important:** 
- Your Child Benefit should have stopped after week 12 of her hospital stay
- If you've continued receiving payments beyond that, you may need to repay the amount received after the 12-week period
- **Your Child Benefit will restart** when your daughter comes home from hospital and lives with you again

You need to contact the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible to report this situation.

**Do you have any other questions about this, or is there anything else about your situation I should know?**

2026-01-28T19:18:54.901620 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rule that Child Benefit stops after a child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks when receiving free NHS treatment and the parent is not contributing the required weekly amount towards care costs.
