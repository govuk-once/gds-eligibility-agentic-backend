**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Responsibility (Criteria 1):** ✓ The agent confirmed the user is responsible for the child, who lives with them and is cared for daily.

2. **Child's Age (Criteria 2):** ✓ The agent confirmed the child (Hans, 5 years old) is under 16 and therefore of eligible age.

3. **Residency and Right to Reside (Criteria 3):** ✓ The agent correctly identified that the user has Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme and is living in the UK. Crucially, the scenario specifies that Lars is "actively looking for work and has registered as a jobseeker," which satisfies the right to reside test for Pre-Settled Status holders. The agent appropriately concluded that this status gives the user the right to reside for Child Benefit purposes.

4. **Additional checks:** The agent verified no one else is claiming Child Benefit for the child and that the child is not in hospital or care for extended periods.

The agent's conclusion that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" and "should be able to apply" correctly communicates an eligible outcome, matching the expected result. The agent provided clear reasoning and covered all relevant eligibility criteria.
