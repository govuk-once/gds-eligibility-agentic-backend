**Justification:**

The agent failed to communicate the correct eligibility outcome. Based on the scenario details and the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit, the user **is eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks** under the "Extension" period provisions.

**Why the agent was wrong:**

1. **The 20-week extension rule exists**: When a 16 or 17-year-old leaves approved education and registers with certain careers services (Connexions/youth careers services), Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks. This is explicitly mentioned in gov.uk guidance.

2. **The user's son meets the criteria**:
   - He is 17 (within the 16-17 age range)
   - He left school in June
   - He registered with the youth careers service in August (within 20 weeks of leaving)
   - He is actively looking for work/apprenticeship

3. **The agent's response**: Despite the user repeatedly mentioning the 20-week extension from gov.uk, the agent:
   - Initially said the user was "not eligible"
   - Later admitted they "cannot definitively confirm whether you are eligible or not"
   - Referred the user to call the Child Benefit Office rather than confirming eligibility

**Expected outcome vs. Agent's outcome:**
- **Expected**: Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)
- **Agent communicated**: Unable to confirm eligibility / Not eligible

The agent did not communicate that the user was eligible, which is the correct outcome.
