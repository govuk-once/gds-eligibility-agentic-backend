**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Key reasoning:**

1. **The agent properly identified the 12-week hospital rule**: The child has been in hospital for 14 weeks, exceeding the 12-week threshold.

2. **The agent correctly applied the expenditure exception criteria**: The agent asked whether the parent was "contributing at least the specified weekly amount towards the cost of her care" (£57.90 per week). The user confirmed "no hospital provides everything," meaning no financial contribution was being made.

3. **The agent accurately concluded ineligibility**: Based on the combination of:
   - Hospital stay >12 weeks
   - Free NHS treatment
   - No financial contribution towards the child's upkeep
   
   The agent correctly stated: "you are not currently eligible for Child Benefit"

4. **The agent's explanation matches the regulations**: According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks in hospital unless the parent is contributing at least a specified amount weekly towards the child's upkeep. The user's situation (visiting but not spending money) does not satisfy the expenditure exception.

The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome clearly and with proper justification, despite the evaluation judge's checkmark (✓) which appears to agree with this assessment as well.
