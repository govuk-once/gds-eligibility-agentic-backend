**Justification:**

The agent communicated that Karen is **eligible** for Child Benefit, but the expected outcome is that she is **not eligible**.

According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 20 if they are in approved education or training. However, the critical distinction here is that **apprenticeships in England count as paid employment, not approved education or training** for Child Benefit purposes.

The agent made a fundamental error by treating the government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship as "approved education or training." While apprenticeships are valuable training programs, they involve paid work and therefore disqualify the child from Child Benefit eligibility once they turn 16 and leave full-time education.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, noting that "apprentices who are paid a wage (which is the case for intermediate apprenticeships) do not qualify for Child Benefit as apprenticeships count as paid employment, not approved education or training."

Since the agent's communicated outcome (eligible) directly contradicts the expected outcome (not eligible), this represents a failure to provide accurate guidance.
