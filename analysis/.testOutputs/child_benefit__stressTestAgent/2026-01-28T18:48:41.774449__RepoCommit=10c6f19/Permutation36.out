2026-01-28T19:11:47.523240 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start assessing your eligibility, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T19:11:49.147180 [actor]: daughtr finished gcses not in school now

2026-01-28T19:11:51.167932 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your daughter has finished her GCSEs and is not currently in school.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**How old is your daughter now?**

2026-01-28T19:11:52.808924 [actor]: 16 years old august

2026-01-28T19:11:55.410521 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your daughter is 16 years old (turned 16 in August) and has finished her GCSEs and is not currently in school.

Let me ask the next important question:

**Is your daughter enrolled in any approved education or training courses, such as A-levels, T-levels, NVQs, or any other approved further education or vocational training?**

2026-01-28T19:11:56.900628 [actor]: accepted to colege starts september

2026-01-28T19:11:59.481689 [root_agent]: That's helpful information - your daughter has been accepted to college and will start in September.

Let me ask you this:

**Is the college course she'll be starting an approved education or training program, such as A-levels, BTECs, T-levels, NVQs, or similar qualifications?**

2026-01-28T19:12:00.986918 [actor]: a levels september

2026-01-28T19:12:03.666284 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for clarifying. Your daughter will be starting A-levels in September.

Now I need to ask about your relationship to the child:

**Are you responsible for your daughter? This means do you live with her and are responsible for her care (such as providing for her day-to-day needs, making decisions about her welfare, etc.)?**

2026-01-28T19:12:05.281567 [actor]: yes live together im her mum

2026-01-28T19:12:08.219278 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. You live with your daughter and you're her mum, so you are responsible for her.

Now I need to ask about your residency status:

**Do you normally live in the UK, and are you either a UK citizen, have settled status, pre-settled status, or have the right to reside in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:12:09.760636 [actor]: uk live here

2026-01-28T19:12:11.655441 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you live in the UK.

Let me ask one more question to complete the eligibility assessment:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your daughter?**

2026-01-28T19:12:13.162506 [actor]: no just me worry she not in school right now

2026-01-28T19:12:18.431657 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me reassure you about your situation.

**Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why you don't need to worry about your daughter not being in school right now:

✓ Your daughter is 16 years old and has been accepted to college to study A-levels starting in September
✓ You live together and you're responsible for her
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

**The key point:** Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training. Since your daughter has been accepted and will be starting A-levels in September, this counts as approved education. There is typically allowance for gaps between finishing one course (like GCSEs) and starting another (like A-levels).

You should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit through this summer period and once she starts college in September, as long as she remains enrolled in the approved education.

**Do you have any other questions about your Child Benefit eligibility?**

2026-01-28T19:12:20.581425 [actor]: ok so i get it then thank you

2026-01-28T19:12:24.492486 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit because their 16-year-old daughter will be starting A-levels in September, which is approved education, and Child Benefit continues during gaps between courses for young people aged 16-19 in approved education or training.
