2026-01-28T19:21:59.333135 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:22:01.069980 [actor]: child left school doing no one left behind in edinbrugh age 16

2026-01-28T19:22:04.475489 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 16-year-old child who has left school and is doing "No One Left Behind" in Edinburgh.

Let me ask a follow-up question to understand their situation better:

**Is the "No One Left Behind" program your child is doing an approved education or training course?** 

(This would typically include things like college courses, A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs, or other accredited training programs)

2026-01-28T19:22:06.036523 [actor]: no one left behind programme scotland 16 year old benefts

2026-01-28T19:22:09.483220 [root_agent]: I understand your child is on the "No One Left Behind" programme in Scotland. Let me ask you a more specific question to help determine eligibility:

**Is your 16-year-old enrolled in any form of approved education or training as part of this programme?** 

This could include:
- Full-time non-advanced education (such as studying for A-levels, Scottish Highers, or equivalent)
- Approved training courses
- College courses

Or is the programme primarily focused on job search support without formal education or training?

2026-01-28T19:22:11.057191 [actor]: trainee programme edinburgh left school

2026-01-28T19:22:13.761084 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your 16-year-old has left school and is on a trainee programme in Edinburgh as part of the "No One Left Behind" scheme.

To help assess eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is this trainee programme an approved training course, and is your child studying or training for at least 12 hours a week on average?**

(Approved training typically includes courses leading to qualifications like NVQs, SVQs, or other accredited vocational qualifications)

2026-01-28T19:22:15.366448 [actor]: how many hours needed child benefit scotland trainee

2026-01-28T19:22:18.346463 [root_agent]: Let me clarify the requirement for you:

**For a young person aged 16-19 to qualify for Child Benefit while in approved education or training, they must be studying or training for at least 12 hours a week on average** (this doesn't include meal breaks or unsupervised study time).

Now, to continue assessing your eligibility, can you tell me:

**Does your child's trainee programme involve at least 12 hours per week of supervised study or training?**

2026-01-28T19:22:20.036340 [actor]: yes trainee 12 hours week no one left behind edenburgh

2026-01-28T19:22:22.376935 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. So your child is doing at least 12 hours per week of training through the "No One Left Behind" programme in Edinburgh.

Now let me ask you the next question:

**Do you live in the UK, or are you a Crown servant (such as a diplomat or member of the armed forces) posted overseas?**

2026-01-28T19:22:24.193341 [actor]: live in uk scotland edinburgh

2026-01-28T19:22:26.808166 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. You live in the UK (Scotland, Edinburgh).

Now let me ask:

**Are you the person responsible for the child?** 

By this I mean:
- Do you live with the child, AND
- Are you responsible for paying for things like their food, clothing, and housing?

2026-01-28T19:22:28.831065 [actor]: yes responsible live with child pay for everything

2026-01-28T19:22:30.882975 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you live with your child and are responsible for paying for their food, clothing, and housing.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Does anyone else also claim Child Benefit for this same child?**

2026-01-28T19:22:32.437269 [actor]: no one else claims just me

2026-01-28T19:22:34.767219 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now I need to ask:

**Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do either of you have a "no recourse to public funds" condition on your visa or immigration status?**

2026-01-28T19:22:36.500807 [actor]: no born here uk citizen

2026-01-28T19:22:39.067079 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming you're a UK citizen with no immigration restrictions.

Let me ask one more question to complete the assessment:

**Does your child normally live with you in your household?**

(Or if they're temporarily away - for example, at boarding school or in hospital - do they usually live with you when not in those circumstances?)

2026-01-28T19:22:40.367641 [actor]: yes lives with me all the time

2026-01-28T19:22:44.823480 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:
- ✓ You have a 16-year-old child who is in approved training (the "No One Left Behind" trainee programme)
- ✓ The training is at least 12 hours per week
- ✓ You live in the UK (Scotland, Edinburgh)
- ✓ You are responsible for the child and pay for their needs
- ✓ The child lives with you
- ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child
- ✓ You're a UK citizen with no immigration restrictions

**Important note:** Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training. However, you should be aware that if your child's circumstances change (for example, if they leave the training programme, reduce their hours below 12 per week, or turn 20), you must inform the Child Benefit Office as this could affect your entitlement.

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:22:50.862534 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately established that the child is 16, participating in approved training through the "No One Left Behind" programme for at least 12 hours per week, and all other eligibility criteria were properly verified (UK residency, responsibility for the child, no other claimants, no immigration restrictions, and the child living with the claimant).
