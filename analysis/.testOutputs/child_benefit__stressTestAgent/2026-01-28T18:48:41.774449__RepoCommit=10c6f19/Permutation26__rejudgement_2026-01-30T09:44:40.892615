**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user (Mo) is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome is that Mo should be **eligible**.

According to the gov.uk guidance on child benefit when a child lives with someone else (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else), you can claim Child Benefit if:
- The child lives with someone else
- You contribute at least as much as Child Benefit would pay toward the child's upkeep
- The person the child lives with doesn't claim Child Benefit

In this case:
1. Zahid lives with his aunt (not with Mo)
2. The aunt is not claiming Child Benefit
3. Mo contributes £15/week and his mother (Zahid's grandmother) contributes £15/week = £30/week total
4. This £30/week exceeds the Child Benefit rate of £25.60/week for an eldest/only child
5. The guidance explicitly states that contributions from multiple people can be combined

The agent failed to recognize that combined contributions from Mo and the grandmother meet the threshold, and incorrectly concluded that Mo is ineligible. The agent focused too heavily on individual contribution amounts and the aunt's caretaking role, rather than properly applying the rule about aggregated contributions meeting the Child Benefit threshold when the person the child lives with doesn't claim.

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent does **not** agree with the expected outcome of "Eligible."
