**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Accurate identification of the situation**: The agent properly identified that Liam is in a formal local authority fostering arrangement where the council pays for his upkeep.

2. **Correct application of eligibility rules**: The agent accurately stated that "when a child is in local authority care under a formal fostering arrangement where the council pays for the child's upkeep, the foster carer cannot claim Child Benefit."

3. **Proper reasoning**: The agent explained that "the local authority is considered responsible for the child in these circumstances," which is the correct rationale for ineligibility.

4. **Alignment with criteria**: This matches the scenario's Criteria 4, which states: "You cannot claim Child Benefit for a fostered child if the council is paying for their accommodation or maintenance."

5. **Helpful additional information**: The agent also appropriately mentioned circumstances under which eligibility could change (adoption, special guardianship, kinship care without formal local authority responsibility).

The agent's determination matches both the expected outcome (Not Eligible) and the evaluation judge's assessment (✓), demonstrating correct understanding and communication of Child Benefit eligibility rules for fostered children.
