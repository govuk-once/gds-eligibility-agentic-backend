2026-01-29T18:19:32.539468 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent appropriately gathered all relevant information through systematic questioning:
- Confirmed the child is 17 years old (over 16)
- Established the child finished GCSEs and is not in college
- Verified the child is not in any approved education or training
- Confirmed the child has not registered with careers services

The agent then correctly applied the eligibility criteria, explaining that:
1. Child Benefit normally stops at age 16
2. It can continue until age 20 **only if** the young person is in approved education or training
3. Since Jordan (the son) meets neither criterion, the parent is not eligible

This assessment aligns with the gov.uk guidance that Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds requires them to be in approved education or training. Jordan is a "NEET" case - not meeting the extension criteria as he hasn't registered with careers services or engaged in any qualifying activities.

The agent also helpfully explained future scenarios where eligibility could be regained, demonstrating thorough understanding of the rules. The communication was clear, accurate, and matches the expected "Not Eligible" outcome.
