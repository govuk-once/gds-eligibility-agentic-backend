**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Maria is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Relationship criterion met**: The agent correctly recognized that you don't need to be the parent to claim Child Benefit. The agent stated: "Under UK rules, you can claim Child Benefit for a child you're responsible for, even if they're not your own child."

2. **Responsibility criterion met**: The agent confirmed that Maria is responsible for Lucia because she:
   - Pays for everything
   - Makes decisions about her care
   - Lucia lives with her

3. **Parental situation properly assessed**: The agent verified that:
   - The parents are unable to care for the child
   - The parents don't claim Child Benefit
   - The parents don't contribute financially

4. **Other eligibility criteria confirmed**:
   - Child is 14 (under 16) ✓
   - Applicant lives in UK ✓
   - Child lives with applicant ✓

According to [gov.uk guidance](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), you can claim Child Benefit if you're responsible for a child under 16 who lives with you, even in informal arrangements like this one where a grandparent cares for a grandchild whose parents cannot.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome: **Eligible**.
