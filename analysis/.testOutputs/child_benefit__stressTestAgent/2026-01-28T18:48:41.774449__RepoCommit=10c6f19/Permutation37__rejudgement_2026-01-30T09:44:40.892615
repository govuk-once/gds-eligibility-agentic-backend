**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Carol (the mother's best friend in a private fostering arrangement) is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors the agent correctly identified:**

1. **Child's age:** The 10-year-old child meets the age requirement (under 16)

2. **Responsibility:** Carol is responsible for the child - she pays for everything (food, clothes, school supplies) and the child lives with her

3. **No existing claim:** No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for this child

4. **UK residency and citizenship:** Carol is a British citizen living in the UK with the right to claim benefits

5. **Living arrangements:** The child lives with Carol, not with the mother (who lives at a different address)

6. **Private fostering:** Most importantly, the agent correctly recognized that this is a **private arrangement** (not council fostering) and that Carol can claim Child Benefit even though she's not the parent, because she is the person responsible for the child's care and expenses

The agent's assessment matches the expected outcome that private fosterers who are financially supporting a child can claim Child Benefit, unlike council foster carers who receive fostering allowances. The eligibility determination was accurate and well-reasoned.
