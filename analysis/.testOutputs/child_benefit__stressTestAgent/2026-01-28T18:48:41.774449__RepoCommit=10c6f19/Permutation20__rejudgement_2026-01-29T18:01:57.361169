**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Maria is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct assessment of responsibility**: The agent properly identified that Maria is responsible for Lucia because she pays for everything and makes decisions about her care.

2. **Correct understanding of relationship requirements**: The agent correctly applied the rule that you don't need to be the parent to claim Child Benefit. According to gov.uk guidance, you can claim Child Benefit if you're responsible for a child, even if it's a friend or relative's child, as long as it's an informal arrangement and the local council isn't paying for accommodation.

3. **Proper verification of key criteria**:
   - Child under 16 (Lucia is 14) ✓
   - Lives in the UK ✓
   - Responsible for the child ✓
   - Parents unable to care and not claiming ✓

4. **Accurate conclusion**: The agent concluded Maria is eligible, which aligns with the expected outcome that informal guardians who are responsible for a child can claim Child Benefit.

The agent's eligibility determination matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**, and the reasoning provided was sound and consistent with Child Benefit rules for informal care arrangements.
