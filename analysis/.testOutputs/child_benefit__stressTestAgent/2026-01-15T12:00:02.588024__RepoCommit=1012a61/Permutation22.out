2026-01-15T12:06:14.986216 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:06:15.600822 [root_agent]: Okay, I can help you with that. To start, could you please confirm how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:06:16.426323 [actor]: 32 last birthday single mother

2026-01-15T12:06:16.978425 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how many children do you have?





2026-01-15T12:06:17.826289 [actor]: one child Arthur he is 7

2026-01-15T12:06:18.199220 [root_agent]: Thank you. Is Arthur currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:06:19.725800 [actor]: arthur hospital now sick 3 weeks already was home only 15 days after 10 weeks hospital before

2026-01-15T12:06:20.932534 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Just to be sure I understand correctly, Arthur was in hospital for 10 weeks, then home for 15 days, and is now back in hospital for 3 weeks – is that right?

2026-01-15T12:06:22.028999 [actor]: yes hospital long time then home briefly now back hospital again

2026-01-15T12:06:23.214351 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. While Arthur is in hospital, are you responsible for meeting the costs of his day-to-day care while he’s there? For example, are you paying for things like his toiletries or clothing while he’s a hospital patient?

2026-01-15T12:06:24.248341 [actor]: hospital provides everything only bring toys sometimes

2026-01-15T12:06:27.237881 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So, the hospital provides all of Arthur's day-to-day care needs.

Considering Arthur has been in hospital for a total of 13 weeks (10 weeks + 3 weeks), and his return to hospital was less than 28 days after his previous discharge, unfortunately, you are likely no longer eligible for Child Benefit while he remains in hospital. 

This is because the rules state that time in hospital counts towards the 12-week limit, and stays within 28 days of each other are linked together. As the hospital is providing his care, there isn't an exception for ongoing costs.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





2026-01-15T12:06:28.551488 [actor]: not eligible understand thank you

2026-01-15T12:06:31.105220 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly applied the "Linking Rule" since Arthur returned to hospital within 28 days, and the combined stay exceeds 12 weeks (13 weeks total), making Jenny ineligible for Child Benefit.
