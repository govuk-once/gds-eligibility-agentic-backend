2026-01-15T12:07:31.200622 [root_agent]: Hello! I can help you with that. To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:07:32.053409 [actor]: 40

2026-01-15T12:07:32.785096 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you related to the child you are applying for Child Benefit for? If so, how?

2026-01-15T12:07:33.743922 [actor]: my son zahid

2026-01-15T12:07:34.449421 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know Zahid is your son. How old is Zahid?

2026-01-15T12:07:35.173307 [actor]: 15 years old

2026-01-15T12:07:35.701123 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Does Zahid live with you?

2026-01-15T12:07:36.471636 [actor]: lives with aunt

2026-01-15T12:07:37.151512 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. And does anyone else contribute financially to the cost of looking after Zahid, besides yourself?

2026-01-15T12:07:37.908082 [actor]: my mother sends money

2026-01-15T12:07:38.512746 [root_agent]: Thank you. Roughly how much do you contribute towards Zahid’s care each week?

2026-01-15T12:07:39.241110 [actor]: £15

2026-01-15T12:07:39.914718 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And approximately how much does your mother contribute each week towards Zahid’s care?

2026-01-15T12:07:40.696586 [actor]: also 15 pounds

2026-01-15T12:07:41.335525 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, your mother is Zahid’s grandmother?

2026-01-15T12:07:42.115573 [actor]: yes grandmother

2026-01-15T12:07:43.016198 [root_agent]: Thanks for confirming. Finally, is the aunt who Zahid lives with claiming Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-15T12:07:43.795857 [actor]: no not claiming

2026-01-15T12:07:47.437466 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for answering all of my questions. 

Based on the information you’ve provided: you are 40 years old, Zahid is your 15-year-old son, he lives with his aunt who isn’t claiming Child Benefit, you contribute £15 per week, and your mother (Zahid's grandmother) contributes another £15 per week. This means the total weekly contribution is £30.

According to the guidance, contributions from multiple people *can* be combined. As the total contributions (£30) exceed the amount of Child Benefit (£26.05), you *are* likely eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid, even though he doesn’t live with you.

Would you like me to summarise this again, or do you have any other questions?





2026-01-15T12:07:48.544978 [actor]: thank you

2026-01-15T12:07:51.065313 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. They correctly noted that contributions from multiple people (£15 from the parent and £15 from the grandmother) can be combined to meet the threshold, exceeding the required £26.05 for Child Benefit.
