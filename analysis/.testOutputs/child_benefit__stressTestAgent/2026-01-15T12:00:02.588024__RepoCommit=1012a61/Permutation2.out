2026-01-15T12:00:22.540640 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:00:23.491771 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm here to help you find out if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:00:24.384804 [actor]: 45 years old

2026-01-15T12:00:24.932072 [root_agent]: Thank you. And do you have a child who lives with you?

2026-01-15T12:00:25.820475 [actor]: daughter priya lives with me

2026-01-15T12:00:26.454157 [root_agent]: That's good to know. How old is your daughter, Priya?

2026-01-15T12:00:27.184782 [actor]: 17

2026-01-15T12:00:27.724609 [root_agent]: Thank you. Is Priya currently in full-time education?

2026-01-15T12:00:28.586871 [actor]: sixth form college a levels

2026-01-15T12:00:29.134646 [root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. And approximately how much do you earn per year?

2026-01-15T12:00:30.050539 [actor]: salary 40k

2026-01-15T12:00:30.925195 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, is Priya’s mother also involved in her upbringing and contributing financially? Or do you have sole responsibility for Priya?





2026-01-15T12:00:31.739723 [actor]: single dad

2026-01-15T12:00:33.712593 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you’ve provided so far – you are 45, your daughter Priya is 17 and in full-time education, you earn £40,000 a year, and you are a single parent with sole responsibility for her – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that you are a UK resident?

2026-01-15T12:00:34.514898 [actor]: london resident

2026-01-15T12:00:35.325655 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. And just one final question – is Priya currently a patient in hospital, or is she in care (for example, residential care)?

2026-01-15T12:00:36.180301 [actor]: no hospital no care

2026-01-15T12:00:38.748828 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for answering all of my questions.

Based on everything you've told me, you *are* eligible for Child Benefit. You are responsible for your 17-year-old daughter who lives with you and is in full-time education. Your income is below the threshold for a High Income Child Benefit Charge, and you are a UK resident with sole responsibility for your daughter, and she is not in hospital or care.



You can find more detailed information about Child Benefit on the UK government website. Would you like me to provide a summary of the key points relating to your situation?

2026-01-15T12:00:42.790555 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Amit is eligible for Child Benefit because Priya is under 20, in approved education, lives with him, and his income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
