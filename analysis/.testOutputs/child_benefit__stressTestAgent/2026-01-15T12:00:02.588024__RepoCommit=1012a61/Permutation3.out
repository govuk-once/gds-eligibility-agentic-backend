2026-01-15T12:00:43.565968 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:00:44.497656 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm here to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:00:45.261866 [actor]: 50 years old

2026-01-15T12:00:45.771770 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is the child you are claiming for?

2026-01-15T12:00:46.571531 [actor]: son ben 17 years old

2026-01-15T12:00:47.497609 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Has your son completed 16 years of education and is he currently still in approved full-time education, such as college or university?

2026-01-15T12:00:48.530750 [actor]: left school june no college registered careers service looking apprenticeship

2026-01-15T12:00:49.558795 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So, your son left school in June and is now actively looking for an apprenticeship while registered with a youth careers service – is that correct?



Just checking I’ve understood correctly before moving on.

2026-01-15T12:00:50.410973 [actor]: yes looking apprenticeship registered youth careers

2026-01-15T12:00:51.379671 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming.

To clarify, how long ago did your son leave school – roughly, how many weeks or months has it been since he finished his education?

2026-01-15T12:00:52.210796 [actor]: june now august

2026-01-15T12:00:53.982158 [root_agent]: Okay, so it’s now August and he left school in June. That means it's been roughly 8-9 weeks since he left school. 

To confirm, is he registered with a youth careers service that is approved for the Child Benefit extension? (This is important as it allows continued eligibility for a short period after leaving education).

2026-01-15T12:00:54.945990 [actor]: yes local youth careers service

2026-01-15T12:00:55.627927 [root_agent]: Excellent. And to be certain, are you responsible for your son's care and does he live with you?

2026-01-15T12:00:56.384871 [actor]: yes lives with me

2026-01-15T12:00:57.068794 [root_agent]: Thank you. Finally, is your son currently receiving any state support, such as being in state-funded care?

2026-01-15T12:00:57.772674 [actor]: no

2026-01-15T12:01:00.596571 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for answering all of my questions. 

Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you *are* likely eligible to receive Child Benefit for your son. He is 17, has recently left school, is actively seeking an apprenticeship and registered with a youth careers service within the qualifying timeframe (under 20 weeks). You are responsible for his care and he lives with you, and he isn’t receiving state support.

However, please keep in mind I am an AI and this is not a definitive answer. You can find more detailed information and confirm your eligibility on the government website. Would you like me to summarise the key reasons why you are likely eligible?

2026-01-15T12:01:01.729255 [actor]: no thanks

2026-01-15T12:01:04.072334 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that Gary would be eligible for Child Benefit under the extension period as Ben is 17, has left school within 20 weeks, and is registered with a youth careers service.
