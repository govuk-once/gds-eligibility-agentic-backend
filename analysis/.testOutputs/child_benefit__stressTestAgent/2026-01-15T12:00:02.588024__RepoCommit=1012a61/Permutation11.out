2026-01-15T12:03:08.351981 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:03:09.239597 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please confirm how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:03:09.884358 [actor]: I'm 44

2026-01-15T12:03:10.408280 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is the child you are claiming for?

2026-01-15T12:03:11.127340 [actor]: my son is 17

2026-01-15T12:03:12.007435 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Is your son currently in full-time, non-advanced education or training? For example, is he still at school, or attending college?

2026-01-15T12:03:13.157485 [actor]: apprenticeship

2026-01-15T12:03:13.788812 [root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know. Could you please tell me if this apprenticeship is government-funded and in England?

2026-01-15T12:03:14.846776 [actor]: Yes Ryan government apprenticeship England Intermediate Apprenticeship

2026-01-15T12:03:16.323986 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Just to be clear, this is an Intermediate Apprenticeship?



*(Thinking: An apprenticeship in England *can* affect eligibility. I need to confirm the level to be certain, as advanced apprenticeships have different rules. The provided links confirm that starting an apprenticeship generally disqualifies a child from receiving Child Benefit.)*

2026-01-15T12:03:17.073265 [actor]: Yes Intermediate Apprenticeship

2026-01-15T12:03:19.649836 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying.

Based on the information you've provided – you are 44, your son is 17, and he has started a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England – it appears you are likely **no longer eligible** for Child Benefit. 

Starting an apprenticeship, even an Intermediate one, usually ends Child Benefit payments.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?



*(Thinking: I have used the provided links to confirm this assessment. An Intermediate Apprenticeship in England disqualifies the child for Child Benefit. I’ve stated this politely and offered further assistance.)*

2026-01-15T12:03:23.037958 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that starting an Intermediate Apprenticeship in England disqualifies Ryan from Child Benefit eligibility.
