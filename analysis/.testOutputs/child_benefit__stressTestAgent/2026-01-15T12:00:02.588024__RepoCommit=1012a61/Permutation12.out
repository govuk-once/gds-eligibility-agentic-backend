2026-01-15T12:03:23.597540 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:03:24.843797 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, are you currently receiving any benefits or financial support in your own right, such as Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance?

2026-01-15T12:03:27.349575 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you live with your 18-year-old son who is still in education. 

To clarify, are *you* the person claiming for Child Benefit, or are *you* asking on behalf of your son? And to confirm, are you responsible for your son financially?

2026-01-15T12:03:29.482876 [root_agent]: Thanks, Jessica. So you are assessing eligibility for Liam, your 18-year-old son who is studying for his A-levels. 

Is Liam financially dependent on you, or does he have his own income?

2026-01-15T12:03:31.944014 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. As Liam is receiving Universal Credit in his own right, this unfortunately means he is no longer eligible for Child Benefit. 

According to the rules, Child Benefit stops when a child starts getting Universal Credit (or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





2026-01-15T12:03:35.220151 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit cannot be claimed for Liam since he receives Universal Credit in his own right, which disqualifies him from Child Benefit eligibility.
