2026-01-15T12:05:51.247152 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:05:52.125012 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, are you responsible for the care of any children?


2026-01-15T12:05:53.215379 [actor]: have two kids but divorced one child with me one with ex

2026-01-15T12:05:54.405434 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. So you have two children, but one lives with you and one lives with your ex-partner. 

To clarify, are *you* currently responsible for the care of the child who lives with you?

2026-01-15T12:05:55.250077 [actor]: yes child lives with me

2026-01-15T12:05:56.060587 [root_agent]: Okay, great. And just to confirm, the other child lives with your ex-partner and they are responsible for their care?





2026-01-15T12:05:56.839149 [actor]: yes other child lives with ex partner

2026-01-15T12:05:57.642579 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. To help me understand your situation better, could you please tell me how old the child who lives with you is?

2026-01-15T12:05:58.594645 [actor]: child 10 years old

2026-01-15T12:05:59.120975 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is the child who lives with your ex-partner?

2026-01-15T12:05:59.891848 [actor]: other child 8 years old

2026-01-15T12:06:02.660370 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information.

Given that you have two children, but they live separately with each of you following a divorce, it's good to know that each of you can potentially claim Child Benefit for the child you have living with you at the full rate. 

To be absolutely sure, could you tell me if you are currently employed, and if so, roughly what your yearly income is *before* tax? This is because Child Benefit can sometimes be affected by parental income. Don’t worry about being exact, a rough estimate is fine.

2026-01-15T12:06:03.723086 [actor]: normal job earn 20000 pounds

2026-01-15T12:06:07.575864 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. An income of £20,000 a year means your income is below the threshold that affects Child Benefit.

Based on the information you’ve provided – you have a 10-year-old child living with you, and you are divorced with your ex-partner having care of an 8-year-old – you are likely eligible to receive Child Benefit at the full rate for your child.

Just to be completely clear, the full rate for a child is currently £26.05 per week. Your ex-partner would also likely be eligible to claim the full rate for the 8 year old.

Would you like me to summarise all the information we’ve covered? Or perhaps you have any other questions?





2026-01-15T12:06:08.576773 [actor]: so i can get child benefit for 10 year old

2026-01-15T12:06:10.499818 [root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct. Based on what you’ve told me – you are responsible for the care of your 10-year-old child, and your income is below the threshold that affects eligibility – you should be able to claim Child Benefit for your 10-year-old. Your ex-partner can also claim for the 8-year-old.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T12:06:12.302939 [actor]: No more questions thanks

2026-01-15T12:06:14.086261 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. They accurately explained that both parents can claim Child Benefit at the full rate for the child living with them, with the parent caring for the 10-year-old receiving the £26.05 weekly rate.
