2026-01-15T12:06:32.642325 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for asking. To help me understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:06:33.594610 [actor]: i am 50

2026-01-15T12:06:34.176054 [root_agent]: Thank you. And is the child you're enquiring about your biological child?

2026-01-15T12:06:35.288840 [actor]: my daughter sarah she's 12

2026-01-15T12:06:35.932742 [root_agent]: Thank you. Do you live with Sarah, your 12-year-old daughter?





2026-01-15T12:06:37.056569 [actor]: no i don't live with her

2026-01-15T12:06:37.634132 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Do you make any regular contributions towards Sarah’s upkeep?

2026-01-15T12:06:38.558659 [actor]: buy groceries clothes deliver to mother

2026-01-15T12:06:39.477526 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Approximately how much money do you spend on groceries and clothes for Sarah *each time* you buy them, and how often do you do this?

2026-01-15T12:06:40.443738 [actor]: £120 every 4 weeks

2026-01-15T12:06:41.257074 [root_agent]: Thank you. Just to clarify, this £120 covers all the groceries and clothes you provide for Sarah during that four-week period, correct?





2026-01-15T12:06:42.280512 [actor]: yes all groceries clothes for 4 weeks

2026-01-15T12:06:42.927050 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Do you receive any other benefits or payments relating to Sarah?

2026-01-15T12:06:43.584332 [actor]: no other benefits

2026-01-15T12:06:44.483807 [root_agent]: Thank you. And just to be clear, you don’t provide this £120 as a one-off payment, but do so regularly, every four weeks?

2026-01-15T12:06:45.198424 [actor]: yes every 4 weeks regularly

2026-01-15T12:06:46.781525 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided, it seems you *may* be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah, as your contributions meet the requirements for a non-resident parent. 

However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that you do not pay any weekly maintenance to Sarah’s mother?

2026-01-15T12:06:47.750567 [actor]: no weekly maintenance just the shopping

2026-01-15T12:06:50.046338 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Based on all the information you’ve provided, you *do* meet the criteria to potentially claim Child Benefit for Sarah. Your regular contributions of £120 every four weeks (averaging £30 per week) exceed the required amount to qualify as a contributing parent, even though you don’t live with her and don’t pay weekly maintenance.

However, the final decision rests with HMRC. Would you like me to summarise the key points for you, or would you prefer I stop here?

2026-01-15T12:06:52.403239 [actor]: Thank you for that information. Good to know I might be able to claim.

2026-01-15T12:06:54.160620 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Kevin may qualify for Child Benefit as his regular contributions of £120 every 4 weeks (averaging £30/week) exceed the required threshold of £26.05 per week.
