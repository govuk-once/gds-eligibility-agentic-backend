2026-01-15T12:11:13.139609 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:11:14.088163 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, are you currently living in the UK?


2026-01-15T12:11:14.946788 [actor]: yes visiting for few months with my son

2026-01-15T12:11:15.630750 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. And just to clarify, are you a British citizen?





2026-01-15T12:11:16.559231 [actor]: American tourist visa 6 months

2026-01-15T12:11:17.354450 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. 

To assess your eligibility accurately, could you please confirm if you are currently working in the UK?





2026-01-15T12:11:18.757241 [actor]: not working sightseeing london museums

2026-01-15T12:11:19.552280 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you.

Just to be clear, is your son currently living with you while you are visiting?

2026-01-15T12:11:20.567636 [actor]: yes my son is 5

2026-01-15T12:11:23.067561 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. As you are visiting the UK on a tourist visa and are not working, and your son is with you, it's likely you won’t be eligible for Child Benefit. This is because Child Benefit generally requires a right to reside in the UK which is usually linked to working or having settled status.

However, to be completely certain, could you tell me if you have lived in the UK for any significant period *before* this visit, or have any family members who are British citizens or have settled status here? This information might change things.





2026-01-15T12:11:23.887841 [actor]: just tourists first time in UK

2026-01-15T12:11:25.872101 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. In that case, given you are visiting the UK as a tourist with a 6-month visa and have no previous significant residency or family connections with settled status here, you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state that generally you need a right to reside in the UK to claim benefits, and that isn’t usually the case for standard visitors. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T12:11:28.208826 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know. We'll just be doing tourist things while in London then. Will leave next month.

2026-01-15T12:11:30.287948 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that a US citizen on a tourist visa does not have the right to reside required for Child Benefit eligibility.
