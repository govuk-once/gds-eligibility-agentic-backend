2026-01-15T17:35:48.558815 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-15T17:35:49.571085 [actor]: Thirty five years old with my boy

2026-01-15T17:35:50.571973 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. That's helpful.

Now, is the boy you mentioned your biological child, or do you have parental responsibility for him in another way (e.g., adoption, fostering)?

2026-01-15T17:35:51.278451 [actor]: My son here with me

2026-01-15T17:35:51.833608 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming.

To clarify, are you currently living with your son?

2026-01-15T17:35:52.593915 [actor]: Hotel stay visiting uk

2026-01-15T17:35:53.416986 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. It's important to understand your living arrangements.

Is the UK your main country of residence, or are you visiting the UK temporarily?

2026-01-15T17:35:54.173241 [actor]: From America visit 6 months

2026-01-15T17:35:55.002990 [root_agent]: Thank you. A 6-month visit from America is helpful to know.

To confirm, are you working in the UK during this 6-month visit?

2026-01-15T17:35:55.784887 [actor]: No working visa tourist

2026-01-15T17:35:56.711286 [root_agent]: Okay, so you're visiting as a tourist with no work visa. This is important.

Is your son also a British citizen, or does he have another nationality?

2026-01-15T17:35:57.525096 [actor]: American passport like me

2026-01-15T17:35:58.770138 [root_agent]: Thank you. Both of you being American citizens on a tourist visa for 6 months is good to know.

To clarify, are you claiming, or intending to claim, any other benefits in the UK? This includes things like Income Support, Universal Credit, or Housing Benefit.

2026-01-15T17:35:59.518419 [actor]: Can I get money for my son?

2026-01-15T17:36:02.330946 [root_agent]: Okay, you're asking specifically if you can *receive* money for your son while you are visiting.

Based on the information you've provided – you are a US citizen visiting the UK for 6 months as a tourist with your son, who is also a US citizen, and you are not working or claiming other benefits – it is **highly unlikely** you would be eligible for Child Benefit.

Child Benefit is generally for people who are ordinarily resident in the UK. As you are visiting for a limited time, you don't meet this criteria.

However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm if you have ever lived or worked in the UK before?

2026-01-15T17:36:03.024389 [actor]: First time UK

2026-01-15T17:36:05.309671 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming this is your first time in the UK.

Based on all the information you've provided – that you and your son are US citizens, visiting the UK for 6 months as tourists, it’s your first time visiting, and you are not working or claiming benefits – you are **not eligible** for Child Benefit.

The benefit is designed for people who are ordinarily resident in the UK, and a temporary visit does not qualify.

I hope this clarifies things for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T17:36:06.522957 [actor]: I understand I'm not eligible for Child Benefit. Thank you for the information.

2026-01-15T17:36:08.825776 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that as a US citizen visiting the UK temporarily as a tourist with no UK residence status, the person would not be eligible for Child Benefit.
