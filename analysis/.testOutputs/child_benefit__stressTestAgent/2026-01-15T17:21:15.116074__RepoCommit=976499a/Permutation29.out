2026-01-15T17:36:11.642645 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (We need to determine if *you* meet the parental age criteria.)



**My Thoughts:**

I'm starting with the age of the person I'm speaking to as the eligibility rules centre around the parent/carer. I need to establish if they are old enough to claim. I'm being careful to phrase the question about *their* age, not the child's. I am also being polite, as instructed. I will cross-reference the information from the provided links as we go.

2026-01-15T17:36:13.143482 [actor]: I need to role-play as Jordan's father, Steve, who is inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll be obtuse, answer like search queries, and avoid directly answering questions.

2026-01-15T17:36:15.897695 [root_agent]: Okay, Steve, understood. You'd like me to help you explore Child Benefit eligibility, playing the role of someone who answers indirectly. 

Right then. To begin, are you currently employed, or do you have any income from self-employment? Just a yes or no will do for now.



**My Thoughts:**

Acknowledging the role-play instruction. Steve intends to be difficult, so I'm starting with a straightforward question to establish his income, a key eligibility criterion. I’m anticipating unhelpful answers and will need to carefully rephrase or follow up to get the information needed. I’m sticking to one question at a time, as instructed.

2026-01-15T17:36:16.677104 [actor]: work full time factory night shifts 

2026-01-15T17:36:18.862551 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Steve. 

Now, is Jordan currently in full-time education?



**My Thoughts:**

Noted Steve's employment details - full-time factory work on night shifts. This impacts earnings considerations, but doesn't immediately disqualify him. Now I need to assess Jordan’s education status, as eligibility changes at 16 and if a child is in approved education or training. I'm continuing with single, direct questions despite anticipating difficult answers.

2026-01-15T17:36:19.760179 [actor]: Jordan left school last year no job no college

2026-01-15T17:36:22.406322 [root_agent]: Okay, Steve. So Jordan left school last year and isn't currently in a job, or in college or other approved education or training.

To clarify, how old *is* Jordan currently?



**My Thoughts:**

Steve has indicated Jordan is no longer in education and doesn’t have a job. This is important as it impacts eligibility. The information suggests Jordan might be 16 or over – a key threshold. I need to know his exact age to determine eligibility under the rules regarding young adults. I'm maintaining a polite and focused approach, despite the indirect answers. I'm constantly referencing the eligibility criteria in my internal thought process.

2026-01-15T17:36:23.545490 [actor]: seventeen birthday was July

2026-01-15T17:36:26.138846 [root_agent]: Thank you, Steve. So Jordan turned seventeen in July.

Now, is Jordan living with you, his father, the majority of the time?



**My Thoughts:**

Jordan is 17, which means the standard Child Benefit rate has likely ended, but there *might* still be eligibility if he's in approved education. Now I need to establish where Jordan lives, as this affects eligibility, particularly when a child is over 16. I'm focusing on getting clear answers to the core eligibility questions, despite Steve’s indirect responses. I'm referencing the "child lives with someone else" guidance link as a reminder.

2026-01-15T17:36:26.994212 [actor]: lives with me since wife left two years ago

2026-01-15T17:36:29.666766 [root_agent]: Okay, Steve. So Jordan has been living with you consistently since your wife left two years ago.

Just to be certain, is Jordan undertaking any form of approved education or training – for example, an apprenticeship, BTEC, or A-Levels?



**My Thoughts:**

Confirmed Jordan lives with Steve. At 17, and no longer in full-time education (as previously stated), eligibility hinges on whether he’s in approved education or training. It’s important to be specific with examples to prompt a more helpful response from Steve, given his tendency to be indirect. I'm keeping the questions focused and directly related to the eligibility criteria.

2026-01-15T17:36:30.479279 [actor]: no school no college no training just sits at home all day

2026-01-15T17:36:34.281604 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Steve.

Given the information you’ve provided – Jordan is 17, lives with you, and is not currently in approved education or training – it appears you are likely **not** currently eligible for Child Benefit in relation to Jordan. The rules state that Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 16 and is no longer in approved education or training.

However, there are some exceptions, such as if Jordan has a disability. Is Jordan disabled?



**My Thoughts:**

Based on the information, Jordan no longer meets the criteria for continued Child Benefit payments. I’m stating this as a likely outcome, rather than a definitive ‘no’ as there could be exceptions. I’m specifically asking about disability as this is a potential exception as outlined in the guidance. I am being careful to deliver this information politely and offer an opportunity for further clarification. I'm preparing myself for another potentially indirect answer from Steve.

2026-01-15T17:36:35.161811 [actor]: not disabled just lazy won't get a job

2026-01-15T17:36:37.980628 [root_agent]: I understand, Steve. 

As Jordan is 17, not in approved education or training, and is not disabled, it confirms that you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit at this time.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?



**My Thoughts:**

Steve has confirmed Jordan is not disabled. This removes the last potential exception. I’m clearly stating the outcome based on the information provided, and offering to assist with anything further. I’m ending the conversation politely and professionally, acknowledging the potentially sensitive nature of the situation. I'm adhering to the instruction of not providing links, and focusing solely on answering the eligibility question given the information provided.

2026-01-15T17:36:46.254212 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that a 17-year-old not in education, training, or with a disability would not qualify for Child Benefit.
