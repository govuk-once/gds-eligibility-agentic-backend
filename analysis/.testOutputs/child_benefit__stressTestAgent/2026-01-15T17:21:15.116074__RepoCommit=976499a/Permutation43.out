2026-01-15T17:43:31.664111 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (Child Benefit is claimed by the parent or guardian, but your age helps determine if you can claim for a child).

2026-01-15T17:43:33.430243 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll be obtuse, not answer questions directly, and speak like I'm entering search terms into a search engine.

Callum 17 Glasgow apprenticeship child benefit

2026-01-15T17:43:35.405614 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. It sounds like you're 17 years old, you live in Glasgow, and you're currently doing an apprenticeship.

To clarify, are you asking about Child Benefit *for yourself*, as you are 17, or are you asking about Child Benefit *for a child you care for*? Child Benefit usually relates to supporting children, but there are some specific rules around claiming for yourself as a young person.





2026-01-15T17:43:36.336999 [actor]: Modern apprenticeship my son Callum lives with me father Glasgow Scotland

2026-01-15T17:43:38.553865 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So, you are the parent of Callum, who is 17, and he lives with you and his father in Glasgow, Scotland. You are currently undertaking a modern apprenticeship.

To help me understand your situation better, could you please tell me – is either you or Callum’s father receiving any other benefits? (For example, Universal Credit, Income Support, etc). It’s okay if you don’t know offhand, just a yes or no to start is fine.





2026-01-15T17:43:39.559579 [actor]: Callum is my son doing Modern Apprenticeship I am father no benefits Scottish

2026-01-15T17:43:41.449095 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So Callum is your son, he's doing a Modern Apprenticeship, you are his father, and neither you nor Callum's mother (if applicable) are currently receiving any benefits. You also confirmed you live in Scotland.

Now, to confirm - is Callum in full-time education? A Modern Apprenticeship *can* count as full-time education for Child Benefit purposes, but it depends on the hours involved.

2026-01-15T17:43:42.377545 [actor]: Modern Apprenticeship paid training work 40 hours Glasgow son 17

2026-01-15T17:43:44.681472 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Callum’s Modern Apprenticeship involves 40 hours a week of paid training and work. 

Given that Callum is 17 and undertaking a Modern Apprenticeship with 40 hours per week, it’s likely this *is* considered full-time education for Child Benefit purposes. However, there’s also a rule about income.

Could you please tell me roughly what your annual income is? (An approximate figure is fine). This isn’t to be intrusive, but Child Benefit has an income threshold that affects eligibility.

2026-01-15T17:43:45.593510 [actor]: Callum earns apprentice wage father income not relevant

2026-01-15T17:43:47.572487 [root_agent]: Okay, you're stating that Callum earns an apprentice wage and that your income isn't relevant.

Just to be absolutely certain I understand correctly, are you saying you believe Callum’s income is the only income that matters in determining eligibility for Child Benefit in this case? Or are you saying you'd prefer not to disclose your income?

It's important to clarify because Child Benefit rules usually consider *household* income, but there are specific considerations for apprentices.





2026-01-15T17:43:48.488843 [actor]: Modern Apprenticeship Scotland paid not education

2026-01-15T17:43:51.095300 [root_agent]: Thank you for the clarification. You are stating that, despite it being a Modern Apprenticeship, in Scotland it is considered paid work and *not* education.

This is a key piece of information! According to the guidance, if a 16 or 17 year old is earning over £120 a week (gross) from an apprenticeship, they are generally no longer eligible for Child Benefit, as it's considered earnings rather than education.

Could you confirm if Callum’s gross weekly earnings from his apprenticeship are more than £120? Knowing this will allow me to give you a more accurate assessment.





2026-01-15T17:43:51.909781 [actor]: Scottish modern apprentice rate minimum wage age 17

2026-01-15T17:43:55.486707 [root_agent]: Thank you. The minimum wage for someone age 17 in Scotland is currently £6.83 per hour (as of April 2024). Working 40 hours a week at that rate would be £273.20 gross per week.

Therefore, as Callum’s weekly earnings (£273.20) are significantly over the £120 threshold, it appears he is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or any other questions you may have?

2026-01-15T17:43:56.731373 [actor]: Not eligible for child benefit then

2026-01-15T17:43:59.194393 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately concluded that a 17-year-old apprentice earning minimum wage (£273.20/week) exceeds the £120/week threshold, making them ineligible for Child Benefit.
