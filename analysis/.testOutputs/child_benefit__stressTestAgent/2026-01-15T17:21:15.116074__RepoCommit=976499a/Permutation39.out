2026-01-15T17:40:49.117212 [root_agent]: Okay, I can help you with that. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (Child Benefit eligibility depends on your age and whether you are responsible for a child).

2026-01-15T17:40:50.264023 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility.

adopted 2 kids special needs local council pays money

2026-01-15T17:40:51.643386 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, are *you* the parent who adopted these two children with special needs, and the local council provides financial support *to you* regarding their care? 

(I'm checking to confirm you are the person claiming, and understanding the source of funds is important for eligibility.)

2026-01-15T17:40:52.634669 [actor]: yes adopted 2 children 6 and 8 special support payment from council

2026-01-15T17:40:53.981450 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And are you currently employed or self-employed? Or, if not, what is your current occupation (e.g., unemployed, retired, full-time carer)? 

(This helps determine if your income affects eligibility – there are income thresholds for Child Benefit.)

2026-01-15T17:40:55.125094 [actor]: me and husband work part time care for kids difficult needs adaptation allowance

2026-01-15T17:40:56.616664 [root_agent]: Thank you. So, both you and your husband work part-time, and you receive an adaptation allowance due to the children's needs. 

To confirm, does either you or your husband have an individual income of over £50,000 per year? (This is a key threshold for Child Benefit eligibility).

2026-01-15T17:40:57.713620 [actor]: no income that high we both under 30k each adoption allowance helps extra costs

2026-01-15T17:40:59.680257 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know – incomes under £50,000 are generally eligible.

Now, just to be absolutely sure, are these children living with you *permanently*? I understand they are adopted, but I need to confirm their primary residence is with you.



(I'm checking this as there are specific rules if a child lives with someone else, even if they are adopted - see link provided)

2026-01-15T17:41:00.688976 [actor]: yes live with us full time adopted permanent 2 years ago sibling pair special needs

2026-01-15T17:41:03.622776 [root_agent]: Excellent. That’s very helpful.

Based on the information you've provided – you and your husband both work part-time with incomes under £50,000, you adopted the two children two years ago, and they live with you full-time – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit.

However, as you receive an adoption allowance from the council, it's best to double-check how this affects your claim. The allowance itself doesn't automatically disqualify you, but it’s worth confirming with HMRC directly to ensure there are no interactions with Child Benefit.

Would you like me to summarise the key points, or would you prefer I ask any further clarifying questions?

2026-01-15T17:41:04.646000 [actor]: so adoption allowance ok with child benefit? can get both? 2 children

2026-01-15T17:41:08.041533 [root_agent]: That's a very good question to clarify. According to the information available, receiving an adoption allowance **does not** automatically prevent you from receiving Child Benefit. You should be able to receive both.

However, the adoption allowance itself might be considered as income for tax purposes, which *could* potentially affect the amount of Child Benefit you receive if your household income exceeds £60,000. But it doesn’t disqualify you outright.

Since you have two children, and are receiving an adoption allowance, it's a slightly more complex situation. To be completely certain, I recommend contacting HMRC directly to confirm how your specific circumstances are treated.

Does that explanation make sense? Would you like me to reiterate anything, or would you like to know how to contact HMRC?

2026-01-15T17:41:09.195119 [actor]: yes eligible then both adoption allowance and child benefit ok

2026-01-15T17:41:10.452122 [actor]: I understand you're eligible for child benefit even while receiving the adoption allowance. Thank you for confirming this information.

2026-01-15T17:41:12.108636 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that the user is eligible for Child Benefit while also receiving an adoption allowance, which aligns with official guidance that adoption allowance does not disqualify someone from receiving Child Benefit.
