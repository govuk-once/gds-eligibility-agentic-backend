2026-01-15T17:27:00.052726 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (Child Benefit eligibility depends on your age)

2026-01-15T17:27:00.968336 [actor]: I'm looking for child benefit information maya adoption process

2026-01-15T17:27:02.272740 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So you are seeking information regarding Child Benefit *after* adopting a child. That’s helpful to know!

To begin assessing your eligibility, could you please confirm how old *you* are? (The parent claiming Child Benefit needs to meet certain age requirements).

2026-01-15T17:27:03.277653 [actor]: I'm 35 have a 4 year old placed with us adoption

2026-01-15T17:27:04.593014 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It’s good to know you are 35 and have a 4-year-old who is placed with you for adoption.

Now, to confirm, is the adoption legally finalised? In other words, are you the legal parent of the child now?

2026-01-15T17:27:05.330844 [actor]: adoption not finalised yet maya lives with us

2026-01-15T17:27:06.560822 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know the adoption isn’t finalised yet, but your child, Maya, is currently living with you.

In this situation, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit. To clarify, are you currently responsible for Maya’s care?

2026-01-15T17:27:07.416320 [actor]: yes responsible she's placed with us for adoption

2026-01-15T17:27:08.460054 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know. Since Maya is placed with you for adoption and you are responsible for her care, we need to check your National Insurance number status. 

Do you have a valid UK National Insurance number?

2026-01-15T17:27:09.038654 [actor]: yes NI number

2026-01-15T17:27:10.154015 [root_agent]: Great! Having a valid National Insurance number is a positive step.

Now, regarding your work or study situation - are you currently working, or are you claiming benefits yourself, or are you a student? (This helps determine eligibility based on income).

2026-01-15T17:27:10.919583 [actor]: Working full time both of us

2026-01-15T17:27:12.072357 [root_agent]: Thank you. So, both you and your partner are working full-time.

To clarify, roughly what is your annual income before tax? (Just an estimate is fine). Knowing this helps determine if your income affects eligibility.

2026-01-15T17:27:12.825854 [actor]: 50000 each salary

2026-01-15T17:27:15.484616 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for sharing that information. A combined income of £100,000 does impact Child Benefit eligibility due to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

However, you may still be able to claim Child Benefit, but you might have to pay a charge if either of you earn over £50,000. The charge is 1% of the Child Benefit amount for every £100 earned over £50,000.

Are you aware of the High Income Child Benefit Charge, and would you like me to explain it in more detail? Or would you prefer to move on to other potential eligibility factors?

2026-01-15T17:27:16.272802 [actor]: whats the benefit amount

2026-01-15T17:27:18.695833 [root_agent]: Certainly! As of the 2024/2025 tax year, the standard weekly rate for Child Benefit is £21.80 for your first child. For any additional children, the rate is £14.45 per week.

So, for Maya, as your first child, you would receive £21.80 per week. 

Given your combined income, it’s important to understand how the High Income Child Benefit Charge might apply. Would you like me to explain how that works with your £50,000 salary each?

2026-01-15T17:27:19.413772 [actor]: explain high income charge

2026-01-15T17:27:23.192373 [root_agent]: Okay, certainly. Here’s how the High Income Child Benefit Charge works:

Because you and your partner each earn £50,000, you’ll both be affected by the charge. The charge is 1% of the full amount of Child Benefit for *every* £100 of income above £50,000.

*   **For you:** Your income is £50,000, so you are at the threshold.
*   **For your partner:** Their income is £50,000, so they are also at the threshold.

Because your incomes are exactly £50,000 each, you won’t be charged anything. If either of your salaries were to exceed £50,000, the charge would begin.

Does that explanation make sense? Would you like me to illustrate with an example if one of your incomes was higher?

2026-01-15T17:27:24.038730 [actor]: so eligible for full amount

2026-01-15T17:27:25.914880 [root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct! Based on the information you’ve provided – your age, Maya living with you and being placed for adoption, having a National Insurance number, being employed, and your current income – you *are* eligible for the full amount of Child Benefit for Maya, which is currently £21.80 per week.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit or the adoption process?

2026-01-15T17:27:29.445846 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that with both parents earning £50,000 (at the threshold but not over), they would be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount of £21.80 weekly for their first child.
