2026-01-15T17:39:58.174244 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how many children you are responsible for? (This means children under 20 who you live with and are in full-time education).

2026-01-15T17:40:00.239306 [actor]: I'll help you roleplay as a user who's trying to determine their eligibility for child benefit. Based on your context, I'll respond to the agent's question while following the rules of being obtuse, not directly answering questions, and speaking like search terms.

Nina live with me not my child friend daughter sick

2026-01-15T17:40:01.467154 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. It sounds like Nina lives with you, and she is a friend's daughter who is unwell. 

Just to clarify – are *you* Nina’s parent or legal guardian? Knowing this is important for determining eligibility.





2026-01-15T17:40:02.529592 [actor]: not parent friend of mother private arrangement mother ill long time nina stay with me now

2026-01-15T17:40:03.900497 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining. So, you are a friend of Nina's mother, and Nina is living with you due to her mother's illness - and this is a private arrangement.

To clarify further, approximately how long has Nina been living with you? This will help me understand the situation better.

2026-01-15T17:40:05.258043 [actor]: months already council knows arrangement not giving money though taking care nina myself she ten years old

2026-01-15T17:40:06.727511 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know Nina has been living with you for several months, and that the council is aware of the arrangement. It's good to know you are providing care for her, and that she is ten years old.

Just to be certain, are you currently receiving any other benefits or financial support specifically *for* Nina?

2026-01-15T17:40:07.888996 [actor]: no money nobody helping financial responsibility mine private foster not council foster

2026-01-15T17:40:09.419996 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you are not receiving any financial support for Nina, and that this is a private fostering arrangement, not a council fostering arrangement. You’ve mentioned you have financial responsibility for her.

To help me understand your situation fully, what is your relationship to Nina’s mother – is it a formal agreement, or something less structured?

2026-01-15T17:40:10.665853 [actor]: mother best friend longtime no formal paper just helping until mother better private arrangement council knows but no money from them

2026-01-15T17:40:12.260674 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So you’ve been friends with Nina’s mother for a long time, it's a private arrangement with no formal paperwork, the council is aware but isn't providing financial assistance.

To confirm, are you employed, or do you have any income of your own? This helps determine eligibility based on your own financial situation.

2026-01-15T17:40:12.947431 [actor]: have job work full time own income

2026-01-15T17:40:14.111719 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you work full-time and have your own income.

Finally, just to be completely clear, is Nina the only child you are responsible for, or are there other children under 20 living with you whom you also support?

2026-01-15T17:40:14.872409 [actor]: just nina only child living with me nobody else

2026-01-15T17:40:19.190100 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that Nina is the only child living with you.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it *sounds like* you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina, despite not being her parent. Because she is living with you, you are taking financial responsibility for her, and her mother is unable to care for her due to illness. However, because you are not the parent or legal guardian, there are specific conditions that need to be met.

According to the information on the government website, you'll need to demonstrate that Nina's mother is unable to care for her, and that you are the main person providing care. You may also need to provide information about the private fostering arrangement.

I strongly recommend you review the following page on the government website for more details, as it specifically addresses situations where a child lives with someone who is not their parent: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else

Would you like me to summarise the key points from that page for you?





2026-01-15T17:40:20.439368 [actor]: yes eligible thank you

2026-01-15T17:40:22.686760 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent appropriately recognized that someone who is caring for a child through a private arrangement may be eligible for Child Benefit when the child's parent cannot care for them due to illness.
