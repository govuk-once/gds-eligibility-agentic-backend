2026-01-15T17:21:35.848778 [root_agent]: Okay, I can help you with that. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (Child Benefit eligibility depends on your age, and whether you are responsible for a child).

2026-01-15T17:21:37.139507 [actor]: I'll now role-play as a person asking about child benefit eligibility.

daughter college student 17 years old

2026-01-15T17:21:38.904037 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know.

To clarify, you are the parent/guardian asking about Child Benefit for your 17-year-old daughter who is a college student. Is that correct? 

(I'm checking because eligibility continues if the child is under 20 and in approved education or training.)

2026-01-15T17:21:39.766040 [actor]: yes A levels London single father

2026-01-15T17:21:41.453217 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming.

To help me assess eligibility, could you please tell me about your own National Insurance number? Specifically, do you have a full National Insurance number, or are you not currently contributing? (Eligibility requires sufficient National Insurance contributions.)

2026-01-15T17:21:42.467979 [actor]: salary £40,000 National Insurance paid every month

2026-01-15T17:21:44.460433 [root_agent]: That's good to know – a salary of £40,000 and consistent National Insurance contributions generally satisfy that requirement.

Now, to confirm, is your daughter living with you as her main home? (This is important as Child Benefit can be affected if the child lives primarily with someone else.)

2026-01-15T17:21:45.241954 [actor]: daughter lives with me full time since birth

2026-01-15T17:21:46.434702 [root_agent]: Excellent. That confirms she lives with you as her main home, which is a positive factor for eligibility.

Finally, are you, as the parent, a UK resident? (Child Benefit generally requires you to be living in the UK.)

2026-01-15T17:21:47.171943 [actor]: London resident for 20 years

2026-01-15T17:21:50.909155 [root_agent]: Okay, great. Based on the information you've provided:

*   Your daughter is under 20 and studying A-Levels (approved education).
*   You have a National Insurance number and pay contributions through your £40,000 salary.
*   Your daughter lives with you full-time.
*   You are a UK resident (London).

It *appears* you are likely eligible for Child Benefit.

However, I must state I am not a legal advisor. To be absolutely certain, and to ensure there are no other factors affecting your specific situation, I recommend you review the official government guidance here: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)

Would you like me to summarise the key eligibility points from that page for you? Or is there anything else I can help with?

2026-01-15T17:21:52.896580 [actor]: Thank you. Good to know eligible for child benefit.

2026-01-15T17:21:54.227126 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that a UK resident parent with a 17-year-old in approved education (A-levels) who lives with the parent full-time would qualify for Child Benefit.
