2026-01-29T14:33:15.603388 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T14:33:17.395594 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Noah - he's 6 years old.

2026-01-29T14:33:19.270867 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is Noah living with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T14:33:21.458844 [actor]: Well, that's a bit complicated at the moment. He's actually living with his grandmother right now. I had to have surgery and I'm recovering, so it was a family emergency situation. He's been there for about 6 weeks now.

2026-01-29T14:33:23.811122 [root_agent]: I understand - recovery from surgery can be challenging. Let me ask a clarifying question about this situation.

Is this arrangement with Noah's grandmother temporary while you recover, and do you expect Noah to return to live with you once you've recovered from your surgery?

2026-01-29T14:33:25.882501 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. It's definitely temporary - just while I'm recovering. He'll be coming back home to live with me once I'm better. The whole thing should only be for about 6 weeks total.

2026-01-29T14:33:28.029597 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. That's helpful information.

Now, do you currently pay towards Noah's upkeep? For example, do you contribute money towards his food, clothing, or other living costs while he's staying with his grandmother?

2026-01-29T14:33:30.536392 [actor]: Yes, I do. I'm still paying for his things - his clothes, contributing to his food costs, that sort of thing. I'm still his mum and responsible for him, he's just staying with his grandmother temporarily while I recover.

2026-01-29T14:33:32.998062 [root_agent]: That's very helpful, thank you.

One more important question: Are you (or your partner if you have one) responsible for Noah - meaning are you the person who is normally looking after him and making decisions about his care and upbringing?

2026-01-29T14:33:35.110320 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for him. I'm a single mother, so it's just me - I'm the one who normally looks after him and makes all the decisions about his care and upbringing. This stay with his grandmother is really just temporary because of my surgery.

2026-01-29T14:33:39.620672 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**You should be eligible for Child Benefit** for Noah. Here's why:

Based on the Child Benefit rules, you can still claim Child Benefit even when your child is temporarily living with someone else (in this case, his grandmother) as long as:

1. ✓ You are responsible for the child - which you are, as his mother making decisions about his care
2. ✓ You contribute to the child's upkeep - which you do, by paying for his clothes, food costs, etc.
3. ✓ The arrangement is temporary - which it is, as he'll return home after your recovery

The fact that Noah is staying with his grandmother for about 6 weeks while you recover from surgery is considered a temporary arrangement, and you're still contributing to his costs and remain responsible for him.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your situation?

2026-01-29T14:33:44.067292 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you! I'm relieved to know I should still be eligible. That really helps while I'm recovering.

2026-01-29T14:33:46.574444 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rules for Child Benefit when a child temporarily lives elsewhere, correctly identifying that the claimant remains eligible because she is still responsible for the child, contributes to his upkeep, and the arrangement is temporary due to medical recovery.
