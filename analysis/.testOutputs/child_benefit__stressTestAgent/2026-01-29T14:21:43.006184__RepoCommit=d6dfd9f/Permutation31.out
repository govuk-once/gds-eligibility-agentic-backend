2026-01-29T14:47:51.088914 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T14:47:52.940597 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Emma. She's 18 and just started at university this year.

2026-01-29T14:47:55.499507 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Emma is 18 and at university, I need to ask:

Is Emma still in approved education or training (such as A-levels, T-levels, Scottish Highers, or similar non-advanced courses)?

2026-01-29T14:47:57.903533 [actor]: Well, she's doing a Bachelor's degree at university. She just finished college and started this 3-year degree course. She still lives at home with me and commutes to uni every day.

2026-01-29T14:48:00.842898 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I need to understand a bit more about Emma's situation.

You mentioned she just finished college - was she in full-time approved education or training (like A-levels, T-levels, or similar non-advanced courses) immediately before starting university, and did she turn 18 while still in that education?

2026-01-29T14:48:02.947724 [actor]: Yes, she was doing A-levels at college before starting university. She turned 18 during her final year of A-levels, and then went straight to university after finishing them.

2026-01-29T14:48:05.799141 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Now I need to ask about your circumstances:

Are you the person responsible for Emma? This means - do you live with her and are you responsible for her care, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards looking after her?

2026-01-29T14:48:07.966684 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Emma lives at home with me - she's my daughter. I'm responsible for her and she commutes to university from our home.

2026-01-29T14:48:13.953305 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**I'm afraid you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Emma.**

Here's why: Child Benefit stops when a young person reaches age 20, **or** when they leave full-time approved education or training - **whichever comes first**. 

The key point is that Child Benefit only continues after age 16 if the young person is in **approved education or training**. This specifically means non-advanced education such as:
- A-levels
- T-levels
- Scottish Highers
- NVQs up to level 3

**University degrees (Bachelor's degrees) are considered advanced education and do not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.**

Since Emma has now left college (where she was doing A-levels) and started university, Child Benefit would have stopped when she left that approved education - even though she's only 18 and still living at home with you.

If Emma were still doing A-levels or similar non-advanced courses, you could continue receiving Child Benefit until she turns 20 or leaves that education. However, university study does not qualify.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-29T14:48:17.073558 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but thank you for explaining it clearly. So even though she's still only 18 and living at home, because she's doing a university degree rather than A-levels, I can't get Child Benefit anymore. I understand now - it's about the type of education, not just her age. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T14:48:20.787736 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops when a child leaves approved non-advanced education (such as A-levels) to start advanced education (university degree), even if the child is still under 20 and living at home.
