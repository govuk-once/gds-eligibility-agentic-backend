2026-01-29T14:39:03.280885 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:39:04.930671 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Sarah. She's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T14:39:06.583235 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Is your daughter Sarah living with you, or does she live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T14:39:08.332019 [actor]: No, she doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother.

2026-01-29T14:39:10.586872 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Since Sarah lives with her mother rather than with you, I need to understand the situation better:

**Do you contribute towards the costs of raising Sarah? For example, do you pay maintenance or child support for her?**

2026-01-29T14:39:12.702739 [actor]: Well, I don't pay weekly maintenance exactly. But I do contribute - every 4 weeks I buy a large bulk order of groceries and clothes for her that costs about £120, and I deliver them to her mother.

2026-01-29T14:39:15.964760 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that.

Let me ask another important question:

**Do you contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate towards Sarah's costs? Currently, Child Benefit is £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child.**

Based on what you've told me, you're spending about £120 every 4 weeks, which works out to approximately £30 per week - so this may meet that threshold.

However, I also need to know: **Is Sarah's mother currently claiming Child Benefit for Sarah?**

2026-01-29T14:39:17.868961 [actor]: I'm not entirely sure if her mother is claiming it or not. Should I check with her?

2026-01-29T14:39:21.212602 [root_agent]: That would be very helpful information to have, as it's an important factor in determining your eligibility.

**Here's why it matters:** Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child at any given time. If Sarah's mother is already claiming Child Benefit for Sarah, then you wouldn't be able to claim it as well - even if you're contributing to her costs.

So yes, it would be good to check with her mother. In the meantime, let me ask:

**If it turns out that Sarah's mother is NOT claiming Child Benefit, would you be interested in claiming it yourself?**

2026-01-29T14:39:23.020869 [actor]: Yes, if her mother isn't claiming it, I'd definitely be interested in claiming it myself since I am contributing regularly to Sarah's costs.

2026-01-29T14:39:26.828633 [root_agent]: That's good to know.

Based on what you've told me so far, here's what I need to clarify about your situation:

Since Sarah doesn't live with you but lives with her mother, the general rule is that **the person the child lives with should normally claim Child Benefit**. 

However, if Sarah's mother is not claiming it, you may be able to claim if you're contributing at least the Child Benefit rate to her upkeep (which appears to be the case with your £120 every 4 weeks).

Before we can determine your full eligibility, I need to ask:

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on accessing public funds as part of your immigration status?**

2026-01-29T14:39:28.514285 [actor]: No, I don't have any immigration restrictions. I'm a UK resident and there are no restrictions on accessing public funds.

2026-01-29T14:39:31.099083 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Let me ask one more question to complete the picture:

**Is Sarah under 16 years old, or if she's 16 or over, is she in approved education or training?**

(I know you mentioned she's 12, so this should be straightforward, but I want to confirm her age and that there are no other circumstances affecting her status.)

2026-01-29T14:39:32.853566 [actor]: Yes, that's right - Sarah is 12 years old, so she's under 16.

2026-01-29T14:39:38.064164 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming all of that information.

Based on what you've told me, here's the situation regarding your eligibility for Child Benefit:

**Key findings:**

1. Sarah is 12 years old (under 16) ✓
2. You have no immigration restrictions ✓
3. You contribute approximately £30 per week towards Sarah's costs (above the Child Benefit rate of £25.60) ✓
4. However, Sarah lives with her mother, not with you

**The main issue is:** Normally, the person the child lives with should claim Child Benefit. Since Sarah lives with her mother, her mother would typically be the one entitled to claim.

**You may be eligible IF:**
- Sarah's mother is NOT currently claiming Child Benefit for Sarah, AND
- You can demonstrate you're contributing at least the Child Benefit rate to Sarah's costs

**My recommendation:** You need to check with Sarah's mother whether she is claiming Child Benefit. If she isn't claiming it and doesn't want to, then you could potentially make a claim based on your regular contributions.

Would you like to find out from her mother about whether she's claiming, and then we can discuss next steps?

2026-01-29T14:39:40.195767 [actor]: Alright, I understand. So just to be clear - if her mother isn't claiming Child Benefit for Sarah, then I would be eligible to claim it myself based on my contributions of £120 every 4 weeks? That's what you're telling me?

2026-01-29T14:39:44.789058 [root_agent]: I need to be careful here to give you accurate information.

**What I can say is:** If Sarah's mother is NOT claiming Child Benefit, you *may* be able to claim it because:
- You're contributing at least the Child Benefit rate (your £120 every 4 weeks = approximately £30/week, which exceeds the £25.60 rate)
- You have no immigration restrictions
- Sarah is under 16

**However**, there's an important consideration: The general principle is that the person the child normally lives with has the primary entitlement to Child Benefit. Since Sarah lives with her mother, even if her mother isn't claiming, the authorities would typically expect her to be the claimant.

You contributing to Sarah's costs may give you a claim in certain circumstances, but this can be a complex area.

**My question to help clarify:** **Is there any particular reason why Sarah's mother wouldn't be claiming Child Benefit herself, or any reason why you rather than she should be the claimant?**

2026-01-29T14:39:47.547717 [actor]: Well, I'm not sure about her specific situation. I just want to make sure Sarah is supported and that I'm doing everything I should be doing for her. I contribute what I can afford regularly. Does it really matter who claims it as long as the money goes towards Sarah's care?

2026-01-29T14:39:52.437409 [root_agent]: That's a very reasonable and caring perspective, and I appreciate that your focus is on making sure Sarah is supported.

You're right that what matters most is that Sarah gets the support she needs. However, **yes, it does matter who claims Child Benefit** for administrative and legal reasons - only one person can claim it for each child at any given time.

**Here's what's important to understand:**

Child Benefit is paid to the person who claims it (not directly for the child). So:
- If Sarah's mother claims it, the money goes to her
- If you were to claim it, the money would come to you

Since Sarah lives with her mother day-to-day, she is incurring the daily costs of Sarah's care, so she would typically be the appropriate person to receive Child Benefit.

**My suggestion:** Have a conversation with Sarah's mother to:
1. Find out if she's claiming Child Benefit for Sarah
2. If she isn't, encourage her to claim it (as the person Sarah lives with)
3. Continue your regular contributions as you're already doing

Would you be comfortable having that conversation with her?

2026-01-29T14:39:54.441731 [actor]: Yes, I can talk to her about it. So just to make sure I understand correctly - you're saying that because Sarah lives with her mother, her mother should be the one claiming Child Benefit, even though I'm making regular contributions? And I wouldn't be eligible to claim it myself in this situation?

2026-01-29T14:39:59.286788 [root_agent]: Yes, that's essentially correct based on the information you've provided.

**To summarize clearly:**

Since Sarah lives with her mother day-to-day, her mother is the person who would normally be eligible to claim Child Benefit - she's the primary caregiver and the one Sarah resides with.

**You would NOT typically be eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation** because:
- Sarah doesn't live with you
- Her mother is the person she lives with, so her mother has the primary entitlement

**Your regular contributions of £120 every 4 weeks are valuable and important** for supporting Sarah, but they don't transfer the Child Benefit entitlement to you when Sarah lives with someone else.

The system is designed so that the person providing day-to-day care (where the child lives) receives Child Benefit to help with those ongoing costs.

**So to directly answer your original question:** Based on Sarah living with her mother rather than with you, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah yourself.

Does this clarify the situation for you?

2026-01-29T14:40:02.224571 [actor]: Yes, that makes sense now. Thank you for explaining it clearly. So I'm not eligible because Sarah doesn't live with me - her mother would be the one who should claim it since Sarah lives with her. I'll continue with my contributions and talk to her mother about whether she's claiming the benefit. Thanks for your help.

2026-01-29T14:40:07.767640 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent concluded the user is not eligible for Child Benefit, but according to gov.uk guidance, a person who doesn't live with the child CAN claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the Child Benefit rate towards the child's upkeep and no one else is claiming for that child. Since the user contributes £30/week (exceeding the £25.60 threshold) and it's unclear if the mother is claiming, the agent should have determined potential eligibility pending confirmation that the mother isn't claiming, rather than stating definitively that the user is not eligible.
