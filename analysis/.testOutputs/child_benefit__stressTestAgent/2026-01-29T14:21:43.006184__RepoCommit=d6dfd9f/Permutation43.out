2026-01-29T14:55:33.831085 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?** This includes:
- Your own child
- An adopted child
- A child you're looking after (even if they're not related to you)

2026-01-29T14:55:36.271614 [actor]: I'm not sure I understand - I'm 17 and live with my dad in Glasgow. Are you asking if I have children? Because I don't have any kids myself. I'm just wondering if my dad can still claim Child Benefit for me, since I've recently started a Modern Apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T14:55:39.550943 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying! That makes much more sense. You're asking whether your dad can still claim Child Benefit for **you** as the child, now that you've started a Modern Apprenticeship.

To help assess this, I need to ask:

**Are you currently enrolled in approved education or training?** Specifically, is your Modern Apprenticeship considered "approved training" and are you studying for at least 12 hours per week on average (not counting paid work)?

2026-01-29T14:55:42.793918 [actor]: Well, it's a Modern Apprenticeship here in Scotland - I'm working with an employer and doing training as part of that. I'm not really sure if it counts as "approved training" or not. I spend quite a bit of time on the training side of things, but it's all connected to my job. Does that count?

2026-01-29T14:55:46.303197 [root_agent]: That's a helpful clarification. Modern Apprenticeships can be a bit complex when it comes to Child Benefit eligibility.

Let me ask you this:

**Are you registered with or receiving training through a government-approved scheme?** In Scotland, Modern Apprenticeships are typically delivered through Skills Development Scotland. Also, **are you receiving a wage or salary from your employer for the work you do as part of the apprenticeship?**

This will help me understand whether your situation falls under "approved training" or is considered paid employment for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-29T14:55:48.537237 [actor]: Yes, I'm registered through Skills Development Scotland - that's who set up my Modern Apprenticeship. And yes, I am getting paid by my employer. I get a wage for the work I do. Is that going to be a problem for my dad's Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T14:55:51.416575 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Yes, this is an important detail.

Let me ask you one more key question:

**Are you working 24 hours a week or more on average (excluding the time spent on training/education)?** 

This is the crucial threshold that determines whether Child Benefit can continue. If you're working 24 hours or more per week in paid employment, Child Benefit would typically stop, even if you're doing an apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T14:55:54.415361 [actor]: I'm not entirely sure how to separate the work hours from the training hours since it's all mixed together in my apprenticeship. Some days I'm more on the job working, other days I'm doing more of the training side. But overall, with everything combined - the work and the training - I'm definitely doing more than 24 hours a week total. Does that mean my dad can't get Child Benefit for me anymore?

2026-01-29T14:55:58.359936 [root_agent]: That's a really good question, and I understand the confusion since apprenticeships blend work and training together.

Let me ask you this to get a clearer picture:

**When you're doing the "training side" of your apprenticeship, is this classroom-based learning, college courses, or structured training that's separate from your regular work duties? And roughly how many hours per week would you say are dedicated specifically to this educational/training element rather than just doing your job?**

This distinction is important because if a significant portion of your time is spent in actual education or training (rather than paid work), it might affect the eligibility differently.

2026-01-29T14:56:01.730689 [actor]: Well, I do go to college one day a week as part of the apprenticeship - that's probably about 6 or 7 hours of classroom learning. The rest of the time I'm at my workplace, and even when I'm there I'm learning on the job, but I suppose that's more like working than formal training. So if we're talking about the structured college bit, it's maybe 6-7 hours a week, but the rest is me working at my employer's and getting paid for it.

2026-01-29T14:56:05.154218 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's very helpful information. So you have about 6-7 hours of college-based training per week, and the remainder of your time is paid work at your employer.

One more important question:

**How many total hours per week are you working at your employer (not counting the college day)? In other words, how many hours of paid work are you doing each week?**

This will help me determine if you're working 24 hours or more per week, which is the key threshold for Child Benefit eligibility for young people aged 16-19 in approved education or training.

2026-01-29T14:56:07.457511 [actor]: I work at my employer's 4 days a week since I'm at college the other day. I'd say that's about 32 hours of paid work each week, not counting the college day.

2026-01-29T14:56:11.991960 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, I can now give you an assessment.

**Unfortunately, your dad would not be eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit for you.**

Here's why: Although you're doing a Modern Apprenticeship through Skills Development Scotland (which is approved training) and attending college one day a week, you are working **32 hours per week in paid employment**. 

The key rule is that Child Benefit stops for young people aged 16-19 who are working **24 hours or more per week** on average, even if they're also in approved education or training.

Since you're working 32 hours per week, this exceeds the 24-hour threshold, which means Child Benefit would end.

Your dad should inform the Child Benefit Office about the change in your circumstances (starting the Modern Apprenticeship with 32 hours of paid work per week) so they can stop the payments. This is important to avoid any overpayments that would need to be repaid later.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-29T14:56:15.198212 [actor]: No, that makes sense. Thanks for explaining it to me. It's disappointing, but at least I understand why now - it's because I'm working more than 24 hours a week. I'll let my dad know he needs to contact them about it.

2026-01-29T14:56:19.311323 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the 24-hour work threshold rule, correctly identifying that working 32 hours per week in paid employment disqualifies the claimant from Child Benefit, even when participating in an approved Modern Apprenticeship with additional college attendance.
