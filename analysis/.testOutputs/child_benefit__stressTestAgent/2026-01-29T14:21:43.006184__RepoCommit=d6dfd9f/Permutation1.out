2026-01-29T14:21:45.456332 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T14:21:47.495213 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who's 8 years old, so he's definitely under 16. He lives with me and my husband.

2026-01-29T14:21:49.967922 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Now, can you tell me - are you or your husband responsible for your son? By this I mean, does at least one of you have main responsibility for him in terms of his care and upbringing?

2026-01-29T14:21:52.460138 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. We're both responsible for him - he lives with us full-time here in Manchester. I'm his mum and my husband is his dad, so we both look after him. He goes to primary school locally and lives at home with us.

2026-01-29T14:21:54.358586 [root_agent]: That's great, thank you for clarifying.

Next question: Do you or your husband currently live in the UK?

2026-01-29T14:21:56.165235 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. We're in Manchester. We're both UK nationals as well, if that matters.

2026-01-29T14:21:58.532284 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful information.

Now, I need to ask about your income: Do either you or your husband have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-29T14:22:00.652066 [actor]: No, neither of us earns that much. My husband works as a teacher and earns £35,000 a year, and I work part-time earning £15,000. So our highest individual income is £35,000, which is below £50,000.

2026-01-29T14:22:02.433518 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

One more question: Is your son currently in hospital or care (such as local authority care or custody)?

2026-01-29T14:22:04.172841 [actor]: No, not at all. He's living at home with us and goes to his local primary school. He's not in hospital or in any kind of care.

2026-01-29T14:22:07.596202 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 years old
✓ You and your husband are responsible for your son
✓ He lives with you in the UK
✓ You both live in the UK
✓ Your son is not in hospital or care
✓ Neither you nor your husband earns over £50,000 individually

Since all these conditions are met, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit. You can choose which parent makes the claim - typically it's one person who claims for all children in the household.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T14:22:09.736709 [actor]: That's brilliant, thank you so much for your help! That's all I needed to know. I really appreciate you taking the time to go through all of that with me.

2026-01-29T14:22:13.982594 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all the relevant eligibility criteria (child under 16, parental responsibility, UK residency, child not in hospital/care, and income below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold of £50,000) and correctly concluded that the user is eligible for Child Benefit.
