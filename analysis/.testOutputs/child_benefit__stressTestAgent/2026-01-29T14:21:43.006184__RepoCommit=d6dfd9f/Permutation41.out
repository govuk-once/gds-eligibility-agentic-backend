2026-01-29T14:53:38.508153 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T14:53:40.621000 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have two children - Ben who's 10 and Jerry who's 8. They actually live with my ex-partner though, not with me.

2026-01-29T14:53:43.079386 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since your children Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner, I need to ask: Are you the person responsible for the children - meaning are you the main person who looks after them and pays for things like food, clothes, and other costs for them?

2026-01-29T14:53:45.571632 [actor]: Well, not directly - they live with my ex-partner, so she's the one who looks after them day-to-day. But I do contribute financially towards their upbringing. I pay £40 per week to help with their costs.

2026-01-29T14:53:47.806255 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Since your ex-partner is the one who looks after Ben and Jerry day-to-day, she would generally be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit as the main carer.

However, I need to ask: Is your ex-partner currently claiming Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry?

2026-01-29T14:53:50.178701 [actor]: No, she's not claiming it. That's why I wanted to check if I could claim it based on the contributions I'm making towards their costs.

2026-01-29T14:53:53.403085 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Even though you contribute financially to Ben and Jerry's costs, Child Benefit is normally paid to the person the child lives with and who is responsible for their day-to-day care. Since your children live with your ex-partner and she looks after them, she would typically be the eligible person to claim.

However, there can be situations where the person the child doesn't live with can claim. Let me ask: Is there any particular reason why your ex-partner is not claiming Child Benefit, or is unable to claim it?

2026-01-29T14:53:56.337854 [actor]: She just doesn't want to claim it. But I'm contributing £40 a week towards the children - doesn't that count for anything? I thought if you're contributing at least as much as the Child Benefit amount, you might be able to claim it instead?

2026-01-29T14:53:59.947238 [root_agent]: I understand your reasoning, and thank you for contributing financially to your children's upbringing. However, I need to clarify an important point:

Child Benefit eligibility is based on who is **responsible for the child** - which means the person who the child lives with and who looks after them day-to-day. It's not primarily based on who makes financial contributions.

Since Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner and she is their main carer, she is the person who would normally be eligible to claim Child Benefit, regardless of whether she chooses to do so.

Let me ask: Do Ben and Jerry spend any nights staying with you regularly, or do they live with you for any periods of time?

2026-01-29T14:54:03.314580 [actor]: No, they don't stay with me regularly - they live with their mum full-time. But I've heard that there are situations where someone who doesn't live with the children can still claim if they're contributing enough financially. The Child Benefit for two children is about £43.30 a week, and I'm paying £40 a week - that's nearly the full amount. Surely there must be some way I can claim it?

2026-01-29T14:54:08.039568 [root_agent]: I understand your frustration, and I appreciate that you're contributing significantly to your children's costs. However, I need to be clear about the rules:

Child Benefit is paid to the person who is **responsible for the child** - and this means the person the child lives with and who looks after them. The amount of money you contribute, even if it equals or exceeds the Child Benefit amount, doesn't change the eligibility criteria.

Since Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner full-time and she is their main carer, she is the eligible person to claim Child Benefit. The fact that she chooses not to claim it doesn't transfer that eligibility to you.

There are only very specific circumstances where someone other than the main carer might claim - for example, if children are living in different households or in certain care situations.

Based on what you've told me, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit** for Ben and Jerry while they live with and are cared for by your ex-partner.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T14:54:10.938481 [actor]: But I've specifically read that HMRC can consider cases where the contribution is split between the parents, and they can look at how much each parent is contributing towards each child. I'm paying £40 a week - can't I ask HMRC to split that contribution and see if I qualify for at least one of the children based on what I'm paying?

2026-01-29T14:54:16.321783 [root_agent]: I understand you want to explore every option, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to be very clear based on the official guidance:

Child Benefit is **not split between parents based on financial contributions**. It's an either/or situation - only one person can claim Child Benefit for a particular child, and that person must be the one who is **responsible for the child**.

"Responsible for the child" means:
- The child lives with them, AND
- They look after the child day-to-day

The amount of money contributed doesn't determine eligibility. Even if you're paying £40 per week towards both children's costs, this doesn't make you the responsible person for either Ben or Jerry, because they don't live with you and you're not their day-to-day carer.

Your ex-partner, as the person Ben and Jerry live with and who cares for them daily, is the only person eligible to claim Child Benefit for them - regardless of how much you contribute financially.

HMRC cannot split Child Benefit between parents or award it based on financial contribution amounts when the children live full-time with one parent.

Does this help clarify the situation?

2026-01-29T14:54:20.041562 [actor]: Look, I really think there's something in the rules about this. I've been doing my research, and I'm sure I read that if someone who doesn't live with the child is contributing at least as much as the Child Benefit rate for that child, they can potentially claim it. And if the contribution doesn't cover both children fully, you can ask HMRC to allocate the contribution differently between the children. I'm paying £40 a week - can you check if there's a way to allocate that so I might qualify for one of them at least?

2026-01-29T14:54:25.234167 [root_agent]: I understand you feel strongly about this, and I want to make sure I'm giving you accurate information. Let me be very clear after carefully reviewing the official guidance:

**There is no provision in the Child Benefit rules that allows someone to claim based on making financial contributions equal to the Child Benefit amount.** This is not how eligibility works.

The fundamental rule is: Child Benefit goes to the person who is **responsible for the child** - meaning the child lives with them and they provide day-to-day care.

There is no mechanism for:
- Splitting Child Benefit between parents based on contributions
- Allocating contributions differently between children to create eligibility
- Claiming Child Benefit for a child you don't live with based on paying a certain amount

The only exceptions to the "person the child lives with" rule are very specific situations like:
- Children spending equal time in two households
- Children in hospital or care
- Formal care arrangements

Since Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner full-time and she cares for them, **she is the only person eligible to claim**, regardless of your £40 weekly contribution.

I know this isn't the answer you were hoping for. Is it possible you've confused Child Benefit with child maintenance or another type of support?

2026-01-29T14:54:28.876838 [actor]: No, I'm definitely talking about Child Benefit. And I'm certain I've read about this - it's in the official guidance about cases where someone doesn't live with the child but contributes at least as much as the Child Benefit amount. There's something about how HMRC normally splits the contribution equally between children, but you can ask them to split it unequally. So if my £40 is split equally, that's £20 for each child. But Ben's rate is £26.05 and Jerry's is £17.25. So I could ask HMRC to allocate £26.05 to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry from my £40, couldn't I?

2026-01-29T14:54:34.271054 [root_agent]: I need to stop you here because I think there may be a significant misunderstanding about what you've read.

Let me be absolutely clear: **I cannot find any provision in the official Child Benefit guidance that allows someone who doesn't live with a child to claim Child Benefit simply by contributing an amount equal to the Child Benefit rate.**

The guidance I have access to covers:
- Eligibility based on being responsible for a child (living with them and caring for them)
- Situations where children live with different people
- Children in hospital or care
- Disputes between people who both care for the same child

**None of this involves calculating financial contributions and allocating them between children to determine eligibility.**

Before we continue, I need to ask: Can you tell me where exactly you read this information about contributing at least the Child Benefit amount and splitting contributions between children? Was it an official gov.uk page, a forum, or another source? 

This would help me understand if there's something specific I need to look into, or if there's been a misunderstanding about what you've read.

2026-01-29T14:54:37.725164 [actor]: I'm pretty sure it was on the official government guidance - something about cases where the person paying contributes at least as much as the Child Benefit for the child. It talked about how the contribution gets allocated and how you can request HMRC to split it differently between children. Maybe it's a specific section you haven't looked at? Can you check the detailed guidance on cases where someone is contributing but the child lives elsewhere?

2026-01-29T14:54:43.310363 [root_agent]: I appreciate your patience, and I want to give you the most accurate information possible. Let me be very transparent with you:

I have carefully reviewed all three official gov.uk pages I have access to regarding Child Benefit eligibility:
- The main eligibility criteria
- Guidance for when a child lives with someone else
- Guidance for children in hospital or care

**I cannot find any section in any of these official sources that discusses:**
- Claiming based on contributing an amount equal to Child Benefit
- Allocating or splitting contributions between children
- HMRC splitting contributions equally or unequally between children to determine eligibility

The consistent message across all official guidance is that eligibility is based on **being responsible for the child** - meaning they live with you and you care for them day-to-day.

It's possible that:
1. You may have read something on a non-official website that was incorrect
2. You may be thinking of a different benefit or child maintenance rules
3. There's guidance I don't have access to (though I'm using the official gov.uk pages)

Would you be willing to contact HMRC directly to verify what you've read? They can clarify definitively whether such a provision exists. Their Child Benefit helpline can address your specific situation.

Does that seem reasonable?

2026-01-29T14:54:46.791869 [actor]: Look, I'm absolutely certain this exists. I've done my homework on this. The rule is there - if you're contributing at least as much as the Child Benefit amount for a child who doesn't live with you, you can potentially claim. And there's definitely something about how HMRC allocates the contribution between multiple children, and that you can request them to do it differently. Maybe you need to look at more detailed guidance or technical notes? This is a real provision, I'm sure of it.

2026-01-29T14:54:52.956922 [root_agent]: I need to be very direct with you now.

I have thoroughly reviewed all the official gov.uk guidance I have access to on Child Benefit eligibility, including:
- Standard eligibility rules
- Cases where children live with someone else
- Special circumstances

**There is no such provision in any of these official sources.** 

The rule you're describing - about claiming Child Benefit by contributing an amount equal to the Child Benefit rate, and allocating contributions between children - **does not exist in the Child Benefit system based on the official guidance available to me.**

I understand you believe you've read this somewhere, but I must tell you clearly: **this does not match any official Child Benefit rules I can find.**

It's possible you've either:
- Read misinformation from an unofficial source
- Confused Child Benefit with child maintenance calculations (which do work differently)
- Misunderstood something you read

**Based on the official rules: You are not eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry because they don't live with you and you're not their day-to-day carer.**

I strongly recommend you contact HMRC's Child Benefit helpline directly on 0300 200 3100 to discuss this. They can definitively confirm whether what you believe you've read actually exists.

Is there anything else I can help clarify about the actual Child Benefit rules?

2026-01-29T14:54:55.908891 [actor]: You know what, maybe I should just contact HMRC directly then, because I'm confident this provision exists and applies to my situation. If you can't find it in your guidance, perhaps they can look into it properly. Thanks anyway.

2026-01-29T14:55:00.999101 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent consistently and accurately explained that Child Benefit eligibility is based on who is responsible for the child (the person the child lives with and who provides day-to-day care), not on financial contributions. Despite the user's persistent claims about a non-existent provision allowing claims based on contribution amounts, the agent correctly maintained that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit for either Ben or Jerry since they live with the ex-partner who is their day-to-day carer. The agent appropriately directed the user to contact HMRC directly when the user continued to insist on incorrect information.
