2026-01-29T14:48:23.120094 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or children under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:48:25.116532 [actor]: Yes, I have a son who's 17. He's living with me and going to college part-time to re-sit a couple of his GCSEs.

2026-01-29T14:48:27.944382 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand a bit more about your son's education:

**Is your son enrolled in approved education or training that counts as full-time, or is it definitely part-time?**

(For Child Benefit purposes, the education or training needs to be full-time and of a qualifying type for young people aged 16-19.)

2026-01-29T14:48:29.831005 [actor]: It's part-time really. He only has 6 hours a week of supervised study at the college. The rest of the time he's just at home playing games.

2026-01-29T14:48:34.079989 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation**.

Here's why: For young people aged 16-19, Child Benefit can only continue if they are in **full-time approved education or training**. Since your son is only attending college for 6 hours per week of supervised study, this would be considered part-time education and would not meet the requirements for Child Benefit eligibility.

Child Benefit typically stops when a young person:
- Turns 16 and leaves education or training, or
- Turns 20 (even if still in approved education or training)

In your case, since your 17-year-old son is only in part-time education, you would not qualify for Child Benefit for him.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T14:48:39.351069 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that part-time education (6 hours per week) does not meet the full-time education requirement for Child Benefit eligibility for a 17-year-old, and correctly concluded the user is not eligible.
