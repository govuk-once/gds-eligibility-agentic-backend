2026-01-29T14:53:04.170971 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this, I need to ask you a few questions.

Let me start with the first one:

**Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T14:53:05.626001 [actor]: Yes, I am. My son Simon is 15 years old.

2026-01-29T14:53:07.139408 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:53:08.980915 [actor]: Yes, I do live in the UK.

2026-01-29T14:53:10.563009 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

**Does your son Simon live with you?**

2026-01-29T14:53:12.570375 [actor]: Well, not at the moment. Simon has been detained under the Mental Health Act and he's in a secure psychiatric unit. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-29T14:53:14.428262 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this must be a difficult time for you and your family.

**Before Simon was detained in the secure psychiatric unit, did he normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T14:53:16.017464 [actor]: Yes, he did. He lived with me before he was detained.

2026-01-29T14:53:18.080998 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

**Are you still contributing to the costs of supporting Simon - for example, are you paying towards his maintenance or keeping his room ready for when he returns home?**

2026-01-29T14:53:20.070411 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm keeping his room exactly as it was for when he comes home, and I'm still buying things he needs and staying involved in his care. I visit him regularly as well.

2026-01-29T14:53:22.071760 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. That's very helpful.

Let me ask one more question to complete the assessment:

**Do you have a partner, and if so, which one of you would be claiming the Child Benefit (or would you be claiming as a single parent)?**

2026-01-29T14:53:23.884270 [actor]: I'm a single parent, so it would just be me claiming.

2026-01-29T14:53:29.772006 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility.

**Good news - you should be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

1. ✓ You are responsible for a child (Simon) who is under 16
2. ✓ You live in the UK
3. ✓ Simon normally lived with you before being detained
4. ✓ You are continuing to contribute to his costs and maintaining his home for his return

**Important point about children in hospital or care:**

When a child is detained under the Mental Health Act or is in similar care arrangements, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **12 weeks** (84 days) from when they went into the secure unit, as long as you continue to contribute to the cost of supporting them - which you are doing.

Since Simon has been in the secure psychiatric unit for about 10 weeks, you are still within this 12-week period and should be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit.

**What happens after 12 weeks?**

After the 12-week period, your entitlement may stop unless Simon returns home or there are other circumstances that apply. You should inform Child Benefit if his situation changes.

Would you like any clarification on this assessment or do you have any other questions?

2026-01-29T14:53:33.898460 [actor]: Thank you so much for explaining all of that. That's really helpful to know, especially about the 12-week period. I'll make sure to keep track of the time and contact Child Benefit if anything changes with Simon's situation.

2026-01-29T14:53:36.385843 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that I am eligible for Child Benefit until the 12-week period ends, correctly applied the rules for children detained under the Mental Health Act, and properly noted that eligibility continues while I contribute to Simon's costs and maintain his home during the first 12 weeks of detention.
