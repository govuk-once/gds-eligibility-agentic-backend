2026-01-29T15:00:08.226220 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T15:00:09.867691 [actor]: Yes, I do. My daughter Fiona is 16 and she's just left school. She's now on the No One Left Behind programme here in Edinburgh.

2026-01-29T15:00:11.999814 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. The No One Left Behind programme is relevant here.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you responsible for Fiona? This means - do you live with her and are you the main person looking after her day-to-day?**

2026-01-29T15:00:14.355877 [actor]: Yes, I am. She lives with me and I look after her day-to-day.

2026-01-29T15:00:16.433293 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year? This is important because it affects whether you need to pay a High Income Child Benefit Charge.**

2026-01-29T15:00:17.940721 [actor]: No, neither of us earns over £60,000 a year.

2026-01-29T15:00:19.687254 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me ask you:

**Do you usually live in the UK? And is Fiona also usually living in the UK with you?**

2026-01-29T15:00:21.373020 [actor]: Yes, we both live in Edinburgh. We're both here in the UK.

2026-01-29T15:00:23.119826 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question:

**Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for Fiona? For example, her other parent or another family member?**

2026-01-29T15:00:25.036787 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for her.

2026-01-29T15:00:29.375559 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Fiona. Here's why:

✓ Fiona is 16 and in approved education or training (the No One Left Behind programme)
✓ You are responsible for her and she lives with you
✓ You both usually live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ Neither you nor your partner earns over £60,000, so you won't need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge

**Important note about Fiona's education/training:** Child Benefit can continue until a young person turns 20 if they're in approved education or training. You'll need to notify Child Benefit when Fiona finishes the No One Left Behind programme or turns 20, whichever comes first.

You can apply for Child Benefit online or by post. Would you like to know anything else about your eligibility or the application process?

2026-01-29T15:00:31.444470 [actor]: That's brilliant, thank you so much! That's really helpful to know. I'll get the application sorted out then.

2026-01-29T15:00:35.796781 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on all the relevant criteria: the child is 16 and in approved education/training (No One Left Behind programme), the parent is responsible for the child, they both live in the UK, no one else is claiming, and income is below £60,000.
