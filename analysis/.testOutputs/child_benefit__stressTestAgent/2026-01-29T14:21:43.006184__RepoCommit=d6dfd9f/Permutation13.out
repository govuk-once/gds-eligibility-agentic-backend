2026-01-29T14:32:47.131771 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T14:32:49.463207 [actor]: Yes, I do. We have a little girl, Maya, who's 4 years old. She's been placed with us by the adoption agency and is now living in our home. The adoption isn't finalized yet though - we're still waiting for the court to grant the final adoption order. Does that matter for Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T14:32:52.479470 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know about Maya's situation.

To clarify - since Maya has been placed with you by the adoption agency and is living in your home, you may be eligible even before the final adoption order is granted.

Let me ask you: Are you responsible for Maya? That is, are you the person who is mainly looking after her and meeting the costs of raising her (such as food, clothing, and other daily expenses)?

2026-01-29T14:32:54.604797 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. My partner and I are completely responsible for Maya. She lives with us full-time, and we take care of all her needs - her food, clothing, everything she needs day-to-day. We're the ones looking after her and paying for everything she requires.

2026-01-29T14:32:56.773167 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It sounds like you are taking full responsibility for Maya's care.

Now, let me ask you about your residency status: Do you currently live in the UK?

2026-01-29T14:32:58.411265 [actor]: Yes, we live in the UK. We're both UK residents.

2026-01-29T14:33:00.465197 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: Is Maya living with you in your home in the UK, or is she living anywhere else (such as in hospital or in care)?

2026-01-29T14:33:02.381265 [actor]: No, Maya is living with us in our home here in the UK. She moved in with us when the adoption agency placed her with us, and she's been here with us ever since.

2026-01-29T14:33:06.570365 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you should be eligible for Child Benefit** for Maya. Here's why:

✓ Maya is under 16 years old (she's 4)
✓ You are responsible for her - you're looking after her and paying for her upbringing
✓ She lives with you in your home in the UK
✓ You live in the UK

Importantly, for adoption cases, you can claim Child Benefit from when a child is **placed with you for adoption**, even before the final adoption order is granted by the court. So the fact that you're still waiting for the court to finalize the adoption doesn't prevent you from claiming.

Since Maya has been placed with you by the adoption agency and is living in your home, you meet the eligibility criteria and should be able to claim Child Benefit for her.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-29T14:33:10.922770 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you! I'm so relieved to hear that we don't have to wait for the final adoption order. That makes things much easier for us. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything clearly.

2026-01-29T14:33:13.568475 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit when a child is placed with them for adoption, even before the final adoption order is granted, and correctly applied all eligibility criteria (child under 16, responsible for the child, child living with them in the UK, and UK residency).
