2026-01-29T14:36:05.817119 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T14:36:07.604878 [actor]: Yes, I do. I've got a daughter, Holly - she's 9 years old.

2026-01-29T14:36:09.535765 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Holly live with you, or does she live with someone else?

2026-01-29T14:36:11.652393 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated actually. I'm separated from my ex, Sue, and Holly splits her time between us. She stays with me 3 days a week and with Sue 4 days a week.

2026-01-29T14:36:14.580291 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. In situations where a child splits their time between two parents, Child Benefit can only be paid to one person.

Let me ask: Have you and Sue come to an agreement about which of you will claim the Child Benefit? Or is Sue already claiming it?

2026-01-29T14:36:17.242788 [actor]: No, we haven't agreed on who should claim it. We both think we should get it since we both look after Holly and buy her clothes and food. Actually, we've both submitted claims to HMRC because we couldn't agree.

2026-01-29T14:36:19.878972 [root_agent]: I understand this is a challenging situation. When both parents submit claims and can't agree, HMRC has to make a decision about who should receive the Child Benefit.

To help me understand your situation better, can you tell me: Are you responsible for Holly? By this I mean, do you provide for her needs such as food, clothing, and a place to live during the time she's with you?

2026-01-29T14:36:21.878426 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. When Holly's with me those 3 days a week, I provide everything she needs - I buy her food, clothes, and she has her own room at my place. I'm fully responsible for her when she's staying with me.

2026-01-29T14:36:25.269226 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like you are responsible for Holly when she's with you.

In cases where both parents are responsible for a child and both have submitted claims, HMRC will decide who receives the Child Benefit. According to the guidance, when parents can't agree and both have claimed, HMRC will generally pay the person who has **main responsibility** for the child.

Let me ask: Between you and Sue, who would you say has the main day-to-day responsibility for Holly? For example, who makes most of the decisions about her care, who does she spend most nights with, or who organizes most of her routine activities?

2026-01-29T14:36:27.928962 [actor]: Well, Holly spends more nights with Sue - 4 nights a week compared to my 3 nights. So I suppose Sue has her slightly more of the time. But I do my fair share when Holly's with me - I take care of everything she needs those days.

2026-01-29T14:36:32.308572 [root_agent]: Thank you for being honest about the arrangement. Based on what you've told me, let me explain the situation:

Since Holly spends more time with Sue (4 nights versus your 3 nights), and both of you have submitted claims, **HMRC will likely decide that Sue has main responsibility** and award the Child Benefit to her. This is because Sue has Holly for the majority of the week.

However, this doesn't diminish the care you provide during your time with Holly. It's simply that when two people both claim and HMRC has to make a decision, they typically award it to the person the child lives with most of the time.

Let me ask: If HMRC decides to pay Sue the Child Benefit, would you still want to pursue your claim, or would you accept that decision?

2026-01-29T14:36:34.751738 [actor]: I see. So you're saying that because Holly is with Sue 4 days a week compared to my 3 days, HMRC will likely award the Child Benefit to Sue since she has Holly most of the time?

2026-01-29T14:36:38.156541 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. Based on the information you've provided:

- Holly spends 4 nights a week with Sue and 3 nights with you
- You both provide for Holly when she's with you
- You've both submitted claims to HMRC

Since Sue has Holly for the majority of the time (more nights per week), **HMRC will likely determine that Sue has main responsibility for Holly and therefore award the Child Benefit to her.**

While you are clearly a responsible parent who cares for Holly during your time together, Child Benefit can only be paid to one person. When HMRC has to decide between two claimants, they generally pay the person with whom the child spends most of their time.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T14:36:41.615811 [actor]: No, that makes sense. Thanks for explaining how it works.

2026-01-29T14:36:44.124322 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that when both parents claim Child Benefit for a child who splits time between them, HMRC awards it to the parent with whom the child spends the most time, which in this case is Sue (4 nights vs 3 nights), making Pete ineligible as expected in the scenario.
