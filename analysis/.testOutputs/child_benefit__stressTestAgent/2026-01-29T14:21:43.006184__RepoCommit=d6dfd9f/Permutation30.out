2026-01-29T14:47:12.818649 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you are responsible for?

2026-01-29T14:47:14.507953 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have children that I'm responsible for and they're under 16.

2026-01-29T14:47:16.184944 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-29T14:47:17.671251 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T14:47:19.658796 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Are you the person who is primarily responsible for the child or children? In other words, are you the main person who looks after them day-to-day?

2026-01-29T14:47:21.329204 [actor]: Yes, I'm the one who primarily looks after them day-to-day.

2026-01-29T14:47:23.270364 [root_agent]: Thank you. Just a few more questions to assess your eligibility.

Does your child (or do any of your children) live with someone else, or are any of them in hospital or in care?

2026-01-29T14:47:24.759664 [actor]: No, they all live with me at home.

2026-01-29T14:47:27.815846 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for that information.

One final important question: Do you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year? (This is relevant because there's a High Income Child Benefit Charge that may apply, though it doesn't affect your eligibility to claim.)

2026-01-29T14:47:29.802845 [actor]: Well, I earn £18,000 a year myself, but my wife earns £65,000 a year.

2026-01-29T14:47:35.683160 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you are eligible to claim Child Benefit**. You meet all the key criteria:

✓ You have children under 16
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are the person primarily responsible for the children
✓ The children live with you

**However, there's an important thing you should be aware of:**

Since your wife earns £65,000 per year (which is over £50,000), the High Income Child Benefit Charge will apply. This means:

- You can still claim Child Benefit
- You'll receive the payments as normal
- But because your wife earns over £50,000, you (or your wife) will need to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the tax system

The charge is 1% of the Child Benefit amount for every £100 of income between £50,000 and £60,000. Since your wife earns over £60,000, you would need to pay back 100% of the Child Benefit received.

**You have two options:**

1. Claim Child Benefit and receive the payments, but pay it all back through your wife's Self Assessment tax return
2. Opt out of receiving the payments but still register for Child Benefit (this protects your child's National Insurance record)

Many people in this situation choose option 2 to avoid the administrative burden, but still register to protect their child's future State Pension entitlement.

Does this make sense, or do you have any questions?

2026-01-29T14:47:37.962085 [actor]: Yes, that makes sense. Just to be clear - you're saying my wife would be the one responsible for paying back the charge through her tax return, not me, even though I'd be the one claiming it? Is that right?

2026-01-29T14:47:42.262324 [root_agent]: That's an excellent question, and I want to make sure I give you accurate information here.

Actually, the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies to whichever partner has the **higher individual income** - which in your case is your wife with her £65,000 salary.

So yes, you're correct: even though you would be the one claiming Child Benefit, your wife would be the one responsible for paying back the charge through her Self Assessment tax return, because she's the higher earner.

This is an important distinction - it's based on individual income, not household income, and it's the responsibility of the partner earning over £50,000 (or the higher earner if both earn over that threshold).

Does that clarify things for you?

2026-01-29T14:47:44.794502 [actor]: Yes, that's very clear now. Thank you for explaining all of that to me. I understand that I'm eligible to claim, and that my wife would need to deal with paying it back through her tax return since she's the higher earner. I appreciate your help!

2026-01-29T14:47:48.814444 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user is eligible for Child Benefit, correctly identified that the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies due to the wife's £65,000 income, properly clarified that the wife (as the higher earner) would be responsible for paying back the charge through Self Assessment, and appropriately presented both claiming options.
