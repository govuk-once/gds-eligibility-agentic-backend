2026-01-29T14:46:33.581338 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T14:46:35.150146 [actor]: Yes, I have a 5-year-old son who lives with me.

2026-01-29T14:46:36.782666 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:46:38.436656 [actor]: Yes, I'm currently in the UK with my son. We've been here for a few months now.

2026-01-29T14:46:40.100585 [root_agent]: Thank you. I need to understand your residency status a bit better.

**Are you normally living in the UK, or are you just visiting temporarily?**

2026-01-29T14:46:41.977248 [actor]: I'm just visiting temporarily. I'm from the United States and I'm here on a tourist visa - a standard 6-month visitor visa. I brought my son with me.

2026-01-29T14:46:45.162553 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that **you are not eligible for Child Benefit**. 

Child Benefit is only available to people who are normally living in the UK. Since you're visiting temporarily on a tourist visa from the United States, you don't meet the residency requirement for Child Benefit.

The benefit is designed for people who have their permanent residence in the UK, not for temporary visitors, even if they have their children with them during their stay.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T14:46:47.280010 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but I understand. No, I think that's clear - since I'm just visiting on a tourist visa, I don't qualify. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T14:46:50.874660 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that a temporary visitor on a US tourist visa does not meet the UK residency requirement for Child Benefit, which requires the claimant to be "normally living in the UK."
