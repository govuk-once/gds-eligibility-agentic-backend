2026-01-29T14:37:21.827339 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:37:23.859731 [actor]: Yes, I have a child. My name is Robert and I'm recently divorced from my wife Tina. We have two children together - Sam who is 10 and Ella who is 8. Sam lives with me now after the divorce.

2026-01-29T14:37:25.906074 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Robert. I understand you have two children - Sam (10) who lives with you, and Ella (8).

**Does Ella live with you as well, or does she live with your ex-wife Tina?**

2026-01-29T14:37:27.791871 [actor]: Ella lives with Tina, my ex-wife. So Sam lives with me and Ella lives with her mum.

2026-01-29T14:37:30.894967 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Robert. So Sam lives with you and Ella lives with Tina.

**Are you the main person responsible for Sam - meaning you're the one who looks after Sam day-to-day and pays for things like food, clothes, and other essentials?**

2026-01-29T14:37:32.658338 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm the main person responsible for Sam. I look after him day-to-day and pay for all his food, clothes, and everything else he needs.

2026-01-29T14:37:34.833216 [root_agent]: Thank you, Robert. That's helpful to know.

**Do you currently live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:37:36.227654 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T14:37:38.170121 [root_agent]: Great, thank you Robert.

**Are you or Sam currently subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on your right to reside in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:37:40.136069 [actor]: No, we don't have any immigration restrictions. We're both UK residents with no restrictions on our right to live here.

2026-01-29T14:37:42.217172 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

**Is Sam currently in hospital for more than 12 weeks, or in local authority care, or in any kind of detention (such as a young offender institution)?**

2026-01-29T14:37:43.912367 [actor]: No, Sam isn't in hospital, care, or detention. He lives at home with me full-time.

2026-01-29T14:37:48.632689 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Robert.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Sam**. Here's why:

✓ Sam is under 16 years old
✓ Sam lives with you
✓ You are the main person responsible for Sam
✓ You live in the UK with no immigration restrictions
✓ Sam is not in hospital long-term, care, or detention

You can claim Child Benefit for Sam as you are his primary carer.

**Regarding Ella:** Since Ella lives with your ex-wife Tina, Tina would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ella (assuming she is Ella's main carer).

**One important final question: Are you currently in a couple with someone else (married, in a civil partnership, or living with a partner), and if so, does either you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

This doesn't affect your eligibility to claim, but it may affect whether you need to pay a tax charge on the Child Benefit.

2026-01-29T14:37:50.401331 [actor]: No, I'm not in a couple with anyone else. It's just me and Sam at home. My income is under £50,000.

2026-01-29T14:37:53.724722 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you Robert.

**Based on all the information you've provided, you are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam.**

Here's a summary:
- ✓ Sam is 10 years old (under 16)
- ✓ Sam lives with you and you're his main carer
- ✓ You live in the UK with no immigration restrictions
- ✓ Sam is not in hospital, care, or detention
- ✓ Your income is under £50,000, so you won't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge

You can go ahead and apply for Child Benefit. Since your income is under £50,000, you'll receive the full benefit without any tax charge.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?**

2026-01-29T14:37:55.625891 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T14:37:59.626493 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Robert is eligible for Child Benefit for Sam (who lives with him) and correctly noted that Tina would claim for Ella (who lives with her), which aligns with the expected outcome that both parents receive benefits for their respective children.
