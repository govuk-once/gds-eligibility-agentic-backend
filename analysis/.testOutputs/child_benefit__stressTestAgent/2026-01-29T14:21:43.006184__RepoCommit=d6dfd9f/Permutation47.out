2026-01-29T14:58:13.516048 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:58:15.434819 [actor]: Yes, I have a child, but I don't live with them. I pay £50 a week for their maintenance, but that's only because a Court Order says I have to. I don't think I should be eligible because it's not voluntary - I'm being forced to pay it.

2026-01-29T14:58:17.358434 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to understand your situation better.

**Does your child live with their other parent or with someone else who is responsible for them?**

2026-01-29T14:58:18.699691 [actor]: Yes, my child lives with their other parent.

2026-01-29T14:58:21.606476 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, if your child lives with their other parent, then **the other parent would typically be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit**, as they are the person the child lives with.

However, I need to ask one more question to be thorough: **Are you and the other parent making a joint claim for Child Benefit, or has the other parent already claimed it?**

(Just to note: Generally, only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child, and it's usually the person the child lives with.)

2026-01-29T14:58:23.978863 [actor]: No, we're not making a joint claim. I don't know if the other parent has claimed it or not. But I'm asking because I thought maybe I could claim it since I'm paying for the child's maintenance - even though it's because of the court order, not because I chose to.

2026-01-29T14:58:27.625608 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation clearly.

Based on the Child Benefit eligibility rules, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation**. Here's why:

To be eligible for Child Benefit, you generally need to be responsible for the child **and** the child needs to live with you. Since your child lives with their other parent, the other parent is the person who would be eligible to claim.

The fact that you pay maintenance (even though it's through a court order) doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit is based on who the child lives with and who has day-to-day responsibility for them, not on who provides financial support.

**The other parent should be the one claiming Child Benefit**, as they are the person your child lives with.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T14:58:30.512417 [actor]: Oh, I see. So it doesn't matter that I'm contributing financially - it's really about who the child lives with and has day-to-day care of them. That makes sense, I suppose. No, I think that answers my question. Thank you for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T14:58:32.764956 [actor]: The agent has now provided me with a clear eligibility outcome - that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because the child doesn't live with me, and eligibility is based on who the child lives with rather than who provides financial support. The conversation has reached its natural conclusion.

2026-01-29T14:58:35.292678 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, a person who contributes at least the Child Benefit rate toward a child's upkeep CAN claim Child Benefit even if the child doesn't live with them, and the agent failed to explore this option or verify the maintenance amount against the Child Benefit threshold.
