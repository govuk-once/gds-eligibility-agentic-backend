2026-01-29T14:57:22.508403 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T14:57:24.232615 [actor]: Yes, I do have a child under 16.

2026-01-29T14:57:27.154548 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Are you responsible for the child?** This means you live with them and are looking after them, or you're contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent) towards their upkeep.

2026-01-29T14:57:28.700512 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for my child. I live with them and look after them.

2026-01-29T14:57:30.483026 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that.

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:57:32.002853 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T14:57:34.325221 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you.

**Are you the only person responsible for the child, or does someone else also live with and care for the child (such as another parent or partner)?**

This helps me understand if there might be anyone else who could also claim Child Benefit for the same child.

2026-01-29T14:57:35.877310 [actor]: I'm the only person responsible for my child.

2026-01-29T14:57:38.059664 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Is your child currently living with you at home, or are they in any of the following situations:**
- In hospital for more than 12 weeks
- In local authority care
- In custody or detention

2026-01-29T14:57:39.558176 [actor]: My child is living with me at home.

2026-01-29T14:57:42.636983 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for answering all those questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

✓ You have a child under 16
✓ You are responsible for the child (you live with them and look after them)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are the only person responsible for the child
✓ Your child lives with you at home

You meet the main eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. You should be able to make a claim.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, or do you have any other circumstances you'd like me to consider?**

2026-01-29T14:57:44.869884 [actor]: Well, actually there is something else. I have Pre-Settled Status, and I've been unemployed for about 95 days now. I've been looking for work but claiming as a jobseeker. Does that affect my eligibility?

2026-01-29T14:57:48.071058 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that additional information - this is important to consider.

Let me ask you a clarifying question about your immigration status:

**Before you became unemployed, were you working in the UK? And if so, for how long were you working before becoming unemployed?**

This is relevant because there are specific rules about how long people with Pre-Settled Status can claim benefits while unemployed and still maintain their eligibility for Child Benefit.

2026-01-29T14:57:49.864114 [actor]: I was working before, but I've been unemployed and looking for work for 95 days now. I don't have a job offer at the moment.

2026-01-29T14:57:53.468395 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is an important detail that affects your eligibility.

Let me ask you this:

**How long were you working in the UK before you became unemployed?** 

I need to understand the duration of your previous employment because there are specific time limits that apply to people with Pre-Settled Status who are claiming as jobseekers. Generally, if you've been unemployed and job-seeking for more than 91 days (around 3 months), this can affect your eligibility for benefits including Child Benefit.

Since you mentioned you've been unemployed for about 95 days, this may impact your eligibility, but I need to understand your work history better to give you accurate guidance.

2026-01-29T14:57:54.972064 [actor]: I was working for about a year before I became unemployed. So I've now been out of work for 95 days looking for a job.

2026-01-29T14:58:00.386158 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you of an important eligibility issue:

**Your Pre-Settled Status combined with being unemployed for 95 days may affect your Child Benefit eligibility.**

Under UK immigration and benefit rules, people with Pre-Settled Status who are claiming as jobseekers generally have a time limit of **91 days (approximately 3 months)** to find work. After this period, they may lose their right to reside for benefit purposes, which would make them ineligible for Child Benefit.

Since you've been unemployed for 95 days - which is **beyond the 91-day limit** - this suggests you may currently **not be eligible** for Child Benefit, even though you meet all the other criteria regarding having a child and being responsible for them.

**Have you received any official communication or decision about your right to reside or benefit eligibility since passing the 91-day mark? Or do you have any job offers or other circumstances that might be relevant?**

2026-01-29T14:58:02.103564 [actor]: No, I don't have any job offers or anything like that. I'm just continuing to look for work but haven't had any luck yet.

2026-01-29T14:58:06.456371 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on all the information you've provided, I need to give you this assessment:

**You are likely NOT currently eligible for Child Benefit** because:

While you meet the basic criteria:
✓ You have a child under 16
✓ You are responsible for the child
✓ The child lives with you
✓ You live in the UK

There is a significant issue with your immigration status and benefit eligibility:
✗ You have Pre-Settled Status and have been unemployed as a jobseeker for 95 days, which exceeds the 91-day limit. This means you may no longer have a qualifying right to reside for benefit purposes, which is required for Child Benefit eligibility.

**What I recommend:**

You should seek advice about your specific situation from a benefits advisor or immigration specialist, as this is a complex area and there may be other factors that could affect your eligibility that we haven't discussed.

**Is there anything else you'd like to ask me about this assessment?**

2026-01-29T14:58:11.726974 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user exceeds the 91-day jobseeker limit (at 95 days) for Pre-Settled Status holders and correctly concluded they are not eligible for Child Benefit due to loss of qualifying right to reside for benefit purposes.
