2026-01-29T14:58:37.242573 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:58:39.344961 [actor]: Yes, I do. My daughter Emily is 18 and she's just started a Higher National Certificate course at the local college.

2026-01-29T14:58:41.777543 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Is Emily enrolled in approved full-time education or training that is not higher education?**

In other words, is her Higher National Certificate (HNC) course classified as further education rather than higher education, and is she studying full-time?

2026-01-29T14:58:43.706948 [actor]: She's studying full-time, yes. But I'm not sure about the classification - it's a BTEC Higher National Certificate at level 4. Is that considered further education or higher education?

2026-01-29T14:58:48.352555 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me think about this carefully.

A Higher National Certificate (HNC) at level 4 is actually classified as **higher education**, not further education. HNCs and HNDs are qualifications that fall under the higher education category, similar to university degrees.

This is an important distinction for Child Benefit purposes, as Child Benefit generally stops when a young person either:
- Turns 20 (if they're in approved education or training)
- Leaves approved education or training
- Starts a course of higher education

Since Emily is 18 and has started a higher education course (the HNC), this affects eligibility.

Let me ask: **When did Emily turn 18, and when exactly did she start her HNC course?** 

This timing is important because Child Benefit can continue until the end of the week that includes the relevant date (either her 20th birthday or when she started higher education, whichever comes first).

2026-01-29T14:58:50.290834 [actor]: She turned 18 in July, and she started the HNC course in September, just a few weeks ago.

2026-01-29T14:58:54.520603 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details. Let me consider this carefully.

Since Emily started her Higher National Certificate (HNC) course in September, and HNCs are classified as higher education, your Child Benefit entitlement would have ended on the 31st August (the last day of August, which is the end of the terminal education period after she left any approved further education).

However, I need to understand her situation more fully to give you accurate guidance.

**Before starting the HNC in September, was Emily enrolled in any approved education or training between when she turned 18 in July and when she started the HNC course?** 

For example, was she still attending school or college doing A-levels, or any other approved further education course that ended in the summer?

2026-01-29T14:58:56.479212 [actor]: Yes, she finished her A-Levels in June. She'd been doing those at sixth form.

2026-01-29T14:59:01.605429 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's very helpful information.

So to clarify the timeline:
- Emily turned 18 in July
- She finished her A-Levels in June (approved further education)
- She started her HNC (higher education) in September

Based on the rules, Child Benefit continues while a young person aged 16-19 is in approved education or training. A-Levels count as approved education. However, Child Benefit stops when they start higher education.

There's a terminal education period that applies - Child Benefit continues until the end of the week that includes the 31st August following the young person leaving approved education (in Emily's case, finishing her A-Levels).

So your Child Benefit would have continued through the summer and stopped at the end of August, even though Emily started her HNC in September.

Now, to complete the eligibility assessment, I need to ask: **Do you live with Emily, and are you responsible for her care?** (Or if she lives elsewhere, do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards her upkeep?)

2026-01-29T14:59:03.514721 [actor]: Yes, she lives with me and I'm responsible for her care. She's still at home while she does her college course.

2026-01-29T14:59:08.466829 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on all the information you've provided, here's the situation:

**You were eligible for Child Benefit for Emily while she was doing her A-Levels and through the summer after she finished them.** Your entitlement would have ended on **31st August** (or the end of the week containing 31st August, depending on when your payment week ends).

Once Emily started her Higher National Certificate course in September, which is classified as higher education, you are **no longer eligible for Child Benefit** for her, even though she's only 18 and still living at home.

The key rule is that Child Benefit stops when a young person starts higher education, regardless of their age (as long as they're under 20).

If you've been receiving Child Benefit payments after August, you should contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them of Emily's situation and stop the payments to avoid potential overpayment issues.

Do you have any other questions about your Child Benefit eligibility, or is there anything else I can help clarify?

2026-01-29T14:59:14.355408 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit eligibility ends when a young person starts higher education (the HNC is correctly classified as higher education at level 4), and properly applied the terminal education rule that extends benefit until 31st August following completion of approved further education (A-Levels).
