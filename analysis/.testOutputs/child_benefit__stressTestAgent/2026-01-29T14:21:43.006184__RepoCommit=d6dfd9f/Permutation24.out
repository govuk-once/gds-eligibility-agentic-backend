2026-01-29T14:40:09.860678 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T14:40:11.626276 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Tom, who's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T14:40:13.102400 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now, does Tom live with you, or is he living with someone else?

2026-01-29T14:40:15.151733 [actor]: Well, he's been living at a residential school for the past 10 weeks. The local council pays for it because he has severe behavioral needs.

2026-01-29T14:40:17.193807 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. That's an important detail.

To help me assess your eligibility correctly, I need to ask: Does Tom come home to live with you during school holidays, or does he stay at the residential school full-time without returning home?

2026-01-29T14:40:19.122762 [actor]: He comes home during the school holidays. He's only there during term time.

2026-01-29T14:40:21.334856 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Since Tom returns home during school holidays, that's a key piece of information.

Now, let me ask: Are you responsible for Tom? By this I mean, do you have parental responsibility for him and are you the main person looking after him when he's at home?

2026-01-29T14:40:22.919313 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm his mum and I'm responsible for him. I look after him when he's home during the holidays.

2026-01-29T14:40:24.801489 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: Do you or your partner (if you have one) currently live in the UK?

2026-01-29T14:40:26.144703 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T14:40:28.325253 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more question: Are you or your partner getting any payments or financial support from your local council specifically to look after Tom?

2026-01-29T14:44:21.530027 [actor]: No, I'm not getting any payments from the council. They pay the residential school directly for his placement, but I don't receive any money for looking after him.

2026-01-29T14:44:26.573623 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you should be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

✓ Tom is 14 years old (under 16)
✓ You are his parent and have parental responsibility for him
✓ Tom lives with you during school holidays and only stays at the residential school during term time
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You're not receiving payments from the local council to look after him (the council pays the school directly, which is different)

**Important point about children in care or residential schools:**
When a child is in local authority care or at a residential school paid for by the council, Child Benefit can usually only be paid if the child regularly comes home to live with you - which Tom does during the holidays. Since he returns home during school holidays, you should be eligible to claim.

You can apply for Child Benefit if you haven't already done so. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-29T14:44:30.732172 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you. I'm glad to hear I should still be eligible since he comes home for the holidays. I'll look into applying for it.

2026-01-29T14:44:33.886408 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital or care, when a child is in local authority care (which includes residential schools paid for by the council), Child Benefit can only be paid for the first 12 weeks. Since Tom has been at the residential school for 10 weeks, the mother is currently eligible but this eligibility will end at week 12. The agent failed to mention this crucial 12-week time limit and instead suggested ongoing eligibility as long as the child returns home for holidays, which is incorrect information.
