2026-01-28T23:44:24.474356 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T23:44:26.446981 [actor]: child not living with me pay 50 quid week but court made me do it so dont think i can get it

2026-01-28T23:44:28.546808 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It sounds like you have a child who doesn't live with you, and you're paying £50 per week through a court order.

Let me ask you this: **Who does the child live with most of the time - is it the other parent or another person?**

2026-01-28T23:44:30.177272 [actor]: other parent has the kid

2026-01-28T23:44:31.875870 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So the child lives with the other parent.

Let me ask you: **Is the other parent claiming Child Benefit for this child, or do you know if anyone else is claiming it?**

2026-01-28T23:44:33.367088 [actor]: dunno if they claiming it or not just know i pay the money

2026-01-28T23:44:35.581031 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you an important question:

**Do you contribute at least the same amount (or more) towards the child's upkeep as the person the child lives with?**

In other words, when you add up everything you provide for the child (including that £50 per week you're paying), does it equal or exceed what the other parent spends on the child?

2026-01-28T23:44:37.163688 [actor]: just the 50 week thats it nothing else court order made me

2026-01-28T23:44:40.993370 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Based on the information you've provided, let me explain your eligibility:

**You are not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.**

Here's why:

- Child Benefit is normally paid to the person the child lives with
- If a child doesn't live with you, you can only claim Child Benefit if you contribute **at least as much** towards the child's upkeep as the person they live with
- Since you're only paying £50 per week through a court order and nothing else, this is unlikely to equal what the parent the child lives with is spending on day-to-day costs (housing, food, clothing, etc.)

The other parent (who the child lives with) would typically be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit for this child, assuming they meet the other eligibility criteria.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T23:44:46.255290 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because they only contribute £50 per week via court order while the child lives with the other parent, and this amount is unlikely to equal or exceed what the resident parent spends on the child's upkeep, which is the requirement for non-resident parents to claim Child Benefit.
