**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Responsibility criterion met**: The user has legally adopted two children (ages 6 and 8) who live with them, and they provide day-to-day care (feeding, school runs, etc.)

2. **Age criterion met**: Both children are under 16 years old

3. **Residence criterion met**: The user lives in the UK

4. **Critical distinction regarding adoption allowance**: The agent correctly identified that receiving an adoption allowance does NOT disqualify the user from Child Benefit. This is a crucial point that distinguishes adoption allowances from fostering allowances. According to the eligibility rules, fostering allowances typically cover full maintenance and would disqualify someone, but adoption allowances are different and can be received alongside Child Benefit.

The agent's final determination explicitly states "You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provides clear reasoning. This matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** as specified in the scenario. The evaluation judge also confirmed this with a ✓ marking, noting the agent "correctly determined my eligibility."
