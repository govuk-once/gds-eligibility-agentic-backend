2026-01-28T23:33:08.196057 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T23:33:09.907090 [actor]: child benefit eligbility 5 year old son

2026-01-28T23:33:11.913421 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 5-year-old son.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Does your son normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit to his upkeep?

2026-01-28T23:33:13.400693 [actor]: visiting uk with son tourist visa 6 months

2026-01-28T23:33:15.144555 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. This is an important detail for Child Benefit eligibility.

Are you or your son normally resident in the UK, or are you just visiting temporarily on a tourist visa?

2026-01-28T23:33:16.699965 [actor]: us citizen here on tourist visa son is with me

2026-01-28T23:33:18.769700 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask an important question:

Do you or your son have any other immigration status in the UK beyond the tourist visa, such as settled status, pre-settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or refugee status?

2026-01-28T23:33:20.213495 [actor]: no just tourist visa 6 month standard visitor

2026-01-28T23:33:23.456194 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that you would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit in your current circumstances.

The main reason is that Child Benefit eligibility requires you to be ordinarily resident in the UK. As a US citizen visiting on a standard 6-month tourist visa, you are not considered ordinarily resident - you are a temporary visitor.

Child Benefit is designed for people who are habitually and normally living in the UK, not for those visiting temporarily. Your tourist visa status indicates you're here for a temporary stay rather than living here on a settled basis.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T23:33:25.151337 [actor]: ok understand not eligble thanks

2026-01-28T23:33:28.364733 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that a US citizen on a 6-month standard tourist visa is not ordinarily resident in the UK and therefore not eligible for Child Benefit, which requires ordinary residence in the UK.
