**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit**, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

The agent properly identified and applied the hospital stay exception rule. Specifically:

1. The agent recognized that normally Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks of hospitalization
2. The agent correctly identified the exception: when a parent continues to spend at least the Child Benefit amount on the child's upkeep while in hospital, eligibility continues beyond 12 weeks
3. The agent verified that Mary spends £30 weekly (exceeding the £25.60 Child Benefit rate for the eldest child)
4. The agent confirmed all other eligibility criteria were met (parental responsibility, child's age, UK residence, no duplicate claims)
5. The agent clearly communicated "Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Chloe" and explained why the exception applies

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome perfectly. This is a case where the standard 12-week hospital rule would normally result in ineligibility, but the exception for regular parental spending on the child's upkeep allows continued eligibility - which the agent correctly identified and communicated.
