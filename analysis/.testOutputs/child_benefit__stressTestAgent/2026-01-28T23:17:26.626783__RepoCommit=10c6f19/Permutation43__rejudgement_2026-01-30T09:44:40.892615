**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

**Key Issue: Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland**

According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), while Child Benefit can continue for 16-19 year olds in "approved education or training," apprenticeships are specifically treated differently across the UK nations.

The critical distinction is:
- **Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland** (and apprenticeships in England and Northern Ireland) are **employment-based training programs** and do NOT qualify for Child Benefit extension
- This is explicitly stated in the scenario context: "The guidance notes that in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, you generally cannot get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship"

The agent failed to recognize that a "Modern Apprenticeship" in Scotland, regardless of whether it was described as "unpaid," is an apprenticeship program that falls outside approved education/training for Child Benefit purposes.

**The agent should have communicated that the user was NOT eligible** because their 17-year-old child is doing a Modern Apprenticeship, which does not qualify as approved training under Child Benefit rules in Scotland.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, noting that Modern Apprenticeships are employment-based training programs that don't meet the criteria for Child Benefit extension beyond age 16.
