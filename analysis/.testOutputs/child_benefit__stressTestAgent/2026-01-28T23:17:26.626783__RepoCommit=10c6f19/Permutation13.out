2026-01-28T23:24:42.143405 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T23:24:43.868809 [actor]: child living with us now adoption agency put her with us

2026-01-28T23:24:46.779519 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child living with you who was placed by an adoption agency.

To continue assessing your eligibility, let me ask: **Is the child formally in your care, meaning have you legally adopted them, or are you in the process of adopting them (such as being approved foster-to-adopt carers or having the child placed with you pending adoption)?**

2026-01-28T23:24:48.421594 [actor]: adoption agnecy placed her with us shes 4 havent got final order yet from court

2026-01-28T23:24:50.611869 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you have a 4-year-old child placed with you by an adoption agency, and you're waiting for the final adoption order from court.

Next question: **Are you responsible for the child? This means - are you the person who the child normally lives with and are you responsible for their day-to-day care?**

2026-01-28T23:24:52.156940 [actor]: yes she lives here with us me and my partner we look after her

2026-01-28T23:24:54.204939 [root_agent]: Excellent. So the child lives with you and your partner, and you look after her day-to-day.

Next question: **Do you normally live in the UK? By this I mean, is the UK where you usually reside?**

2026-01-28T23:24:55.543239 [actor]: yes we live in uk

2026-01-28T23:24:57.616075 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Just a few more questions to complete the assessment.

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for this same child?** For example, the child's birth parents or anyone else?

2026-01-28T23:24:58.941570 [actor]: no one else claiming for her

2026-01-28T23:25:00.986505 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

One final question: **Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, meaning do either of you have restrictions on your visa or immigration status that would prevent you from claiming public funds?**

2026-01-28T23:25:02.127259 [actor]: no we dont have any immigration restrictions

2026-01-28T23:25:05.550697 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all those questions. Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:
- You have a 4-year-old child (under 16) living with you
- The child was placed with you by an adoption agency and you're awaiting the final adoption order
- You are responsible for the child's day-to-day care
- You normally live in the UK
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child
- You don't have immigration restrictions preventing you from claiming public funds

**You can claim Child Benefit even though the adoption isn't finalized yet**, as long as the child is living with you and you're responsible for them, which you are.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit now. The application process involves filling out a claim form with details about yourself and the child.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-28T23:25:10.887019 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a person with a child placed by an adoption agency (pending final adoption order) who lives in the UK, is responsible for the child's care, has no one else claiming for the child, and has no immigration restrictions, is eligible for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible."
