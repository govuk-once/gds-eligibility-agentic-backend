2026-01-28T23:24:10.938712 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:24:12.236191 [actor]: child benefit liam 18 alevels universal credit

2026-01-28T23:24:15.112369 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I can see that Liam is 18 and doing A-levels, which is good - that could qualify as approved education.

Let me ask you this:

**Is Liam still in full-time, non-advanced education or approved training?** (A-levels would typically count as non-advanced education, but I need to confirm he's still enrolled and attending.)

2026-01-28T23:24:16.779577 [actor]: yes liam studying alevels fulltime

2026-01-28T23:24:19.348908 [root_agent]: That's great - Liam studying A-levels full-time should qualify as approved education.

Now let me ask:

**Are you responsible for Liam? This means, do you live with him and either pay for things like food, clothes, or housing for him, OR does he live with you for more than his other parent (if applicable)?**

2026-01-28T23:24:21.112145 [actor]: yes he lives with me im jessica his mum

2026-01-28T23:24:23.486280 [root_agent]: Thank you, Jessica. That's helpful information.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you or your partner getting certain means-tested benefits like Universal Credit, Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, or income-related Employment and Support Allowance?**

(I noticed you mentioned Universal Credit in your initial message - could you confirm if you're currently receiving Universal Credit?)

2026-01-28T23:24:24.807186 [actor]: no liam gets universal credit not me

2026-01-28T23:24:27.051552 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Jessica.

Let me ask you:

**Do you (or your partner, if you have one) earn more than £60,000 per year, or does either of you have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

2026-01-28T23:24:28.637244 [actor]: no i dont earn that much

2026-01-28T23:24:30.135868 [root_agent]: Thank you, Jessica.

One more important question:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T23:24:31.390393 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T23:24:35.099227 [root_agent]: Excellent, Jessica. Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

**Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit!**

Here's why:
- ✓ You have a child (Liam, age 18) who is in full-time, non-advanced education (A-levels)
- ✓ You are responsible for him - he lives with you
- ✓ You live in the UK
- ✓ Your income is below £50,000, so you wouldn't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge

**You can claim Child Benefit for Liam until:**
- He turns 20, OR
- He leaves full-time, non-advanced education or approved training (whichever comes first)

The fact that Liam receives Universal Credit himself doesn't affect your eligibility for Child Benefit - these are separate benefits.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-28T23:24:37.781479 [actor]: ok thanks

2026-01-28T23:24:40.193808 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated I was eligible for Child Benefit when a child (Liam, 18) is receiving Universal Credit. According to gov.uk guidance, if a young person aged 16-19 is receiving certain benefits including Universal Credit in their own right, they are not counted as a qualifying young person for Child Benefit purposes, making the claimant ineligible.
