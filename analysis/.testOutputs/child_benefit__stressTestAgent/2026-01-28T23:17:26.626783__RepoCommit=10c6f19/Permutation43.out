2026-01-28T23:41:58.533885 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this, I need to ask you a few questions.

Let me start with the first one:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T23:42:00.401571 [actor]: child in scottland aprentice 17 yrs

2026-01-28T23:42:04.269753 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old child in Scotland who is doing an apprenticeship.

To determine eligibility, I need to understand more about their education or training status:

**Is your 17-year-old's apprenticeship an approved course of education or training? This would typically include things like:**
- **Full-time non-advanced education (such as studying for A levels, Scottish Highers, or equivalent qualifications)**
- **Approved training programs or apprenticeships that are unpaid or where they earn less than a certain amount per week**

Can you tell me more about what type of apprenticeship they're doing?

2026-01-28T23:42:05.570912 [actor]: modern apprenticship glasgow unpaid

2026-01-28T23:42:08.225435 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. A modern apprenticeship in Glasgow that is unpaid sounds like it could qualify as approved training.

Now I need to ask about your relationship with the child:

**Are you responsible for the child? This means, do you live with them and are you responsible for their care, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards their upkeep if they don't live with you?**

2026-01-28T23:42:09.458767 [actor]: live with me father responsible

2026-01-28T23:42:11.358668 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you live with your 17-year-old child and you're their father who is responsible for them.

Now I need to understand your residency status:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T23:42:12.745839 [actor]: yes glasgow scotland

2026-01-28T23:42:14.872008 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you. So you live in Glasgow, Scotland with your 17-year-old child who is doing an unpaid modern apprenticeship, and you're responsible for them.

One more important question:

**Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for this child?**

(Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child at any one time.)

2026-01-28T23:42:16.097901 [actor]: no one else claiming

2026-01-28T23:42:19.327601 [root_agent]: Excellent! Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:
- You have a 17-year-old child (under 20)
- They're doing an unpaid modern apprenticeship, which qualifies as approved training
- You live with them in the UK (Glasgow, Scotland) and are responsible for them
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child

**You meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.**

You can now proceed to make a claim. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the claiming process?

2026-01-28T23:42:22.119288 [actor]: thank you eligibilty confirmed

2026-01-28T23:42:24.853921 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds only applies to those in approved full-time non-advanced education or certain training programs, but paid apprenticeships (including Modern Apprenticeships which typically involve employment) do not qualify - even if described as "unpaid," Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland are employment-based training programs that fall outside the approved education/training criteria for Child Benefit extension beyond age 16.
