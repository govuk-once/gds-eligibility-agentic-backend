2026-01-28T23:42:50.732205 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or young person who you're responsible for?**

(This includes children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)

2026-01-28T23:42:52.233891 [actor]: dughter 8 yrs hospital long time can i get mony

2026-01-28T23:42:54.622846 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have an 8-year-old daughter who has been in hospital for a long time, and you're wondering about Child Benefit.

Let me ask you an important question to assess your eligibility:

**Are you responsible for your daughter - meaning do you normally live with her and are you responsible for her care and upbringing?**

(You can still be considered responsible even while she's in hospital, as long as you were responsible for her before she went into hospital)

2026-01-28T23:42:56.312133 [actor]: yes visit every day hours and hours she my daughter

2026-01-28T23:42:58.519413 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's clear you're very dedicated to your daughter's care.

Let me ask you the next question:

**How long has your daughter been in hospital - has it been more than 12 weeks (84 days) continuously?**

2026-01-28T23:43:00.131264 [actor]: 14 weeks now been ther 14 weeks

2026-01-28T23:43:02.670800 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks now.

Let me ask you an important question:

**Is the hospital or local authority paying toward the cost of your daughter's hospital care or maintenance while she's there?**

(In other words, are they covering the costs of her stay, or are you paying privately for her care?)

2026-01-28T23:43:04.312591 [actor]: hospital pays everything they give food clothes evrything

2026-01-28T23:43:06.081842 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. 

Now let me ask you another important question:

**Before your daughter went into hospital, were you already claiming Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-28T23:43:07.857405 [actor]: yes was getting it before

2026-01-28T23:43:09.934825 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Let me ask you one more question to complete the assessment:

**Are you living in the UK, or are you subject to immigration control that would prevent you from claiming benefits?**

(Most people living and working in the UK are eligible, but some visa conditions may affect this)

2026-01-28T23:43:11.126652 [actor]: live in uk born here

2026-01-28T23:43:15.092539 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Let me give you an assessment of your eligibility based on what you've told me:

**Unfortunately, you are NOT eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit in your current situation.**

Here's why:

When a child has been in hospital continuously for **more than 12 weeks (84 days)** AND the hospital or local authority is paying toward the cost of their care and maintenance, Child Benefit stops being payable.

Since your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks and the hospital is covering all her costs (food, clothes, everything), you won't be eligible for Child Benefit during this time.

**However, there is good news:**

Once your daughter leaves hospital and returns home to live with you, you can claim Child Benefit again immediately. Your eligibility will resume as soon as she's no longer in hospital care.

I'm sorry this isn't the answer you were hoping for during this difficult time. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T23:43:20.013239 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rule that Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks of continuous hospital care when the hospital/local authority pays for the child's maintenance, and correctly informed me that I would not be eligible while my daughter remains in hospital under these circumstances.
