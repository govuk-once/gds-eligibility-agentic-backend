**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct identification of living arrangements:** The agent established that the child (Emma/daughter, 12 years old) does not live with the applicant (Mike) but lives with her mother.

2. **Correct application of the contribution threshold:** The agent clearly explained that when a child lives with someone else, the applicant must contribute "at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate" to be considered responsible. The agent cited the rate as £25.60/week (the scenario uses £26.05/week, but this minor difference doesn't affect the outcome).

3. **Correct assessment of the applicant's contribution:** The agent accurately noted that the £10/week contribution plus an annual birthday present falls short of the required threshold (£25.60 or £26.05/week).

4. **Correct conclusion:** The agent clearly stated "you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit" and explained that the mother, who has primary responsibility, would be the eligible party.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome (Not Eligible) as specified in the scenario, where Mike fails Criteria 1 (Responsibility) because his contribution is insufficient.
