**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated the eligibility outcome that aligns with the expected outcome: **Eligible (but only for the last 3 months; they lose the first month's money)**.

Specifically, the agent:

1. **Confirmed eligibility** - The agent clearly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" after verifying all necessary criteria (child under 16, UK residence, responsible for the child, UK citizens, no duplicate claims).

2. **Explained the backdating limitation** - The agent explicitly stated that Child Benefit "can only be backdated for up to **3 months**" from the date of claim.

3. **Clarified the loss** - When the user asked "so we lost 1 month money then?", the agent confirmed: "Unfortunately, no - you won't be able to get all 4 months back" and "you will have lost out on that first month's payment."

4. **Summarized correctly** - The agent stated "if you claim now, you'll receive payments for the last 3 months, but you will have lost out on that first month's payment."

This communication matches the expected outcome precisely: the family is eligible, but due to the 3-month backdating limit, they can only recover 3 of the 4 months, losing the first month's payment.
