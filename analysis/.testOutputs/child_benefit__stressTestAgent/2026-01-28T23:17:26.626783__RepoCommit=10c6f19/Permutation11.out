2026-01-28T23:22:56.353158 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T23:22:57.967984 [actor]: child benefit for 17 year old aprentice

2026-01-28T23:23:01.447772 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old who is an apprentice.

To help determine your eligibility, I need to understand a bit more about the apprenticeship. Is your 17-year-old doing an **approved** apprenticeship or training course? 

(Approved training typically includes things like courses up to A-level standard, certain traineeships, or approved apprenticeships that don't receive a salary equivalent to National Minimum Wage or above for someone aged 19 or over working 24 hours a week.)

2026-01-28T23:23:02.832210 [actor]: son started aprentice last month lives with me

2026-01-28T23:23:04.810158 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son started an apprenticeship last month and lives with you.

To determine eligibility, I need to understand more about the apprenticeship arrangement. 

Is your son receiving a **salary or wage** from his apprenticeship, and if so, do you know approximately how much he earns per week or month?

2026-01-28T23:23:06.333698 [actor]: he gets paid yeh works at garage

2026-01-28T23:23:08.252339 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your son is getting paid for his apprenticeship at a garage.

This is an important detail. To assess eligibility, I need to know:

**How many hours per week does your son work at the garage?**

2026-01-28T23:23:09.549531 [actor]: full time aprentice mechanic

2026-01-28T23:23:12.581557 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your son works full-time as an apprentice mechanic.

This is important because if an apprentice is paid and works enough hours, they may not count as being in approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

One more question: **Do you know roughly how much your son earns per week from his apprenticeship?** 

(I'm asking because if he earns above a certain threshold - specifically the equivalent of the National Minimum Wage for a 19-year-old working 24 hours per week - this affects whether he counts as being in approved education or training.)

2026-01-28T23:23:14.191863 [actor]: don't know exact amount he gets apprentice wage though

2026-01-28T23:23:18.663517 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son receives an apprentice wage, let me help you understand the situation.

Based on the Child Benefit rules, there's an important distinction:

- **Apprentices who earn less than the equivalent of the National Minimum Wage for a 19-year-old working 24 hours per week** may still qualify you for Child Benefit, as they can count as being in approved education or training.

- **Apprentices who earn at or above this threshold typically don't qualify** because they're considered to be in paid employment rather than approved education or training.

Since apprentice wages are often lower than standard minimum wage rates, especially in the first year, there's a possibility you may still be eligible.

**My question is: Would you be able to find out what your son's weekly or monthly wage is?** This would help me give you a more definitive answer about your eligibility. Alternatively, do you know if he's in his first, second, or third year of his apprenticeship?

2026-01-28T23:23:20.283877 [actor]: its government funded aprentice program in england

2026-01-28T23:23:23.561263 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful information. Your son is on a government-funded apprenticeship program in England.

Government-funded apprenticeships can vary in terms of how much apprentices are paid, but the key factor for Child Benefit eligibility is still whether he's earning above that threshold I mentioned.

Let me ask a different question that might help: **Is your son's apprenticeship course one that leads to a qualification up to A-level standard or equivalent (such as Level 2 or Level 3)?**

This is relevant because approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes includes courses up to this level, even if they're part of an apprenticeship, provided the earnings aren't above the threshold.

2026-01-28T23:23:25.011085 [actor]: intermediate apprenticeship level 2

2026-01-28T23:23:28.913194 [root_agent]: Thank you - that's very helpful! Your son is doing an intermediate apprenticeship at Level 2, which is up to GCSE equivalent standard.

This is a positive indicator because Level 2 qualifications can count as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Now, the final key factor is the earnings threshold. Since he's on a government-funded Level 2 apprenticeship and receiving apprentice wages (which are typically lower than standard minimum wage), there's a good chance his earnings are below the threshold that would disqualify you.

Let me ask you: **Are you the person responsible for your son? That is, do you have main responsibility for him - meaning you live with him and are responsible for his day-to-day care?**

2026-01-28T23:23:30.316043 [actor]: yes im his mum he lives at home with me

2026-01-28T23:23:33.257613 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that. You're his mum and he lives at home with you, so you have main responsibility for him.

Let me ask one more important question: **Are you or your partner (if you have one) currently receiving Child Benefit for your son, or would this be a new claim?**

(I'm asking because the rules can be slightly different depending on whether you're already claiming and need to continue, or whether you're making a new claim now that he's started his apprenticeship.)

2026-01-28T23:23:34.832903 [actor]: been getting it before he started apprentice

2026-01-28T23:23:37.837534 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you've been receiving Child Benefit for your son and he has now started his apprenticeship.

This is an important situation because when a young person's circumstances change - such as starting an apprenticeship - you need to report this to the Child Benefit Office, and they will assess whether you can continue to receive it.

One final question to give you the clearest guidance: **Did you inform the Child Benefit Office when your son started his apprenticeship last month, or are you asking about eligibility because you're not sure whether you should continue claiming?**

2026-01-28T23:23:39.284880 [actor]: want to know if still eligible now hes doing apprentice

2026-01-28T23:23:44.038983 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on all the information you've provided, let me give you an assessment:

**You are likely still eligible for Child Benefit**, but there are some important considerations:

**Why you're likely eligible:**
- Your son is 17 (under 20)
- He lives with you and you're responsible for him
- He's doing a Level 2 intermediate apprenticeship (approved education/training up to A-level equivalent)
- He's receiving apprentice wages, which are typically below the earnings threshold

**The key factor:** If your son earns **less than** the equivalent of National Minimum Wage for a 19-year-old working 24 hours per week, he should still count as being in approved education or training, and you can continue receiving Child Benefit.

**What you should do:**
1. **You must inform the Child Benefit Office** about the change in your son's circumstances (that he started an apprenticeship)
2. They will assess his specific situation, including his exact earnings
3. They will confirm whether you can continue to receive Child Benefit

Would you like to know how to contact the Child Benefit Office to report this change?

2026-01-28T23:23:45.490792 [actor]: so i can keep getting it then?

2026-01-28T23:23:49.540380 [root_agent]: I understand you want a clear answer, but I need to be careful here.

**I cannot give you a definitive "yes"** because eligibility depends on the specific amount your son earns from his apprenticeship, which we haven't been able to confirm.

**What I can say is:**
- You are **likely** still eligible based on what you've told me (Level 2 apprenticeship, apprentice wages, lives with you)
- **But** the Child Benefit Office needs to make the final decision based on his exact earnings

**You must contact the Child Benefit Office to:**
1. Report that your son started an apprenticeship
2. Provide details about his earnings
3. Let them confirm whether you can continue receiving it

If you don't report this change, you could end up being overpaid and having to pay money back later.

**Would you like information on how to contact the Child Benefit Office to report this change?**

2026-01-28T23:23:51.072704 [actor]: ok so probably not eligible anymore because of the apprentice

2026-01-28T23:23:55.829606 [root_agent]: No, please don't think that! I may not have explained clearly enough - I'm sorry if I caused confusion.

**You are LIKELY STILL ELIGIBLE.** Let me be clearer:

**Why you probably CAN keep getting Child Benefit:**
- Level 2 apprenticeships often DO qualify for Child Benefit
- Apprentice wages are usually LOW - typically well below the threshold that would stop your claim
- Many parents continue to receive Child Benefit when their 16-19 year old is doing an apprenticeship, especially at Level 2

**The reason I can't say "definitely yes"** is simply because I don't have your son's exact wage figure. But based on typical apprentice wages (especially for someone who just started last month), you very likely remain eligible.

**What you need to do:**
- Contact the Child Benefit Office
- Tell them about the apprenticeship
- They will confirm you can continue (which is the most likely outcome)

This is a **positive situation** - not a negative one. Does that make more sense?

2026-01-28T23:23:57.619520 [actor]: but aprenticeships in england mean no child benefit right

2026-01-28T23:24:02.555376 [root_agent]: **No, that's not correct!** Apprenticeships do NOT automatically mean you lose Child Benefit.

Let me be very clear:

**You CAN still get Child Benefit for a young person doing an apprenticeship** - it depends on the specific circumstances.

**You're likely to KEEP Child Benefit if:**
- The apprentice is under 20 ✓ (your son is 17)
- They live with you ✓ (he does)
- The apprenticeship is at Level 2 or 3 ✓ (his is Level 2)
- Their earnings are below a certain threshold ✓ (apprentice wages are usually low enough)

**Many parents of apprentices DO continue receiving Child Benefit**, especially when:
- It's a government-funded apprenticeship
- The young person just started (wages start low)
- It's at Level 2 or Level 3

**Where did you hear that apprenticeships mean no Child Benefit?** There may be some confusion out there, but it's simply not an automatic rule.

The most likely outcome when you contact the Child Benefit Office is that they'll confirm you can **continue** receiving it. Does that reassure you?

2026-01-28T23:24:05.357760 [actor]: ok thanks ill contact them then

2026-01-28T23:24:08.552474 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated I was "likely still eligible" and could "KEEP Child Benefit" for my 17-year-old son doing a full-time paid apprenticeship. However, according to gov.uk guidance, young people on apprenticeships who receive a salary are generally NOT in approved education/training for Child Benefit purposes, which means I should stop my claim. The agent should have clearly stated I was not eligible rather than repeatedly suggesting I was "likely" eligible.
