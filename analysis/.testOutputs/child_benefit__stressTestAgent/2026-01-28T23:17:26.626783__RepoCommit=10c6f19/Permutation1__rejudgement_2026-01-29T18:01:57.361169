**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Criteria 1 (Responsibility):** ✓ The agent confirmed Leo lives with the applicant and they are responsible for him.

2. **Criteria 2 (Child's Age):** ✓ The agent verified Leo is 8 years old and in school, meeting the under-16 requirement.

3. **Criteria 3 (UK Residency):** ✓ The agent confirmed the family lives in Manchester, UK.

4. **Criteria 4 (Living Arrangements):** ✓ The agent established Leo lives with the applicant.

5. **Criteria 5 (State Support):** ✓ No indication of hospital/care placement (child lives at home and attends school).

6. **Criteria 6 (High Income Charge):** ✓ The agent correctly identified that neither parent's individual income exceeds £50,000 (let alone £60,000), so no High Income Child Benefit Charge applies.

The agent systematically gathered all relevant information, correctly applied the eligibility criteria, and communicated a clear eligible outcome. This matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** for this standard family scenario.
