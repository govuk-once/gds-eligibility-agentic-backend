**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Age criterion assessed:** The agent correctly identified that the child is 17, which exceeds the automatic eligibility age of under 16.

2. **Education/training status verified:** The agent established that Jordan is not in college, not working, and not in any approved education or training.

3. **Extension eligibility properly evaluated:** The agent specifically asked about registration with a government-approved careers service and confirmed Jordan is not registered anywhere. This is the critical requirement for the 20-week extension for 16/17-year-olds who are NEET.

4. **Additional extension rule considered:** The agent also checked whether the 31 August extension applied (for those leaving education after the first Monday in April), correctly determining that this grace period has passed since Jordan left school last June.

5. **Clear outcome communicated:** The agent explicitly stated "you would not currently be eligible for Child Benefit" with proper reasoning.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that Jordan does not qualify because he has not registered with any approved careers service or training program, which is required for the extension beyond age 16 when not in education or training.
