2026-01-28T23:30:29.294518 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T23:30:30.734992 [actor]: child benefit son 14 residental scool

2026-01-28T23:30:32.753187 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old son who attends a residential school.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Does your son live at the residential school full-time, or does he regularly come home during weekends, holidays, or term breaks?

2026-01-28T23:30:34.192964 [actor]: lives there full time council pays

2026-01-28T23:30:36.365414 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son lives at the residential school full-time and the council pays for this.

This is an important detail. Let me ask: Is your son living at this residential school because he's in local authority care, or is it for other reasons such as special educational needs while you still have parental responsibility for him?

2026-01-28T23:30:37.665046 [actor]: behavioral needs local council pays

2026-01-28T23:30:39.640022 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining. So your son is at the residential school due to behavioral needs, and the local council pays for this placement.

Let me ask an important question to clarify the care arrangement: Do you still have parental responsibility for your son, or has he been taken into local authority care (meaning the council has taken over parental responsibility)?

2026-01-28T23:30:40.882148 [actor]: still have parental responsibilty

2026-01-28T23:30:43.253844 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's an important detail - you still have parental responsibility for your son.

Now I need to understand the living arrangements better. Even though your son lives at the residential school full-time, does he come home to stay with you at all - for example, during school holidays, some weekends, or other breaks?

2026-01-28T23:30:44.724491 [actor]: no stays there full time been 10 weeks now

2026-01-28T23:30:47.247807 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your son has been living at the residential school full-time for the past 10 weeks and doesn't come home during that time.

Let me ask: Is this placement expected to be temporary (for example, with a plan for him to return home eventually), or is it a longer-term or permanent arrangement?

2026-01-28T23:30:48.799661 [actor]: not sure how long maybe temporary

2026-01-28T23:30:51.193871 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining. So it's uncertain how long the placement will last, but it could be temporary.

Let me ask another important question: Are you currently contributing financially to your son's maintenance or upkeep in any way - for example, paying for his clothing, personal items, or other costs - even though the council pays for the residential school placement?

2026-01-28T23:30:52.870605 [actor]: buy him clothes and things when he needs

2026-01-28T23:30:54.840365 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful to know - you do contribute by buying him clothes and other things when he needs them.

Now, a few more questions to complete the assessment. First: Are you (or your partner, if you have one) responsible for your son and living in the UK?

2026-01-28T23:30:56.436694 [actor]: yes live in uk responsible for him

2026-01-28T23:30:58.158085 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now let me ask: Do you currently receive Child Benefit for your son, or are you asking about applying for it / whether you can claim it given his current living situation?

2026-01-28T23:30:59.531369 [actor]: already get it but not sure if still can

2026-01-28T23:31:01.883172 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying - you're currently receiving Child Benefit but are concerned about whether you can still claim it now that your son is in residential school.

Let me ask one more important question: Has anyone from the local authority or the residential school told you that someone else (such as the school or the local authority) is claiming Child Benefit for your son?

2026-01-28T23:31:03.229918 [actor]: no one said anything about that

2026-01-28T23:31:08.324188 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me share my assessment with you.

**Based on what you've told me, you should still be eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit for your son.** Here's why:

1. **You still have parental responsibility** - This is crucial. Your son hasn't been taken into care by the local authority; they're simply funding his residential school placement.

2. **You contribute to his upkeep** - You're still buying him clothes and things when he needs them, which shows you're contributing to his maintenance.

3. **The placement may be temporary** - Since you're not sure how long it will last and it could be temporary, this supports your ongoing entitlement.

4. **You live in the UK and are responsible for him** - You meet the basic eligibility criteria.

Even though your son is living at residential school full-time and the council pays for the placement, the fact that you retain parental responsibility and still contribute to his costs means you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit.

**You should continue claiming your Child Benefit.** If anyone from the council or school contacts you about it in the future, you can explain your situation. But based on the current circumstances you've described, there's no reason for you to stop your claim.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit you'd like to know?

2026-01-28T23:31:09.869753 [actor]: ok thanks that helps

2026-01-28T23:31:13.894190 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, when a child is looked after by the local authority (even if parents retain parental responsibility), Child Benefit can only be claimed for the first 12 weeks. Since the child has been in residential care for 10 weeks with the council paying, the parent is only eligible until week 12, not indefinitely as the agent stated.
