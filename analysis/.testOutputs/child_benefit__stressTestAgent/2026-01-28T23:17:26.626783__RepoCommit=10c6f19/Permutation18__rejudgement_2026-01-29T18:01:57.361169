**Justification:**

The agent made a critical error in determining eligibility. According to the scenario and GOV.UK guidance, the expected outcome is **Not Eligible** because eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday.

**Key Facts:**
- The user clearly stated their son Dev is "20 years old"
- Dev is studying A-levels full-time at college (approved education)

**The Agent's Error:**
The agent stated: "You have a son who is under 20 years old" - this is factually incorrect based on the user's initial statement that Dev is 20 years old.

The agent then concluded the user is eligible and stated: "You can claim Child Benefit for your son while he continues his approved education or training, up until he turns 20..."

**The Correct Outcome:**
According to [GOV.UK Child Benefit eligibility guidance](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), Child Benefit stops when a young person reaches 20, even if they are still in approved education or training. Since Dev is already 20 years old, Raj is **not eligible** for Child Benefit.

The agent communicated an eligibility outcome (Eligible) that directly contradicts the expected outcome (Not Eligible). The evaluation judge correctly identified this error.
