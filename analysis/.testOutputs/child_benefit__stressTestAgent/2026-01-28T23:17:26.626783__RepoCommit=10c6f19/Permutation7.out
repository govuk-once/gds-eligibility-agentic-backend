2026-01-28T23:20:35.033649 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T23:20:36.658427 [actor]: son 14 yrs old weekends home friday to sunday

2026-01-28T23:20:38.638757 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old son who is with you from Friday to Sunday each weekend.

To help me assess your eligibility, I need to understand the living arrangements more clearly:

Where does your son live during the rest of the week (Monday to Friday)?

2026-01-28T23:20:40.052185 [actor]: son in care local authority 3 months now

2026-01-28T23:20:42.212228 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. I understand your son has been in local authority care for 3 months and stays with you on weekends (Friday to Sunday).

This is an important detail for Child Benefit eligibility. Let me ask you:

Before your son went into local authority care 3 months ago, were you receiving Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-28T23:20:43.564624 [actor]: need benefits for son comes home weekends

2026-01-28T23:20:45.970249 [root_agent]: I understand you want to know about benefits for your son who comes home on weekends.

To clarify your situation regarding Child Benefit specifically, let me ask:

Are you currently receiving Child Benefit payments for your son, or are you asking whether you can claim Child Benefit given that he's in local authority care during the week but comes home to you on weekends?

2026-01-28T23:20:47.518498 [actor]: can i get child benefit son in care but stays weekends friday saturday sunday

2026-01-28T23:20:49.755098 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. You want to know if you can get Child Benefit for your son who is in local authority care during the week but stays with you Friday, Saturday and Sunday each weekend.

To assess this properly, I need to know:

Is the local authority paying for your son's care and accommodation during the week when he's not with you?

2026-01-28T23:20:51.110824 [actor]: yes council pays care during week

2026-01-28T23:20:53.449904 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So the local authority is paying for your son's care during the week.

This is a key factor in determining eligibility. Let me ask you one more important question:

When your son comes home to you on weekends (Friday to Sunday), are you responsible for his care during that time - meaning you're looking after him, providing for his needs, and he's living as part of your household during those days?

2026-01-28T23:20:55.234415 [actor]: yes i look after him weekends he stays with me friday evening to sunday evening

2026-01-28T23:20:59.821441 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your situation based on what you've told me.

**Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.**

Here's why: When a child is being looked after by a local authority (in care), and the local authority is paying for their accommodation and maintenance, Child Benefit cannot be paid - even if the child comes home to you regularly on weekends.

The key factor is that the local authority is paying for your son's care during the week. Child Benefit rules state that you cannot receive Child Benefit for a child when a local authority is paying for their accommodation and looking after them.

This applies even though you are clearly caring for your son on weekends and he's staying with you Friday to Sunday. The fact that the local authority has financial responsibility for his care during the week means Child Benefit cannot be paid.

I know this may be disappointing news, especially as you are actively involved in your son's life and caring for him regularly on weekends. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this decision or Child Benefit in general?

2026-01-28T23:21:05.071283 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit CAN be paid when a child in local authority care regularly stays with the claimant for at least one night per week, which this scenario clearly meets (Friday evening to Sunday evening every weekend). The agent should have determined the claimant eligible via the exception for regular overnight stays.
