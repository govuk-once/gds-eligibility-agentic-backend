**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible (until week 12)."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct rule application**: The agent properly applied the 12-week hospital rule for children in hospital/residential care, which is the correct framework for Mental Health Act detention in a secure psychiatric unit.

2. **Accurate eligibility determination**: The agent clearly stated "You should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit" and confirmed the user is "within this period" (10 weeks out of 12 weeks).

3. **Appropriate timeframe warning**: The agent correctly advised that "if your son's hospital stay extends beyond 12 weeks in total, the rules may change," which demonstrates understanding of the time-limited nature of this eligibility.

4. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly confirmed eligibility status and reassured the user they are "doing everything correctly."

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome: the user is eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit because the child has been in hospital for 10 weeks, which is within the 12-week limit for hospital stays.
