**Justification:**

The agent made a critical error in applying the hospital rules for Child Benefit eligibility.

**The Facts:**
- First hospital stay: 10 weeks
- Gap at home: 15 days (less than 28 days)
- Second hospital stay: 3 weeks (ongoing)
- NHS is paying for the care

**What the Agent Got Wrong:**

The agent stated: "because the NHS is paying for his care (rather than a local authority), you can continue to receive Child Benefit throughout his hospital stays, regardless of how long they last."

This is **incorrect**. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital, when the NHS pays for treatment, Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks in hospital.

**What Should Have Happened:**

The agent correctly identified that the two hospital stays are "linked" (the gap was only 15 days, which is less than the 28-day threshold). This means the stays count cumulatively: 10 weeks + 3 weeks = 13 weeks total.

**Expected Outcome:** Not eligible after the cumulative 12th week.

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Eligible throughout the hospital stay regardless of duration.

The agent's conclusion directly contradicts the expected outcome. The user should have been informed that eligibility ceased after the cumulative 12th week of the linked hospital stays.
