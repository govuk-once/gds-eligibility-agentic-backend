2026-01-28T23:27:14.728285 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To get started, let me ask you the first question:

**Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T23:27:16.083461 [actor]: son dev 20 years old studing a levels

2026-01-28T23:27:18.227015 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a son who is 20 years old studying A-levels.

Let me ask a follow-up question to assess eligibility:

**Is your son studying A-levels through approved education or training? (For example, is he enrolled at a school, college, or with a training provider that is recognized for these purposes?)**

2026-01-28T23:27:19.780761 [actor]: yes hes at colege doing a levels full time

2026-01-28T23:27:21.760933 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Your son is studying A-levels full time at college, which is approved education.

Now I need to ask:

**Do you live with your son, or are you responsible for him (meaning you're contributing at least the Child Benefit rate towards his upkeep)?**

2026-01-28T23:27:23.156430 [actor]: yes i live with dev hes my son i look after him

2026-01-28T23:27:24.759567 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live with your son and look after him.

Now I need to ask an important question about your residence status:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T23:27:26.348468 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T23:27:28.238872 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question:

**Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on your right to reside in the UK?**

(For example, do you have settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or are you a British citizen?)

2026-01-28T23:27:29.431669 [actor]: british citizen no restrictions

2026-01-28T23:27:33.142277 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You have a son who is under 20 years old
2. ✓ He is in approved full-time education (A-levels at college)
3. ✓ You live with him and are responsible for him
4. ✓ You live in the UK
5. ✓ You are a British citizen with no immigration restrictions

You meet the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. You can claim Child Benefit for your son while he continues his approved education or training, up until he turns 20 or finishes his course (whichever comes first).

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?**

2026-01-28T23:27:38.345307 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The son is already 20 years old, and according to GOV.UK guidance, Child Benefit eligibility ceases on the child's 20th birthday, even if they are still in approved education or training.
