2026-01-30T09:52:54.358026 [confirmation_judge]: **Judgement: 👍**

**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. The agent properly identified that the daughter (Emily, 18) is studying an HNC at Level 4
2. The agent correctly classified HNC as "advanced education" (higher than A-levels)
3. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds only continues for "non-advanced" education or approved training
4. The agent clearly stated: "Unfortunately, this means you are not eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter"

This conclusion is consistent with Gov.uk guidance, which states that Child Benefit continues only if the young person is in approved education or training up to Level 3 (A-level equivalent). Since HNC is Level 4 qualification, it exceeds the non-advanced education threshold, making the user ineligible regardless of whether it's taken at college or university.

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
