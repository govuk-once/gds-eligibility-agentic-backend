2026-01-28T23:36:16.665797 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:36:18.171821 [actor]: rashid 17 years old still in scool

2026-01-28T23:36:20.671574 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child named Rashid who is 17 years old and still in school.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is Rashid in approved education or training? This would typically include:**
- Full-time non-advanced education (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or similar qualifications)
- Approved training courses with an approved training provider

2026-01-28T23:36:22.084725 [actor]: yes a levels full time

2026-01-28T23:36:24.593720 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you. Rashid being 17 and studying A-levels full-time means he could qualify as a child for Child Benefit purposes.

Now I need to ask about your relationship with Rashid:

**Are you responsible for Rashid? This means, do you live with him and are you the main person looking after him (such as providing food, clothing, and a home)?**

2026-01-28T23:36:25.877965 [actor]: yes he lives with us we look after him

2026-01-28T23:36:28.301320 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your residency status:

**Do you normally live in the UK? (This includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland)**

2026-01-28T23:36:29.531824 [actor]: yes we live in uk

2026-01-28T23:36:31.696618 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask an important question about Rashid's living arrangements:

**Does anyone else also claim Child Benefit for Rashid, or does Rashid live with anyone else who might be claiming Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T23:36:33.152282 [actor]: no just us we claim

2026-01-28T23:36:35.397395 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification.

I have one more important question:

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, meaning do either of you have any restrictions on your right to remain in the UK or access to public funds?**

2026-01-28T23:36:36.935889 [actor]: no we have right to live here

2026-01-28T23:36:40.841599 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You have a child (Rashid) who is 17 years old and in full-time approved education (A-levels)
2. ✓ You are responsible for Rashid - he lives with you and you look after him
3. ✓ You normally live in the UK
4. ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Rashid
5. ✓ You have the right to live in the UK with no immigration restrictions

**However, please note:** While you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit, if you or your partner has an individual income over £60,000 per year, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which could mean paying back some or all of the Child Benefit through your tax return.

You can proceed with applying for Child Benefit if you haven't already done so.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T23:36:45.680291 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on having a 17-year-old child in full-time A-level education, being responsible for the child, living in the UK, having no other claimants, and having the right to live in the UK without immigration restrictions.
