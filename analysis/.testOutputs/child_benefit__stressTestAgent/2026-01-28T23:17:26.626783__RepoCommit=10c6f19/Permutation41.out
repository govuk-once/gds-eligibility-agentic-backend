2026-01-28T23:39:37.260568 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:39:38.923789 [actor]: child benefit for two kids not living with me pay 40 quid a week

2026-01-28T23:39:40.480618 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you an important question to understand your situation better:

**Do these two children live with you, or do they live with someone else?**

2026-01-28T23:39:41.924849 [actor]: they live with ex partner ben is 10 jerry is 8

2026-01-28T23:39:44.697862 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Now I need to understand your financial contribution:

**Do you contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate towards the cost of looking after Ben and Jerry each week?**

(For context, the current Child Benefit rate is approximately £25.60 per week for the eldest child and £16.95 per week for each additional child, which totals around £42.55 per week for two children.)

2026-01-28T23:39:46.109235 [actor]: i pay 40 pounds evry week for both kids

2026-01-28T23:39:47.627293 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Let me ask you another important question:

**Is your ex-partner currently claiming Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry?**

2026-01-28T23:39:49.155893 [actor]: no ex partner not claiming child benefit

2026-01-28T23:39:51.260877 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Now I need to ask:

**Are Ben and Jerry living with your ex-partner full-time, or do they spend time living with you as well? For example, do they stay with you on certain days of the week or alternate weeks?**

2026-01-28T23:39:52.630636 [actor]: they live with ex partner full time dont live with me

2026-01-28T23:39:54.170695 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me ask you this:

**Does your ex-partner provide for Ben and Jerry's day-to-day needs, such as food, clothing, and housing?**

2026-01-28T23:39:55.400941 [actor]: yes ex partner looks after them day to day

2026-01-28T23:39:57.595084 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me ask one more important question:

**Are you and your ex-partner able to come to an agreement about who should claim the Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry?**

This is important because when a child doesn't live with you, normally only one person can claim Child Benefit, and it's usually the person the child lives with who has priority.

2026-01-28T23:39:58.961138 [actor]: want to claim it myself i pay 40 quid week

2026-01-28T23:40:03.141547 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying your preference. Based on the information you've provided, I need to give you an assessment of your eligibility:

**Unfortunately, you are not eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry in your current situation.**

Here's why:

1. **The children live with your ex-partner full-time** - Ben and Jerry don't live with you at all.

2. **Your ex-partner provides their day-to-day care** - Your ex-partner looks after them on a daily basis, including food, clothing, and housing.

3. **Priority rules** - When a child doesn't live with you, the person who the child lives with has priority to claim Child Benefit, even if you're contributing financially.

While you're paying £40 per week towards their costs, Child Benefit is awarded to the person who is primarily responsible for the child and who the child lives with. In this case, that would be your ex-partner.

**Your ex-partner would be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit** for Ben and Jerry, as they provide the day-to-day care and the children live with them full-time.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-28T23:40:04.766739 [actor]: but i read i can claim if i pay enuff money even if kids dont live with me

2026-01-28T23:40:08.550541 [root_agent]: Thank you for raising that point. Let me clarify this important rule:

You're partially correct - there is a provision where you *might* be able to claim if the child doesn't live with you, BUT there are specific conditions that must be met.

Let me ask you a crucial question:

**Is anyone else currently contributing towards the cost of looking after Ben and Jerry, apart from you and your ex-partner? For example, is anyone else providing financial support or care for them?**

This matters because to claim Child Benefit when a child doesn't live with you, you need to be contributing at least as much as the Child Benefit rate towards their costs, AND no one else (including the person the child lives with) should have a greater claim.

2026-01-28T23:40:10.278904 [actor]: no just me paying 40 pounds week ex partner not paying anything just looking after them

2026-01-28T23:40:14.257960 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. However, I need to explain an important point about eligibility:

**Your ex-partner IS contributing to Ben and Jerry's costs** - not in cash, but by providing their day-to-day care, housing, food, and clothing. This counts as a contribution.

When determining who has priority for Child Benefit when a child doesn't live with you, the rules consider:

1. Who the child lives with
2. Who provides day-to-day care
3. Financial contributions

Even though you're paying £40 per week, your ex-partner is providing the home, daily care, food, and other essentials - which represents a significant contribution to the children's upbringing.

**The person the child lives with and who provides their day-to-day care generally has priority for Child Benefit**, even if someone else is making financial contributions.

Based on the government rules, your ex-partner would have the stronger claim to Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry because they live with them full-time and provide their daily care.

Do you have any other questions about this?

2026-01-28T23:40:15.905122 [actor]: no i read on gov.uk if i contribute at least as much as child benefit rate i can claim even if child lives elsewhere

2026-01-28T23:40:20.343848 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right to challenge me on this - let me reconsider the rules more carefully based on what the government guidance actually says.

Let me ask you this important question to assess your situation properly:

**Besides providing the home and day-to-day care for Ben and Jerry, is your ex-partner also contributing money towards their costs - for example, paying for their clothes, school items, activities, or other expenses?**

This distinction is important because the rules do state that you may be able to claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with you if you contribute at least the Child Benefit rate towards their costs. However, if someone else is contributing the same amount or more, they would have priority.

Since you're paying £40 per week and the Child Benefit rate for two children is approximately £42.55, you're contributing close to that amount. I need to understand if your ex-partner is also making financial contributions on top of providing the home and care.

2026-01-28T23:40:21.879241 [actor]: ex partner not paying money just doing the care i pay the 40 pounds

2026-01-28T23:40:25.006429 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Let me ask one final important question:

**Do you and your ex-partner agree that you should be the one to claim Child Benefit, or does your ex-partner want to claim it themselves?**

This matters because when more than one person could potentially claim, and there's a dispute about who should receive it, only one person can actually get the payment. The government guidance indicates that if you can't agree, they will decide based on who has the greater responsibility - but if you both agree, that can affect who should claim.

2026-01-28T23:40:26.868743 [actor]: we dont agree i want to claim it myself they can claim it if they want but i want it

2026-01-28T23:40:31.787582 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Based on all the information you've provided, here's my assessment:

**You may potentially have a case to claim Child Benefit**, but there are important points you need to understand:

1. **Your contribution**: You're paying £40 per week, which is close to the Child Benefit rate for two children (approximately £42.55 per week).

2. **The rules state**: You can claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with you IF you contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate towards looking after them.

3. **However, there's a conflict**: Since you and your ex-partner don't agree on who should claim, and your ex-partner could also claim it (as the person providing day-to-day care), this creates a dispute.

**What happens in a dispute:**
- Only ONE person can receive Child Benefit
- If both of you try to claim and disagree, HMRC will decide who has priority
- They typically give priority to the person the child lives with

**My recommendation**: You could apply for Child Benefit, but be aware that because the children live with your ex-partner full-time and you disagree about who should claim, HMRC may decide your ex-partner has the greater claim.

Would you like to know how to proceed with an application?

2026-01-28T23:40:33.398731 [actor]: but i contribute more than child benefit for one child can i claim for just one kid then

2026-01-28T23:40:38.444014 [root_agent]: That's an interesting question. Let me clarify:

**You cannot choose to claim Child Benefit for just one of your children (Ben or Jerry) while your ex-partner claims for the other.**

Here's why:

- Child Benefit is claimed by a person for the children they're responsible for
- You're contributing £40 per week total for BOTH Ben and Jerry
- You can't split the claim between two different people for different children in the same family when they live in the same household

The situation is assessed as a whole - either you claim for both children, or your ex-partner claims for both children.

Since you're paying £40 per week total for both children, and the Child Benefit rate for two children is approximately £42.55 per week, you're slightly under the full rate.

**Do you contribute any additional support beyond the £40 per week** - such as paying for school uniforms, trips, birthday presents, or other expenses for Ben and Jerry?

2026-01-28T23:40:40.202854 [actor]: i want hmrc to split my 40 pounds differently can i ask them to put more money towards ben

2026-01-28T23:40:44.569769 [root_agent]: I understand what you're asking, but I need to clarify something important:

**HMRC doesn't decide how your £40 payment is split between Ben and Jerry. That's not how the Child Benefit eligibility assessment works.**

The £40 you pay is your personal contribution/maintenance payment that you've arranged (presumably with your ex-partner or through another arrangement). HMRC doesn't control or allocate how you divide that money between the children.

What HMRC assesses is:
- Whether your TOTAL contribution meets the Child Benefit rate threshold
- Who has the greater claim to Child Benefit overall

You're paying £40 total per week for both children. The Child Benefit rates are:
- £25.60 for the eldest child (Ben)
- £16.95 for the additional child (Jerry)
- Total: £42.55

**Let me ask: Are you able to increase your weekly payment to at least £42.55 (or higher) to meet or exceed the full Child Benefit rate for both children?** 

This might strengthen your claim if you decide to apply.

2026-01-28T23:40:46.394413 [actor]: no but if 26 pounds goes to ben and 14 to jerry then i pay enough for ben can i claim for him

2026-01-28T23:40:51.725014 [root_agent]: I understand your thinking, but I need to explain how the rules actually work:

**You cannot split your contribution that way to claim for just one child. Here's why:**

1. **Child Benefit is an "all or nothing" situation** - When children live in the same household (with your ex-partner), one person claims for all the children in their care, not split between different claimants.

2. **You can't choose which child to claim for** - You either claim for both Ben and Jerry, or neither. You cannot claim for Ben while your ex-partner claims for Jerry when they both live together.

3. **Your total contribution is assessed** - HMRC looks at your overall contribution (£40/week) against the total Child Benefit rate for both children (£42.55/week).

**The reality of your situation:**
- You're contributing £40/week for both children
- This is slightly below the full Child Benefit rate of £42.55
- The children live with your ex-partner who provides day-to-day care
- You and your ex-partner disagree about who should claim

**You could still apply for Child Benefit for both children**, but given the disagreement and that the children live with your ex-partner, HMRC would likely decide in your ex-partner's favor.

Is there anything else you'd like to understand about this?

2026-01-28T23:40:53.346097 [actor]: but gov.uk says i can ask hmrc about unequal splitting i read it

2026-01-28T23:40:56.751412 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right to push back on this - I apologize for not being fully accurate. Let me reconsider what the government guidance actually says.

**Can you tell me specifically what the guidance said about "unequal splitting"?** Was this in reference to:

- Splitting the contribution differently between the two children, or
- Something else about how Child Benefit can be split or allocated?

I want to make sure I'm giving you accurate information based on the actual government guidance. If you saw specific wording on gov.uk about unequal splitting and asking HMRC, that's important and I need to understand the exact context to give you the right answer.

What exactly did the guidance say about this?

2026-01-28T23:40:58.208606 [actor]: it said you can ask hmrc to consider unequal splitting of contribution between children

2026-01-28T23:41:02.511548 [root_agent]: Thank you for persisting on this point - you're right to hold me to account on what the government guidance actually says.

I need to be honest with you: **I cannot find specific guidance on gov.uk about asking HMRC to consider "unequal splitting of contribution between children" for Child Benefit purposes.**

The guidance I have access to covers:
- Eligibility when a child lives with you
- Eligibility when a child lives with someone else
- Contributing at least the Child Benefit rate when the child doesn't live with you

However, I don't see specific mention of unequal splitting of contributions between multiple children.

**Could you help me by telling me which specific page or section on gov.uk you saw this information?** For example:
- Was it on the main Child Benefit eligibility page?
- Was it on the "child lives with someone else" page?
- Or another specific page?

This would help me give you accurate information based on the actual guidance rather than potentially misleading you. I want to make sure I understand the rules correctly so I can properly assess your situation.

2026-01-28T23:41:04.076324 [actor]: i dont remember exact page just read it on gov uk about unequal splitting for child benefit contributions

2026-01-28T23:41:08.747691 [root_agent]: Thank you for your honesty. I need to be transparent with you as well.

**I have thoroughly reviewed the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, and I cannot find any reference to "unequal splitting" of contributions between children.**

The guidance I have access to covers:
- https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility
- https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else  
- https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care

None of these mention the concept of splitting contributions unequally between children to claim for one but not the other.

**It's possible that:**
- You may have misremembered what you read
- You might have seen information about a different benefit or situation
- Or there's guidance I don't have access to

**Based on the official guidance I can access, my assessment remains:**
- You cannot claim Child Benefit for just one child (Ben) while excluding the other (Jerry) when they live together
- Your £40/week contribution is assessed as a total against the full rate for both children (£42.55)
- With the children living with your ex-partner full-time and disagreement between you, your ex-partner would likely have priority

Would you like guidance on how to apply anyway, or do you have other questions?

2026-01-28T23:41:10.288386 [actor]: ok so am i eligible or not

2026-01-28T23:41:14.027798 [root_agent]: Based on all the information you've provided, here is my clear assessment:

**You are NOT eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry.**

Here's why:

1. **The children live with your ex-partner full-time** - not with you

2. **Your ex-partner provides their day-to-day care** - housing, food, clothing, and daily needs

3. **Your contribution is below the threshold** - You pay £40/week, but the Child Benefit rate for two children is £42.55/week

4. **Priority rules** - When a child doesn't live with you, the person they live with who provides day-to-day care has priority, especially when there's a disagreement

5. **You and your ex-partner disagree** - If you both tried to claim, HMRC would decide, and they would likely give priority to your ex-partner

**Your ex-partner would be the eligible person** to claim Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry.

You could still submit an application, but based on the rules, it would likely be refused, and your ex-partner would have the stronger claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know?

2026-01-28T23:41:16.908524 [actor]: ok thanks

2026-01-28T23:41:19.772244 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent concluded I was not eligible for either child, but according to the expected outcome I should be eligible for Ben (Full Rate) and not eligible for Jerry, as my £40 weekly contribution exceeds the Child Benefit rate for one child (£25.60) even though it falls short of the combined rate for both children.
