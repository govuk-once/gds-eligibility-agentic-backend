2026-01-28T23:43:21.759702 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T23:43:23.364044 [actor]: child benefit how long can claim jobseekr

2026-01-28T23:43:25.018841 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me focus on your Child Benefit eligibility question.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand your situation better.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T23:43:26.629851 [actor]: yes have child under 16 lookng for work presettled status

2026-01-28T23:43:28.507832 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child under 16, which meets one of the key criteria.

Now I need to ask: Are you responsible for the child? By this I mean, does the child live with you?

2026-01-28T23:43:30.100522 [actor]: yes child lives with me been unemployd 95 days now

2026-01-28T23:43:32.509077 [root_agent]: Thank you. So the child lives with you and you're responsible for them - that's good.

Now, regarding your immigration status - you mentioned you have pre-settled status. This is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

Are you currently working, or have you worked in the UK before? I'm asking because people with pre-settled status may need to meet certain conditions related to their right to reside in the UK for benefits purposes.

2026-01-28T23:43:33.958967 [actor]: no not working looking for work 95 days jobseekr

2026-01-28T23:43:36.427561 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you have pre-settled status, you're not currently working, and you've been looking for work for 95 days.

This is an important question: Before you became unemployed, were you working in the UK? And if so, for how long were you working?

I'm asking this because your right to reside status (which affects Child Benefit eligibility) can depend on your work history in the UK when you have pre-settled status.

2026-01-28T23:43:37.931259 [actor]: no job offer just looking cant find work been 95 days searching

2026-01-28T23:43:40.179081 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining. So you haven't worked in the UK yet and have been searching for work for 95 days.

Let me ask you this: When did you arrive in the UK and receive your pre-settled status? And are you from an EU country, or where are you from originally?

This information is important because your right to reside in the UK (which affects benefit eligibility including Child Benefit) depends on your specific circumstances with pre-settled status.

2026-01-28T23:43:41.686037 [actor]: how long jobseeker can get child benfit presettled

2026-01-28T23:43:44.185022 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about how long someone with pre-settled status can claim Child Benefit while looking for work as a jobseeker.

Let me clarify an important point: Child Benefit eligibility is primarily about your right to reside in the UK, not about how long you've been job seeking. However, with pre-settled status, your right to reside can be affected by your circumstances.

To answer your question properly, I need to know:

When did you first arrive in the UK and how long have you been living here? This is important because people with pre-settled status may have different rights depending on when they arrived and how long they've been here.

2026-01-28T23:43:45.521231 [actor]: been here looking work 95 days presettled no job yet

2026-01-28T23:43:47.877227 [root_agent]: I understand you've been looking for work for 95 days, but I need to know something different to help assess your Child Benefit eligibility.

Let me ask this more clearly: When did you first come to live in the UK? For example, was it 6 months ago, 1 year ago, 2 years ago, or longer?

I need to know your total time living in the UK, not just the time you've been looking for work, because this affects your right to reside and therefore your Child Benefit eligibility with pre-settled status.

2026-01-28T23:43:49.313519 [actor]: 91 days time limit jobseeker child benefit heard this

2026-01-28T23:43:53.145015 [root_agent]: I understand your concern about a 91-day time limit for jobseekers claiming Child Benefit. Let me help clarify this.

There are rules about jobseekers and right to reside that can affect some benefits, but I need to understand your full situation first.

Let me ask again: How long in total have you been living in the UK? Not just the 95 days of job seeking, but from when you first arrived in the UK - have you been here for several months, a year, two years, or longer?

Also, are you or your child's other parent an EU/EEA citizen, or from another country?

This will help me give you accurate information about your Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-28T23:43:54.773966 [actor]: came uk 95 days ago got presettled staus looking work whole time no job

2026-01-28T23:43:57.207811 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's very helpful information. So you arrived in the UK 95 days ago, received pre-settled status, and have been looking for work the whole time.

Now I need to ask: Which country did you come from? Are you an EU/EEA citizen or Swiss citizen?

This is important because the rules about right to reside (which affects Child Benefit eligibility) can be different depending on your nationality and when you arrived in the UK.

2026-01-28T23:43:58.842365 [actor]: eu citizen came here jobseeker 95 days presettled

2026-01-28T23:44:01.597405 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important information. You're an EU citizen who came to the UK 95 days ago as a jobseeker and have pre-settled status.

This is a crucial question: Did you apply for and receive pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme before it closed on 30 June 2021, or did you apply more recently under one of the later schemes or exceptions?

The timing of when you got your pre-settled status matters for determining your rights and Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-28T23:44:03.033960 [actor]: when eligible for child benefit jobseeker presettled 91 days

2026-01-28T23:44:05.304368 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about the 91-day rule for jobseekers with pre-settled status and Child Benefit eligibility.

Before I can give you accurate information about this, I need to understand one more thing:

Did you receive your pre-settled status **before** you came to the UK 95 days ago, or did you apply for it **after** you arrived in the UK?

This is important because it affects whether you have a right to reside as a jobseeker, which determines your Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-28T23:44:06.975390 [actor]: got presettled then came uk 95 days jobseeker child benefit time limit

2026-01-28T23:44:11.884064 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying - you got pre-settled status and then came to the UK 95 days ago as a jobseeker.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to give you some important guidance about your situation:

**For Child Benefit eligibility, you need to have a "right to reside" in the UK.** With pre-settled status as a jobseeker, there are specific time limits that apply.

EU citizens who are jobseekers generally have a right to reside for up to **91 days** while genuinely seeking work. After 91 days without finding employment, your right to reside as a jobseeker may end, which could affect your Child Benefit eligibility.

Since you've been here for 95 days and haven't yet found work, this is a critical issue for your Child Benefit claim.

**Important question:** Have you already applied for Child Benefit, or are you planning to apply? And have you received any communication from the government about your right to reside or benefits?

This is a complex area and you may need specialist immigration or benefits advice to understand your specific situation fully.

2026-01-28T23:44:13.311451 [actor]: so not eligible then child benefit after 91 days

2026-01-28T23:44:17.377536 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided - that you're an EU citizen with pre-settled status who came to the UK as a jobseeker 95 days ago and haven't found work - it does appear that you may not currently be eligible for Child Benefit.

This is because:
- Jobseekers from the EU typically have a right to reside for up to 91 days while genuinely seeking work
- After 91 days without employment, that right to reside as a jobseeker generally ends
- Child Benefit requires you to have a right to reside in the UK

**However**, this is a complex area of immigration and benefits law, and there may be other factors or exceptions that could apply to your specific situation.

I would strongly recommend that you:
- Contact a benefits adviser or immigration specialist who can review your full circumstances
- Speak to an organization like Citizens Advice who can provide free, expert guidance

Is there anything else about the general Child Benefit rules you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T23:44:22.684446 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that as an EU citizen with pre-settled status who came to the UK as a jobseeker 95 days ago without finding employment, the user would not be eligible for Child Benefit because their right to reside as a jobseeker expires after 91 days, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Expired)".
