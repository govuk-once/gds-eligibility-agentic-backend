2026-01-28T23:31:54.925734 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:31:56.531148 [actor]: child beneffit for my son zahid he 15 aunt has him

2026-01-28T23:31:58.309107 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you a clarifying question:

**Does Zahid normally live with you, or does he live with your aunt?**

This is important because Child Benefit is usually paid to the person the child lives with.

2026-01-28T23:31:59.677907 [actor]: lives with aunt not me

2026-01-28T23:32:02.135345 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Zahid lives with your aunt.

Since Zahid lives with your aunt rather than with you, this affects eligibility. Generally, Child Benefit is paid to the person the child normally lives with.

Let me ask you: **Are you the one who is mainly responsible for Zahid, even though he lives with your aunt? For example, do you make the main decisions about his upbringing, welfare, and day-to-day care?**

2026-01-28T23:32:03.699560 [actor]: i send money for him evry week

2026-01-28T23:32:06.118853 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. Sending money regularly shows you're contributing financially to Zahid's care.

However, to determine eligibility, I need to understand more about the care arrangement:

**Between you and your aunt, who makes the main decisions about Zahid's day-to-day life - such as his education, health care, and general welfare?**

In other words, who is primarily responsible for looking after him on a daily basis?

2026-01-28T23:32:07.567339 [actor]: aunt does day to day stuff i send 15 pound weekly

2026-01-28T23:32:10.831794 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, it appears that your aunt is the one who is primarily responsible for Zahid's day-to-day care, as she handles his daily welfare and he lives with her.

In this situation, **your aunt would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid**, not you, because:
- Zahid lives with her
- She is responsible for his day-to-day care

The fact that you send money weekly to support him is commendable, but Child Benefit is generally paid to the person the child lives with and who has main responsibility for them.

Let me ask: **Is your aunt currently claiming Child Benefit for Zahid, or are you trying to determine if you could claim it instead of her?**

2026-01-28T23:32:12.247112 [actor]: aunt not claiming child benfit my mum sends 15 pound too

2026-01-28T23:32:15.237064 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your aunt is not currently claiming Child Benefit for Zahid, and that both you and your mum send money to support him.

This is an important situation because if your aunt has main responsibility for Zahid's day-to-day care and he lives with her, she would normally be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit - even if she chooses not to.

Let me ask you this: **Why is Zahid living with your aunt rather than with you or another parent? Is this a temporary arrangement, or is it a long-term care situation?**

This will help me better understand the circumstances and whether there might be any special considerations.

2026-01-28T23:32:16.677085 [actor]: long term arragnement aunt looks after him

2026-01-28T23:32:20.078304 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that this is a long-term arrangement where your aunt looks after Zahid.

Based on what you've told me, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid** because:

- Zahid lives with your aunt (not with you)
- Your aunt is responsible for his day-to-day care
- This is a long-term arrangement

**Your aunt would be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit** since she is the one Zahid lives with and who has main responsibility for him.

The fact that you and your mum contribute financially by sending £15 each week is supportive, but it doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit under the rules.

**Has your aunt considered claiming Child Benefit for Zahid?** She may be entitled to it and should look into making a claim if she hasn't already done so.

2026-01-28T23:32:21.546373 [actor]: we send 30 pound total does that count

2026-01-28T23:32:25.699462 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking whether the £30 total that you and your mum send weekly would make you eligible for Child Benefit.

Unfortunately, **no, the financial contribution alone doesn't make you eligible**. 

Child Benefit eligibility is primarily based on:
- The child living with you
- You being responsible for the child's day-to-day care

Since Zahid lives with your aunt and she handles his day-to-day care, she is the person who would be eligible to claim Child Benefit, regardless of the financial support you provide.

Your financial contributions are helpful and show you care about Zahid's welfare, but they don't transfer the Child Benefit eligibility to you.

**Is there a particular reason your aunt isn't claiming Child Benefit for Zahid?** It would be worth encouraging her to apply, as she appears to meet the eligibility criteria.

2026-01-28T23:32:27.509218 [actor]: so im not eligble then?

2026-01-28T23:32:29.910647 [root_agent]: That's correct - **you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Zahid** based on what you've told me.

This is because:
- Zahid doesn't live with you
- Your aunt is responsible for his day-to-day care
- Child Benefit goes to the person the child lives with and who has main responsibility for them

**Your aunt would be the eligible person** to claim Child Benefit for Zahid since he lives with her and she looks after him.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to help clarify?

2026-01-28T23:32:35.095703 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my son Zahid lives with my aunt who has day-to-day care responsibility, and correctly identified that the aunt would be the eligible claimant, which aligns with the rules that Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with and who has main responsibility for them.
