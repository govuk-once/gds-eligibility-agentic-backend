2026-01-30T09:50:19.477758 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.

**Justification:**

The agent correctly identified that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit for Bella. The key reasoning was sound:

1. **Age consideration**: Bella is 16, so she falls into the category where Child Benefit eligibility depends on whether she's in approved education or training.

2. **Training assessment**: The agent properly established that Bella's training is:
   - Employer-paid (by the local travel agency)
   - Work-based training through direct employment
   - Not registered with any careers service
   - Not part of an approved training program

3. **Correct application of rules**: The agent accurately applied the eligibility criteria, explaining that "Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds is only available if the young person is in **approved education or training**" and that employer-provided work-based training doesn't meet this requirement.

4. **Final determination**: The agent clearly stated "you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Bella in this situation."

This conclusion aligns perfectly with the expected outcome (Not Eligible) and the scenario details, which specifically note that education counts as "approved" only if it is **not paid for by an employer**. The agent's communication was clear, well-reasoned, and reached the correct eligibility determination.
