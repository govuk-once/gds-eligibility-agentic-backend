**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct determination**: The agent clearly stated "Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit for your 18-year-old daughter who is at university doing a degree course."

2. **Accurate reasoning**: The agent properly distinguished between "approved education" (non-advanced education like A-levels) and "advanced education" (university degree courses), explaining that only the former qualifies for continued Child Benefit after age 16.

3. **Clear explanation**: The agent explained that Child Benefit stops on 31 August after the child turns 16 unless they are in approved non-advanced education, and that university degrees do not qualify.

4. **Consistent messaging**: When the user confirmed their understanding ("ok so no child benefit for uni students then"), the agent reinforced the correct answer.

The agent's communication of the eligibility outcome matches the expected outcome that students in advanced education (university degrees) are not eligible for Child Benefit, even if under 20 and living at home.
