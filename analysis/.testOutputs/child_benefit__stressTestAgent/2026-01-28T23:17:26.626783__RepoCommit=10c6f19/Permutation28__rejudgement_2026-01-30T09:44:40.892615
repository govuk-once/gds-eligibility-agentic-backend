**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of the critical issue:** The agent properly identified that the user is on a standard 6-month tourist visa and is a US citizen temporarily visiting the UK with her son.

2. **Accurate application of eligibility criteria:** The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit requires the applicant to be "ordinarily resident in the UK" and that someone on a tourist visa is considered a temporary visitor, not ordinarily resident.

3. **Right to Reside failure:** Although the agent phrased it in terms of "ordinary residence," this directly relates to the Right to Reside requirement. A standard visitor visa subjects holders to immigration control with no recourse to public funds, meaning they lack the qualifying right to reside for benefit purposes.

4. **Clear communication:** The agent communicated the ineligibility decision clearly and provided appropriate reasoning that the user could understand.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome that Maria is **Not Eligible** due to failing Criteria 2 (Immigration Status/Right to Reside), as she only has a standard tourist visa with no qualifying right to reside for benefit purposes.
