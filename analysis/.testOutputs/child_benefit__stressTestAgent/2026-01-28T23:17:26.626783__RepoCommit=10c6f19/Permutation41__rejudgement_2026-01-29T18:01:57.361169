**Justification:**

The agent failed to communicate the correct eligibility outcome. 

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible for Ben (Full Rate), Not Eligible for Jerry.

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Not eligible for either child.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Missed the unequal allocation option:** The user explicitly mentioned reading about "unequal splitting" on gov.uk multiple times. While the agent couldn't verify this guidance, the expected outcome confirms this is a valid approach - Martin can request HMRC to allocate his £40 contribution as £26.05 to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry.

2. **Incorrect threshold analysis:** The agent treated the £40 contribution as an "all or nothing" assessment against the combined rate (£42.55), concluding ineligibility. However, the correct analysis should recognize that:
   - £40 exceeds the eldest child rate (£26.05 for Ben) 
   - By explicitly requesting unequal allocation, Martin qualifies for Ben at full rate
   - The remaining contribution (£13.95) falls short of Jerry's requirement (£17.25)

3. **Wrong conclusion:** The agent concluded "NOT eligible" for both children, when the correct outcome is eligible for Ben but not Jerry. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of how contribution thresholds work when unequal allocation is requested.

The agent's final assessment directly contradicts the expected outcome.
