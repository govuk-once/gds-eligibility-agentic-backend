2026-01-28T23:42:26.790198 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T23:42:28.236981 [actor]: child in care comes home weekends

2026-01-28T23:42:30.452500 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child who is in care but comes home on weekends.

Let me ask you this:

**How many nights per week does your child spend at home with you?**

This is important because eligibility can depend on how much time the child spends with you versus in care.

2026-01-28T23:42:31.921053 [actor]: saturdy to sunday 10am til 11am next day

2026-01-28T23:42:34.426070 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your child stays with you from Saturday 10am until Sunday 11am - that's approximately one night per week.

Let me ask you:

**Are you contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay toward the cost of looking after your child while they are in care?**

(This is important because there are specific rules about claiming Child Benefit when a child is in local authority care.)

2026-01-28T23:42:35.932712 [actor]: no not paying anythng care home is free

2026-01-28T23:42:37.981479 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Is the care home where your child stays run by the local authority (council), or is it a different type of care arrangement?**

This will help me determine your eligibility under the rules for children in care.

2026-01-28T23:42:39.337112 [actor]: local authority care yes council runs it

2026-01-28T23:42:43.320978 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Based on what you've told me, I need to let you know that **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.

Here's why: When a child is being looked after by the local authority (council) in care, Child Benefit cannot be paid for that child. This applies even though your child comes home to stay with you on weekends.

The rules state that if a local authority is looking after your child, you cannot claim Child Benefit for them during that period.

However, if your child's care arrangement changes in the future - for example, if they come back to live with you full-time - you would be able to claim Child Benefit at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T23:42:48.465065 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, a parent CAN claim Child Benefit when their child is in local authority care if they contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit toward the child's care costs. The agent failed to properly explain this option and prematurely concluded ineligibility without exploring whether the claimant might want to make such contributions.
