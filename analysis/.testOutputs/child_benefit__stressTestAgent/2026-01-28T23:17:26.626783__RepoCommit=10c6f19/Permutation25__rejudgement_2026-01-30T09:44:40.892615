**Justification:**

The agent informed the user that they are eligible for Child Benefit, stating they can receive it for "up to 12 weeks" when a child is in local authority care. However, this contradicts the expected outcome and the actual eligibility rules.

According to the UK Government guidance on child benefit (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), Child Benefit stops after **8 weeks** when a child is in local authority care, not 12 weeks. The 12-week rule applies to children in hospital, not local authority care.

In this scenario:
- Leo has been in local authority care for **10 weeks**
- This exceeds the **8-week limit** for local authority care
- Therefore, Beatrice should **not be eligible** for Child Benefit at this point

The expected outcome states "Eligible," but based on the facts provided (10 weeks in local authority care exceeds the 8-week threshold), the user should actually be **ineligible**. The agent's conclusion agrees with the expected outcome but both appear to be incorrect based on the governing rules.

Even considering the spousal contribution exception mentioned in the scenario context, the 8-week time limit for local authority care is a separate criterion that cannot be overridden by making contributions. The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent does not properly reflect the rules regarding the time limit for children in local authority care.
