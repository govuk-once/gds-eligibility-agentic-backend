2026-01-28T23:46:10.170665 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T23:46:11.728157 [actor]: child benfit scotland 16 year old trainig

2026-01-28T23:46:13.282186 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. To help assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to clarify a few things.

**Are you responsible for a 16-year-old who is currently in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T23:46:15.088937 [actor]: yes 16 year old no one left behnd programme edinburgh

2026-01-28T23:46:17.448139 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. A 16-year-old on the "No One Left Behind" programme in Edinburgh could potentially qualify, as this is a type of approved training.

Now, let me ask: **Do you live with this 16-year-old, or are you responsible for them even if they don't live with you?**

2026-01-28T23:46:18.700259 [actor]: live with them yes

2026-01-28T23:46:20.219082 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful information.

Next question: **Does anyone else also claim Child Benefit for this 16-year-old?**

2026-01-28T23:46:21.594970 [actor]: no one else claiming

2026-01-28T23:46:23.978938 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask: **Are you or your partner's individual income over £60,000 per year?** 

(This is important because if either of you earns over this amount, it may affect whether you need to pay a tax charge, though you can still claim Child Benefit.)

2026-01-28T23:46:25.280923 [actor]: income benfit tax charge whats the limit

2026-01-28T23:46:28.261304 [root_agent]: Good question! Let me clarify:

- You can claim Child Benefit regardless of your income
- However, if either you or your partner has an individual income over £60,000 per year, the higher earner will need to pay a tax charge called the "High Income Child Benefit Charge"
- This charge increases gradually between £60,000 and £80,000
- If either of you earns £80,000 or more individually, the tax charge equals the full amount of Child Benefit received

**So, to continue assessing your eligibility: Does either you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year?**

2026-01-28T23:46:29.625913 [actor]: no under 60000

2026-01-28T23:46:31.386984 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now, one more important question: **Are you (or your partner if you have one) living in the UK, or are you a Crown servant or member of the armed forces posted overseas?**

2026-01-28T23:46:32.715750 [actor]: living in edinburgh scotland uk

2026-01-28T23:46:36.109661 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

✓ You are responsible for a 16-year-old in approved training (No One Left Behind programme)
✓ The young person lives with you
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for them
✓ Neither you nor your partner earns over £60,000 (so no tax charge applies)
✓ You live in the UK (Scotland)

**You can now apply for Child Benefit.** You'll need to apply and continue claiming as long as your 16-year-old remains in approved education or training, up until they turn 20.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-28T23:46:40.931282 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria including the child's age and approved training status, living arrangements, absence of other claimants, income threshold for tax charges, and UK residency, providing correct information throughout the conversation.
