**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **Not Eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Criteria 1 - Hospital Duration (>12 weeks):** The child has been in hospital for 14 weeks, exceeding the 12-week threshold. ✓

2. **Criteria 2 - Hospital/Authority Pays for Care:** The user confirmed the hospital pays for everything (food, clothes, etc.). ✓

3. **Expenditure Exception:** The user visits daily for hours but explicitly stated they do not spend money on the child ("hospital pays everything they give food clothes evrything"). According to the rules, the exception after 12 weeks requires the parent to "regularly spend money" on the child's upkeep. Visiting alone, without financial contribution, does not satisfy this exception. ✓

The agent accurately applied the rule from https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care that Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks of continuous hospital care when the hospital/local authority covers the costs and there's no regular expenditure by the parent.

**Conclusion:** The agent's determination of "NOT eligible" aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible" for this scenario.
