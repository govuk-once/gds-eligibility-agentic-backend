**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit for Sofia, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Reasoning:**

1. **Correct criteria applied:** The agent properly identified that Child Benefit eligibility for children aged 16-20 requires the child to be in approved education or training.

2. **Accurate assessment of facts:** The agent noted that Sofia:
   - Is 18 years old
   - Left school 2 years ago
   - Is not in approved education or training
   - Works 30 hours per week as a receptionist

3. **Clear communication of ineligibility:** The agent explicitly stated "Unfortunately, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia" and provided clear reasons why.

4. **Alignment with expected outcome:** According to the scenario, Sofia is 18, left school two years ago, works 30 hours a week, and is not taking any courses. Per gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit stops at 16 unless the child is in approved education or training (and working 24+ hours a week typically disqualifies them). The agent's conclusion of ineligibility matches the expected "Not Eligible" outcome.

The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome.
