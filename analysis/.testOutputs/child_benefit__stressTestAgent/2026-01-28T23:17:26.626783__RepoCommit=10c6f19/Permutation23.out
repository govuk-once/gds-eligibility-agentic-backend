2026-01-28T23:29:58.681551 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T23:30:00.284043 [actor]: child benefit groceries payment daughter

2026-01-28T23:30:02.195062 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. It sounds like you have a daughter and may be asking about Child Benefit.

To help assess your eligibility, let me ask:

**Is your daughter under 16 years old, or is she under 20 and in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T23:30:03.618490 [actor]: daughter 12 years old grocerys £120

2026-01-28T23:30:05.612684 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your daughter is 12 years old. That means she meets the age requirement.

Now, let me ask you another important question:

**Are you responsible for your daughter? By this I mean, does she normally live with you?**

2026-01-28T23:30:07.141658 [actor]: no dont live together buy clothes food every month

2026-01-28T23:30:09.386483 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is an important point - you mentioned that your daughter doesn't live with you, but you buy clothes and food for her every month.

Let me ask a clarifying question:

**Who does your daughter normally live with - is it another parent, a guardian, or someone else?**

2026-01-28T23:30:10.659511 [actor]: lives with mother groceries delivery 4 weeks

2026-01-28T23:30:12.462182 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your daughter lives with her mother, and you provide groceries for her every 4 weeks.

This is important for determining eligibility. Let me ask:

**Does your daughter's mother currently receive Child Benefit for your daughter?**

2026-01-28T23:30:13.951642 [actor]: dunno just want know if im eligable contribute £120 every 4 weeks

2026-01-28T23:30:17.280102 [root_agent]: I understand you want to know about your own eligibility. Let me explain the situation based on what you've told me.

For Child Benefit, the key rule is that **only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child**, and this is normally the person the child lives with.

Since your daughter lives with her mother, her mother would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit.

However, let me ask you this important question:

**Do you contribute to your daughter's upbringing because you have a formal arrangement (such as a court order or agreement), or is this something you do voluntarily to support her?**

This will help me give you the most accurate information about your situation.

2026-01-28T23:30:18.819975 [actor]: just buy grocerys clothes £120 deliver to her every 4 weeks support daughter

2026-01-28T23:30:22.397993 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. Based on what you've told me, I need to give you an important answer about Child Benefit eligibility.

**You would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit in your situation.**

Here's why:

- Child Benefit can only be claimed by **one person** for each child
- It's normally claimed by the person the child **lives with**
- Since your daughter lives with her mother, her mother is the person who would be eligible to claim Child Benefit

The financial support you're providing (£120 every 4 weeks for groceries and clothes) is commendable and important for your daughter, but it doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit when she doesn't live with you.

**The person who has your daughter living with them - her mother - is the one who can claim Child Benefit.**

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T23:30:24.204170 [actor]: ok understood not eligble thanks

2026-01-28T23:30:27.334667 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly assessed that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because the child does not live with them, correctly applying the rule that only one person can claim Child Benefit per child and it must normally be the person the child lives with.
