**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Amit is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Responsibility (Criteria 1)**: ✓ Agent confirmed Amit is responsible as his daughter lives with him
2. **Child's Age and Education (Criteria 2)**: ✓ Agent verified daughter is 17 (under 20) and in approved education (A-levels)
3. **Residency and Immigration (Criteria 3)**: ✓ Agent confirmed Amit is a British citizen with right to reside
4. **Living Arrangements (Criteria 4)**: ✓ Agent confirmed daughter lives with Amit in London
5. **No Duplicate Claims**: ✓ Agent verified no one else is claiming
6. **High Income Charge**: ✓ Agent appropriately mentioned the £60,000 threshold (Amit earns £40,000, so not liable)

The agent systematically worked through all relevant eligibility criteria, asked appropriate clarifying questions, and reached the correct conclusion that Amit is eligible for Child Benefit. The agent also provided helpful additional information about the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which was relevant context even though it doesn't affect Amit's eligibility.

The communicated outcome matches the expected outcome: **Eligible**.
