**Justification:**

The agent concluded that Kevin is **not eligible** for Child Benefit because his daughter does not live with him. However, according to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, a person can still be eligible for Child Benefit even when the child doesn't live with them, provided they contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit toward the child's upkeep.

**Analysis of Kevin's situation:**

1. **Contribution frequency:** Kevin contributes £120 every 4 weeks, which equals £30 per week (£120 ÷ 4 = £30/week)

2. **Child Benefit threshold:** The weekly Child Benefit rate for one child is £26.05 (as of current rates)

3. **Sufficiency:** Kevin's £30/week contribution exceeds the £26.05 threshold

4. **Regularity:** The contributions are made regularly every 4 weeks in the form of groceries and clothes

According to the guidance, Kevin **is eligible** to claim Child Benefit because he contributes at least the equivalent amount regularly, even though his daughter doesn't live with him. The agent failed to explore this exception and incorrectly concluded Kevin was not eligible.

The expected outcome is **Eligible**, but the agent communicated **Not Eligible**. Therefore, the agent's determination does not agree with the expected outcome.
