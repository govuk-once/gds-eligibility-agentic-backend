2026-01-28T23:32:36.780587 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T23:32:38.352947 [actor]: child benefit baby 6 months old cant afford nappys

2026-01-28T23:32:40.131247 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. So you have a 6-month-old baby, which means you do have a child under 16.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T23:32:41.607334 [actor]: yes live uk need money for baby

2026-01-28T23:32:43.757913 [root_agent]: Good, you live in the UK and have a 6-month-old baby.

Next question: **Are you responsible for the child? This means do you live with the baby and are you the main person looking after them?**

2026-01-28T23:32:45.352137 [actor]: live with my parents baby mia I look after her

2026-01-28T23:32:47.549471 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you live with your parents along with baby Mia, and you look after her.

Next question: **Are you the person who is mainly responsible for Mia's care, or does someone else (like one of your parents) take the main responsibility for looking after her?**

This is important because only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, and it should be the person who has main responsibility for the child.

2026-01-28T23:32:48.999834 [actor]: i take care of mia feed her change her im the mum

2026-01-28T23:32:51.083159 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. As Mia's mum and the person who takes main responsibility for her care, that's good.

Next question: **Do you or your partner (if you have one) earn over £60,000 a year, or does anyone else in your household claim Child Benefit for Mia?**

2026-01-28T23:32:52.588786 [actor]: no dont work im 15 nobody claims for mia yet

2026-01-28T23:32:55.164930 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is an important detail - you're 15 years old.

Let me ask: **Is Mia your child, or are you looking after her for someone else (for example, a sibling or relative)?**

I need to understand your relationship to Mia to assess your eligibility correctly.

2026-01-28T23:32:56.881722 [actor]: mia is my baby shes mine i had her

2026-01-28T23:33:00.827767 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Mia is your baby.

Based on the information you've given me, let me assess your eligibility:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Mia) who is under 16
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are responsible for Mia - you're her mum and you look after her
✓ You live with Mia
✓ Nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ You don't earn over £60,000 (or have a partner who does)

The fact that you're 15 years old doesn't prevent you from claiming Child Benefit. You can claim Child Benefit even if you're under 16 yourself, as long as you're responsible for a child.

**Next steps:** You should apply for Child Benefit as soon as possible. You can claim it backdated for up to 3 months, so it's important to apply now. The current rate is £25.60 per week for your first or only child.

Do you have any questions about how to apply or anything else about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T23:33:06.177195 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a 15-year-old mother living in the UK who is the primary caregiver for her 6-month-old baby is eligible for Child Benefit, correctly noting that being under 16 herself does not prevent her from claiming, and provided accurate information about eligibility criteria and next steps.
