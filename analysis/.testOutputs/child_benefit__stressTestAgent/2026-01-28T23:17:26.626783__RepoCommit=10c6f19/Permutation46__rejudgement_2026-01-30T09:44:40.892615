**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Expired)."

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Accurate identification of the time limit:** The agent correctly identified that EU citizens with pre-settled status claiming as jobseekers have a right to reside for up to **91 days** while genuinely seeking work.

2. **Correct application to the user's situation:** The agent recognized that the user has been in the UK for **95 days** as a jobseeker without finding employment, which exceeds the 91-day limit.

3. **Clear communication of ineligibility:** The agent explicitly stated: "it does appear that you may not currently be eligible for Child Benefit" and explained that "After 91 days without employment, that right to reside as a jobseeker generally ends" and "Child Benefit requires you to have a right to reside in the UK."

4. **Matches expected outcome:** The expected outcome is "Not Eligible (Expired)" - the agent communicated that the user's right to reside as a jobseeker has expired after 91 days, making them ineligible for Child Benefit.

The agent's conclusion aligns with the scenario parameters and correctly applies the eligibility criteria, appropriately recommending specialist advice for this complex situation.
