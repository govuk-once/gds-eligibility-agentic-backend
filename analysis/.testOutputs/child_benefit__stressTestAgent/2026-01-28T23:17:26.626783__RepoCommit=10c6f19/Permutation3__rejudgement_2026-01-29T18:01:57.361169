**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome is that the user should be **Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)**.

According to the official gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), there is an "extension period" that applies when a young person aged 16 or 17 leaves education or approved training. During this extension period, which lasts up to 20 weeks, Child Benefit can continue if the young person is registered with a careers service (or Connexions) and is looking for work or training.

In this scenario:
- The son is 17 years old
- He left school in June (within the 20-week window, as it's currently August)
- He is registered with the careers service
- He is actively looking for an apprenticeship

These facts clearly meet the criteria for the extension period. The agent failed to recognize or apply this extension rule and incorrectly concluded the user was not eligible. The agent only mentioned that eligibility would resume once the son actually starts an apprenticeship, completely missing the interim extension period that currently applies.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error. The agent's communicated outcome does not agree with the expected outcome.
