2026-01-29T18:09:44.858943 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for child benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent properly identified that:
1. The daughter is 18 years old and studying an HNC (Higher National Certificate) at college
2. HNC is Level 4 qualification, which is advanced education (above A-level standard)
3. Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds only applies to non-advanced education or approved training
4. Since HNC is advanced education, it does not qualify for Child Benefit purposes

The agent clearly stated: "Unfortunately, this means you are not eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter" and provided accurate reasoning that aligns with gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, which specifies that continued payments for 16-19 year olds require non-advanced education (up to and including Level 3/A-level standard).

The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" and the agent communicated this outcome correctly with proper justification based on the education level being advanced rather than non-advanced.
