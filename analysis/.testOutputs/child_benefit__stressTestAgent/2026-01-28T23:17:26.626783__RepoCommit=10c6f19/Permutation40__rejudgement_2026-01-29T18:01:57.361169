2026-01-29T18:08:53.463515 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome of "Eligible (until week 12)."

**Justification:**

The agent accurately:
1. Identified that the child (Simon, age 15) was in hospital under the Mental Health Act for 10 weeks
2. Applied the correct 12-week rule for hospital stays (not the 8-week custody rule)
3. Clearly communicated that the parent remains eligible to receive Child Benefit during this period
4. Explicitly warned that "if your son's hospital stay extends beyond 12 weeks in total, the rules may change"
5. Confirmed the parent was correctly receiving payments and should continue to do so

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome: the parent is eligible for Child Benefit until week 12 of the hospital stay. Since the child has been detained for 10 weeks, the parent remains within the eligible period. The agent provided accurate guidance consistent with gov.uk rules for children in hospital or residential accommodation.
