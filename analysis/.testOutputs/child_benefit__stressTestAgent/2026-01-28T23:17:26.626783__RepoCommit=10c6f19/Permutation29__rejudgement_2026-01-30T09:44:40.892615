**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Age criteria assessed**: The agent confirmed the child is 17 (over 16), so doesn't automatically qualify on age alone.

2. **Education/Training status verified**: The agent established that Jordan is not in college, not working, and critically, **not registered with any approved careers service**.

3. **Extension eligibility properly evaluated**: The agent correctly explained that:
   - Child Benefit can continue until 31 August following the year a young person leaves education (if they left after the first Monday in April)
   - Since Jordan left in June (after this date), benefit would have continued until 31 August
   - After 31 August, benefit stops unless the child is in education, training, or registered with an approved careers service

4. **Clear final determination**: The agent explicitly stated "**you would not currently be eligible for Child Benefit**" with proper justification.

The agent's assessment matches the scenario exactly: Jordan is 17, not in education/employment/training, not registered with any careers service, and therefore does not qualify for the 20-week extension or ongoing Child Benefit. The communication was clear, methodical, and reached the correct conclusion of **Not Eligible**.
