2026-01-29T18:09:11.027165 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent systematically verified all relevant eligibility criteria:

1. **Age requirement**: Confirmed the child is 17 (under 20)
2. **Approved training**: Crucially recognized that a Welsh Government Foundation Apprenticeship qualifies as approved training for Child Benefit purposes - this demonstrates understanding of the regional exception for Wales mentioned in the scenario
3. **Responsibility**: Confirmed the parent lives with and is responsible for the child
4. **UK residency**: Verified both live in Cardiff, Wales (UK)
5. **Immigration status**: Confirmed British citizenship
6. **Exclusive claim**: Verified no one else is claiming

The agent's final determination explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided a comprehensive checklist of why the user qualifies. This directly aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

The agent also appropriately mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge as additional relevant information, which shows thoroughness without affecting the core eligibility determination.
