**Justification:**

The agent's eligibility determination does not align with the expected outcome.

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible for Ben (Full Rate), Not Eligible for Jerry. (By explicitly allocating, Martin saves one claim).

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Not eligible for either child.

**Key Issues with Agent's Assessment:**

1. **Missed the Unequal Allocation Mechanism:** The scenario explicitly states Martin can "ask HMRC to consider unequal splitting" and request that £26.05 be allocated to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry. The agent repeatedly denied this was possible, despite the user persistently raising this point.

2. **Incorrect Threshold Analysis:** With Martin's £40 contribution:
   - If allocated as £26.05 to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry
   - Ben's threshold: £26.05 (Martin pays £26.05) → **PASS** (eligible)
   - Jerry's threshold: £17.25 (Martin pays £13.95) → **FAIL** (not eligible)
   - This matches the expected outcome

3. **Wrong Conclusion:** The agent concluded Martin was not eligible for either child, when the correct outcome is eligibility for Ben at full rate only.

4. **Failure to Recognize Valid Process:** When the user mentioned reading about "unequal splitting" on gov.uk (which aligns with the scenario's Criteria 3), the agent dismissed this rather than exploring whether such an exception request mechanism exists.

The agent's determination directly contradicts the expected eligibility outcome.
