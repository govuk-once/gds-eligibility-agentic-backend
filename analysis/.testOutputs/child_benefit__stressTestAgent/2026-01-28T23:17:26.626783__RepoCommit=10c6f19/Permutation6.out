2026-01-28T23:19:54.070038 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T23:19:55.509952 [actor]: child in hospital long time need money help

2026-01-28T23:19:57.713102 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. I understand your child has been in hospital for a long time and you need financial help.

To assess your Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in hospital, I need to ask:

How long has your child been in hospital - has it been more than 12 weeks (84 days) or less than 12 weeks?

2026-01-28T23:19:59.115782 [actor]: daughter hospitel 14 weeks serious condtion

2026-01-28T23:20:03.316228 [root_agent]: I understand your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks with a serious condition. I'm sorry to hear she's unwell.

Since your daughter has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks, this affects Child Benefit eligibility. According to the rules, you can usually only get Child Benefit for a child in hospital for up to 12 weeks (84 days). After that, you may need to stop your claim unless certain conditions apply.

However, let me ask you an important question:

Are you still contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay (currently £25.60 per week for the eldest child or £16.95 for additional children) towards the cost of supporting your daughter while she's in hospital?

2026-01-28T23:20:04.626726 [actor]: spending 30 pounds weekly books pyjamas special food chloe

2026-01-28T23:20:07.392516 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're spending £30 weekly on books, pyjamas, and special food for Chloe, which is more than the Child Benefit rate, this is an important factor.

Let me ask you another question to better assess your situation:

Do you still have parental responsibility for Chloe, and is she expected to return home to live with you after she leaves hospital?

2026-01-28T23:20:08.991205 [actor]: yes im her mum visit every day she comes home when better

2026-01-28T23:20:12.123810 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. As Chloe's mum with parental responsibility, and given that you visit every day, are contributing more than the Child Benefit amount (£30 weekly), and she will return home when she's better, this is very helpful information.

Now let me ask you a few more questions to complete the eligibility assessment:

How old is Chloe?

2026-01-28T23:20:13.329525 [actor]: chloe is 6 years old

2026-01-28T23:20:15.414220 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Chloe is 6 years old, which means she's definitely under 16.

Let me ask you:

Are you responsible for Chloe - meaning, before she went into hospital, did she normally live with you?

2026-01-28T23:20:16.913920 [actor]: yes she lives with me im her mum

2026-01-28T23:20:18.518902 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your circumstances:

Are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-28T23:20:20.082063 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T23:20:21.843464 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you live in the UK.

One more important question:

Has anyone else already claimed Child Benefit for Chloe?

2026-01-28T23:20:23.162046 [actor]: no just me nobody else

2026-01-28T23:20:27.307928 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Chloe.**

Here's why:

✓ Chloe is 6 years old (under 16)
✓ She normally lives with you and you're her mum with parental responsibility
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else has claimed Child Benefit for her
✓ Even though Chloe has been in hospital for 14 weeks (more than the usual 12-week limit), you are still contributing at least the Child Benefit amount towards her costs (you're spending £30 weekly on books, pyjamas, and special food)
✓ She's expected to return home to live with you when she's better

Because you're continuing to contribute to Chloe's costs while she's in hospital, you should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit even beyond the 12-week period.

Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit, or would you like to know how to make a claim if you haven't already?

2026-01-28T23:20:33.302362 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that despite the child being hospitalized for more than 12 weeks (which normally would make someone ineligible), the exception applies because the parent is contributing at least the Child Benefit amount (£30 weekly, which exceeds the £25.60 rate) towards the child's costs, maintains parental responsibility, and the child will return home - correctly resulting in an "Eligible (via Exception)" determination.
