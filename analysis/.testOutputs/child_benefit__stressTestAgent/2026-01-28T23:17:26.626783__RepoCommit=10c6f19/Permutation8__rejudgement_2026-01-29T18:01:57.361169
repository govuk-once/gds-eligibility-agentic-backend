**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit but subject to a tax charge**, which aligns with the expected outcome: "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Eligibility confirmed**: The agent clearly stated "You ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit" and verified all criteria (child under 16, responsibility, residency, main carer status).

2. **Tax charge properly explained**: The agent identified that the user's £75,000 income triggers the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) because it exceeds the £60,000 threshold.

3. **Accurate calculation**: The agent correctly noted that approximately 75% of the benefit would be clawed back at the £75,000 income level (consistent with the 1% charge per £200 over £60,000).

4. **Clear options presented**: The agent explained both options:
   - Claim and receive payments (then repay via tax)
   - Claim but opt out of payments (still preserving NI credits)

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome perfectly: the user is eligible to claim Child Benefit, but will face a tax charge due to high income. This is precisely the scenario described in "Permutation 8: The High Earner."
