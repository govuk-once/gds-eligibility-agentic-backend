2026-01-28T23:34:29.847989 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:34:31.165016 [actor]: yes daughter 18 univeristy

2026-01-28T23:34:33.541326 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help determine your eligibility, I need to understand your daughter's situation a bit better.

**Is your 18-year-old daughter currently enrolled in approved education or training?** (This would typically include full-time non-advanced education such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or similar qualifications, but not university degree courses)

2026-01-28T23:34:35.037336 [actor]: shes at uni doing degree lives at home

2026-01-28T23:34:37.025548 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me ask you the next important question:

**Are you the person responsible for your daughter?** In other words, do you live with her and are you responsible for her day-to-day care and financial support?

2026-01-28T23:34:38.521581 [actor]: yes she lives with me I pay for evrything

2026-01-28T23:34:39.906210 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Now I need to ask about your residency status:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T23:34:41.257057 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T23:34:45.550907 [root_agent]: Thank you. Based on the information you've provided, I need to give you some important guidance about your eligibility.

**Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit for your 18-year-old daughter who is at university doing a degree course.**

Here's why: Child Benefit stops when a young person reaches age 20, BUT it actually stops earlier - on 31 August (known as the "terminal date") after they turn 16 - **unless** they are in approved education or training. 

The key point is that approved education means **full-time non-advanced education** (like A-levels or Scottish Highers). University degree courses are considered "advanced education" and do not qualify.

So even though your daughter lives with you and you support her financially, Child Benefit would have stopped on 31 August after she turned 16 (or when she started her university degree course if that was later).

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-28T23:34:46.992501 [actor]: ok so no child benefit for uni students then

2026-01-28T23:34:50.589062 [root_agent]: That's correct - **no Child Benefit for students doing university degree courses**, even if they're under 20 and living at home with you.

Child Benefit can continue after age 16 only if the young person is in approved **non-advanced** education or training (like A-levels, T-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or similar). University degree courses are classified as advanced education, so they don't qualify.

The benefit would have stopped on 31 August after your daughter turned 16 or when she started her degree, whichever was later.

I hope that clarifies things for you. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T23:34:53.234398 [actor]: no thats all thanks

2026-01-28T23:34:55.355702 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available for children in advanced education such as university degree courses, and correctly stated that it stops on 31 August after the child turns 16 unless they are in approved non-advanced education.
