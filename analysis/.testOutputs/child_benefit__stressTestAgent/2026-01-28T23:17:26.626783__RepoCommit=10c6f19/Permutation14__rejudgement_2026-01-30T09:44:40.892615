**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct Assessment of Temporary Absence:** The agent properly recognized that the child's stay with the grandmother is temporary (due to the mother's recovery from surgery) and does not disqualify the mother from Child Benefit.

2. **Proper Application of the 8-Week Rule:** Although the agent didn't explicitly cite the 8-week rule, the principle was correctly applied. The scenario indicates Noah has been with his grandmother for 6 weeks (less than 8 weeks), and the grandmother has not claimed Child Benefit. The agent correctly determined that the mother retains eligibility.

3. **Verification of Key Criteria:**
   - Child under 16: ✓ (6 years old)
   - Lives in UK: ✓ 
   - Responsible for the child: ✓ (single mother)
   - Continues to pay for child's upbringing: ✓
   - Temporary arrangement: ✓

4. **Alignment with Gov.uk Guidance:** According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, you can continue to get Child Benefit for 8 weeks after your child goes to live with someone else, provided no one else claims. This applies here.

The agent's communication clearly stated eligibility with appropriate reasoning, matching the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
