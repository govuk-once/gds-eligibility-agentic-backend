**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit via the hospital stay exception**.

The agent accurately identified all relevant factors:

1. **Standard eligibility criteria met**: Child under 16 (Chloe is 6), parental responsibility established, lives in UK, no duplicate claims
2. **Hospital stay exceeds 12 weeks**: Correctly noted that 14 weeks exceeds the standard 12-week limit
3. **Exception applies**: The agent properly recognized that the parent's regular contributions of £30 weekly (exceeding the Child Benefit rate of £25.60) qualify as an exception to the 12-week hospital rule
4. **Correct outcome communicated**: The agent explicitly stated "Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Chloe" and explained that "you should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit even beyond the 12-week period"

This aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)** as specified in the scenario. The agent demonstrated proper understanding of the hospital stay rules and the spending exception outlined in https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care.
