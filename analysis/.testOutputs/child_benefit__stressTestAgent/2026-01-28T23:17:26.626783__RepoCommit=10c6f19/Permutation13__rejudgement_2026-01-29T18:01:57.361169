**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Adoption placement criteria met**: The agent correctly identified that the user can claim Child Benefit even though the final adoption order has not been granted. The agent explicitly stated: "You can claim Child Benefit even though the adoption isn't finalized yet, as long as the child is living with you and you're responsible for them."

2. **Accurate understanding of adoption rules**: According to gov.uk guidance, you can claim Child Benefit as soon as a child you're adopting comes to live with you - you do not need to wait for the final adoption order. The agent applied this rule correctly.

3. **All eligibility criteria verified**:
   - Child under 16 (Maya is 4) ✓
   - Child lives with applicants ✓
   - Responsible for day-to-day care ✓
   - Normally live in UK ✓
   - No one else claiming ✓
   - No immigration restrictions ✓

4. **Clear communication**: The agent provided a clear, unambiguous statement of eligibility and explained the reasoning comprehensively.

The agent's assessment aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of "Eligible" for this prospective adopter scenario.
