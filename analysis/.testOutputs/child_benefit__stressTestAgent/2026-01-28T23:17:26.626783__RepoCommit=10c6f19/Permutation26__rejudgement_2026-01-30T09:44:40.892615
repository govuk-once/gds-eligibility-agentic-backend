**Justification:**

The agent concluded that Mo is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and the specific guidance on contributions, Mo should be **eligible**.

**Key Issue:**

The agent failed to properly apply the rule about aggregated contributions from multiple people. According to the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, a person can claim Child Benefit for a child living elsewhere if they contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount to the child's upkeep (£26.05 for the eldest/only child).

**Critical Point from the Scenario:**

The scenario explicitly states that "contributions still count if more than one person is contributing, as long as the **total contributions** are worth at least as much as the Child Benefit." Mo contributes £15 and his mother contributes £15, totaling £30 per week, which exceeds the £26.05 threshold.

**What the Agent Missed:**

When the user specifically asked "we send 30 pound total does that count," the agent dismissed this by saying "the financial contribution alone doesn't make you eligible" and focused only on physical custody and day-to-day care. The agent should have recognized that combined contributions of £30/week meet the financial threshold for eligibility under the special rule for children living with someone else.

**Conclusion:**

The agent's eligibility determination (not eligible) contradicts the expected outcome (eligible), making this a failure.
