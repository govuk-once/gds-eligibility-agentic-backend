**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome for this scenario is **Eligible**.

According to the scenario details, Leo spends 25 hours at home each week (Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am), which exceeds the 24-hour threshold mentioned in the criteria. The gov.uk guidance on children in care states that you may still be able to claim Child Benefit if your child spends at least one night a week at home, or at least 24 hours a week with you.

While the agent correctly identified that the child is in local authority care and asked relevant questions, they failed to recognize that:

1. The child spends more than 24 hours per week at home (25 hours total)
2. This meets the threshold for potential eligibility even when a child is in care

The agent prematurely concluded ineligibility based solely on the child being in local authority care, without properly applying the time-at-home exception. The evaluation judge also noted this error, pointing out that the agent "failed to properly explain this option and prematurely concluded ineligibility."

Therefore, the agent communicated an incorrect eligibility outcome that does not agree with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
