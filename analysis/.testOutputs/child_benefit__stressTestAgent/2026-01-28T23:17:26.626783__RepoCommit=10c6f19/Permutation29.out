2026-01-28T23:33:30.092825 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking:

**Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T23:33:31.950689 [actor]: child 17 not in colege or wrking

2026-01-28T23:33:34.968264 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old child who is not in college or working.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is your 17-year-old child registered with a government-approved careers service, such as a career service provider or Connexions service?**

(This is important because young people aged 16-19 who have left education or training can still qualify if they're registered with an approved careers service and waiting to start education or training.)

2026-01-28T23:33:36.396257 [actor]: no not registred anywher just at home

2026-01-28T23:33:40.314436 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your 17-year-old is not registered anywhere and is just at home.

Based on the eligibility criteria, **Child Benefit is generally available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training**. Since your child is 17, not in college, not working, and not registered with an approved careers service, they would not meet the eligibility requirements for Child Benefit.

However, let me ask one more question to be thorough:

**Did your child leave education or training before 30 April (or the last Monday in April or earlier)?**

(This matters because if they left education or training on or after the first Monday in April, Child Benefit can continue until 31 August that year.)

2026-01-28T23:33:41.989486 [actor]: left scool last june after gcses

2026-01-28T23:33:45.904773 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your child left school last June after GCSEs.

Based on the Child Benefit eligibility rules:

- Child Benefit can continue until **31 August** following the year a young person leaves education, as long as they left on or after the first Monday in April
- Since your child left school in June (which is after the first Monday in April), Child Benefit would have continued until 31 August of that year
- After 31 August, Child Benefit stops unless the young person is in approved education or training, or registered with an approved careers service

**So, you would not currently be eligible for Child Benefit** for your 17-year-old, as they are not in education, training, or registered with an approved careers service, and the extension period (until 31 August) has now passed.

Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T23:33:48.755247 [actor]: ok thanks

2026-01-28T23:33:50.744696 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the Child Benefit rules: the child is 17, not in approved education or training, not registered with an approved careers service, and the extension period until 31 August (following leaving school in June) has passed, making the claimant ineligible.
