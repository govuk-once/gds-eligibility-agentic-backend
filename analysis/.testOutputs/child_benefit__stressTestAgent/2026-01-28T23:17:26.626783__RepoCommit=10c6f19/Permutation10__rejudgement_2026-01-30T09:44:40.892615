**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of circumstances:** The agent properly identified that Liam is a fostered child placed by the local authority, and that the council pays a fostering allowance covering accommodation and maintenance.

2. **Accurate application of rules:** According to the eligibility criteria, when a local council pays for a child's accommodation or maintenance, the foster carer cannot claim Child Benefit. The agent correctly stated: "when a child is looked after by a local authority... Child Benefit cannot be claimed."

3. **Clear explanation:** The agent provided a clear rationale explaining that the local authority is considered responsible for the child and that the fostering allowance replaces Child Benefit.

4. **Matches expected outcome:** The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" and the agent definitively communicated "you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam."

The agent's assessment was accurate, well-reasoned, and correctly applied the Child Benefit eligibility rules for foster children where the local authority provides financial support.
