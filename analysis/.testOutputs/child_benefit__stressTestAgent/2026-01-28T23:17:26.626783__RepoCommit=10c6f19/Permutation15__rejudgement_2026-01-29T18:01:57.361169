**Justification:**

The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome. Let me break down why:

**Expected Outcome:** Not Eligible

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** "Unfortunately, based on these circumstances, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit."

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct Assessment of Responsibility Criteria:** The agent properly identified that since Mike doesn't live with his daughter, he would need to contribute at least the Child Benefit rate (£25.60/week, though the scenario states £26.05/week - minor variance) to be considered "responsible" for the child.

2. **Accurate Calculation:** The agent correctly noted that Mike's £10/week contribution plus an annual birthday present falls short of the required threshold.

3. **Clear Communication:** The agent explicitly stated Mike would "not be eligible" and explained why, identifying the mother as the person who would be eligible to claim.

4. **Proper Legal Understanding:** The agent demonstrated correct understanding of the Child Benefit rules regarding non-resident parents and the financial contribution requirement.

The agent's determination aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible" based on Criteria 1 (Responsibility) not being met. The communication was clear, accurate, and well-reasoned.
