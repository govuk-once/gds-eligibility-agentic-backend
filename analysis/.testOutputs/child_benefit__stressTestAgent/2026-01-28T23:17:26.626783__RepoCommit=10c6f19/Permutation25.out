2026-01-28T23:31:15.609990 [root_agent]: I'll be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T23:31:17.118731 [actor]: child in care 10 weeks cant pay anythng husband pays 30 a week

2026-01-28T23:31:20.109644 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I can see that you mentioned a child in care and your husband pays £30 a week.

Let me ask you a clarifying question:

Is your child currently living in local authority care or residential care, and if so, are you (or your husband) still contributing at least the amount your local council says you should pay towards the child's care?

2026-01-28T23:31:21.584649 [actor]: yes husband pays 30 pounds to carer evry week for upkeep

2026-01-28T23:31:23.999687 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your husband is paying £30 per week towards your child's upkeep while they are in care.

To help me assess your eligibility properly, I need to understand a bit more about your situation:

Is your child living with a local authority foster carer or in a care home arranged by the local council, or are they living with someone else in a different arrangement?

2026-01-28T23:31:25.363957 [actor]: local authority care foster carer

2026-01-28T23:31:27.847475 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your child is in local authority foster care, and your husband is contributing £30 per week towards their upkeep.

This is an important question: Has your local council told you how much you should contribute towards your child's care costs? In other words, do you know if the £30 per week your husband is paying is at least the amount the council says you should pay?

2026-01-28T23:31:29.215388 [actor]: no council hasnt said anything just husband pays 30 pounds

2026-01-28T23:31:31.835075 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So the council hasn't specified an amount you should contribute, and your husband is voluntarily paying £30 per week.

Let me ask you another important question:

How long has your child been in local authority foster care? You mentioned "10 weeks" earlier - is that correct, or has it been a different length of time?

2026-01-28T23:31:33.198586 [actor]: yes 10 weeks in care

2026-01-28T23:31:35.260154 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your child has been in local authority foster care for 10 weeks.

This is important to understand: When your child first went into care 10 weeks ago, were you already receiving Child Benefit for them, or are you applying for Child Benefit now for the first time?

2026-01-28T23:31:36.659911 [actor]: was getting it before went into care

2026-01-28T23:31:38.807524 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful to know. You were receiving Child Benefit before your child went into care 10 weeks ago.

Now I need to ask you an important question:

Are you still living in the UK, and is your child in foster care within the UK?

2026-01-28T23:31:40.136454 [actor]: yes uk both of us

2026-01-28T23:31:41.694957 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both you and your child are in the UK.

Now, let me ask you this important question:

Do you have any other children that you're responsible for, or is this your only child?

2026-01-28T23:31:43.396911 [actor]: only child leo

2026-01-28T23:31:47.605051 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Leo is your only child.

Based on the information you've provided, let me explain your situation regarding Child Benefit:

**You should still be eligible for Child Benefit** for Leo while he is in local authority foster care, because:

1. You were already receiving Child Benefit before Leo went into care
2. Leo has been in care for 10 weeks (which is under 12 weeks)
3. Your husband is contributing towards Leo's upkeep (£30 per week)

**Important:** You can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **12 weeks** (approximately 3 months) when a child is in local authority care, as long as you're contributing towards their upkeep.

Since Leo has been in care for 10 weeks, you still have approximately 2 weeks left where you can receive Child Benefit under these rules.

After 12 weeks in care, your Child Benefit will normally stop, even if you continue contributing to Leo's care costs.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-28T23:31:52.993624 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately informed me that I remain eligible for Child Benefit while my child has been in local authority foster care for 10 weeks, correctly citing the 12-week rule and the requirement to contribute towards the child's upkeep, which is satisfied by the £30 weekly payments.
