**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit but subject to a tax charge**, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points the agent communicated correctly:**

1. **Eligibility confirmed**: The agent clearly stated "You ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit" and verified all the basic eligibility criteria (child under 16, responsible for the child, UK resident, lives with child full-time).

2. **High Income Child Benefit Charge explained**: The agent properly identified that since the user earns £75,000 (above the £60,000 threshold), they would be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

3. **Accurate calculation**: The agent correctly explained that at £75,000 income, approximately 75% of the benefit would need to be paid back through tax (this is accurate: £75,000 is £15,000 above the £60,000 threshold, which equals 75% of the way to the £80,000 upper limit where 100% is repaid).

4. **Options presented**: The agent appropriately presented both options available to high earners - claiming and paying the tax charge, or claiming but opting out of payments while still receiving NI credit protection.

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and comprehensive regarding the "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)" outcome.
