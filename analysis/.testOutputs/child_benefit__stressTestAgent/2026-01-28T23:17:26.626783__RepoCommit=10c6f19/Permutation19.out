2026-01-28T23:27:40.239330 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you are responsible for?

2026-01-28T23:27:41.793805 [actor]: child benefit eligibilty daughter 9 years old

2026-01-28T23:27:43.450856 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 9-year-old daughter.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Is your daughter living with you?

2026-01-28T23:27:45.045214 [actor]: she stays with me 3 days and her mum 4 days we both buy stuff for her

2026-01-28T23:27:46.996423 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So your daughter splits her time between you and her mother, staying with you 3 days a week and with her mother 4 days a week, and you both contribute to her costs.

Let me ask: Is there currently anyone already claiming Child Benefit for your daughter - either you or her mother?

2026-01-28T23:27:48.405395 [actor]: we both submited claims cant agree who shud get it

2026-01-28T23:27:51.550108 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. I understand that both you and your daughter's mother have submitted claims and can't agree who should receive the Child Benefit.

This is an important situation. When both parents claim for the same child, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will need to decide who is the main carer and therefore who should receive the benefit. Generally, only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child.

Let me ask you: Do you know if HMRC has contacted either of you yet about these competing claims, or asked you to provide more information about who is the main carer?

2026-01-28T23:27:52.959688 [actor]: no havent heard anything yet what happens now

2026-01-28T23:27:57.183040 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Let me explain what typically happens in this situation.

When HMRC receives competing claims for the same child, they will investigate to determine who should receive the Child Benefit. They will look at who is the main carer - this is usually the person the child lives with for most of the time.

In your case, since your daughter lives with her mother 4 days a week and with you 3 days a week, HMRC would likely consider her mother to be the main carer based on where your daughter spends most of her time.

However, HMRC will contact both of you to gather more information before making a decision. They may ask questions about:
- Who the child lives with most of the time
- Who is mainly responsible for the child's day-to-day care
- Financial arrangements

Let me ask: Are you and your daughter's mother able to discuss and potentially agree between yourselves who should claim, or would you prefer HMRC to make the decision?

2026-01-28T23:27:59.184896 [actor]: ok so becuse she has her 4 days they will give it to her mum then

2026-01-28T23:28:03.027498 [root_agent]: Based on the current arrangement where your daughter stays with her mother 4 days a week and with you 3 days a week, it is **likely** that HMRC would determine that her mother is the main carer and should receive the Child Benefit - but this isn't automatic.

HMRC will make their decision based on who has the main responsibility for the child's day-to-day care. The number of days is an important factor, but they may also consider other aspects of care.

However, there are a few things you should know:

1. HMRC will review the information from both claims before making a final decision
2. They may contact both of you for more details
3. If the living arrangements change in the future (for example, if your daughter starts living with you more), the decision could be reviewed

Let me ask: Would you like to know what options you might have if you disagree with HMRC's decision once they make it?

2026-01-28T23:28:04.468184 [actor]: no thats fine understand now thanks

2026-01-28T23:28:06.671378 [root_agent]: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help you understand the situation.

Just to summarize: With your daughter living with her mother 4 days a week, HMRC will likely award the Child Benefit to her mother as the main carer. HMRC will review both claims and contact you both if they need more information before making their final decision.

If you have any other questions about Child Benefit in the future, feel free to ask. Take care!

2026-01-28T23:28:13.353415 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that HMRC would "likely" award Child Benefit to the mother based on the 4 days vs 3 days arrangement, but this is not necessarily correct according to gov.uk guidance. When parents cannot agree and both claim, only one person can get Child Benefit - the person who has "main responsibility" for the child. While time spent is a factor, the agent oversimplified by suggesting the 4-day arrangement would likely determine the outcome, when HMRC actually considers multiple factors including who has main day-to-day responsibility, and the scenario indicates both parents share responsibilities (both buy things for the child). The agent should have been more neutral about the outcome rather than suggesting a likely winner.
