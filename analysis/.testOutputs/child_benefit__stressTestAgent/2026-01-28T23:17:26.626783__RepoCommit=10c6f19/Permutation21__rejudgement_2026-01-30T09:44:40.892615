**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user (Robert) is **eligible for Child Benefit** for his son Sam (10 years old) who lives with him. This aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct eligibility determination for Robert:** The agent properly established that Robert meets all criteria for Child Benefit for Sam:
   - Sam is under 16 ✓
   - Sam lives with Robert (responsibility established) ✓
   - No one else is claiming for Sam ✓
   - Robert is a UK resident and British citizen ✓
   - Income under £60,000 ✓

2. **Acknowledgment of the split family situation:** The agent appropriately recognized that the ex-wife (Tina) is claiming for Ella, who lives with her, and correctly stated this doesn't affect Robert's claim for Sam.

3. **Alignment with the "Eldest Child" rate rule:** According to the scenario, both parents should receive the higher rate (£26.05) for their respective "eldest child" in their household. While the agent didn't explicitly mention the payment rates, the eligibility determination is correct - both parents are entitled to claim for the child living with them, which would result in both receiving the higher rate for their eldest/only child in their care.

**Expected outcome confirmed:** Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate) ✓

The agent's conclusion that Robert is eligible for Child Benefit for Sam is accurate and matches the expected outcome.
