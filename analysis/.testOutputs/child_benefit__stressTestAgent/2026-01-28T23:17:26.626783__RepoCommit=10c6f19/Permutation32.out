2026-01-28T23:34:57.557359 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:34:58.864205 [actor]: child 17 collge gcse

2026-01-28T23:35:01.201552 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old child who is in college studying for GCSEs.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Are you (or your partner if you have one) the person responsible for the child? This means you're the one the child normally lives with and you're responsible for their care and upbringing.**

2026-01-28T23:35:02.434549 [actor]: yes lives with me

2026-01-28T23:35:04.565239 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. So the child lives with you and you're responsible for them.

Next question:

**Do you normally live in the UK, or are you a Crown servant (such as a diplomat or member of HM Forces) posted overseas?**

2026-01-28T23:35:05.932149 [actor]: live uk

2026-01-28T23:35:08.204781 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on your right to reside in the UK?**

2026-01-28T23:35:09.563255 [actor]: no immigration

2026-01-28T23:35:13.312730 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Based on the information you've provided:

- You have a 17-year-old child living with you
- The child is in college studying for GCSEs (which counts as approved education)
- You're responsible for the child
- You live in the UK
- You have no immigration restrictions

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit!**

You meet the key criteria:
- Your child is under 20 and in approved education or training
- You're responsible for the child who lives with you
- You live in the UK
- You don't have immigration restrictions preventing you from claiming

You can make a claim for Child Benefit. However, please note that if you or your partner has an individual income over £60,000 per year, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which could cancel out some or all of the Child Benefit received.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T23:35:18.409092 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated I was eligible for Child Benefit, but the expected outcome was "Not Eligible". A 17-year-old studying GCSEs at college does not meet the eligibility criteria because approved education or training for 16-19 year olds must be full-time non-advanced education (typically A-levels, Scottish Highers, or equivalent), not GCSE resits.
