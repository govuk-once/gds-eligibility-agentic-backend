**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of the critical issue**: The agent recognized that the coding course paid for by an employer as part of an agreement to join them afterwards does not constitute "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes.

2. **Appropriate application of rules**: The agent correctly applied the principle that Child Benefit covers children under 16, or under 20 if in approved education or training. Since Tom (17) is not in approved education, he does not qualify.

3. **Consistent with guidance**: According to the GOV.UK guidance, courses "doing a course with an employer's agreement - for example, to get a job" are explicitly excluded from approved education.

4. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "You are not eligible for Child Benefit for Tom" and provided clear reasoning for this determination.

5. **User confirmation**: The user acknowledged understanding ("ok so not eligble understand"), indicating the agent successfully communicated the ineligibility outcome.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**, and the reasoning is sound and properly grounded in Child Benefit eligibility criteria.
