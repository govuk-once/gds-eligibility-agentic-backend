**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user (Robert) is **eligible for Child Benefit** for his son Sam, who lives with him. This aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct eligibility determination for Robert:** The agent properly identified that Robert meets all criteria for Child Benefit for Sam (age requirement, responsibility, UK residence, citizenship, income threshold).

2. **Correct understanding of split family rules:** The agent appropriately recognized that Robert's ex-wife (Tina) claiming for Ella does not prevent Robert from claiming for Sam, stating: "It's quite right that your ex-wife claims for Ella since Ella lives with her."

3. **Alignment with expected outcome:** The expected outcome states "Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)" - meaning both Robert and Tina should each be eligible for the higher £26.05 rate for their respective eldest child in their household. The agent confirmed Robert's eligibility for Sam.

4. **Implicit higher rate:** While the agent didn't explicitly state Robert would receive the "eldest child" higher rate of £26.05, the determination of eligibility is correct. Since Sam is the only child in Robert's household, he would automatically receive the higher rate.

The agent successfully communicated that Robert is eligible for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome for this split family scenario.
