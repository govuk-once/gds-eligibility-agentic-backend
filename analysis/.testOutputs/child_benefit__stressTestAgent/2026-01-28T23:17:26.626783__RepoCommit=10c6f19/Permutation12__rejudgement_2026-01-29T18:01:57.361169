**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that Jessica was eligible for Child Benefit. Here's why this assessment is wrong:

According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, Child Benefit stops when a young person (aged 16-19) starts receiving certain benefits **in their own right**, including:
- Universal Credit
- Employment and Support Allowance
- Income Support
- income-based Jobseeker's Allowance

In this scenario, Liam (18) is receiving Universal Credit in his own right. This is explicitly stated in both the scenario setup and confirmed during the conversation when Jessica said "no liam gets universal credit not me."

The agent made a critical error by stating: "The fact that Liam receives Universal Credit himself doesn't affect your eligibility for Child Benefit - these are separate benefits." This is factually incorrect according to the eligibility rules.

**Expected Outcome:** Not Eligible
**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Eligible

The agent's determination directly contradicts the expected outcome. Jessica should have been informed that she is **not eligible** for Child Benefit because Liam is receiving Universal Credit in his own right, which disqualifies him as a qualifying young person for Child Benefit purposes.
