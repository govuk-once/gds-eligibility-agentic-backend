2026-01-28T23:37:22.197574 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking:

**Do you have a child or children under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:37:24.194783 [actor]: child benfit eligibilty 10 year old lives with me now

2026-01-28T23:37:26.356571 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 10-year-old child living with you now.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for this child? By this, I mean do you look after them and meet their everyday needs such as providing food, clothing, and a home?**

2026-01-28T23:37:28.102190 [actor]: yes looking after her mothers friend child stays here mums ill

2026-01-28T23:37:30.332019 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. So you're looking after your mother's friend's child while the mother is ill.

This is an important situation. Let me ask:

**Do you receive Child Benefit for this child, or does someone else (such as the child's mother or another person) currently receive Child Benefit for them?**

2026-01-28T23:37:32.008126 [actor]: no one getting it now child beneffit for nina

2026-01-28T23:37:34.514055 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that no one is currently receiving Child Benefit for Nina.

Let me ask you an important question about the arrangement:

**Is this expected to be a temporary arrangement while Nina's mother is ill, or is Nina going to be living with you for an extended period (such as for at least several weeks or months)?**

This matters because to claim Child Benefit, you generally need to be responsible for the child on more than just a very short-term basis.

2026-01-28T23:37:35.947102 [actor]: living here now forseeable future mothers illness ongoing

2026-01-28T23:37:37.830377 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. So Nina is living with you for the foreseeable future due to her mother's ongoing illness, and you're responsible for her day-to-day care.

Let me ask:

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) currently living or working in the UK?**

2026-01-28T23:37:39.486688 [actor]: yes live uk work here

2026-01-28T23:37:41.399984 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Now I need to ask about your immigration status:

**Do you have the right to live in the UK? For example, are you a British citizen, or do you have settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another type of permission to be in the UK?**

2026-01-28T23:37:42.704633 [actor]: british citizen born here

2026-01-28T23:37:45.416844 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now, let me ask about Nina's mother:

**Has Nina's mother given you permission or agreed for you to claim Child Benefit for Nina while she's living with you? And is the mother still involved in decisions about Nina's care, or have you taken on full parental responsibility?**

This is important because if the mother still has parental responsibility and might want to claim Child Benefit herself, we need to understand the arrangement.

2026-01-28T23:37:47.115322 [actor]: mothers friend agreed im looking after nina mother knows about it

2026-01-28T23:37:49.945676 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So Nina's mother has agreed to you looking after Nina and knows about the arrangement.

One more important question about this:

**Do you have anything in writing from Nina's mother about this arrangement, or any formal agreement or order (such as from a court) that gives you responsibility for Nina's care?**

I ask because when a child is living with someone other than their parent, it can be helpful to have documentation of the arrangement when claiming Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T23:37:51.425343 [actor]: no just private arrangemnt mothers ill so nina stays here

2026-01-28T23:37:54.061462 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that - so it's a private arrangement without formal documentation.

Let me ask one final question to complete the assessment:

**Are you claiming any means-tested benefits or tax credits yourself, or do you (or your partner if you have one) earn over £50,000 per year?**

I ask because while this doesn't affect whether you can *claim* Child Benefit, if you or your partner earns over £50,000, there's a tax charge that applies which you should be aware of.

2026-01-28T23:37:55.451648 [actor]: earn under 50000 no partner

2026-01-28T23:38:00.287445 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility for Child Benefit for Nina.

**Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina.** Here's why:

✓ Nina is 10 years old (under 16)
✓ She's living with you for the foreseeable future
✓ You're responsible for her day-to-day care and meeting her needs
✓ You're a British citizen living and working in the UK
✓ No one else is currently receiving Child Benefit for her
✓ Nina's mother has agreed to this arrangement

**Important points to be aware of:**

1. **Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child at any time.** Since you're the one caring for Nina, you would be the one to claim.

2. **Private arrangements are accepted** - you don't necessarily need formal legal documentation, though it's good that Nina's mother is aware and has agreed.

3. **The arrangement should be expected to last** - which yours is, given the mother's ongoing illness.

4. Since you earn under £50,000 and have no partner, you won't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your situation?

2026-01-28T23:38:03.187191 [actor]: ok thanks child benfit eligble thats good

2026-01-28T23:38:05.532041 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am eligible for Child Benefit based on the circumstances: caring for a 10-year-old child (Nina) living with me for the foreseeable future due to her mother's ongoing illness, with the mother's knowledge and agreement, no one else claiming Child Benefit for her, and I am a British citizen living and working in the UK earning under £50,000.
