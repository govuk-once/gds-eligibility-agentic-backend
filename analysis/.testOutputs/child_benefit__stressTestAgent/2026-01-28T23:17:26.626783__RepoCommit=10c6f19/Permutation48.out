2026-01-28T23:44:48.377757 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:44:49.911267 [actor]: child benefit hnc collge 18 yesr old

2026-01-28T23:44:51.675805 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask a clearer question:

**Do you have an 18-year-old who is currently attending college on an HNC (Higher National Certificate) course?**

2026-01-28T23:44:53.163513 [actor]: yes she doing hnc at collge started after a levels

2026-01-28T23:44:56.564680 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To determine eligibility, I need to understand more about the type of course and her circumstances.

**Is your daughter studying full-time on this HNC course, and does the course qualify as "approved education or training"?**

(For context: approved education or training typically includes full-time non-advanced education up to A-level or equivalent standard, but HNC courses are often considered advanced education, which may affect eligibility once someone turns 16 or leaves full-time school-level education.)

2026-01-28T23:44:58.122493 [actor]: full time yes hnc course collge not university

2026-01-28T23:45:01.244139 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that it's a full-time HNC course at college.

I need to ask an important question about the level of this qualification:

**HNC courses are typically considered "advanced education" (above A-level standard). Can you confirm whether this HNC course is at a higher level than A-levels, or is it somehow equivalent to or below A-level standard?**

This is important because Child Benefit generally only continues for young people aged 16-19 who are in full-time non-advanced education or approved training. Advanced courses like HNCs usually don't qualify.

2026-01-28T23:45:02.866070 [actor]: hnc is advanced level 4 higher than a level

2026-01-28T23:45:06.901496 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. This is an important point for your eligibility.

Based on the information you've provided:

- Your daughter is 18 years old
- She is studying a full-time HNC course at college
- HNC is Level 4, which is advanced education (higher than A-levels)

**Unfortunately, this means you are not eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter.**

Child Benefit for young people aged 16-19 only continues if they are in full-time **non-advanced** education or approved training. Since an HNC is advanced education (Level 4), it does not qualify as approved education for Child Benefit purposes, even though it's being taken at a college rather than a university.

Child Benefit would have stopped being payable after she finished her A-levels or when she turned 20, whichever came first.

**Do you have any other questions about this, or is there anything else you'd like me to clarify?**

2026-01-28T23:45:09.658509 [actor]: ok thanks understand now not eligble

2026-01-28T23:45:11.733823 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit does not continue for an 18-year-old studying an HNC (Level 4) course because HNCs are advanced education, and Child Benefit only covers non-advanced education or approved training for 16-19 year olds.
