**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

The agent systematically verified all relevant criteria:

1. **Child's age and education**: Leo is 8 years old and in school (meets the under-16 requirement)
2. **Residency**: The family lives in Manchester, UK
3. **Responsibility**: Leo lives with the applicant who is responsible for him
4. **No duplicate claims**: No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Leo
5. **High Income Child Benefit Charge**: Neither parent earns over £50,000 individually (husband earns £35,000, applicant earns £15,000), so they won't be subject to the charge

The agent's conclusion that the user is eligible for Child Benefit is correct and matches the expected outcome for this standard family scenario. The agent also appropriately noted that the family can receive full Child Benefit payments without tax implications due to their income levels.
