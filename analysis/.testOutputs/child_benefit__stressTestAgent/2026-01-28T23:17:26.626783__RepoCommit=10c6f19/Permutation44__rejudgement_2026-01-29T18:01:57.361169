**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome is that the user should be **eligible**.

According to the gov.uk guidance on children in care (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), when a child is looked after by a local authority, you can still claim Child Benefit if:
1. The child regularly spends at least 1 night a week at home with you, OR
2. The child spends at least 24 hours a week at home with you

In this scenario, the child stays from Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am, which is **25 hours** - exceeding the 24-hour threshold. This means the user meets the time-at-home requirement and should be eligible for Child Benefit.

The agent incorrectly focused on the fact that the child is in local authority care and concluded ineligibility without properly assessing whether the child's time at home met the threshold. The agent asked about nights spent at home but failed to recognize that the 24-hour alternative criterion was satisfied.

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent (not eligible) does not agree with the expected outcome (eligible).
