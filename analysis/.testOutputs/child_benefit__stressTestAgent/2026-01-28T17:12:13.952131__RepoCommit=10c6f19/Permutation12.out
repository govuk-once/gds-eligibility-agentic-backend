2026-01-28T17:18:44.118096 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:18:45.842770 [actor]: child benefit liam 18 alevel living with me

2026-01-28T17:18:48.198338 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Liam is 18 and doing A-levels and living with you.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Is Liam still in approved education or training, and if so, has he turned 20 yet?**

(This is important because Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training.)

2026-01-28T17:18:49.905574 [actor]: yes alevel studyng approved educaton hasnt turnd 20

2026-01-28T17:18:52.856489 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. So Liam is 18, studying A-levels (which is approved education), hasn't turned 20, and lives with you.

Now I need to ask: **Are you the person primarily responsible for Liam? In other words, are you the main person who looks after him and pays for things like food, clothes, and his general upkeep?**

2026-01-28T17:18:54.662898 [actor]: yes im his mum jessica i look after him

2026-01-28T17:18:56.905375 [root_agent]: Thank you, Jessica. That's helpful information.

Now I need to ask: **Do you normally live in the UK? Or if not, do you work in the UK for an employer based here, or are you a crown servant (such as a diplomat or member of the armed forces)?**

2026-01-28T17:18:58.302965 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T17:19:00.275263 [root_agent]: Thank you, Jessica. 

One more important question: **Does anyone else also claim Child Benefit for Liam, or is there anyone else who might consider themselves equally responsible for him?**

2026-01-28T17:19:01.809491 [actor]: no just me his dad estranged

2026-01-28T17:19:05.839812 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Jessica.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

✓ You have a child (Liam) who is 18 and under 20
✓ He's in approved education (A-levels)
✓ He lives with you
✓ You're responsible for him
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

However, there's one more thing I should check: **Do you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 a year?**

This doesn't affect your eligibility to receive Child Benefit, but if either of you earns over this amount, you may have to pay a tax charge called the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means you might have to pay some or all of the Child Benefit back through your tax return.

2026-01-28T17:19:07.431651 [actor]: no income liam no income either

2026-01-28T17:19:11.009149 [root_agent]: Thank you, Jessica.

Based on all the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit** for Liam because:

✓ Liam is 18 years old and under 20
✓ He's in approved education (A-levels)
✓ He lives with you
✓ You're responsible for him as his mum
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him
✓ Neither you nor Liam has income over £50,000, so there won't be any High Income Child Benefit Charge to worry about

You can claim Child Benefit for Liam and it will continue until he turns 20, or until he finishes his approved education or training (whichever comes first).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T17:19:13.001438 [actor]: no thats all thanks

2026-01-28T17:19:16.436926 [actor]: The agent has provided an eligibility outcome, indicating that Jessica is eligible for Child Benefit for Liam. However, based on the scenario provided, this is **incorrect**. According to the situation, Liam has successfully claimed Universal Credit in his own right, which means Jessica should NOT be eligible for Child Benefit, as a child receiving certain benefits (including Universal Credit) in their own right disqualifies the parent from receiving Child Benefit for that child.

The agent failed to ask the critical question about whether Liam receives any benefits in his own right, which was the key disqualifying factor in this scenario.

2026-01-28T17:19:18.474202 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent failed to ask whether Liam receives any benefits in his own right (specifically Universal Credit), which is a critical disqualifying factor that would make Jessica ineligible for Child Benefit.
