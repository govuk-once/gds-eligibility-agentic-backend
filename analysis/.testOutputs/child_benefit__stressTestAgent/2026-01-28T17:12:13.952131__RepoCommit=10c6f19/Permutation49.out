2026-01-28T17:41:36.520087 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T17:41:38.171645 [actor]: child benefit 17 year old computr course

2026-01-28T17:41:41.071570 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask a follow-up question to understand the situation better.

**Is the 17-year-old in approved education or training?** Specifically, I need to know if their computer course is:
- Full-time education (at least 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience), OR
- Approved training with an approved training provider

2026-01-28T17:41:42.674544 [actor]: son doing coding course employer paying fees

2026-01-28T17:41:45.812259 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to clarify a bit more about this coding course.

**Is your son enrolled as a student on this coding course, or is he employed and receiving work-based training?** 

In other words, is he:
- An employee who is working and being trained by his employer, OR
- A student on an education/training course that the employer happens to be paying for?

2026-01-28T17:41:47.486567 [actor]: employer pays course then he joins them after not paid now

2026-01-28T17:41:49.699753 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son is currently a student on a coding course (not yet employed), and the employer will pay for the course with the understanding he'll join them afterwards.

**Is this coding course full-time education, meaning at least 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience?**

2026-01-28T17:41:51.257315 [actor]: yes full time coding course 12 hours week

2026-01-28T17:41:53.516959 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now I need to understand your relationship with your son and living arrangements.

**Do you live with your son, and are you responsible for him?** In other words, do you look after him and are you the main person responsible for his care and upbringing?

2026-01-28T17:41:55.055454 [actor]: yes live together im responsible for him

2026-01-28T17:41:56.881130 [root_agent]: Thank you. I have one more important question to assess your eligibility.

**Are you living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:41:58.234334 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T17:42:03.094703 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You are responsible for your 17-year-old son
✓ You live with him in the UK
✓ He is under 20 years old
✓ He is in full-time approved education (at least 12 hours per week of supervised study on his coding course)

Since your son is 17 and in full-time education of at least 12 hours per week, he meets the criteria for Child Benefit to continue beyond age 16.

**Important notes:**
- Child Benefit can continue until your son turns 20, as long as he remains in approved education or training
- If his circumstances change (e.g., he leaves the course or starts paid employment with the employer), you must inform the Child Benefit Office
- If you or your partner earns over £60,000 per year, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T17:42:06.284341 [actor]: ok thank you

2026-01-28T17:42:09.437912 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The son is on a work-based training scheme where an employer is paying for the course with the expectation he will join them afterwards, which constitutes approved training rather than full-time education, but more critically, once someone starts paid employment or employer-sponsored training that leads directly to employment, they typically don't qualify for the education/training exception to Child Benefit eligibility beyond age 16.
