2026-01-28T17:29:36.803931 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T17:29:38.598490 [actor]: child benefit eligibilty 18000 income wife higher earner

2026-01-28T17:29:40.703404 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you a specific question to start assessing your eligibility:

**Do you or your wife have a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that either of you are responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:29:42.458607 [actor]: yes got child claim benfit form filled alredy

2026-01-28T17:29:45.758119 [root_agent]: That's great that you have a child and have already filled out the claim form.

Now, let me ask you an important question about your household income:

**Does either you or your wife have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

(I notice you mentioned £18,000 income and that your wife is the higher earner - I just need to confirm if either of your individual incomes exceeds £50,000)

2026-01-28T17:29:47.441851 [actor]: wife earns more high income 65000

2026-01-28T17:29:51.634741 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is important for your situation.

Since your wife earns £65,000 per year (which is over £50,000), this affects your Child Benefit in the following way:

- **You are still eligible to claim Child Benefit**
- However, because the higher earner in your household earns over £50,000, you'll be subject to the **High Income Child Benefit Charge**

This means that for every £100 earned over £50,000, you'll have to pay back 1% of the Child Benefit through the tax system. Since your wife earns £65,000, that's £15,000 over the threshold, so you would need to pay back 100% of the Child Benefit received.

Let me ask you: **Do you or your wife live with the child for whom you're claiming?**

2026-01-28T17:29:53.324294 [actor]: yes live with child i filled form payments my bank

2026-01-28T17:29:58.740022 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on what you've told me, here's your situation:

**You ARE eligible for Child Benefit** because:
- You have a child under 16 (or under 20 in approved education/training)
- You live with and are responsible for the child
- You've filled out the claim form

However, there's an important financial consideration:

Since your wife earns £65,000 (the higher earner in your household), you will need to repay 100% of the Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge when the higher earner completes their Self Assessment tax return.

You have two options:
1. **Receive the payments** (into your bank as you've requested) but your wife will need to repay it all through her tax return
2. **Opt out of receiving payments** but still maintain your claim (this protects your child's National Insurance record and your State Pension, without creating a tax bill)

One final question: **Are you aware that even though your wife will have to repay the full amount, it's still beneficial to submit the claim to protect National Insurance credits for you and your child's future?**

2026-01-28T17:30:00.761985 [actor]: ok so i get the money then wife pays back got it eligble then

2026-01-28T17:30:05.856982 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct! Let me clarify to make sure you fully understand:

**You ARE eligible for Child Benefit.** 

Here's what will happen:
- You will receive the Child Benefit payments into your bank account
- Your wife (as the higher earner with £65,000 income) will need to repay the full amount through her Self Assessment tax return each year via the High Income Child Benefit Charge

Since she earns £15,000 over the £50,000 threshold, the repayment will be 100% of what you receive.

**Important point:** Your wife will need to register for Self Assessment if she hasn't already, as she'll be required to complete a tax return each year to repay this charge.

So yes - you're eligible, you can proceed with your claim, and the payments will go to your bank as you've arranged on the form.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T17:30:07.650410 [actor]: no thats all thanks eligble and wife pays it back understood

2026-01-28T17:30:11.664846 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that I am eligible for Child Benefit, that I would receive the payments, and that my wife (as the higher earner at £65,000) would need to repay 100% of the benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge via Self Assessment tax return, which matches the expected outcome.
