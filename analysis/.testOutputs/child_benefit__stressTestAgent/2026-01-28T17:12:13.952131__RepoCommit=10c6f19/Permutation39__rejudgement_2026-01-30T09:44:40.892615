2026-01-30T09:48:36.580149 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent properly assessed all relevant criteria:

1. **Responsibility for children**: Confirmed the two adopted children (ages 6 and 8) live with the user full-time, and the adoption is finalized
2. **Age requirement**: Both children are under 16, meeting the eligibility requirement
3. **Immigration status**: Both adoptive parents are UK-born and settled
4. **No duplicate claims**: Confirmed no one else is claiming Child Benefit for these children
5. **Income threshold**: Confirmed income is below £50,000, so no High Income Child Benefit Charge applies

**Critically**, the agent correctly addressed the key issue in this scenario: the adoption allowance from the local authority does **not** disqualify the user from Child Benefit. The agent explicitly stated: "The adoption allowance you receive from the local authority does not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit - these are separate benefits."

This is the correct interpretation. According to gov.uk guidance, adoption allowances (unlike fostering allowances which cover full maintenance and accommodation) do not prevent Child Benefit eligibility. The agent's conclusion that the user is eligible matches the expected outcome.
