2026-01-30T09:49:24.656955 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent accurately identified the key disqualifying factors:

1. **Right to Reside failure**: The agent correctly explained that a 6-month tourist visa does not confer a "right to reside" for benefits purposes in the UK

2. **Habitual residence**: The agent properly distinguished between temporary visiting and being habitually resident in the UK

3. **No recourse to public funds**: The agent accurately noted that tourist visas typically include this condition, which prevents access to public benefits like Child Benefit

4. **Clear outcome communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you are not eligible for Child Benefit in your current circumstances" with a clear explanation

The agent's assessment aligns perfectly with the scenario facts: Maria is a US citizen on a standard tourist visa with no right to reside for benefit purposes, making her ineligible despite being physically present in the UK with her child. The agent correctly applied the immigration status/right to reside criteria.
