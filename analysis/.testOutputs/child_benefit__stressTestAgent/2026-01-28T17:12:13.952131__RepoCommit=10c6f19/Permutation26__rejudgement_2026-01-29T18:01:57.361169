**Justification:**

The agent determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and the specific permutation scenario provided, the user **should be eligible**.

**Key Facts from the Scenario:**
- Mo (the applicant) contributes £15/week
- Mo's mother (grandmother) also contributes £15/week
- Total combined contributions = £30/week
- Current Child Benefit rate = £26.05/week
- The aunt does not claim Child Benefit

**Why the User Should Be Eligible:**

According to the Gov.UK guidance on "child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else," a person can claim Child Benefit for a child living elsewhere if they contribute **at least as much as the Child Benefit rate** toward the child's upkeep. The guidance explicitly states that **contributions from multiple people can be combined** to meet this threshold.

Since the combined contributions (£30) exceed the threshold (£26.05), Mo should be eligible to claim.

**Agent's Error:**

The agent incorrectly focused exclusively on physical custody and day-to-day care responsibilities, failing to recognize or apply the alternative eligibility pathway based on financial contributions. The agent dismissed the relevance of the financial contributions multiple times, even when the user specifically raised this point.

The agent's determination contradicts the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
