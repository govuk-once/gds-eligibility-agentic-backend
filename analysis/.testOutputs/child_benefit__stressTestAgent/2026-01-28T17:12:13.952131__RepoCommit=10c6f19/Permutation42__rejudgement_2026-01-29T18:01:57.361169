**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user was **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "if your daughter is receiving a wage or salary for her apprenticeship, you are likely NOT eligible for Child Benefit."

However, the expected outcome is that the user should be **Eligible**.

According to the scenario details and gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility:

1. **Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are specifically listed as "approved training"** for Child Benefit purposes, even though apprenticeships in England are generally excluded.

2. The gov.uk guidance states that Child Benefit continues for young people under 20 in approved education or training, and this can include situations where they receive an allowance or wage during that training.

3. The scenario explicitly confirms there is a **Regional Exception (Wales)** and that Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales qualify as approved training despite being apprenticeships.

The agent failed to recognize this Welsh-specific exception and incorrectly applied the general rule about paid apprenticeships. The agent's conclusion that the user was "likely NOT eligible" directly contradicts the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

Therefore, the agent did NOT communicate the correct eligibility outcome.
