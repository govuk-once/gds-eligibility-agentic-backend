2026-01-28T17:36:03.698050 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

**First question:** Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T17:36:05.479687 [actor]: child benefit chek eligbility two kids not livng with me

2026-01-28T17:36:08.912982 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have two children who are not living with you.

Let me ask you an important question to assess your eligibility:

**Are you responsible for the children in any way?** For example, do you:
- Pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate) towards their upkeep?
- Or contribute regularly to their living costs?

2026-01-28T17:36:10.551924 [actor]: pay 40 pounds week for both kids

2026-01-28T17:36:12.853448 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You're paying £40 per week for both children.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand a bit more:

**Does anyone else currently claim Child Benefit for these two children?** (This would typically be the person the children live with, such as their other parent or guardian)

2026-01-28T17:36:14.436992 [actor]: ex partner has them kids live with her

2026-01-28T17:36:16.402521 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your ex-partner has the children living with her.

**Is your ex-partner currently claiming Child Benefit for these two children?**

2026-01-28T17:36:18.133642 [actor]: yes she claims it alredy

2026-01-28T17:36:22.037911 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me reflect on your situation:

- You have two children who live with your ex-partner
- Your ex-partner is already claiming Child Benefit for them
- You pay £40 per week towards both children

Based on the Child Benefit rules, **only one person can claim Child Benefit for each child**. Since your ex-partner is already claiming Child Benefit for your two children, you are **not eligible** to claim Child Benefit for them as well.

However, it's worth noting that the person who claims Child Benefit is usually the person the child lives with and who is responsible for them. Since your children live with your ex-partner and she's already claiming, she is the eligible claimant.

If circumstances change in the future (for example, if the children come to live with you), the situation could be reassessed.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T17:36:23.709973 [actor]: ok so cant get it then

2026-01-28T17:36:26.460187 [root_agent]: That's correct - you cannot get Child Benefit for these two children while your ex-partner is already claiming it for them and they live with her.

Only one person can claim Child Benefit for each child, and it's typically the person the child lives with.

If your circumstances change in the future (for example, if the children come to live with you), then you could potentially become eligible to claim at that point.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit or any other questions you may have?

2026-01-28T17:36:28.096277 [actor]: no thats all thanks

2026-01-28T17:36:29.925783 [root_agent]: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify your Child Benefit eligibility for you. If you have any questions in the future, feel free to come back. Take care!

2026-01-28T17:36:35.021581 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately concluded that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because the ex-partner is already claiming it for the children who live with her, and only one person can claim Child Benefit per child.
