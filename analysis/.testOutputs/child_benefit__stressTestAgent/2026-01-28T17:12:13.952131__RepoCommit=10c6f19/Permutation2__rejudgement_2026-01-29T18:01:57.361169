**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Assessment of the agent's reasoning:**

1. **Criteria 1 (Responsibility):** ✓ The agent confirmed Amit is responsible for his daughter as a single father with whom she lives.

2. **Criteria 2 (Child's Age and Education):** ✓ The agent correctly identified that the 17-year-old daughter studying A-levels qualifies, as children under 20 in approved education are eligible.

3. **Criteria 3 (Residency and Immigration):** ✓ The agent verified UK residence (London) and British citizenship status.

4. **Criteria 4 (Living Arrangements):** ✓ The agent confirmed the daughter lives with Amit.

5. **Criteria 5 (State Support):** The agent didn't explicitly ask about hospital/care, but this wasn't indicated as an issue in the scenario.

6. **Criteria 6 (High Income Charge):** ✓ The agent confirmed income of £40,000 is below the £60,000 threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply.

The agent's conclusion that Amit is eligible for Child Benefit is accurate and matches the expected outcome. The evaluation judge also confirmed this assessment with a ✓.
