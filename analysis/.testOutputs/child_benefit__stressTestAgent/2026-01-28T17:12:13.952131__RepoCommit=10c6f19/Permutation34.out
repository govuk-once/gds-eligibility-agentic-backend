2026-01-28T17:31:49.785914 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T17:31:51.504197 [actor]: child benefit son 15 custdy

2026-01-28T17:31:53.462257 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 15-year-old son and you have custody of him.

Let me ask you the next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:31:55.297834 [actor]: yes live uk son in detenshun centre

2026-01-28T17:31:57.415543 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand your 15-year-old son is in a detention centre.

This is an important detail. Let me ask: **Is your son in a detention centre as part of the youth justice system (such as a young offender institution or secure training centre)?**

2026-01-28T17:31:58.830927 [actor]: yes young offender 6 month sentance

2026-01-28T17:32:01.431042 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I understand your son is in a young offender institution serving a 6-month sentence.

This is relevant to your Child Benefit eligibility. Let me ask you: **Are you still contributing to the costs of supporting your son while he's in the young offender institution? For example, are you providing him with clothing, sending money, or planning for his return home?**

2026-01-28T17:32:03.066931 [actor]: yes send him things planning for when he comes back

2026-01-28T17:32:05.316755 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, let me ask one more important question to complete the assessment:

**Are you the only person claiming Child Benefit for your son, or is someone else (such as another parent or guardian) also claiming or planning to claim for him?**

2026-01-28T17:32:06.750864 [actor]: only me claiming no one else

2026-01-28T17:32:11.108383 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, I can now assess your eligibility.

**You should be eligible for Child Benefit** for your 15-year-old son, even though he is currently in a young offender institution.

Here's why:

✓ Your son is under 16
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are responsible for him and contributing to his costs
✓ You are continuing to support him while he's detained (sending things, planning for his return)
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

**Important:** When a child is in custody in the youth justice system (like a young offender institution), you can continue to receive Child Benefit as long as you're still contributing to their costs. The fact that you're sending him items and planning for his return demonstrates this ongoing responsibility.

You should be able to continue claiming Child Benefit throughout his 6-month sentence, provided you maintain this contribution to his support.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-28T17:32:16.203988 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit stops when a child is detained in custody as part of the youth justice system, regardless of whether the parent continues to contribute to their costs or plans for their return.
