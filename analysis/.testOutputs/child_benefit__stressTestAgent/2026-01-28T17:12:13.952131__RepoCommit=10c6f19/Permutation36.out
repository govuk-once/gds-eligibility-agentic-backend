2026-01-28T17:32:57.048019 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T17:32:58.693114 [actor]: daughter 16 finsihed school in june worried not in scool right now

2026-01-28T17:33:01.390748 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your daughter is 16 and finished school in June, and she's not currently in school.

To determine eligibility, I need to understand her current situation better:

**Is your daughter currently in any approved education or training, such as:**
- A college course
- An apprenticeship
- Traineeships
- Other approved training programmes

Or is she not enrolled in any education or training at the moment?

2026-01-28T17:33:02.874049 [actor]: college starts september accepted already

2026-01-28T17:33:05.558017 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you. So your daughter has been accepted to college and will be starting in September.

Good news - this period between finishing school and starting college is usually covered. However, I need to ask:

**Are you the person responsible for your daughter - meaning, does she live with you and you're responsible for her care?**

2026-01-28T17:33:07.043464 [actor]: yes live with me im responsible

2026-01-28T17:33:09.387112 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to understand your current household situation to assess your eligibility:

**Do you or your partner (if you have one) currently receive Child Benefit for your daughter, or have you received it in the past?**

2026-01-28T17:33:11.315809 [actor]: not sure if still get it thats why asking

2026-01-28T17:33:14.917514 [root_agent]: I understand - you're checking whether you should still be receiving it now that she's 16 and finished school.

Let me ask you this: **When your daughter starts college in September, will she be enrolled in full-time approved education?** 

By this I mean:
- A course of at least 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience
- Non-advanced education (like A-levels, T-levels, Scottish Highers, or similar qualifications, but not university degrees)

2026-01-28T17:33:16.378652 [actor]: a levels full time yes

2026-01-28T17:33:18.873523 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you. That's very helpful information.

Just one more important question to confirm your eligibility:

**Are you (or your partner if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do you have the right to reside in the UK?**

In other words, do you have settled status, British citizenship, or another status that gives you the right to live in the UK?

2026-01-28T17:33:20.539220 [actor]: british citizen born here

2026-01-28T17:33:25.201546 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you should remain eligible for Child Benefit** for your daughter. Here's why:

✓ Your daughter is 16 and will be starting full-time A-level education in September
✓ She lives with you and you're responsible for her
✓ You're a British citizen with the right to reside in the UK

**Important points:**

- Child Benefit continues until a young person turns 20, as long as they remain in approved full-time education or training (at least 12 hours per week of supervised study)
- A-levels count as approved education
- The gap between finishing school in June and starting college in September is typically covered - you should continue receiving Child Benefit during this period

**What you should do:**

If your payments have stopped or you're unsure, you should contact the Child Benefit Office to confirm your payments are continuing and that they have the correct information about your daughter's college enrollment.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-28T17:33:30.474459 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit because their 16-year-old daughter is starting full-time A-level education in September, lives with them, they are responsible for her care, they are a British citizen, and the gap between finishing school and starting college is covered.
