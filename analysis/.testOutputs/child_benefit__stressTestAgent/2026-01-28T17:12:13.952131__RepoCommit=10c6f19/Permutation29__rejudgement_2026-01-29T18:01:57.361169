**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Analysis:**

1. **Facts gathered:** The agent established that:
   - The child is 17 years old
   - The child is not in college
   - The child is not working
   - The child left school last year after GCSEs

2. **Correct application of rules:** According to gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility:
   - Child Benefit normally stops when a child turns 16
   - It can continue until age 20 if the child remains in approved education or training
   - For 16/17-year-olds who have left education, there is a potential 20-week extension IF they register with careers services or certain approved programs

3. **Agent's determination:** The agent correctly concluded that since the child:
   - Is over 16
   - Left education after GCSEs (over a year ago)
   - Has not been in approved education or training since
   - The user is NOT eligible for Child Benefit

4. **Communication quality:** The agent clearly explained the reasoning and even offered to check eligibility for any other children, demonstrating thoroughness.

The agent's eligibility determination matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible" as specified in the scenario (Permutation 29: The "NEET").
