2026-01-28T17:42:11.679141 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T17:42:13.657196 [actor]: child beneffit edinbrugh 16 year old training programe

2026-01-28T17:42:16.329365 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. So you have a 16-year-old in a training programme in Edinburgh.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Are you responsible for this child? In other words, do they live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards their upbringing?**

2026-01-28T17:42:18.109641 [actor]: yes lives with me no one left behind programe

2026-01-28T17:42:21.541000 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that the 16-year-old lives with you and is on the No One Left Behind programme.

Next question: **Is the training programme your child is on an approved education or training course? This typically includes programmes that are not advanced (like A-levels, Scottish Highers, or equivalent vocational qualifications), and are usually supervised or done during the day.**

The No One Left Behind programme in Scotland does typically count as approved training, but I need to confirm this applies to your specific situation.

2026-01-28T17:42:25.856465 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. The No One Left Behind programme is a Scottish Government employment support programme, which typically does count as approved training for Child Benefit purposes.

Next question: **Are you currently living in the UK, or are you a UK citizen or have permission to be in the UK?** (This is to confirm you meet the residency requirements for Child Benefit.)

2026-01-28T17:42:27.480730 [actor]: live in uk edinburgh scotland

2026-01-28T17:42:29.805023 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know you live in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Next question: **Does anyone else also claim Child Benefit for this same child, or does the child live with someone else who might be claiming it?**

2026-01-28T17:42:31.457202 [actor]: no just me claiming child beneffit

2026-01-28T17:42:34.537890 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: **Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?**

This is important because if either you or your partner earns over this amount, it may affect your Child Benefit entitlement through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-28T17:42:36.341078 [actor]: no income under 60000

2026-01-28T17:42:40.196956 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You have a 16-year-old child in approved education/training (the No One Left Behind programme)
2. ✓ The child lives with you and you're responsible for them
3. ✓ You live in the UK (Edinburgh, Scotland)
4. ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child
5. ✓ Your income is under £60,000, so you won't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge

You can claim Child Benefit for your child until they turn 20, as long as they remain in approved education or training.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the claiming process?**

2026-01-28T17:42:45.575298 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria including the child's age (16), approved training status (No One Left Behind programme), residency requirements, responsibility for the child, absence of duplicate claims, and income threshold considerations.
