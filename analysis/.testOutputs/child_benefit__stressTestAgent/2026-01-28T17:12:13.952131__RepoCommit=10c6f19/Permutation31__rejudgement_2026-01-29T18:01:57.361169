2026-01-29T18:02:02.863169 [confirmation_judge]: **Judgement:** 👍

**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of education type:** The agent accurately identified that a university degree is "advanced education" and explicitly stated this multiple times throughout the conversation.

2. **Clear eligibility determination:** The agent clearly stated: "you would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit for her, even though she's under 20 and living at home."

3. **Accurate reasoning:** The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit can continue until age 20 but only for "approved education or training" and that "university degrees are considered advanced education and don't qualify."

4. **Consistency with guidance:** This aligns with the official guidance from gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, which states that Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education such as a university degree.

The evaluation judge's assessment (✓) also confirmed that "the agent accurately explained that university degree courses are considered 'advanced education' and do not qualify for Child Benefit purposes, correctly concluding that [the user] would not be eligible."

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and reached the correct eligibility outcome.
