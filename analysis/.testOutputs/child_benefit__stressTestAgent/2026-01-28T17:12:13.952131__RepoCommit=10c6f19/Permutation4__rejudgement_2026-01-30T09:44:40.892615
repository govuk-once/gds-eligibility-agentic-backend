**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Child's Age and Education Status:** The daughter is 18 years old and left school 2 years ago (at age 16). She is not currently in any approved education or training.

2. **Employment Status:** The daughter works 30 hours per week as a receptionist, which is full-time employment.

3. **Eligibility Criteria:** According to [gov.uk guidance](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), Child Benefit is available for children:
   - Under 16, OR
   - Under 20 if they're in approved education or training

4. **Agent's Assessment:** The agent correctly identified that since the daughter left education at 16 and is now working rather than being in approved education or training, Child Benefit would have ended when she turned 16 or left education.

5. **Additional Factor:** Working 24+ hours per week typically disqualifies a young person from Child Benefit even if they were in some forms of non-advanced education, which further supports the ineligibility determination.

The agent's communication was accurate, clear, and properly explained why the user does not qualify for Child Benefit for their 18-year-old working daughter.
