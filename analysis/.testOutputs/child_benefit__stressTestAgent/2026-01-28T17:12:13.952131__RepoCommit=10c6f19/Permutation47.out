2026-01-28T17:40:25.658102 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T17:40:27.371566 [actor]: child not living with me court order payments £50 week maintenence cant be eligble

2026-01-28T17:40:29.976708 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a child who isn't living with you, and you're paying £50 per week in child maintenance under a court order.

Let me ask you an important clarifying question: Is your child living with someone else who is their main carer (such as the other parent, a guardian, or someone else who looks after them day-to-day)?

2026-01-28T17:40:31.411119 [actor]: other parent main carer yes

2026-01-28T17:40:33.420723 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So the other parent is the main carer for your child.

In this situation, let me ask: Is the other parent (who is the main carer) currently claiming Child Benefit for your child?

2026-01-28T17:40:35.467986 [actor]: dont know if claiming or not just pay court order

2026-01-28T17:40:39.797351 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me explain the situation based on what you've told me.

Generally, only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, and this is usually the person who the child lives with and who is responsible for them on a day-to-day basis. Since your child lives with the other parent who is their main carer, the other parent would typically be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.

However, there is one important question I need to ask: Do you ever have your child stay with you for extended periods, or do you share the caring responsibilities in any way (not just financially through maintenance payments)?

2026-01-28T17:40:41.354897 [actor]: no just the £50 week thats it court made me pay

2026-01-28T17:40:45.627763 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Based on what you've told me, I can now give you an assessment of your eligibility.

**You are not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.**

Here's why:

- Your child lives with the other parent who is their main carer
- You don't have the child living with you or share day-to-day caring responsibilities
- Child Benefit can only be claimed by one person, and it goes to the person who is responsible for the child - typically the person the child lives with

The £50 per week maintenance payments you make under the court order are separate from Child Benefit. These payments don't affect eligibility - what matters is who the child lives with and who provides their day-to-day care.

The other parent (as the main carer) would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for your child, if they're not already doing so.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T17:40:51.262994 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a non-resident parent who only pays maintenance and does not provide day-to-day care is not eligible for Child Benefit, correctly explaining that only the main carer (the parent the child lives with) can claim it.
