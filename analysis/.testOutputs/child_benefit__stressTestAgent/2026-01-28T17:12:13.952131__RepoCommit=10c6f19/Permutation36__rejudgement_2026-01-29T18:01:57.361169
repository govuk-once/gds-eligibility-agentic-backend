**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct age criterion assessment**: The agent confirmed the daughter is 16 and under 20.

2. **Correct education status assessment**: The agent established that the daughter will be starting full-time A-level education in September, which qualifies as approved education.

3. **Critical understanding of the "summer gap"**: The agent explicitly stated that "The gap between finishing school in June and starting college in September is typically covered - you should continue receiving Child Benefit during this period." This directly addresses the core concern of the scenario.

4. **Proper application of terminal dates rule**: The agent correctly understood that eligibility does not stop immediately when school ends in June, because the daughter has been accepted into further approved education starting in September.

5. **All other criteria verified**: The agent confirmed the mother is responsible for the child, they live together, and the mother is a British citizen.

The agent's conclusion that the user "should remain eligible for Child Benefit" accurately reflects the eligibility rules for students in the summer gap between approved educational courses, matching the expected outcome.
