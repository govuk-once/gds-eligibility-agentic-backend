2026-01-28T17:36:36.993368 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T17:36:38.638713 [actor]: yeh got daughter 17 doin appremticeship cardiff

2026-01-28T17:36:41.248561 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your daughter is 17 and doing an apprenticeship in Cardiff.

To assess your eligibility, I need to clarify: **Is your daughter's apprenticeship an approved education or training programme?**

(Child Benefit can continue until a young person turns 20 if they're in approved education or training, but apprenticeships may be treated differently depending on whether they're unpaid or paid.)

2026-01-28T17:36:43.066395 [actor]: foundation apprenticship wales governmnet funded

2026-01-28T17:36:45.297981 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. A foundation apprenticeship that's Welsh Government funded would typically be considered approved training.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK, or do you work in the UK and pay UK National Insurance contributions?**

2026-01-28T17:36:46.919566 [actor]: live in cardiff wales uk

2026-01-28T17:36:48.940047 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. You live in Cardiff, Wales, UK.

Next question: **Are you the person who is mainly responsible for your daughter, or do you share responsibility equally with someone else (such as a partner or ex-partner)?**

2026-01-28T17:36:50.793655 [actor]: shes living with me im the mum main responsibilty

2026-01-28T17:36:52.747859 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. You're the main person responsible for your daughter and she lives with you.

Next question: **Are you or your partner (if you have one) currently receiving Child Benefit for your daughter, or has anyone else claimed Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-28T17:36:54.299446 [actor]: no one claming it now thats why im asking

2026-01-28T17:36:56.904143 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that no one is currently claiming Child Benefit for your daughter.

One more important question: **Did your daughter start her foundation apprenticeship before or after she turned 16, and is she still enrolled in it?**

(This is important because to continue receiving Child Benefit after age 16, the young person must have been enrolled in approved education or training before turning 20, and they must still be in that education or training.)

2026-01-28T17:36:58.735164 [actor]: she started after turnin 16 shes still doin it now

2026-01-28T17:37:03.597633 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - it appears you should be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

✓ Your daughter is 17 (under 20)
✓ She's doing a Welsh Government-funded foundation apprenticeship, which is approved training
✓ She started it after turning 16 and is still enrolled
✓ You live in the UK (Cardiff, Wales)
✓ You're the main person responsible for her and she lives with you
✓ No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for her

**However, there is one important consideration:** You'll need to check whether your daughter's apprenticeship is **unpaid** or if she receives an apprenticeship wage. Child Benefit typically continues for young people in unpaid approved training, but paid apprenticeships may be treated differently.

**My final question: Is your daughter's foundation apprenticeship unpaid, or does she receive an apprenticeship wage/salary?**

2026-01-28T17:37:05.254972 [actor]: she gets paid but its foundation apprenticship wales not england

2026-01-28T17:37:10.869701 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. This is an important detail.

Unfortunately, **if your daughter is receiving a wage or salary for her apprenticeship, you are likely NOT eligible for Child Benefit**, even though it's a Welsh Government-funded foundation apprenticeship.

Here's why: Child Benefit generally stops when a young person:
- Starts paid work (including paid apprenticeships), OR
- Leaves approved education or training

The key factor is that she's being **paid** for the apprenticeship. Paid apprenticeships - whether in Wales or England - typically don't qualify for Child Benefit purposes, as they're considered employment rather than purely education or training.

**However**, I'd recommend you contact HMRC's Child Benefit Office directly to confirm this, as:
- Foundation apprenticeships in Wales may have specific considerations
- The rules can be complex and there may be exceptions I'm not aware of
- They can give you a definitive answer based on the specific details of your daughter's apprenticeship

You can contact the Child Benefit Office at **0300 200 3100** or check the gov.uk website for more information.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T17:37:12.636405 [actor]: ok so not eligble then cheers

2026-01-28T17:37:16.661225 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated I was "likely NOT eligible" because my daughter receives a wage for her apprenticeship, but according to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit continues for young people under 20 in approved education or training regardless of whether they receive an allowance or wage during that training.
