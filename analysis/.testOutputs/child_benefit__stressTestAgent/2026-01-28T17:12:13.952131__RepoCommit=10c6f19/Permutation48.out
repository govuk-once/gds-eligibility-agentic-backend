2026-01-28T17:40:53.530677 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:40:55.179106 [actor]: child beneffit for 18 year old collge student

2026-01-28T17:40:58.394591 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. So you have an 18-year-old who is in college.

Let me ask you this: **Is your 18-year-old in approved education or training that is not higher education (such as A-levels, T-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or similar courses)?**

This is important because Child Benefit can continue until age 20 for approved education or training, but generally not for higher education courses like university degrees.

2026-01-28T17:41:00.364845 [actor]: hnc course at collge not univrsity

2026-01-28T17:41:03.161722 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying - an HNC course at college (not university).

**Is this HNC course full-time, and does it involve more than 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience?**

This helps me determine if it qualifies as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-28T17:41:04.636912 [actor]: full time course yes more than 12 hours

2026-01-28T17:41:07.814988 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. An HNC course can sometimes qualify as approved education or training, but it depends on the level.

**Do you know what level the HNC course is? Specifically, is it up to and including Level 3 (equivalent to A-levels), or is it Level 4 or above?**

HNCs are typically Level 4 or 5 qualifications, which would be considered higher education and wouldn't normally qualify for Child Benefit beyond age 19. However, I want to confirm the specific level of this course.

2026-01-28T17:41:09.237385 [actor]: level 4 hnc course

2026-01-28T17:41:13.248195 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Unfortunately, a Level 4 HNC course is considered higher education, similar to the first year of a university degree. **Child Benefit generally stops when a young person turns 20, or when they leave approved education or training - whichever comes first.**

Since Level 4 courses are higher education, they don't qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes after the young person turns 19.

Let me ask: **Has your 18-year-old already turned 19, or are they still 18?**

This timing is important because:
- Child Benefit continues until the 31st August after their 19th birthday if they're in approved education or training
- But Level 4+ courses (like HNC) only count as approved education up until they turn 19

2026-01-28T17:41:14.800905 [actor]: still 18 turns 19 in november

2026-01-28T17:41:18.742100 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your child is currently 18 and will turn 19 in November.

Here's the important point: **Child Benefit can continue until the 31st August following their 19th birthday, but only if they're in approved education or training.** Since the HNC Level 4 course is higher education, it won't qualify as approved education for Child Benefit purposes once they turn 19.

This means:
- You should be eligible for Child Benefit while they're still 18
- Once they turn 19 (in November), the HNC course won't qualify as approved education
- Your Child Benefit would stop from the date they turn 19

Before I can fully confirm your eligibility, let me ask: **Are you responsible for the child, meaning they normally live with you, or you're contributing at least the amount of Child Benefit toward their upkeep?**

2026-01-28T17:41:20.126948 [actor]: yes live with me responsible for them

2026-01-28T17:41:23.521281 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Based on what you've told me:

**You should be eligible for Child Benefit now** while your child is 18 years old and living with you.

However, **your Child Benefit will stop when your child turns 19 in November**, because the Level 4 HNC course they're taking is considered higher education and doesn't qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes beyond age 19.

Just one final question to complete the eligibility assessment: **Are you currently living in the UK, and is your child also living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:41:25.354464 [actor]: yes both living in uk

2026-01-28T17:41:29.013159 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Based on all the information you've provided, here's your Child Benefit eligibility status:

**You ARE currently eligible for Child Benefit** because:
- You have an 18-year-old child who lives with you
- You're responsible for them
- Both you and your child live in the UK

**However, your Child Benefit will stop when your child turns 19 in November** because:
- The Level 4 HNC course is considered higher education
- Higher education courses don't qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes after age 19
- Child Benefit only continues past 19 (until the August after their 20th birthday) for approved education/training up to Level 3

So you can continue claiming until your child's 19th birthday in November, at which point your entitlement will end.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T17:41:32.120332 [actor]: ok thank you

2026-01-28T17:41:34.401350 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that I am currently eligible for Child Benefit while my child is 18, but that eligibility will end when they turn 19 in November because Level 4 HNC courses are considered higher education and don't qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes beyond age 19.
