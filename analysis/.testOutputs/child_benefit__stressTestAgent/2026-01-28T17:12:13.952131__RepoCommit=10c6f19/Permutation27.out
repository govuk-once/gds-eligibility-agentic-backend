2026-01-28T17:28:19.961096 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child (or children) who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T17:28:21.677565 [actor]: need child benefit for baby help

2026-01-28T17:28:24.250447 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. So you have a baby - that's great, they would meet the age requirement.

Now, let me ask you: Are you responsible for the child? This means do you live with the baby and are you the one looking after them?

2026-01-28T17:28:25.926545 [actor]: yes live with baby mine

2026-01-28T17:28:28.032682 [root_agent]: Great! So you live with your baby and are responsible for them.

Next question: Are you or your partner currently receiving Child Benefit for this baby already? Or is this a new claim you're looking to make?

2026-01-28T17:28:29.617522 [actor]: new claim want to get it for my baby mia

2026-01-28T17:28:31.902135 [root_agent]: Perfect, so this is a new claim for your baby Mia.

Now I need to ask: Do you normally live in the UK? (This means the UK is your main home where you usually reside)

2026-01-28T17:28:33.940478 [actor]: yes live in uk with my parents

2026-01-28T17:28:36.198782 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you live in the UK.

One more important question: Are you the person with the main day-to-day responsibility for caring for baby Mia? (This means you're the one primarily looking after her - feeding, clothing, and caring for her daily needs)

2026-01-28T17:28:38.138729 [actor]: yes i look after mia everyday im her mum

2026-01-28T17:28:42.192956 [root_agent]: Excellent! Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be **eligible for Child Benefit** for your baby Mia.

Here's why you qualify:
- Mia is under 16 years old (she's a baby)
- You live with her in the UK
- You are responsible for her and provide her main day-to-day care as her mum
- This is a new claim (you're not already receiving it)

You meet all the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

**Next steps:** You'll need to make a claim for Child Benefit. You should do this as soon as possible, as it can be backdated for up to 3 months from the date you make your claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the claiming process?

2026-01-28T17:28:45.561657 [actor]: ok thanks for help

2026-01-28T17:28:48.011391 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility.
