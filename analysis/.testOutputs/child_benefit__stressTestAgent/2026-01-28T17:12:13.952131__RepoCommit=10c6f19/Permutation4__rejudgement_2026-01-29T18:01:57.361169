**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Child's Age:** The daughter is 18 years old, which is over 16 but under 20.

2. **Education/Training Status:** The daughter left school 2 years ago (at approximately age 16) and is not currently in any approved education or training.

3. **Employment:** The daughter works 30 hours per week as a receptionist, which is full-time employment.

4. **Eligibility Rule Application:** According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 (turning 20) only if they are in approved education or training. The daughter does not meet this criterion, as she left education 2 years ago and is in full-time work instead.

5. **Agent's Communication:** The agent clearly explained that the user is "not eligible for Child Benefit" and provided accurate reasoning: "Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 16, unless they remain in approved education or training."

The agent's assessment is correct and aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**. Both the original evaluation judge (✓) and my assessment (👍) confirm the agent properly determined and communicated the eligibility status.
