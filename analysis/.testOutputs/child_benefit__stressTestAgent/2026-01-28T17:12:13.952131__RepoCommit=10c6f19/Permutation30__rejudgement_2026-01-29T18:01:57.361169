**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** and accurately explained the financial arrangements, which aligns with the expected outcome: "Eligible (Lucas receives money; Emily pays the tax)."

Key points the agent got right:
1. **Eligibility confirmed**: The agent clearly stated "You ARE eligible for Child Benefit"
2. **Payment recipient**: The agent confirmed Lucas (the claimant) will receive the payments into his bank account
3. **Tax liability**: The agent correctly identified that Emily (the wife/higher earner at £65,000) must repay the benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge
4. **100% repayment**: The agent accurately calculated that since Emily earns £15,000 over the £50,000 threshold, the repayment would be 100%
5. **Self Assessment requirement**: The agent mentioned Emily would need to complete a tax return

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome perfectly: Lucas is eligible and receives the money, while Emily (the higher-income partner) pays the tax charge, even though she is not the claimant.
