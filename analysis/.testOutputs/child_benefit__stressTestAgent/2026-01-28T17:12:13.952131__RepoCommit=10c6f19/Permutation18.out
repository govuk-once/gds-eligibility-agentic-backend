2026-01-28T17:22:21.788488 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:22:23.419391 [actor]: son turned 20 stil in scool doing a levels

2026-01-28T17:22:26.179002 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son being 20 and still in school doing A-levels is relevant.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is your son in full-time non-advanced education or approved training?** 

(A-levels would typically count as non-advanced education, but I need to confirm he's studying full-time)

2026-01-28T17:22:27.756822 [actor]: yes full time a levels not finished yet

2026-01-28T17:22:30.378335 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you. Since your son is in full-time A-level education (which is non-advanced education), he may still qualify as a child for Child Benefit purposes even though he's 20.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you the person responsible for your son - meaning, does he live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards his upkeep?**

2026-01-28T17:22:31.705099 [actor]: he lives with me im his dad

2026-01-28T17:22:33.740470 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's clear - your son lives with you and you're responsible for him.

Next question:

**Are you or your partner currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:22:35.193925 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T17:22:37.086275 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask:

**Do you have immigration status that allows you to claim benefits in the UK? For example, are you a UK citizen, have settled status, or have the right to reside and claim benefits here?**

2026-01-28T17:22:38.414740 [actor]: uk citizen born here

2026-01-28T17:22:40.830872 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

One more important question:

**Is your son the only person claiming Child Benefit for himself? In other words, is anyone else (such as his mother or another person) currently receiving Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T17:22:42.598725 [actor]: no just me claiming nobody else

2026-01-28T17:22:46.894335 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Let me assess your eligibility based on the information you've provided.

**Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

✓ Your son is 20 years old and still in full-time A-level education (non-advanced education), which means he qualifies as a child for Child Benefit purposes until he finishes his A-levels or turns 20 (whichever comes later)

✓ Your son lives with you, and you're responsible for him

✓ You live in the UK and are a UK citizen

✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for your son

**Important note:** Child Benefit will stop when your son either:
- Finishes or leaves his A-level course, OR
- Reaches the age of 20 (which he already has)

So the benefit will continue only until he completes his A-levels. Once he finishes or leaves the course, Child Benefit will end.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T17:22:52.557209 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit stops on the child's 20th birthday (or the 31 August following their 19th birthday, whichever is later), even if they continue in approved education or training. Since the son has already turned 20, eligibility has ceased regardless of whether he is still completing his A-levels.
