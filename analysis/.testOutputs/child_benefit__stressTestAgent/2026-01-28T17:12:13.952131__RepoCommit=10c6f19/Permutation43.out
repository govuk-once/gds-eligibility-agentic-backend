2026-01-28T17:37:19.136758 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:37:20.895822 [actor]: child benefit scotland apprenticship 17 year old

2026-01-28T17:37:24.126375 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old in an apprenticeship in Scotland.

Let me ask you this:

**Is your 17-year-old in approved education or training? Specifically, is their apprenticeship a recognized qualification such as:**
- Scottish Vocational Qualifications up to level 3 (SVQ)
- National Vocational Qualifications up to level 3 (NVQ)
- A similar approved course?

In other words, is this a formal, approved apprenticeship program?

2026-01-28T17:37:25.908411 [actor]: modern apprenticship glasgow starts last month

2026-01-28T17:37:29.295940 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying - a modern apprenticeship in Glasgow that started last month.

Modern apprenticeships in Scotland are generally approved training programs, so that's positive for eligibility.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Are you responsible for this 17-year-old? This means, do they normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards their upkeep (currently at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate per week)?**

2026-01-28T17:37:30.724204 [actor]: lives with dad glasgow

2026-01-28T17:37:32.621395 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So the 17-year-old lives with their dad in Glasgow.

Let me ask you:

**Are you the dad that the child lives with, or are you someone else (such as the other parent, a guardian, or another person)?**

2026-01-28T17:37:34.265303 [actor]: am the dad

2026-01-28T17:37:37.155899 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

So you're the dad, the 17-year-old lives with you in Glasgow, and they started a modern apprenticeship last month.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you currently living in the UK, and do you have the right to claim benefits in the UK? This usually means you're a UK resident and not subject to immigration control that would prevent you from claiming benefits.**

2026-01-28T17:37:38.748308 [actor]: live in glasgow uk yes

2026-01-28T17:37:40.912842 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you.

Now, one more important question:

**Does anyone else currently claim Child Benefit for this 17-year-old? For example, does the child's other parent or anyone else receive Child Benefit for them?**

2026-01-28T17:37:42.284533 [actor]: no one else claims it

2026-01-28T17:37:47.484028 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you should be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You have a 17-year-old child (under 20)
2. ✓ They are in approved education/training (a modern apprenticeship in Scotland)
3. ✓ They live with you, so you're responsible for them
4. ✓ You live in the UK (Glasgow) and have the right to claim benefits
5. ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for them

**Important points to note:**

- Child Benefit can continue until your child turns 20, as long as they remain in approved education or training
- If your child leaves their apprenticeship or it ends before they turn 20, you should inform the Child Benefit Office
- You'll need to make a claim if you haven't already done so

**One final question: Do you earn over £50,000 per year?** (This won't affect your eligibility to *receive* Child Benefit, but it may affect whether you need to pay some or all of it back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-28T17:37:48.940579 [actor]: no earn under that

2026-01-28T17:37:52.705430 [root_agent]: Excellent! That's good news.

**Summary: You are eligible for Child Benefit.**

Since you earn under £50,000 per year, you won't need to worry about the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means you can receive the full Child Benefit amount without having to pay any of it back.

**What you need to do:**

If you haven't already claimed Child Benefit, you'll need to make a claim. You can do this online or by post.

**Important reminders:**

- Keep the Child Benefit Office informed if your child's circumstances change (e.g., if they leave their apprenticeship)
- Child Benefit can continue until your child turns 20, as long as they stay in approved education or training
- The apprenticeship must remain an approved qualification

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-28T17:37:58.164340 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a parent living with their 17-year-old child in a modern apprenticeship in Scotland, earning under £50,000, with no one else claiming, is eligible for Child Benefit, which aligns with the eligibility criteria on gov.uk.
