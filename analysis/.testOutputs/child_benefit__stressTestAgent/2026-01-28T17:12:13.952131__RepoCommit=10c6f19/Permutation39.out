2026-01-28T17:34:54.660762 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:34:56.462130 [actor]: adopted kids special needs get money from council can I still claim

2026-01-28T17:34:59.195459 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Yes, you can still potentially claim Child Benefit even if you receive money from the council for your adopted child with special needs.

To help me assess your eligibility properly, let me ask:

**Are you responsible for the child - meaning do they normally live with you, or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent) towards their upkeep?**

2026-01-28T17:35:00.817823 [actor]: yes they live with us 6 and 8 years old siblingz

2026-01-28T17:35:03.576986 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know you have two children aged 6 and 8 living with you.

Now, let me ask you an important question about your circumstances:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 a year?**

(This is important because it may affect whether you need to pay a tax charge, though you can still claim the benefit itself.)

2026-01-28T17:35:05.705545 [actor]: no income not high we just get the adopshun allowance from local authority for the kids

2026-01-28T17:35:07.827462 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. That's helpful information.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you or your partner currently subject to immigration control - meaning do either of you have any restrictions on your right to live in the UK, or are you both settled here?**

2026-01-28T17:35:09.365283 [actor]: we are settled here born in uk both of us

2026-01-28T17:35:11.916678 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now let me ask about your specific situation with the children:

**Are both children currently living with you full-time, or are either of them in hospital or care for any extended periods?**

(This is important because there are specific rules if a child is in hospital or local authority care for certain lengths of time.)

2026-01-28T17:35:13.758187 [actor]: they live with us fulltime adopted them properly legal adoption

2026-01-28T17:35:16.012332 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's very clear.

Let me ask one more important question:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for either of these two children?**

(For example, a birth parent or another family member who might still have an active claim.)

2026-01-28T17:35:17.548089 [actor]: no one else claiming we are the parents now adoption final

2026-01-28T17:35:23.175273 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for both of your children. Here's why:

✓ You have two children under 16 (aged 6 and 8)
✓ They live with you full-time
✓ You are responsible for them (as their adoptive parents with finalized adoption)
✓ You and your partner are settled in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for them
✓ Your income is below £50,000, so you won't have to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge

**Important points:**
- The adoption allowance you receive from the local authority does not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit - these are separate benefits
- You can claim Child Benefit for both children
- Since your income is under £50,000, you can claim and keep the full amount without any tax charge

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for both children. Would you like to know anything else about your eligibility?

2026-01-28T17:35:28.468105 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for both adopted children, correctly noting that adoption allowances from local authorities do not affect Child Benefit eligibility, and properly verified all necessary criteria including residency, responsibility, income threshold, and that no one else is claiming for the children.
