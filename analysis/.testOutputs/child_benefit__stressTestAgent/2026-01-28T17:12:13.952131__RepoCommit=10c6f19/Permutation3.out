2026-01-28T17:13:21.232762 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T17:13:23.009713 [actor]: son 17 left skool registerd carers service looking apprenticship

2026-01-28T17:13:25.509464 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old son who has left school and is registered with a careers service looking for an apprenticeship.

To assess his eligibility, I need to know: Is your son enrolled in any approved education or training at the moment, such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs, or any other approved courses?

2026-01-28T17:13:27.227071 [actor]: no left in june not in collge registered with youth carers service

2026-01-28T17:13:29.566472 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son left school in June, is not in college, and is registered with a youth careers service.

Now I need to ask: Is your son currently responsible for a child of their own, or are they part of a couple living together with someone?

2026-01-28T17:13:31.025212 [actor]: no just me and him lives with me

2026-01-28T17:13:32.860945 [root_agent]: Thank you. So it's just you and your son living together, and he doesn't have any children of his own.

Now, an important question: Is your son working or in paid employment at the moment?

2026-01-28T17:13:34.543481 [actor]: no looking for apprenticship actively looking

2026-01-28T17:13:36.656755 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask another important question:

Are you (or your partner if you have one) responsible for your son? By this I mean, does your son live with you and do you provide for him financially?

2026-01-28T17:13:38.093230 [actor]: yes he lives with me im responsble

2026-01-28T17:13:40.147725 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now I need to understand your own circumstances:

Do you normally live in the UK, or are you treated as living in the UK for benefit purposes?

2026-01-28T17:13:41.603691 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T17:13:43.277579 [root_agent]: Thank you. And one more question about your own status:

Are you subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on your right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-28T17:13:44.959822 [actor]: no im fine uk resident

2026-01-28T17:13:50.843313 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on the current Child Benefit rules, I'm afraid your son is not eligible as a qualifying child for Child Benefit in your circumstances.**

Here's why:

Child Benefit can be claimed for young people aged 16-19 (turning 20), but **only if** they are in approved education or training. The key rules are:

- The education or training must be full-time (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience)
- Simply being registered with a careers service and looking for an apprenticeship does not count as being "in approved education or training"

Since your son left school in June and is not currently enrolled in college, an apprenticeship, or any other approved education or training course, Child Benefit would have stopped from the following dates:
- 31 August (the end of the school leaving year), or
- The date he left the approved education/training

**Once your son starts an apprenticeship**, you may be able to claim Child Benefit again, as long as the apprenticeship is approved and he remains under 20 years old.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-28T17:13:52.561162 [actor]: ok so no benefit then

2026-01-28T17:13:55.406815 [root_agent]: That's correct - you're not eligible for Child Benefit at the moment because your son is not currently in approved education or training.

However, **this could change** once your son finds and starts an apprenticeship. If he starts an approved apprenticeship before he turns 20, you should be able to claim Child Benefit again at that point.

When he does start an apprenticeship, you would need to contact the Child Benefit Office to let them know and restart your claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or this situation?

2026-01-28T17:14:01.432192 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, a young person who has left education and is registered with certain careers services or connections services is covered for an "extension period" of up to 20 weeks after leaving education while they look for work or training. Since the son left school in June and is registered with a careers service looking for an apprenticeship, the parent should be eligible for Child Benefit during this extension period (up to 20 weeks from when he left education).
