2026-01-28T17:15:16.155914 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:15:17.595767 [actor]: daughter 6 yrs old hosptial

2026-01-28T17:15:19.458037 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 6-year-old daughter who is in hospital.

Let me ask you: **Is your daughter expected to be in hospital for more than 12 weeks?**

2026-01-28T17:15:21.161069 [actor]: been ther 14 weeks alredy

2026-01-28T17:15:23.839746 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Your daughter has already been in hospital for 14 weeks.

Next question: **Are you still contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay (currently £25.60 per week for the eldest child) towards your daughter's upkeep while she's in hospital?**

This could include things like buying her clothes, toys, or other items she needs.

2026-01-28T17:15:25.371069 [actor]: spend 30 pound every week books pyjamas food

2026-01-28T17:15:27.394819 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful. You're spending £30 per week on items like books, pyjamas, and food for your daughter, which is more than the Child Benefit amount.

Now let me ask: **Do you live in the UK, or are you considered ordinarily resident in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:15:29.287995 [actor]: live uk visit every day

2026-01-28T17:15:31.314621 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you live in the UK and visit your daughter every day.

Next question: **Are you the person who is responsible for your daughter - meaning you're the one who has main day-to-day responsibility for her care when she's not in hospital?**

2026-01-28T17:15:33.157660 [actor]: yes am responsible for her

2026-01-28T17:15:35.173662 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Let me ask: **Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your daughter, or are you applying for it for the first time?**

2026-01-28T17:15:36.543077 [actor]: need to know if eligible first

2026-01-28T17:15:38.798411 [root_agent]: I understand. Let me ask one more important question:

**Is your daughter in hospital receiving NHS treatment, or is she in some other type of care facility (such as a local authority care home)?**

2026-01-28T17:15:40.876848 [actor]: nhs hospital serious condition

2026-01-28T17:15:46.134155 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you should be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

✓ You have a 6-year-old daughter (under 16)
✓ You're responsible for her
✓ You live in the UK
✓ She's in an NHS hospital
✓ You're contributing at least £30 per week towards her upkeep (more than the Child Benefit amount of £25.60)
✓ You visit her regularly

**Important point about hospital stays:** When a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks, you can normally only continue to get Child Benefit if you're still contributing at least the weekly Child Benefit amount towards their upkeep. Since your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks and you're spending £30 per week on items for her, you meet this requirement.

You can continue to claim Child Benefit as long as you keep contributing towards her upkeep while she remains in hospital.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-28T17:15:52.009563 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user qualifies for Child Benefit under the hospital stay exception, correctly applying the rule that when a child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks, the claimant can continue receiving Child Benefit if they contribute at least the weekly Child Benefit amount (£25.60) towards the child's upkeep, which the user does at £30 per week.
