**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit but subject to a tax charge**, which aligns perfectly with the expected outcome.

**Key points the agent got right:**

1. **Eligibility confirmed**: The agent clearly stated multiple times that the user "is eligible for Child Benefit" and "can claim it"

2. **Tax charge explained**: The agent accurately explained the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC), noting that:
   - The user's income of £75,000 exceeds the £60,000 threshold
   - At this income level, 100% of the benefit must be paid back through tax
   - This is done via Self Assessment tax return

3. **Practical implications**: The agent helpfully explained that while eligible to claim, the user would receive payments but pay them back in tax, resulting in zero net benefit

4. **Options presented**: The agent gave the user two choices - claim and pay back, or opt out of payments

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)" for this high-earner scenario where one partner earns £75,000 (between the £60,000-£80,000 range where full clawback applies).
