**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated the eligibility outcome that aligns with the expected outcome: **Eligible (but only for the last 3 months; they lose the first month's money)**.

The agent explicitly stated:
- "you can backdate your Child Benefit claim for up to **3 months** from the date you make your claim"
- "Since your baby is 4 months old, you should claim as soon as possible to get the maximum backdated payment available"
- "if you claim now, you'll be able to get Child Benefit payments going back 3 months"

The agent clearly communicated that:
1. The user IS eligible for Child Benefit ✓
2. Backdating is limited to 3 months ✓
3. Since the baby is 4 months old, only 3 months can be claimed back ✓

This implicitly but clearly indicates the first month's payment will be lost. While the agent could have been more explicit about losing the first month's money, they accurately conveyed the essential outcome: eligible, but only for 3 months of backdated payment when the baby is 4 months old. The mathematical reality communicated (4 months old, 3 months backdating) necessarily means one month is lost, which matches the expected outcome.
