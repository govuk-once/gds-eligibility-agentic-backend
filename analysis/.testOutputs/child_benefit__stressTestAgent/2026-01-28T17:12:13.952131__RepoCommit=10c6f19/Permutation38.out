2026-01-28T17:34:09.190484 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:34:11.042528 [actor]: babby 4 months old forgot form can i get mony back

2026-01-28T17:34:13.657340 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 4-month-old baby, which is great - that meets the age requirement.

Now, let me ask you this important question:

**Are you the person who is primarily responsible for your baby? This means you're the one who the child lives with and who is mainly looking after them on a day-to-day basis.**

2026-01-28T17:34:15.218249 [actor]: yes we look after babby every day live with us

2026-01-28T17:34:17.328841 [root_agent]: That's good to hear - your baby lives with you and you look after them every day.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you or your partner currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:34:32.537624 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T17:34:35.446758 [root_agent]: Excellent, that's another requirement met.

Now, an important question about your current situation:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for this baby, or have you never claimed it before?**

(I ask because you mentioned forgetting a form and wanting to know about getting money back, so I want to understand if you've already made a claim or if this would be a new claim.)

2026-01-28T17:34:37.225251 [actor]: never claimed forgot to do form when babby born 4 months ago

2026-01-28T17:34:39.795141 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. That's actually quite common - many parents don't claim right away.

Let me ask you one more question to complete the eligibility assessment:

**Does anyone else currently receive Child Benefit for your baby, or is anyone else claiming to be responsible for your baby for benefit purposes?**

2026-01-28T17:34:41.320219 [actor]: no just us nobody else claiming

2026-01-28T17:34:46.156704 [root_agent]: Excellent news! Based on what you've told me, **you are eligible for Child Benefit** because:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 4-month-old baby)
✓ You are primarily responsible for the baby and they live with you
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for your baby

**About claiming backdated payments:**

The good news is that you can backdate your Child Benefit claim for up to **3 months** from the date you make your claim. Since your baby is 4 months old, you should claim as soon as possible to get the maximum backdated payment available.

This means if you claim now, you'll be able to get Child Benefit payments going back 3 months, and then ongoing payments from now forward.

**What you need to do:**

You need to make a claim for Child Benefit. You'll need your baby's birth certificate and your National Insurance number.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about claiming Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T17:34:52.353656 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. While the agent correctly identified that I am eligible for Child Benefit, they stated I can backdate for "up to 3 months from the date you make your claim" when my baby is 4 months old. This means I would only receive 3 months of payments and lose the first month's money. The agent should have explicitly clarified that I would lose one month of benefit (the first month) and only receive backdated payments for the most recent 3 months, not for the full 4 months since birth.
