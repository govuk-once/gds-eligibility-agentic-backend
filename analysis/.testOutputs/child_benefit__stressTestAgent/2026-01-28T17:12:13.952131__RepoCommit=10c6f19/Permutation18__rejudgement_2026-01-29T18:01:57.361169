**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit," which directly contradicts the expected outcome of **Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)**.

According to the official gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, payments stop when a child reaches 20 years of age, even if they are still in approved education or training. The specific rule states that Child Benefit continues until the child turns 20, or until the 31st of August following their 19th birthday - whichever is later.

In this scenario, Dev has already turned 20 years old. The agent incorrectly stated that "Child Benefit will stop when your son either: Finishes or leaves his A-level course, OR Reaches the age of 20 (which he already has)" and then concluded the benefit "will continue only until he completes his A-levels." This is factually incorrect - once a child turns 20, eligibility immediately ceases, regardless of their educational status.

The correct outcome should have been that the user is **not eligible** because their son has already reached his 20th birthday, and Child Benefit does not extend beyond this age threshold even for students in full-time education.

The evaluation_judge's assessment (✗) correctly identified this error, and I agree with that determination.
