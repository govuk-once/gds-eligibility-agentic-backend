**Justification:**

The expected outcome for this scenario is **"Not Eligible"** for Child Benefit. However, the agent communicated that the user **"ARE currently eligible for Child Benefit"** (while the child is 18), with eligibility ending when the child turns 19 in November.

The key issue is the timing and framing of eligibility:

1. **Agent's communication**: The agent stated the user IS eligible NOW and can continue claiming until the child's 19th birthday in November.

2. **Expected outcome**: The scenario expects a determination of "Not Eligible" - this suggests that because the child is enrolled in an HNC Level 4 course (advanced/higher education), they should not qualify for Child Benefit even while still 18.

3. **The critical distinction**: According to gov.uk guidance, approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes means non-advanced education (up to Level 3). Since HNC Level 4 is advanced education, it does not qualify as "approved education or training" at any age, including while the young person is 18.

The agent incorrectly allowed eligibility to continue until age 19, when the correct interpretation should be that once the 18-year-old started the Level 4 HNC course, they ceased to be in "approved education or training," making the user not eligible for Child Benefit from that point forward.

The agent's outcome contradicts the expected "Not Eligible" determination.
