**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit**, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)."

The agent appropriately:

1. **Confirmed eligibility** - Clearly stated multiple times that the user is eligible to claim Child Benefit for their 4-year-old daughter Ruby

2. **Explained the tax charge** - Accurately explained that with an income of £75,000 (over £60,000), the user would be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge and would have to pay back 100% of the benefit through Self Assessment

3. **Clarified the confusion** - When the user expressed confusion ("ok so I get the benfit or not confused"), the agent clearly explained that they ARE eligible and CAN claim it, but will have to pay it back through tax

4. **Provided context** - Explained why someone might still want to claim despite the charge (National Insurance credits)

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome perfectly: the user is eligible for Child Benefit but will be subject to a tax charge due to their high income level.
