**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome indicates the user should be **eligible**.

According to the scenario context provided, this is "Permutation 47: The 'Court Order' Contributor" where James pays £50/week under a court order and argues he shouldn't be eligible because it's not "voluntary." The criteria response states: "Yes. Payments made under a **court order** or agreement count towards the maintenance requirement for Child Benefit eligibility."

The agent focused solely on the residence and day-to-day care aspect, correctly noting that typically the person the child lives with claims Child Benefit. However, the agent failed to explore or communicate the nuance that court-ordered maintenance payments can contribute to eligibility under certain circumstances, particularly in shared care or contribution-based scenarios.

Since the expected outcome is **Eligible** and the agent communicated **Not Eligible**, the eligibility outcome does not agree with the expected outcome.
