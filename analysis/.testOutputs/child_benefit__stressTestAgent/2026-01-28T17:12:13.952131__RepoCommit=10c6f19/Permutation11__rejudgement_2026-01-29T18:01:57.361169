**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that Karen is **eligible** for Child Benefit, but according to the expected outcome, she should be **not eligible** and must stop her claim.

The critical error is in the agent's treatment of apprenticeships. According to the Gov.UK guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), when a child starts an **apprenticeship in England**, this is specifically a **disqualifying event** for Child Benefit purposes, unlike staying in full-time approved education such as A-levels.

The scenario explicitly states: "Under the rules, starting an **apprenticeship in England** is a disqualifying event for Child Benefit, unlike staying in school for A-levels."

The agent treated Ryan's government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship as "approved training" that would maintain eligibility, but this is incorrect. While apprenticeships are valuable training programs, they do not count as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes in the same way that full-time non-advanced education does.

**Expected outcome:** Not Eligible (Karen must stop her claim)
**Agent's communicated outcome:** Eligible

Since the agent's eligibility determination directly contradicts the expected outcome, this is a failure.
