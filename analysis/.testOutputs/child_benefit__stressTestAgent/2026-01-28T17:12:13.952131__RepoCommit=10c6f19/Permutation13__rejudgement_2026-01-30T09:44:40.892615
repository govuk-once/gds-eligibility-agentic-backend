**Justification:** The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."

The agent's assessment was accurate because:

1. **Adoption placement status**: The agent correctly recognized that Child Benefit can be claimed when a child placed for adoption moves in with prospective adopters, even before the final adoption order is granted. This aligns with UK government guidance that states you can claim "as soon as any child you're adopting comes to live with you."

2. **Responsibility criteria**: The agent confirmed the user is responsible for day-to-day care of the child (Maya, age 4).

3. **UK residency**: The user confirmed they are a UK resident.

4. **No duplicate claims**: No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child.

The agent explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided clear reasoning, correctly applying the rules for prospective adopters. The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent agrees with the expected outcome.
