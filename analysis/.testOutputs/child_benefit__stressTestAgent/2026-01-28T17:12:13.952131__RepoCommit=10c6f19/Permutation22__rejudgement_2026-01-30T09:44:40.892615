**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user **is eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "Yes, you can get Child Benefit" and "You are eligible to claim Child Benefit for your son."

However, the expected outcome is: **Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)**.

According to the scenario (Permutation 22), this case involves the Hospital "Linking Rule":
- Arthur was in hospital for 10 weeks
- He was home for 2 weeks (15 days)
- He was readmitted and has been in hospital for 3 weeks
- Total cumulative hospital time: 10 + 3 = 13 weeks

According to [gov.uk guidance](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), Child Benefit stops after a child has been in hospital for 12 weeks, unless the parent is spending money on the child's upkeep. The linking rule states that if a child returns to hospital within 28 days, the periods are added together.

While the agent correctly identified that the parent is "paying for things" (which could be the exception that maintains eligibility), the agent **failed to investigate the critical 12-week hospital duration limit** and the linking rule. The agent never asked:
- How long the child has been in hospital
- Whether there were multiple hospital stays
- Whether the total exceeded 12 weeks

The agent's determination of eligibility contradicts the expected outcome, as they did not properly assess the hospital duration criteria that would render the user ineligible after the cumulative 12th week.
