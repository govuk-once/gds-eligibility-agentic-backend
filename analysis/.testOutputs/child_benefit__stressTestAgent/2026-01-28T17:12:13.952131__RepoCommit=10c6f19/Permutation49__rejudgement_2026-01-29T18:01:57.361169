**Justification:**

The agent determined the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, but the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), a child aged 16-19 can qualify if they are in approved education or training. However, the guidance specifically **excludes** education or training done "with an employer's agreement - for example, to get a job."

In this scenario (Permutation 49), Tom (17) is doing a coding course where his future employer pays the course fees as part of an agreement that he will join them afterwards. This is explicitly described as a course "with an employer's agreement" to get a job afterward.

The agent failed to recognize this exclusion and instead focused only on whether the course was "full-time" (12+ hours per week). While the agent did ask clarifying questions about whether the son was employed versus a student, they did not properly apply the rule that courses done under an employer agreement for future employment are **not** approved education for Child Benefit purposes.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, noting that "employer-sponsored training that leads directly to employment" does not qualify for the education/training exception.

**Conclusion:** The agent communicated an eligibility outcome (Eligible) that **does not agree** with the expected outcome (Not Eligible).
