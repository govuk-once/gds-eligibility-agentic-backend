**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

The agent systematically verified all key eligibility criteria:

1. **Age and education/training status**: Confirmed the child is 16 years old and participating in the "No One Left Behind" programme, which the agent correctly identified as approved training for Child Benefit purposes
2. **Responsibility**: Verified the child lives with the claimant
3. **Residency**: Confirmed UK residency (Edinburgh, Scotland)
4. **No duplicate claims**: Established no one else is claiming for the same child
5. **Income threshold**: Confirmed income is under £60,000 (no High Income Child Benefit Charge applies)

The agent's final determination explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided clear reasoning based on all the criteria being met. This assessment aligns perfectly with the expected outcome that the user should be eligible for Child Benefit.
