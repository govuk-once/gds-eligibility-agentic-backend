**Justification:**

The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible (Expired)**.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of the 91-day limit**: The agent accurately explained that jobseekers with pre-settled status have a right to reside for benefit purposes limited to 91 days.

2. **Proper application to the user's circumstances**: The agent correctly identified that the user (Hans) has been unemployed and claiming as a jobseeker for 95 days, which exceeds the 91-day threshold.

3. **Accurate assessment of qualifying criteria**: The agent properly determined that:
   - Hans came to the UK purely as a jobseeker (not as a worker)
   - He has never worked in the UK
   - He has no other qualifying status (self-sufficient, comprehensive health insurance, etc.)
   - He has no imminent job offer

4. **Clear communication of ineligibility**: The agent explicitly stated "you are not currently eligible for Child Benefit" and provided a thorough explanation of why this is the case.

5. **Consistency with expected outcome**: The scenario indicates Hans should be "Not Eligible (Expired)" due to exceeding the 91-day jobseeker limit, and the agent's assessment matches this exactly.

The evaluation judge also confirmed the agent's correct determination with a ✓, and the agent's reasoning demonstrates a proper understanding of the right to reside requirements for Child Benefit purposes.
