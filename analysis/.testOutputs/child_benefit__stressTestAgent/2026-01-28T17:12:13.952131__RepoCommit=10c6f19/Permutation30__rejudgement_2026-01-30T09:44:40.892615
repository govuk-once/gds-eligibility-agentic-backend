**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated the eligibility outcome that aligns with the expected outcome for this scenario.

**Key points the agent got right:**

1. **Eligibility confirmed**: The agent clearly stated multiple times that the user IS eligible for Child Benefit and can proceed with the claim.

2. **Payment arrangement**: The agent confirmed that Lucas (the claimant) will receive the Child Benefit payments into his bank account as he arranged on the form.

3. **Tax liability**: The agent correctly identified that Emily (the wife), as the higher earner at £65,000, will be responsible for paying back the benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge via Self Assessment.

4. **Repayment amount**: The agent accurately calculated that 100% of the benefit would need to be repaid since Emily earns £15,000 over the £50,000 threshold.

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome: **Eligible (Lucas receives money; Emily pays the tax)**. The user also confirmed understanding with "eligble and wife pays it back understood," showing the message was clearly conveyed.
