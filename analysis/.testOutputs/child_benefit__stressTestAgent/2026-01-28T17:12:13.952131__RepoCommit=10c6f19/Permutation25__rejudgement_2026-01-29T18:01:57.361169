**Justification:**

The agent determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "you are not eligible to claim Child Benefit while Leo is in local authority care."

However, according to the expected outcome and the specific circumstances of this permutation, the user **should be eligible**.

**Key factors the agent missed:**

1. **The 8-week threshold**: According to [gov.uk guidance](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), parents can continue to claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit to the child's upkeep. Leo has been in care for 10 weeks, which exceeds 8 weeks, so contributions become relevant.

2. **Spousal contributions count**: The scenario specifically notes that the husband (stepfather) pays £30/week to the carer. The rules state that a **partner's money counts as the applicant's contribution** when they are married/civil partners and living together. The agent failed to recognize that the husband's £30/week payment satisfies the contribution requirement.

3. **The agent incorrectly applied a blanket rule**: The agent stated parents cannot claim "even if they are contributing financially," which is incorrect. The whole point of the contribution rule is that parents CAN claim if they contribute enough.

**Conclusion**: The agent communicated an outcome of "not eligible" when the correct outcome should have been "eligible" due to the spousal contribution exception. This does not agree with the expected outcome.
