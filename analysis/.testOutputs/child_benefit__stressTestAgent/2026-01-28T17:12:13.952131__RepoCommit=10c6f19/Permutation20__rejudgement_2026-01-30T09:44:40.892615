**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct Assessment of Criteria:**
   - The agent properly identified that the user (Maria/grandmother) is responsible for a child under 16 (granddaughter, age 14)
   - The agent correctly recognized that having an informal arrangement to care for a relative's child qualifies for Child Benefit eligibility
   - The agent verified main responsibility (the grandmother pays for everything and the child lives with her)
   - The agent confirmed UK residency and citizenship status
   - The agent verified no one else is claiming Child Benefit for the child

2. **Alignment with Expected Outcome:**
   - The expected outcome states: "Outcome: Eligible"
   - The agent's conclusion: "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit"
   - These outcomes match

3. **Correct Application of Rules:**
   - Per gov.uk guidance, you can claim Child Benefit if you have an informal arrangement to look after a friend or relative's child
   - The grandmother meets all criteria: she has main responsibility, lives in the UK, the child is under 16, and no one else is claiming

The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected result of "Eligible."
