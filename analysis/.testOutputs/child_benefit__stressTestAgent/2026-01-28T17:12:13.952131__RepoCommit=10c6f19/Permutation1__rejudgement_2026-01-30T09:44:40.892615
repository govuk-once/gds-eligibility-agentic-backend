**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Assessment against eligibility criteria:**

1. **Responsibility**: ✓ The user confirmed they are responsible for their 8-year-old son who lives with them
2. **Child's Age and Education**: ✓ The son is 8 years old (under 16) and in primary school
3. **Residency and Immigration**: ✓ Both parents are UK nationals living in Manchester
4. **Living Arrangements**: ✓ The son lives with them full-time
5. **State Support**: ✓ No indication the child is in hospital or care
6. **High Income Child Benefit Charge**: ✓ The agent correctly identified that neither parent earns over £50,000 (incomes are £35,000 and £15,000), so the High Income Child Benefit Charge won't apply

The agent systematically worked through all relevant criteria, asked appropriate clarifying questions, and reached the correct conclusion. The agent also provided helpful additional information about next steps and noted that only one parent can be the claimant. The eligibility determination matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
