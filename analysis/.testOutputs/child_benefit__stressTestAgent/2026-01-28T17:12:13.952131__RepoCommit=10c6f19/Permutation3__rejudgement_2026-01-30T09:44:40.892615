**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, when they should actually be **eligible for up to 20 weeks** under the extension period.

**Key Facts from the Transcript:**
- Son is 17 years old
- Left school in June (currently August, so within 20 weeks)
- Registered with youth careers service
- Actively looking for an apprenticeship
- Not in paid employment
- Lives with the parent who is responsible for him

**Why the Agent Was Wrong:**

The agent failed to recognize the **"extension period"** provision in Child Benefit rules. According to gov.uk guidance, when a young person aged 16 or 17 leaves approved education or training, Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks if they are registered with:
- Careers services (England)
- Careers Wales
- Skills Development Scotland
- Education and Library Boards (Northern Ireland)

The user clearly stated their son is "registered with youth carers service" (careers service), left school in June, and is actively looking for an apprenticeship. This meets all the criteria for the extension period eligibility.

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)
**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Not eligible

The agent's determination directly contradicts the expected outcome and the actual Child Benefit rules regarding the extension period for young job seekers registered with careers services.
