2026-01-28T17:30:36.866464 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T17:30:38.256650 [actor]: son 17 colege gcse retakes

2026-01-28T17:30:41.011021 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your 17-year-old son who is at college doing GCSE retakes would potentially qualify, as children under 20 in approved education or training can be covered.

Now, let me ask you: Are you responsible for your son? This means, do you live with him and are you the person who is primarily looking after him?

2026-01-28T17:30:42.396142 [actor]: yeah he lives with me plays games mostly

2026-01-28T17:30:44.410873 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son lives with you and you're responsible for him.

Next question: Are you or your partner currently receiving Child Benefit for your son, or have you received it in the past but it stopped for some reason?

2026-01-28T17:30:45.869316 [actor]: no not getting it now want to know if can get

2026-01-28T17:30:48.678929 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're not currently receiving it.

Let me ask: Is your son's college course an approved education or training programme? This typically includes things like:
- GCSEs or A-levels
- NVQs up to level 3
- Home education (if it started before they turned 16)

Are his GCSE retakes part of a recognized course at a registered educational institution?

2026-01-28T17:30:50.176178 [actor]: yeah local colege doing 2 gcses

2026-01-28T17:30:52.688985 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you. A local college doing GCSEs would typically be approved education.

Now, an important question about your son's education: Is he enrolled in full-time education (which means more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience)?

2026-01-28T17:30:54.285435 [actor]: 6 hours a week supervised study

2026-01-28T17:30:57.291073 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is an important detail.

For Child Benefit purposes, approved education for 16-19 year olds generally needs to be full-time, which means more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience.

At 6 hours a week of supervised study, your son's course may not meet the full-time education requirement for Child Benefit eligibility.

Let me ask: Does his course include any additional hours of course-related work experience or other supervised course activities beyond those 6 hours of study?

2026-01-28T17:30:58.736312 [actor]: no just the 6 hours rest of time gaming at home

2026-01-28T17:31:02.597668 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. 

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that you would likely **not be eligible** for Child Benefit in this situation. Here's why:

For a child aged 16-19 to qualify for Child Benefit, they need to be in **full-time approved education or training**. Full-time education is defined as more than 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience.

Your son is only doing 6 hours per week of supervised study at college for his GCSE retakes. This falls short of the 12-hour minimum requirement, which means his course would not be considered full-time education for Child Benefit purposes.

If your son's circumstances change - for example, if he enrolls in a full-time course with more than 12 hours per week - you could potentially become eligible at that point.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-28T17:31:07.981727 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that 6 hours per week of supervised study does not meet the 12+ hours per week requirement for full-time approved education necessary for Child Benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds, and correctly concluded ineligibility.
