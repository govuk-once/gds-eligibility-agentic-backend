**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** to continue receiving Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of the 12-week rule**: The agent properly identified that Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks (84 days) of continuous NHS hospital care.

2. **Proper handling of the "expenditure exception"**: The user explicitly stated "nhs hospital they give evrything" and later asked "but i visit every day spending hours with her doesnt that count." The agent correctly clarified that:
   - Visiting alone does not satisfy the exception
   - The child must come home for visits (at least one day/night per week)
   - The user is not spending money on the child's upkeep (hospital provides everything)

3. **Clear communication of outcome**: The agent explicitly stated "you will not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit" and confirmed the user understood with "ok so not eligble got it thanks."

4. **Alignment with criteria**: 
   - Criteria 1 (Hospital >12 weeks): Yes (14 weeks) ✓
   - Criteria 2 (Regular expenditure): No (hospital provides everything, only visits) ✓
   - Outcome: Not Eligible ✓

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome perfectly.
