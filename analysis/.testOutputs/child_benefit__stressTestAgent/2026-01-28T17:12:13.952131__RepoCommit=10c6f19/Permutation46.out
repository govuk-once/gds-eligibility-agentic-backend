2026-01-28T17:39:33.933325 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 living with you? Or do you have a child under 20 who is in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T17:39:35.466995 [actor]: child benefit jobseeker presettled status 95 days no job

2026-01-28T17:39:38.328367 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you some clarifying questions to assess your eligibility properly.

**First, can you confirm: Do you have a child (under 16) or a young person (under 20 in approved education or training) who you are responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:39:40.033518 [actor]: yes child 5 years old responsible

2026-01-28T17:39:42.008418 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now I need to understand more about your residency status.

**You mentioned you have pre-settled status. Can you confirm that you are currently living in the UK with your 5-year-old child?**

2026-01-28T17:39:43.462543 [actor]: yes living uk with child presettled status

2026-01-28T17:39:45.543210 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now I need to understand more about your circumstances.

**You mentioned you've been in the UK for 95 days with no job and are claiming jobseeker's allowance. Are you actively looking for work, and are you registered as a jobseeker with the relevant authorities?**

2026-01-28T17:39:47.067928 [actor]: yes looking for work jobseeker 95 days no job offer

2026-01-28T17:39:50.070928 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to ask an important question about your right to reside in the UK.

**With your pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, are you from the EU, EEA, or Switzerland? And have you been living in the UK and actively seeking work during these 95 days?**

(This is important because eligibility for Child Benefit requires you to have a "right to reside" in the UK, and the rules can be complex for those with pre-settled status depending on your circumstances and how long you've been jobseeking.)

2026-01-28T17:39:51.727962 [actor]: yes from EU actively seeking work 95 days presettled

2026-01-28T17:39:54.575241 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. I need to ask you something important about your work history in the UK.

**Before you started claiming jobseeker's allowance 95 days ago, were you working in the UK? If so, for how long were you employed?**

(This is important because there are specific rules about retaining "worker status" for people with pre-settled status who are seeking work after having been employed.)

2026-01-28T17:39:56.600638 [actor]: no not working before jobseeker started 95 days ago

2026-01-28T17:39:59.305196 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. This is a crucial point for your eligibility. Let me ask:

**When you arrived in the UK and obtained your pre-settled status, did you come here to look for work, or were you already working or had a job offer when you arrived?**

(This is important because the right to reside rules can be different depending on whether you entered the UK as a jobseeker or as a worker.)

2026-01-28T17:40:00.983037 [actor]: came uk to look for work jobseeker from start

2026-01-28T17:40:03.489878 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I need to understand your situation a bit more clearly.

**Have you been claiming jobseeker's allowance for the entire 95 days since you arrived in the UK, or did you arrive before you started claiming jobseeker's allowance?**

(This helps me understand the timeline of your residency and jobseeking status, which is important for assessing your right to reside for Child Benefit purposes.)

2026-01-28T17:40:04.873053 [actor]: been claiming jobseeker 95 days unemployed 95 days

2026-01-28T17:40:09.914295 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Based on the information you've provided, I need to give you some important information about your eligibility.

**Unfortunately, based on what you've told me, you may not currently be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why: To qualify for Child Benefit, you must have a "right to reside" in the UK. While you have pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, if you:

- Came to the UK purely as a jobseeker (not as a worker)
- Have never worked in the UK
- Have only been seeking work for 95 days

Then your right to reside as a jobseeker is typically limited to a maximum of **91 days** (approximately 3 months) from when you started seeking work. After this period, you may not have a sufficient right to reside for Child Benefit purposes unless you find employment or meet other qualifying criteria.

**One final question to be thorough: Is there any other reason you might have a right to reside in the UK - for example, are you self-sufficient with comprehensive health insurance, or do you have any other status or circumstances I should know about?**

2026-01-28T17:40:11.489137 [actor]: no other status just presettled jobseeker no job no insurance

2026-01-28T17:40:17.932549 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming all those details. Based on the information you've provided, I can now give you an assessment of your eligibility.

**Unfortunately, you are not currently eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

1. **Right to Reside requirement**: To receive Child Benefit, you must have a "right to reside" in the UK that qualifies for benefits purposes.

2. **Your situation**: You have pre-settled status and came to the UK as a jobseeker. While EU citizens with pre-settled status can reside in the UK as jobseekers, this right to reside is generally limited to **91 days** (approximately 3 months) for benefit purposes.

3. **Time limit exceeded**: You've been seeking work for 95 days without finding employment, which means you've exceeded the typical 91-day limit for jobseekers' right to reside for benefits.

4. **No other qualifying status**: You haven't worked in the UK, don't have comprehensive health insurance, and don't have self-sufficient status, which are other ways you might establish a right to reside.

**What you could do**: If you find employment in the UK, you would establish a right to reside as a worker, which would then make you eligible to claim Child Benefit. I'd recommend focusing on securing employment, which would change your eligibility status.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-28T17:40:23.616443 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that as an EU citizen with pre-settled status who came to the UK as a jobseeker (not a worker), never worked in the UK, and has been seeking work for 95 days without employment, I have exceeded the 91-day right to reside limit for jobseekers for benefit purposes, making me ineligible for Child Benefit.
