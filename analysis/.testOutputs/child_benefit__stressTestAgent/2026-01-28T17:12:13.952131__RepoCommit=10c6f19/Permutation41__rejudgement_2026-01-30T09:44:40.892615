**Justification:**

The agent failed to communicate the correct eligibility outcome for this specific scenario.

**What the agent concluded:**
- The user is not eligible for Child Benefit because the ex-partner is already claiming it

**What the expected outcome should be:**
- **Eligible for Ben (Full Rate)** - The user pays £40/week total, and can request HMRC to allocate £26.05 to Ben, meeting the threshold
- **Not Eligible for Jerry** - The remaining £13.95 allocated to Jerry falls short of the £17.25 requirement

**Critical errors in the agent's response:**

1. **Failed to recognize the contribution-based eligibility pathway**: The agent did not assess whether the user's £40/week contribution could qualify them for Child Benefit, even when someone else is the primary claimant

2. **Failed to explain the allocation mechanism**: The agent never mentioned that:
   - HMRC typically splits contributions equally by default (£20/£20)
   - The user can request an unequal allocation (£26.05 for Ben, £13.95 for Jerry)
   - This would make them eligible for at least one child (Ben)

3. **Gave an overly simplistic answer**: The agent simply stated "only one person can claim" without exploring the exception that allows someone contributing at least the Child Benefit rate to also claim

The agent should have identified that with proper allocation of the £40 contribution, Martin would be eligible for Ben at full rate, potentially saving one claim.
