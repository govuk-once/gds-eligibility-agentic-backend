**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** while their son has been in the secure unit for 10 weeks. This aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible (until week 12)."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct rule application**: The agent properly applied the 12-week rule for hospital/residential accommodation under the Mental Health Act (not the 8-week custody rule)

2. **Accurate eligibility determination**: The agent clearly stated "You should still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for your son" because the 10-week period is less than the 12-week threshold

3. **Clear timeline communication**: The agent explicitly informed the user they have "about 2 more weeks" before the 12-week limit is reached, accurately reflecting the "until week 12" timeframe in the expected outcome

4. **Proper context**: The agent explained what happens after 12 weeks (benefit would stop unless contributing financially), which shows understanding of the complete rule

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome that the claimant remains eligible during this 10-week period, with eligibility continuing until the 12-week threshold is reached.
