2026-01-28T17:27:28.758260 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine whether you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking you: **Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T17:27:30.777575 [actor]: child benfit for grandosn he 15 livs with aunt

2026-01-28T17:27:33.403273 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask a clarifying question to better understand your situation:

**Are you responsible for the child (your grandson), or does your grandson live with his aunt who is responsible for him?**

In other words, who is the main person looking after your 15-year-old grandson on a day-to-day basis - is it you or his aunt?

2026-01-28T17:27:35.267440 [actor]: i send money every week for him aunt looks after

2026-01-28T17:27:37.626507 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your grandson lives with and is looked after by his aunt, but you contribute financially by sending money every week.

Let me ask you this: **Does the aunt claim Child Benefit for your grandson?**

This is important because generally, only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, and it's usually the person who the child lives with and who is responsible for them.

2026-01-28T17:27:39.229503 [actor]: aunt doesnt claim i send 15 pound week

2026-01-28T17:27:42.235930 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is helpful to know.

Let me ask you: **Does your grandson's aunt have any income or reason why she doesn't claim Child Benefit herself?**

I'm asking because Child Benefit is normally paid to the person the child lives with and who is responsible for them on a day-to-day basis. Since your grandson lives with his aunt and she looks after him, she would typically be the eligible person to claim - even if you're contributing money towards his care.

2026-01-28T17:27:44.145545 [actor]: no aunt has no income just want to know if i can get it i contribute

2026-01-28T17:27:46.602569 [root_agent]: I understand you contribute £15 a week towards your grandson's care and want to know if you can claim Child Benefit.

Let me ask an important question: **Do you have any involvement in making decisions about your grandson's upbringing, such as decisions about his education, healthcare, or day-to-day welfare? Or does his aunt make all these decisions?**

This helps me understand the level of responsibility you have for him, which is a key factor in Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-28T17:27:48.291070 [actor]: aunt makes decisions i just send the money to help

2026-01-28T17:27:52.430869 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Based on what you've told me, I need to give you some important information:

**Unfortunately, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your grandson in this situation.**

Here's why: Child Benefit is paid to the person who is responsible for the child and who the child lives with. Since your grandson lives with his aunt and she is the one making decisions about his upbringing and day-to-day care, she would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit - not you.

The fact that you contribute money towards his care is very generous, but financial contribution alone doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit if you're not the main carer and the child doesn't live with you.

**However, it's worth noting that your aunt should consider claiming Child Benefit herself**, especially since she has no income. Child Benefit could provide her with important financial support for looking after your grandson.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T17:27:54.142683 [actor]: but i pay more than child benfit amount doesnt that count

2026-01-28T17:28:00.240009 [root_agent]: I understand your question - you're paying more than the Child Benefit amount and wondering if that makes a difference.

**Unfortunately, no - the amount you pay doesn't change the eligibility rules.** Child Benefit isn't based on who pays the most money towards a child's care. 

The key criteria for Child Benefit eligibility are:

1. **The child lives with you**, and
2. **You are responsible for the child** - meaning you make decisions about their day-to-day care, upbringing, education, and welfare

Since your grandson lives with his aunt and she makes all the decisions about his care and upbringing, she is the one who meets the eligibility criteria - regardless of the financial contributions you make.

Your financial support is valuable and important, but Child Benefit is specifically designed for the main carer who the child lives with, not for someone who provides financial support from elsewhere.

**Again, I'd encourage your aunt to claim Child Benefit if she isn't already**, as she appears to be eligible and it would help support her in caring for your grandson.

Is there anything else I can help clarify about this?

2026-01-28T17:28:02.381305 [actor]: but theres other family sending money too we pay more together than the benfit

2026-01-28T17:28:07.290798 [root_agent]: I understand what you're saying - that collectively, you and other family members are contributing more money than the Child Benefit amount.

However, **this still doesn't change the eligibility rules, I'm afraid.** Even if multiple family members are sending money and the total exceeds the Child Benefit amount, the eligibility criteria remain the same:

Child Benefit can only be claimed by **one person** - the person who:
- The child lives with, AND
- Is responsible for the child's day-to-day care and upbringing

It doesn't matter how much money is being sent by family members or how many people are contributing. What matters is who the child actually lives with and who looks after them.

In your case, that person is your grandson's aunt. She is the eligible person to claim Child Benefit because:
- Your grandson lives with her
- She makes the decisions about his care
- She looks after him day-to-day

Your financial contributions (and those of other family members) are separate from Child Benefit eligibility.

**The aunt really should claim Child Benefit for your grandson** - it would provide her with regular support and wouldn't affect the money you and others choose to send.

Does this make sense, or is there anything else you'd like me to explain?

2026-01-28T17:28:08.782050 [actor]: ok so im not eligble then

2026-01-28T17:28:12.569352 [root_agent]: **That's correct - based on what you've told me, you are not eligible to claim Child Benefit for your grandson** because he doesn't live with you and you're not responsible for his day-to-day care.

However, **your grandson's aunt would be eligible** since he lives with her and she's responsible for him. I'd strongly encourage her to apply for Child Benefit, especially as she has no income. This would provide her with regular financial support to help with the costs of raising your grandson.

I appreciate you taking the time to go through these questions with me. Your willingness to support your grandson financially is commendable, even though it doesn't qualify you for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or any other matter I can help you with?

2026-01-28T17:28:18.074572 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user (grandparent sending money) is not eligible for Child Benefit because the child lives with the aunt who is the main carer, and correctly explained that eligibility depends on who the child lives with and who has day-to-day responsibility, not on financial contributions.
