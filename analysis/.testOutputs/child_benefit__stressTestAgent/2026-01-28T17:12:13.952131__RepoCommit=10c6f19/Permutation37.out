2026-01-28T17:33:32.539230 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T17:33:34.236441 [actor]: child benefit 10 year old living with me not mine mothers friend sick

2026-01-28T17:33:37.329293 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me make sure I understand your situation correctly.

You mentioned a 10-year-old child who is living with you, but who is not your own child - they are your mother's friend's child, and the mother is sick.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for this child? In other words, are you the person who is mainly looking after them and meeting the costs of raising them (such as food, clothing, and other day-to-day expenses)?

2026-01-28T17:33:39.081159 [actor]: yes looking after nina costs food clothes everything mothers sick

2026-01-28T17:33:41.393719 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you are responsible for Nina, covering all her costs including food, clothes, and everything else while her mother is sick.

My next question is: Does Nina normally live with you? By this, I mean is your home her main residence where she usually stays?

2026-01-28T17:33:43.083276 [actor]: yes nina lives here now mother ill cant look after

2026-01-28T17:33:45.501830 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Nina lives with you now as her main home because her mother is ill and can't look after her.

Next question: Is Nina's mother still receiving Child Benefit for Nina, or has the Child Benefit stopped or been transferred?

2026-01-28T17:33:47.109660 [actor]: dont know about mothers benefit just need help with costs

2026-01-28T17:33:49.107836 [root_agent]: I understand - you're focused on getting help with the costs of looking after Nina, which makes sense.

Let me ask you this: Are you a UK resident? In other words, do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-28T17:33:51.166804 [actor]: yes live in uk always

2026-01-28T17:33:53.936462 [root_agent]: Thank you. And one more important question: Do you have the right to live and work in the UK? This could be because you're a British citizen, have settled status, or have another immigration status that allows you to access public funds?

2026-01-28T17:33:55.434854 [actor]: yes british citizen born here

2026-01-28T17:34:00.350882 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your situation.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Nina. Here's why:

✓ Nina is 10 years old (under 16)
✓ Nina lives with you as her main home
✓ You are responsible for Nina - you're looking after her and paying for all her costs (food, clothes, everything)
✓ You're a UK resident and British citizen

The key point is that you don't have to be the child's parent to claim Child Benefit - you just need to be responsible for the child and they need to be living with you, which is your situation.

**Important note about Nina's mother:** If Nina's mother is still receiving Child Benefit for Nina, only one person can claim it at a time. You would need to make a claim, and if the mother is already receiving it, HMRC will contact her to stop her claim before starting yours.

Would you like to know how to make a claim for Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T17:34:06.513352 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit because they are responsible for a child under 16 who lives with them, and they are a UK resident with the right to claim benefits, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible." The agent also correctly noted that you don't need to be the child's parent to claim Child Benefit, which is accurate according to gov.uk guidance.
