2026-01-28T17:25:56.447083 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T17:25:58.165591 [actor]: child benefitt son 14 yrs old residental school council pays

2026-01-28T17:26:01.126120 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old son who is at a residential school that the council pays for.

This is an important situation that affects eligibility. Let me ask you:

**Does your son live with you for part of the time, or does he live at the residential school full-time?** For example, does he come home during school holidays or on weekends?

2026-01-28T17:26:02.934036 [actor]: been there 10 weeks council pays behavioral needs

2026-01-28T17:26:05.013423 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son has been at the council-funded residential school for 10 weeks due to behavioral needs.

Let me ask you an important question to understand your situation better:

**Before your son went to the residential school 10 weeks ago, were you receiving Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T17:26:06.818526 [actor]: yes was getting it before he went

2026-01-28T17:26:09.066162 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you were receiving Child Benefit before your son went to the residential school 10 weeks ago.

This is helpful to know. Now let me ask:

**Are you responsible for your son, meaning do you still make decisions about his care and welfare, and does he come home to you during school holidays or weekends?**

2026-01-28T17:26:10.720109 [actor]: yes im responible make decisons for him still his mum

2026-01-28T17:26:13.062344 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. As his mum, you're still responsible for him and make decisions about his care and welfare.

Now, this is important for your eligibility:

**Does your son come home to stay with you during school holidays, half-terms, or weekends? Or does he stay at the residential school for the entire time without coming home?**

2026-01-28T17:26:14.693923 [actor]: he stays there dont come home

2026-01-28T17:26:17.214250 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. So your son stays at the residential school full-time and doesn't come home, even during holidays or weekends.

Let me ask one more clarifying question:

**Is this a permanent arrangement, or is there a plan for him to come home at some point in the future? For example, is this expected to be a long-term placement, or is it temporary while he receives support?**

2026-01-28T17:26:18.955849 [actor]: temporary for support behavioral issues

2026-01-28T17:26:21.270929 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that this is a temporary placement to support him with his behavioral issues.

Let me ask you:

**How long is the temporary placement expected to last? Do you know if it's likely to be for less than a year, or could it be longer?**

2026-01-28T17:26:22.884887 [actor]: dont know how long maybe few months maybe longer

2026-01-28T17:26:24.792691 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand the uncertainty about how long the placement will last.

Let me ask you one final important question:

**Do you contribute financially toward the cost of your son's care at the residential school, or does the council pay for everything?**

2026-01-28T17:26:26.356623 [actor]: council pays evrything no contribution from me

2026-01-28T17:26:32.861244 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility for Child Benefit.

**Your situation:**
- Your son is 14 years old (under 16)
- You are his mother and remain responsible for him
- He's in a council-funded residential school for temporary behavioral support (been there 10 weeks)
- He stays there full-time and doesn't come home
- The council pays for everything
- You were receiving Child Benefit before he went into care

**My assessment:**

You may **not be eligible** to continue receiving Child Benefit while your son is living full-time at the residential school, because:

- When a child is "looked after" by a local authority (which includes being in council-funded residential care), the person caring for them day-to-day is usually entitled to claim Child Benefit
- Since your son doesn't come home at all and the council is funding his full-time care, the local authority or the residential school may be entitled to claim instead
- This applies even when the arrangement is temporary

**What you should do:**

You need to inform the Child Benefit Office about your son's current living situation. They will determine whether you should continue receiving Child Benefit or whether payments should stop while he's in residential care.

Would you like to know how to contact the Child Benefit Office about this?

2026-01-28T17:26:34.948892 [actor]: ok so not eligble then thank you

2026-01-28T17:26:38.880197 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, when a child is in local authority care or residential school, the parent can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks if they remain responsible for the child and the arrangement is temporary. Since the child has been there for 10 weeks, the parent should still be eligible until week 12.
