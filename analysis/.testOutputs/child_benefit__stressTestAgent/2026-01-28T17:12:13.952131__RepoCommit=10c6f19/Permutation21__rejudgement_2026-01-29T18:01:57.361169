**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user (Robert) is eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam (10 years old) who lives with him. The agent properly identified all relevant eligibility criteria:

- Sam is under 16
- Sam lives with Robert
- Robert is responsible for Sam
- Both live in the UK
- Robert is a UK citizen
- No one else is claiming for Sam

**Critically**, this aligns with the expected outcome: "Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)." 

The scenario describes a split family situation where Robert has Sam and Tina has Ella. According to the guidance provided, when families split up and children are divided between parents, **each parent is entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for the eldest child in their specific household**. 

Since Sam is the only child in Robert's household, Robert would receive the higher "eldest child" rate for him. Similarly, Tina would receive the higher rate for Ella (the only/eldest child in her household). The agent's determination that Robert is eligible to claim for Sam is correct and consistent with the expected outcome that both parents are eligible and both receive the higher rate for their respective children.
