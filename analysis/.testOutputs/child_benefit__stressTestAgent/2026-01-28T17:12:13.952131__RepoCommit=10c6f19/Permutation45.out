2026-01-28T17:38:31.856055 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:38:33.796903 [actor]: dauter in hosptal 14 weeks do i get mony

2026-01-28T17:38:36.248954 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a daughter who has been in hospital for 14 weeks.

To help assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, let me ask:

**Is your daughter under 16 years old (or under 20 if she's in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T17:38:37.785881 [actor]: shes 8 years old

2026-01-28T17:38:40.261925 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your daughter is 8 years old and has been in hospital for 14 weeks.

Let me ask you this:

**Are you responsible for your daughter - meaning, was she living with you before she went into hospital, and will she be returning to live with you when she leaves hospital?**

2026-01-28T17:38:41.866290 [actor]: yes she lives with me i visit every day for hours

2026-01-28T17:38:43.863872 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. It's clear you're very dedicated to your daughter.

Now, to help determine your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is your daughter's hospital stay being paid for by the NHS, or is it being paid for privately?**

2026-01-28T17:38:45.346873 [actor]: nhs hospital they give evrything

2026-01-28T17:38:47.905619 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Your daughter is in an NHS hospital where they're providing her care.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your daughter, or would this be a new claim?**

2026-01-28T17:38:49.955009 [actor]: i get it now but will it stop

2026-01-28T17:38:52.146180 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification - you're currently receiving Child Benefit and are concerned it might stop while your daughter is in hospital.

Let me ask you this important question:

**Has your daughter been in hospital continuously, or has she come home for any periods during these 14 weeks?**

2026-01-28T17:38:53.725837 [actor]: continous 14 weeks no breaks

2026-01-28T17:38:56.076327 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your daughter has been in hospital continuously for 14 weeks with no breaks.

Now I need to ask:

**Has anyone from the hospital or any authority told you that they are now responsible for your daughter's care, or do you still have full parental responsibility for her?**

2026-01-28T17:38:57.403990 [actor]: i still responsible parent

2026-01-28T17:39:00.015919 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. You remain the responsible parent.

Let me ask one more important question to assess your situation:

**Are you currently getting any letters or communication from the Child Benefit Office about your daughter's hospital stay, or have you informed them that she's been in hospital?**

2026-01-28T17:39:01.409792 [actor]: no letters should i tell them

2026-01-28T17:39:05.933559 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, let me explain your situation:

**You should continue to receive Child Benefit** for your daughter while she's in hospital, but there are important time limits you need to be aware of.

According to the rules, if a child is in hospital and their treatment is paid for by the NHS:
- You can continue to get Child Benefit for up to **12 weeks** (84 days) without any issues
- After 12 weeks, Child Benefit normally stops **unless** the child comes home regularly (at least one day or night every week)

Since your daughter has now been in hospital continuously for 14 weeks with no breaks, **your Child Benefit may have already stopped or will stop soon**.

Let me ask you this:

**Moving forward, is there any possibility that your daughter could come home for visits - even for just one day or night per week - while she continues her treatment?**

2026-01-28T17:39:07.365316 [actor]: but i visit every day spending hours with her doesnt that count

2026-01-28T17:39:12.448751 [root_agent]: I understand your concern, and it's clear you're a devoted parent visiting your daughter every day for hours. However, I need to clarify an important point:

**Unfortunately, you visiting your daughter in hospital doesn't count for Child Benefit purposes.** 

The rule specifically requires that **the child comes home** - meaning your daughter would need to leave the hospital and return to your home for at least one day or night per week.

Your visits to her in the hospital, while absolutely important for her wellbeing and show you're the responsible parent, don't meet the requirement to continue Child Benefit beyond 12 weeks.

Let me ask:

**Is your daughter medically able to come home for short visits - even just for a few hours or overnight - or is her condition such that the hospital requires her to stay there continuously?**

2026-01-28T17:39:14.127826 [actor]: she cant leave hospital needs to stay

2026-01-28T17:39:18.032662 [root_agent]: I understand - your daughter needs to stay in hospital continuously for medical reasons and cannot leave.

Based on all the information you've provided, here's your situation:

**Your Child Benefit will stop (or may have already stopped) because:**
- Your daughter has been in NHS hospital care continuously for more than 12 weeks (84 days)
- She cannot come home, even for short visits
- The 12-week limit has been exceeded

**You should inform the Child Benefit Office about your daughter's hospital stay as soon as possible.** If you haven't already told them and you've continued receiving payments beyond the 12-week period, you may have been overpaid and might need to pay money back.

Let me ask:

**Do you have any other children living with you who you might be eligible to claim Child Benefit for?**

2026-01-28T17:39:19.937962 [actor]: no just her so i wont get anything now

2026-01-28T17:39:25.735665 [root_agent]: I understand this is difficult news, especially when you're already dealing with your daughter being in hospital.

Based on what you've told me - your 8-year-old daughter is your only child, she's been in NHS hospital continuously for 14 weeks and cannot leave - **you will not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit** beyond the 12-week period.

**What you need to do:**

1. **Contact the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible** to inform them of your daughter's hospital stay - call 0300 200 3100
2. They will stop your payments from the correct date
3. If you've received payments beyond 12 weeks, they may ask you to repay the overpayment

**Important:** When your daughter is discharged from hospital and comes home to live with you again, **your Child Benefit can restart**. You'll need to contact them again at that point.

I'm sorry you won't receive this support during such a challenging time. 

**Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?**

2026-01-28T17:39:27.942166 [actor]: ok so not eligble got it thanks

2026-01-28T17:39:31.610307 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks of continuous NHS hospital care when the child cannot come home for regular visits, and correctly concluded the user is not eligible to continue receiving the benefit beyond that period.
