**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and gov.uk guidance, the user should be **eligible for up to 20 weeks**.

The critical error is that the agent failed to recognize the "extension period" provision. According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, when a 16 or 17-year-old leaves approved education or training, there is an extension period of up to 20 weeks during which Child Benefit can continue if the young person is registered with certain careers services (such as a youth careers service) and is looking for work or training.

In this case:
- Ben is 17 years old
- He left school in June
- It is currently August (within the 20-week extension period)
- He is registered with a youth careers service
- He is actively looking for an apprenticeship

All these factors mean the parent (Gary) **should be eligible** for Child Benefit during this extension period.

The agent's statement that "Simply being registered with a careers service and looking for an apprenticeship does not count as being 'in approved education or training'" is incorrect in this context, as it fails to account for the extension period provisions specifically designed for this exact situation.
