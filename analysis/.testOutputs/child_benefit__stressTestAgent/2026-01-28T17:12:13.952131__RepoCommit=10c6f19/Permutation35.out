2026-01-28T17:32:18.081825 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:32:19.750904 [actor]: child benefit son 17 marriied still in shcool

2026-01-28T17:32:21.750436 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old son who is still in school and you're married.

Let me ask you the next question: **Are you or your partner responsible for the child?** In other words, does your son live with you or are you the main person looking after him?

2026-01-28T17:32:23.318268 [actor]: yes son lives with us he married his girlfreind she moved in our house

2026-01-28T17:32:27.562282 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your 17-year-old son lives with you along with his wife (your son's girlfriend whom he married).

This is an important detail. Let me ask: **Is your son still in approved education or training?** Specifically, I need to know:

- Is he in full-time non-advanced education (such as school-level courses, including A-levels or Scottish Highers)?
- Or is he doing approved training like certain vocational courses?

2026-01-28T17:32:28.959401 [actor]: a levels full time

2026-01-28T17:32:31.868763 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your son is doing A-levels full-time, which is non-advanced education.

Now, this is a crucial question for eligibility: **Is your son under 20 years old?**

(I can see he's 17, so yes, but I need to confirm he hasn't turned 20 yet to ensure he qualifies as a "qualifying young person" under Child Benefit rules.)

2026-01-28T17:32:33.387126 [actor]: hes 17 not 20 yet

2026-01-28T17:32:35.172787 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to understand your residency status: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:32:36.704864 [actor]: yes uk resident

2026-01-28T17:32:39.207543 [root_agent]: Thank you. And one more question about residency: **Are you a UK national, or if not, do you have the right to reside in the UK?** 

For example, this could include having settled status, pre-settled status, refugee status, or certain other immigration statuses that give you the right to claim benefits.

2026-01-28T17:32:40.529236 [actor]: uk national born here

2026-01-28T17:32:43.022342 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for that information.

Now, one final important question: **Has your son's wife (who lives with you) claimed Child Benefit for him, or is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for your son?**

This is important because only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child.

2026-01-28T17:32:44.725640 [actor]: no nobody else claiming just me want to keep claiming

2026-01-28T17:32:49.329649 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news: You should still be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your son.**

Here's why:

✓ Your son is 17 years old (under 20)
✓ He's in full-time non-advanced education (A-levels)
✓ He lives with you
✓ You're responsible for him
✓ You're a UK national living in the UK
✓ Nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for him

**Important point about his marriage:** The fact that your son is married does not automatically disqualify you from receiving Child Benefit for him. As long as he meets the criteria as a qualifying young person (which he does - he's under 20 and in approved full-time education), you can continue to claim.

You can continue claiming Child Benefit for him until:
- He turns 20, OR
- He leaves full-time approved education or training (whichever comes first)

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-28T17:32:52.347863 [actor]: ok thank yu

2026-01-28T17:32:55.055414 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit despite the son being married, correctly applying the rules that a qualifying young person under 20 in full-time non-advanced education can still qualify regardless of marital status, which represents an exception to typical assumptions about married children.
