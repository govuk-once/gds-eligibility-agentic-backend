**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of "Eligible."

The agent's assessment was thorough and accurate:

1. **Correctly identified key eligibility factors:**
   - Nina (10 years old) meets the age requirement (under 16)
   - Nina lives with the user as her main residence
   - The user is responsible for Nina and covering all her costs
   - The user is a UK resident and British citizen

2. **Correctly applied the responsibility test:** The agent accurately recognized that you don't need to be the child's parent to claim Child Benefit - the key requirement is being responsible for the child who lives with you. This aligns with gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility.

3. **Appropriately addressed the private fostering scenario:** This is a private arrangement where the user (Carol) is caring for her mother's friend's child (Nina) due to the mother's illness. The council is not paying for accommodation or providing a fostering allowance. According to the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, private fosterers who are financially supporting a child can claim Child Benefit.

4. **Provided helpful additional information:** The agent correctly noted that only one person can claim Child Benefit at a time and explained the process if the mother is currently claiming.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**, making this a correct assessment.
