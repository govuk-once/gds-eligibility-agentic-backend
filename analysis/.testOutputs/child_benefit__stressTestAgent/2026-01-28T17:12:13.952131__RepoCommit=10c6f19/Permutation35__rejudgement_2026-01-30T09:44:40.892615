**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible (via Exception)."

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of the exception**: The agent accurately recognized that while marriage typically raises questions about Child Benefit eligibility, the son still qualifies as a "qualifying young person" because he is:
   - Under 20 years old (17)
   - In full-time non-advanced education (A-levels)
   - Living with the claimant parent

2. **Accurate application of rules**: According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 20 who are in approved education or training, even if they are married, as long as they meet the qualifying criteria. The agent correctly applied this exception.

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "You should still be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your son" and explained that "The fact that your son is married does not automatically disqualify you from receiving Child Benefit for him."

4. **Comprehensive assessment**: The agent gathered all necessary information (age, education status, living arrangements, residency, and whether anyone else is claiming) and correctly concluded eligibility.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome: the parent is eligible via the exception that allows claims for married children who are still qualifying young persons in approved education.
