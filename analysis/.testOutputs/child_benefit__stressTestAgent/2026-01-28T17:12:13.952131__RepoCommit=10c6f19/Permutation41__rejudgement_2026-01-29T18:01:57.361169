**Justification:**

The agent failed to communicate the correct eligibility outcome for this scenario. Here's why:

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible for Ben (Full Rate), Not Eligible for Jerry (by explicitly allocating contributions).

**What Actually Happened:** The agent concluded the user was not eligible for either child simply because the ex-partner was already claiming.

**Critical Errors:**

1. **Missed the Contribution Threshold Analysis:** The agent never calculated whether Martin's £40/week contribution met the Child Benefit thresholds (£26.05 for the eldest, £17.25 for the younger child).

2. **Failed to Explore Unequal Allocation:** The scenario specifically states that Martin can request HMRC consider **unequal splitting** of his contribution. If Martin allocates £26.05 to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry, he would qualify for Ben at full rate (meeting the £26.05 threshold) but not for Jerry (£13.95 < £17.25).

3. **Oversimplified the Rules:** The agent applied only the basic rule that "one person can claim per child" without exploring the exception for non-resident parents who contribute at least the Child Benefit rate.

The agent should have:
- Calculated the Child Benefit rates
- Assessed Martin's contribution against these rates
- Explained the option to request unequal allocation
- Concluded he's eligible for Ben but not Jerry

The actual outcome communicated (not eligible for either child) directly contradicts the expected outcome (eligible for Ben, not eligible for Jerry).
