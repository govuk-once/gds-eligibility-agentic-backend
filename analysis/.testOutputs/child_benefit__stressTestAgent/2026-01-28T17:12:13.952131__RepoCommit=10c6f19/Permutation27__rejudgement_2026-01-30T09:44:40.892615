**Justification:**

The agent determined the user was eligible for Child Benefit, which is technically correct - Chloe (age 15) can claim Child Benefit for her baby Mia. However, the agent **failed to communicate crucial information** about the financial implications of this decision.

According to the scenario details and the GOV.UK guidance:
- A person under 16 CAN claim Child Benefit for their own child
- BUT "You'll usually get more if [someone responsible for you] claims... on your behalf"
- If Chloe claims for Mia, her parents will likely lose the Child Benefit they currently receive for Chloe herself

The expected outcome is "**Eligible (Though potentially financially suboptimal)**" - meaning the agent should have:
1. Confirmed eligibility (which they did)
2. **Warned about the financial trade-off** (which they did NOT do)

The agent never asked about Chloe's age, never discovered she was 15, and never explained that while she CAN claim, it might result in her family losing money overall because her parents would lose their Child Benefit for her.

While the eligibility determination is technically correct, the agent failed to communicate the complete picture of the outcome, particularly the "potentially financially suboptimal" aspect that is central to this scenario. This is a significant omission that could lead to a financially disadvantageous decision for the family.
