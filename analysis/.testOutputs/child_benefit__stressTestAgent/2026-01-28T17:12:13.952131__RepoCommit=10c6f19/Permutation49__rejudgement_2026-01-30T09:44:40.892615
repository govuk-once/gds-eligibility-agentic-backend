**Justification:**

The agent determined the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, but the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

According to the GOV.UK guidance on approved education (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), courses done "with an employer's agreement - for example, to get a job" are specifically **excluded** from approved education.

In this scenario, the key facts are:
- Tom (17) is doing a coding course
- His future employer is paying for the course fees
- There is an agreement that he will join the employer afterwards
- He is not currently being paid

This arrangement clearly falls under "doing a course with an employer's agreement...to get a job," which means it does **not** qualify as approved education for Child Benefit purposes.

The agent failed to identify this critical exclusion and incorrectly approved eligibility. While the agent asked relevant questions about the course being full-time and whether it was employment vs. education, they did not probe into whether this was an employer-sponsored arrangement leading to employment, which would disqualify it from being "approved education."

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, noting that "employer-sponsored training that leads directly to employment" doesn't qualify for the education/training exception.

**Outcome communicated by agent:** Eligible  
**Expected outcome:** Not Eligible  
**Agreement:** NO 👎
