2026-01-28T17:22:54.742304 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T17:22:56.254179 [actor]: child benefit holly 9 years daughter pete seperated sue

2026-01-28T17:22:58.659059 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 9-year-old daughter named Holly, and you're separated from Pete (I assume Pete is Holly's other parent), and there's mention of someone named Sue.

Let me ask you this important question:

**Does Holly live with you, or does she live with someone else (such as Pete or Sue)?**

2026-01-28T17:23:00.171232 [actor]: holly stays with me 3 days week stays with sue 4 days

2026-01-28T17:23:02.347061 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So Holly stays with you 3 days a week and with Sue 4 days a week.

This is an important detail for Child Benefit eligibility. Let me ask you:

**Who is Sue in relation to Holly? Is Sue Holly's other parent, or someone else like a grandparent or another relative?**

2026-01-28T17:23:03.845584 [actor]: sue is hollys mother im pete

2026-01-28T17:23:06.180166 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Pete. So to confirm: you're Holly's father, Sue is Holly's mother, and Holly stays with you 3 days a week and with Sue 4 days a week.

This is helpful information. Now let me ask:

**Is either you or Sue currently claiming Child Benefit for Holly?**

2026-01-28T17:23:07.851023 [actor]: both claimed we cant agree who shud get it

2026-01-28T17:23:09.891836 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Pete. I understand that both you and Sue have claimed Child Benefit and you can't agree on who should receive it.

Let me ask you this:

**Do you and Sue contribute equally to Holly's costs (such as food, clothing, and other expenses), or does one of you contribute more than the other?**

2026-01-28T17:23:11.361277 [actor]: both buy cloths and food for holly

2026-01-28T17:23:14.621923 [root_agent]: Thank you, Pete. So you both buy clothes and food for Holly during the time she stays with each of you.

Let me ask another important question:

**Does Holly receive Child Benefit from her school - meaning, is she a full-time student at a non-advanced course at an approved educational establishment where Child Benefit is paid directly by the school?**

(This is just to confirm she's not in one of these specific educational situations - most 9-year-olds wouldn't be, but I need to check all eligibility factors.)

2026-01-28T17:23:16.157797 [actor]: no shes 9 normal school

2026-01-28T17:23:22.971786 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Pete. 

Based on the information you've provided, let me now assess your situation:

**Your Eligibility Status:**

You are **potentially eligible** for Child Benefit for Holly. However, there's an important issue to resolve:

**The Key Issue:** Only ONE person can receive Child Benefit for Holly at any given time, even though she splits her time between you and Sue. When parents can't agree on who should claim, HMRC has specific rules to determine who gets priority.

**What happens when both parents claim:**

According to the rules, when a child lives with more than one person and you can't agree, HMRC will usually pay Child Benefit to:
- The person the child lives with for the most time, OR
- If the time is fairly equal (as in your case - 3 days vs 4 days), the person who is the **main carer** - meaning who contributes more to the child's care and upbringing

Since Holly stays with Sue for 4 days and with you for 3 days per week, **Sue would likely have priority for the Child Benefit claim**, as Holly spends slightly more time with her.

**What you should do:**
You and Sue need to decide between yourselves who will claim, or HMRC will make the decision based on who is the main carer. Would you like guidance on what to do next?

2026-01-28T17:23:24.509199 [actor]: ok so sue gets it then not me

2026-01-28T17:23:28.528346 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct, Pete. Based on the information you've provided:

Since Holly stays with Sue for 4 days a week compared to 3 days with you, **Sue would be the one eligible to receive the Child Benefit payment**, not you.

Only one person can claim Child Benefit for Holly, and when parents share care but can't agree, HMRC gives priority to the person the child lives with for the most time - which in this case is Sue.

**Important to know:**
- Even though Sue receives the Child Benefit payment, this doesn't affect your parental responsibilities or your role as Holly's father
- The payment is meant to help with the costs of raising Holly
- You can still discuss with Sue how you both contribute to Holly's expenses

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-28T17:23:30.296916 [actor]: no thats all thanks

2026-01-28T17:23:34.602122 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that Sue, not Pete, is eligible for Child Benefit because Holly spends 4 days per week with Sue compared to 3 days with Pete, and correctly explained that only one person can claim Child Benefit when care is shared, with priority given to the person the child lives with most.
