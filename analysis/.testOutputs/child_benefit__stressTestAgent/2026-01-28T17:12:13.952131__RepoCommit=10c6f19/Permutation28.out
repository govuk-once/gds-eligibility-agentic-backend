2026-01-28T17:28:50.762383 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:28:52.266489 [actor]: child benfit eligble tourist visa us citizen

2026-01-28T17:28:54.647439 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you a specific question to help assess your eligibility:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

This is important because Child Benefit eligibility typically requires you to be living in the UK, even if you're a US citizen.

2026-01-28T17:28:56.274977 [actor]: yes in uk now with 5 year old son 6 month visa

2026-01-28T17:28:57.845948 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask the next important question:

**Is your 5-year-old son living with you in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:28:59.347160 [actor]: yes son living with me here

2026-01-28T17:29:01.775415 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now I need to ask:

**Are you or your son ordinarily resident in the UK, or are you here temporarily on your 6-month tourist visa with plans to return to the US?**

This is important because Child Benefit generally requires that you're habitually resident in the UK, not just visiting temporarily.

2026-01-28T17:29:03.297628 [actor]: visiting 6 months not working

2026-01-28T17:29:05.546646 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I need to ask one more important question:

**Are you or your son receiving any other UK benefits or tax credits while you're visiting?**

This will help me give you a complete answer about your Child Benefit eligibility based on your temporary visitor status.

2026-01-28T17:29:07.092756 [actor]: no benefits not recieving anything

2026-01-28T17:29:12.810895 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, let me explain your eligibility situation:

**Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit in your current circumstances.**

Here's why:

1. **Residence requirement**: Child Benefit requires that you be "responsible for a child" and that either you or your partner are living in the UK. However, the key requirement is that you must be **habitually resident** in the UK or have the **right to reside** in the UK.

2. **Tourist visa status**: As a US citizen on a 6-month tourist visa who is not working and is visiting temporarily, you do not have the right to reside in the UK for benefits purposes. Tourist visas are for temporary visits, not for establishing residence.

3. **No recourse to public funds**: Tourist visas typically come with a "no recourse to public funds" condition, which means you cannot claim benefits like Child Benefit during your stay.

Child Benefit is designed for people who are settled or habitually living in the UK, not for temporary visitors.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-28T17:29:16.039308 [actor]: ok understand not eligble thank you

2026-01-28T17:29:18.834738 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that a US citizen on a 6-month tourist visa is not eligible for Child Benefit due to lacking habitual residence and right to reside in the UK, and correctly noted the "no recourse to public funds" condition that applies to tourist visas.
