2026-01-28T17:35:30.527750 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T17:35:32.185041 [actor]: son in hosptial mental helth act can i get benfit

2026-01-28T17:35:34.335976 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand your son is in hospital under the Mental Health Act, and you're asking about Child Benefit eligibility.

Let me ask you some questions to help determine your eligibility:

**Is your son under 16 years old, or under 20 and in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T17:35:36.166443 [actor]: 15 years old detaned secure unit

2026-01-28T17:35:38.406097 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son is 15 years old and detained in a secure unit.

This is an important situation. Let me ask you the next question:

**How long has your son been in the secure unit - has it been less than 12 weeks, or 12 weeks or more?**

2026-01-28T17:35:39.711369 [actor]: 10 weeks in unit

2026-01-28T17:35:41.696101 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your son is 15 years old and has been in the secure unit for 10 weeks (which is less than 12 weeks).

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you the person who is responsible for your son - meaning, were you looking after him before he went into the secure unit?**

2026-01-28T17:35:43.227750 [actor]: yes i look after him before unit

2026-01-28T17:35:45.007218 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. You were looking after your son before he went into the unit.

Now, let me ask you:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your son, or would this be a new claim?**

2026-01-28T17:35:46.752523 [actor]: already getting child benfit worried will stop

2026-01-28T17:35:49.287900 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. You're already receiving Child Benefit and are worried it might stop while your son is in the secure unit.

Let me ask you one more important question:

**Do you contribute towards the cost of looking after your son while he's in the secure unit - for example, do you pay at least the same amount as the weekly Child Benefit rate towards his accommodation or maintenance?**

2026-01-28T17:35:50.726248 [actor]: no dont pay anything for the unit

2026-01-28T17:35:55.799994 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering my questions. Based on the information you've provided, I can now give you guidance on your Child Benefit eligibility.

**Good news: You should still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for your son.**

Here's why:

- Your son is 15 years old (under 16)
- You were responsible for him before he went into the secure unit
- He has been in the secure unit for 10 weeks, which is **less than 12 weeks**

According to the rules, if your child is in hospital or care (including secure units), you can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **12 weeks** (or 84 days) even if you're not contributing to the costs.

**Important:** After 12 weeks, your Child Benefit would normally stop unless you're contributing at least the weekly Child Benefit amount towards your son's accommodation or maintenance costs.

Since your son has been there for 10 weeks, you have about 2 more weeks before you'd need to either:
- Start contributing financially, or
- Your Child Benefit may stop

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?

2026-01-28T17:35:57.712690 [actor]: ok so i keep getting it thank you

2026-01-28T17:36:01.705185 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit continues for up to 12 weeks when a child is detained in a secure unit without parental contribution, and correctly identified that at 10 weeks the claimant remains eligible (with approximately 2 weeks remaining in the 12-week period).
