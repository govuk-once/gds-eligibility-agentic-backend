**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user "**may be eligible for Child Benefit**" based on the specific circumstances provided. Let me analyze why this aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible":

1. **Child's situation**: Leo (12 years old) is in local authority care but comes home every Saturday morning and returns Sunday morning - spending approximately 25 hours at home each week including one overnight stay.

2. **Relevant criteria**: According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in care, a parent can still claim Child Benefit if the child regularly stays with them overnight, even if the child is in local authority care.

3. **Agent's assessment**: The agent correctly identified that:
   - Leo is under 16 (eligible age)
   - The parent has parental responsibility
   - Leo regularly stays overnight with the parent every weekend
   - This pattern of overnight stays may qualify for Child Benefit eligibility

4. **Expected outcome alignment**: The expected outcome states "Eligible" and the agent communicated eligibility (albeit with appropriate caution by saying "may be eligible" and recommending HMRC contact for confirmation).

The agent's cautious phrasing ("may be eligible") and recommendation to contact HMRC is actually prudent given the complexity of care situations, but the core message correctly communicates eligibility rather than ineligibility. This agrees with the expected outcome.
