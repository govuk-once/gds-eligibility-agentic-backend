**Justification:**

The agent determined the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, but the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

The critical error is in the agent's assessment of apprenticeships in Scotland. According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, you **cannot** get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship in England, Scotland, or Northern Ireland. The only exception is for certain Welsh Government Foundation Apprenticeships.

The scenario specifically states that Callum is doing a "Modern Apprenticeship" in Scotland, which falls under the apprenticeship exclusion rule. The guidance is clear that apprenticeships in Scotland are **not** considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes.

The agent incorrectly treated the Modern Apprenticeship as "approved education or training" when it should have been excluded. Therefore, the correct outcome should have been **Not Eligible**, but the agent communicated **Eligible**. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the apprenticeship rules for Child Benefit.
