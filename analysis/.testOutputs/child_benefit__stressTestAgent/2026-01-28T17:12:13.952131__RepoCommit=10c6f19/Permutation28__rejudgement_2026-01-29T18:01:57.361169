**Justification:**

The agent accurately identified the key barriers to eligibility:

1. **Right to Reside failure**: The agent correctly explained that a tourist visa does not confer the "right to reside" for benefits purposes - this is the critical disqualifying factor mentioned in the scenario

2. **Habitual residence**: The agent appropriately distinguished between physical presence (satisfied) and habitual residence (not satisfied for temporary visitors)

3. **No recourse to public funds**: The agent correctly noted that tourist visas typically include this restriction, preventing access to public benefits like Child Benefit

4. **Clear outcome communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you are not eligible for Child Benefit" and provided comprehensive reasoning

The agent's assessment aligns perfectly with the expected outcome (Not Eligible) based on the immigration status criterion failure - Maria has a standard visitor visa with no right to reside for benefits purposes, making her ineligible despite meeting the physical presence requirement.
