**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit when the correct outcome should be **not eligible**.

According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, Child Benefit generally stops after a child has been in custody for **8 weeks**. The scenario clearly states that Mark (the 15-year-old son) has been detained for **10 weeks** in a youth custody center, which exceeds the 8-week threshold.

The agent made a critical error by stating: "When a child is in custody in the youth justice system (like a young offender institution), you can continue to receive Child Benefit as long as you're still contributing to their costs." This is incorrect. The key factor is the **duration of detention** (8 weeks), not whether the parent continues to contribute to costs.

Since the child has been in custody for 10 weeks (more than the 8-week limit), the mother Lisa should **not be eligible** to continue receiving Child Benefit, regardless of her ongoing support and contributions.

The agent's eligibility determination does **not** agree with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
