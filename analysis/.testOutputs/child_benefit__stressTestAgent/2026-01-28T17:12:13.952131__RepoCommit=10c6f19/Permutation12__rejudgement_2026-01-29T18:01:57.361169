**Justification:**

The agent communicated that Jessica **is eligible** for Child Benefit for Liam. However, the expected outcome is that she should be **Not Eligible**.

According to the scenario details provided, Liam "has successfully claimed Universal Credit in his own right to help with his personal living costs." The UK government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility clearly states that Child Benefit stops when a child starts receiving certain benefits in their own right, including Universal Credit.

The critical failure in the agent's assessment was that they never asked whether Liam receives any benefits (particularly Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance) in his own right. This is explicitly mentioned in Criteria 2 of the scenario as a disqualifying factor.

While the agent correctly verified:
- Liam's age and education status
- Jessica's responsibility for Liam
- UK residency
- No competing claims

They missed the decisive question about whether Liam receives benefits in his own right, which would have revealed the Universal Credit claim and correctly determined Jessica's ineligibility.

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent (Eligible) does **not** agree with the expected outcome (Not Eligible).
