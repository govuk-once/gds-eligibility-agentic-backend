2026-01-27T22:07:56.015032 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The expected outcome was "Eligible" but the agent incorrectly stated the person was not eligible for Child Benefit. EU citizens with pre-settled status who are registered jobseekers with genuine prospects of work (as Lars is described in the scenario) do have a qualifying right to reside for benefits purposes, including Child Benefit.
