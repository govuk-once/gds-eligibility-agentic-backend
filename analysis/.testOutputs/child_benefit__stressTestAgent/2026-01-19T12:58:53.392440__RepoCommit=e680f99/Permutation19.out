2026-01-19T13:06:56.233754 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

child benefit for holly

2026-01-19T13:06:59.435775 [root_agent]: I understand that you're asking about Child Benefit for someone named Holly. To determine eligibility, I need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, are you responsible for Holly? (This typically means she lives with you or you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit toward looking after her)

2026-01-19T13:07:00.433970 [actor]: Holly stays with me some days need money for clothes food

2026-01-19T13:07:02.092141 [root_agent]: I understand that Holly stays with you some days, and you need money for her clothes and food. To properly assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to gather more specific information.

Is Holly under 16 years old, or under 20 if she's in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:07:03.003724 [actor]: she's nine years old primary school

2026-01-19T13:07:04.565014 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Holly is nine years old and in primary school, she is within the eligible age range for Child Benefit.

Now I need to understand your specific situation better. Is Holly living with someone else for most of the time, or do you have shared care arrangements with another person?

2026-01-19T13:07:05.618028 [actor]: live with sue 4 days me 3 days we both look after her

2026-01-19T13:07:09.226032 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation. I understand that Holly lives with Sue for 4 days a week and with you for 3 days a week, and you both look after her.

In shared care arrangements like yours, typically only one person can receive Child Benefit for Holly. Generally, Child Benefit is paid to the person who Holly lives with for the majority of the time, which in this case appears to be Sue (since Holly stays with her for 4 days compared to 3 days with you).

However, if Sue agrees not to claim Child Benefit for Holly, or if you have other reasons why you should receive it instead, you could potentially make a claim.

Would you know if Sue is currently claiming Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-19T13:07:10.074337 [actor]: we both sent forms to claim child benefit

2026-01-19T13:07:13.427747 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that both you and Sue have submitted forms to claim Child Benefit for Holly.

In this situation, when two people make separate claims for Child Benefit for the same child, the UK government will need to decide who receives it. Since Holly spends more time with Sue (4 days versus your 3 days), she may have a stronger claim.

However, other factors can also be considered, such as:
- Who has the main responsibility for Holly's day-to-day care
- Who pays for major expenses related to Holly
- Any formal or informal agreements between you and Sue

Have you received any response to your claim from HMRC yet, or have you had any discussions with Sue about who should receive the benefit?

2026-01-19T13:07:14.124814 [actor]: no response yet who gets it

2026-01-19T13:07:18.589264 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, I can explain how HMRC will likely determine who receives Child Benefit for Holly:

In cases where two people have submitted claims for the same child, HMRC will make a decision based on several factors:

1. Who the child lives with for the majority of time (in this case, Sue has Holly for 4 days versus your 3 days)
2. Who has the main day-to-day responsibility for the child's care
3. Who covers most of the child's expenses

Since Holly spends more days with Sue, she may have a stronger claim. However, HMRC will consider all relevant circumstances before making their decision.

When HMRC processes both claims, they will likely contact both you and Sue to gather more information before deciding who will receive the benefit. This process can take some time.

If you have any specific arrangements with Sue about Holly's care that you believe should be considered, you should make sure HMRC is aware of these when they contact you.

Would you like information about what you can do while waiting for HMRC's decision?

2026-01-19T13:07:22.860775 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that in shared care situations where the child stays with two people, typically the person who has the child for more days (Sue) has the stronger claim, while also explaining the other factors HMRC considers.
