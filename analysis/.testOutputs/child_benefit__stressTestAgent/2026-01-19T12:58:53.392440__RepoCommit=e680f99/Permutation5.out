2026-01-19T13:00:13.962914 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:00:15.376516 [actor]: I need to find out if I'm eligible for child benefit. My son Lucas is 10 years old but doesn't live with me. I pay money to my ex-wife for him every month.

2026-01-19T13:00:17.001197 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand you're asking about Child Benefit for your 10-year-old son Lucas who lives with your ex-wife, and you provide financial support.

Does your ex-wife currently receive Child Benefit for Lucas, as far as you're aware?

2026-01-19T13:00:18.094882 [actor]: don't think she gets it never mentioned it

2026-01-19T13:00:20.555275 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. In cases where parents are separated, usually only one person can get Child Benefit for a child, and it's typically the person the child lives with.

Since Lucas lives with your ex-wife, she would generally be the one who could claim Child Benefit for him. However, in some circumstances, you might be eligible if you're contributing financially to his upbringing.

Do you have any other children who live with you?

2026-01-19T13:00:21.720937 [actor]: no other kids just pay for lucas food clothes

2026-01-19T13:00:25.104061 [root_agent]: I understand. Based on the information you've provided:

1. Your son Lucas is 10 years old and lives with your ex-wife
2. You provide financial support for Lucas (for food, clothes, etc.)
3. You don't have any other children living with you

Given these circumstances, you would generally not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas. Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with - in this case, your ex-wife. 

Since Lucas doesn't live with you, even though you contribute financially to his upbringing, you wouldn't normally qualify for Child Benefit under UK rules. Your ex-wife would be the one eligible to claim it if she hasn't already done so.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit or suggest any other support you might be eligible for as a non-resident parent?

2026-01-19T13:00:26.128340 [actor]: how much money sending her for lucas

2026-01-19T13:00:29.728729 [root_agent]: Thank you for your question. The amount of money you send to your ex-wife for Lucas doesn't directly impact Child Benefit eligibility. 

Child Benefit is paid to the person who has main responsibility for caring for a child, which is typically the person the child lives with. Since Lucas lives with your ex-wife, she would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit, regardless of the financial support you provide.

If you're providing financial support through a formal child maintenance arrangement or informally, this is separate from the Child Benefit system. Child Benefit is currently £24.00 per week for the eldest or only child, and £15.90 for each additional child.

Is there anything specific about financial support arrangements you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-19T13:00:30.593731 [actor]: send £150 every month for him

2026-01-19T13:00:34.492929 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. The £150 you send monthly for Lucas is what's considered child maintenance or child support - it's separate from the Child Benefit system.

To clarify: The £150 you provide is important financial support for Lucas, but it doesn't affect Child Benefit eligibility. Since Lucas lives with your ex-wife, she would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit (currently £24.00 per week or about £104 per month for an only/eldest child).

Your financial contribution shows you're supporting your child's upbringing, which is commendable, but the Child Benefit would still typically go to the parent with whom the child primarily lives.

Is there anything else about financial support for children after separation that you'd like to know?

2026-01-19T13:00:35.430993 [actor]: can i claim benefit if i pay more than benefit amount

2026-01-19T13:00:38.575147 [root_agent]: I understand your question, but unfortunately, the amount of financial support you provide doesn't change the Child Benefit eligibility rules.

Child Benefit isn't based on who provides more financial support, but rather on who has the main day-to-day responsibility for caring for the child. Since Lucas lives with your ex-wife, she has the primary caring responsibility, so she would be the one eligible for Child Benefit - regardless of whether you pay more than the benefit amount.

Even if you pay £150 per month (which is indeed more than the Child Benefit amount of about £104 per month for an only child), the eligibility still typically goes to the parent the child lives with.

The financial support you provide through maintenance payments is separate from the Child Benefit system, though both are meant to support your child's wellbeing.

2026-01-19T13:00:39.631949 [actor]: if she's not claiming can i claim instead

2026-01-19T13:00:44.147133 [root_agent]: Thank you for asking that question. If your ex-wife is not claiming Child Benefit for Lucas, you may still face challenges claiming it instead because:

According to the UK government rules, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who the child lives with. Since Lucas lives with your ex-wife, she would normally be considered the eligible person, even if she isn't currently claiming it.

In special circumstances, someone who isn't the main carer might be able to claim if they're contributing to the cost of raising the child and no one else is claiming. However, since Lucas doesn't live with you, this would be difficult to establish in your situation.

The most straightforward approach would be to discuss with your ex-wife whether she plans to claim Child Benefit, as she would likely have a more straightforward claim as the resident parent.

Would you like me to provide more information about how Child Benefit claims are prioritized when parents are separated?

2026-01-19T13:00:45.171581 [actor]: she definitely not claiming asked her before 

2026-01-19T13:00:50.023557 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your ex-wife is definitely not claiming Child Benefit for Lucas.

In this specific situation, since she's not claiming and you're financially contributing to Lucas's upbringing, you could potentially apply for Child Benefit. However, I should note that your application might still face challenges because:

1. The primary eligibility criterion is usually having the child live with you
2. You would need to demonstrate that you're paying a reasonable amount toward Lucas's upkeep (which your £150 monthly payment does indicate)

If you decide to apply, be prepared to explain the circumstances clearly - that Lucas lives with his mother but she is not claiming Child Benefit, and that you provide regular financial support for him.

The claim form will ask about your relationship to the child and living arrangements. You should answer honestly about the situation, including that Lucas lives with his mother but you contribute financially to his upbringing.

Would you like information about how to make a Child Benefit claim if you decide to proceed?

2026-01-19T13:00:54.867345 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent initially correctly stated I wouldn't be eligible since the child lives with the ex-wife, but later incorrectly suggested I could potentially claim Child Benefit despite the child not living with me, which contradicts gov.uk guidance that states Child Benefit is only payable to the person the child lives with.
