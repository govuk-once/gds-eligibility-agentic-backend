2026-01-19T13:07:24.348815 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To do this properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T13:07:25.735083 [actor]: I need to play the role of someone asking about Child Benefit eligibility. Let me engage with the agent in character.

looking after granddaughter since parents can't

2026-01-19T13:07:27.379377 [root_agent]: I understand you're looking after your granddaughter since her parents are unable to. Thank you for providing that information.

Could you tell me if you're legally responsible for your granddaughter? This would mean you're the main person looking after her on a day-to-day basis.

2026-01-19T13:07:28.545783 [actor]: grandma taking care of 14 year old lucia no court papers just family arrangement

2026-01-19T13:07:29.923555 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your granddaughter Lucia is 14 years old and you're caring for her under a family arrangement without formal court papers.

Is Lucia living with you full-time in your home?

2026-01-19T13:07:30.791157 [actor]: lives with me full time parents not helping financially

2026-01-19T13:07:32.056080 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Lucia lives with you full-time and her parents are not providing financial support.

Are you a UK resident, or do you have a right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-19T13:07:32.982347 [actor]: yes british 60 years old

2026-01-19T13:07:34.081389 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're British and 60 years old.

Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucia?

2026-01-19T13:07:34.890394 [actor]: nobody else claiming money for her

2026-01-19T13:07:38.644162 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Lucia.

Based on the information you've provided, you may be eligible for Child Benefit for your granddaughter Lucia. Since:

1. You are caring for her full-time
2. You are a UK resident
3. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
4. She is under 16 years old (as she is 14)

Even though you don't have formal court papers, you can still claim Child Benefit if you're the person primarily responsible for Lucia. This is considered an "informal family arrangement."

To make a claim, you would need to complete a Child Benefit claim form (CH2) and send it to the Child Benefit Office. You may need to provide evidence that Lucia lives with you and that you're responsible for her.

Is there anything specific you'd like to know about the application process or the benefit itself?

2026-01-19T13:07:40.960231 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know I can get Child Benefit for Lucia even without court papers. Need form CH2.

2026-01-19T13:07:42.339998 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a grandparent caring for a child under an informal family arrangement, which aligns with gov.uk guidelines.
