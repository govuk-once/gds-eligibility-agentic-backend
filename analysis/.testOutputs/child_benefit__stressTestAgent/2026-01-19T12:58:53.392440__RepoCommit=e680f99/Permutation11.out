2026-01-19T13:03:06.016072 [root_agent]: #thought: I need to assess whether this person is eligible for Child Benefit based on UK government rules. I'll need to ask several questions to determine eligibility, one at a time. According to the links provided:

Key eligibility factors include:
- Whether they are responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if in approved education/training)
- Whether they live in the UK
- Immigration and residency status
- Income considerations (high earners may have to pay a tax charge)
- Whether the child lives with them

Let me start with the most fundamental question.

Do you have a child under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:03:07.344966 [actor]: I'm looking for child benefit information my son Ryan seventeen apprenticeship

2026-01-19T13:03:11.943213 [root_agent]: #thought: This gives me some important information. The person has a son named Ryan who is 17 years old and is on an apprenticeship. This is relevant to eligibility because:

1. The child is over 16 but under 20
2. The child appears to be in some form of training (apprenticeship)

According to the eligibility rules, Child Benefit can be paid for children under 20 who are in approved education or training. An apprenticeship would generally qualify as training, but I need to confirm some details about the apprenticeship to ensure it meets the criteria.

Thank you for that information. Since your son Ryan is 17 and on an apprenticeship, I need to ask: Is Ryan's apprenticeship unpaid or does it pay £728 or less per month on average? (This is important because Child Benefit can continue for children under 20 in approved training, but there are specific requirements about the payment level of the apprenticeship.)

2026-01-19T13:03:12.738975 [actor]: England apprenticeship government funded intermediate level

2026-01-19T13:03:17.172446 [root_agent]: #thought: The person has provided additional information about Ryan's apprenticeship. It's:
- In England
- Government funded
- At intermediate level

This suggests it's a formal, recognized apprenticeship program, which is positive for eligibility. Government-funded intermediate apprenticeships in England would typically qualify as approved training for Child Benefit purposes.

However, I still need to confirm the payment level, as this is a critical factor. If the apprenticeship pays more than £728 per month on average, Ryan would not qualify regardless of the type of apprenticeship.

I should also confirm whether the person actually lives with Ryan and is responsible for him, as this is another key eligibility criterion.

Thank you for that information. A government-funded intermediate apprenticeship generally qualifies as approved training for Child Benefit purposes.

Does Ryan's apprenticeship pay £728 or less per month on average? This is an important threshold for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-19T13:03:18.114268 [actor]: Living at home with me Ryan living at home

2026-01-19T13:03:21.606323 [root_agent]: #thought: The person has confirmed that Ryan is living at home with them, which is a positive factor for eligibility. This meets the requirement that they're responsible for the child and the child lives with them.

However, I still need information about how much Ryan's apprenticeship pays, as this is crucial for determining eligibility. If the apprenticeship pays more than £728 per month on average, Ryan would not qualify for Child Benefit purposes even if all other criteria are met.

I should also confirm if the person is a UK resident for tax purposes, as this is another eligibility requirement.

Thank you for confirming that Ryan lives at home with you. That's helpful information for determining eligibility.

I still need to know about Ryan's apprenticeship pay. Does his apprenticeship pay £728 or less per month on average?

2026-01-19T13:03:22.555343 [actor]: Intermediate apprenticeship government pays don't know exact amount

2026-01-19T13:03:28.248940 [root_agent]: #thought: The person has indicated that Ryan is on an intermediate apprenticeship that is government-funded, but they don't know the exact payment amount. This makes it difficult to definitively determine eligibility based on the £728 per month threshold.

According to the eligibility rules, for Child Benefit to continue for a child aged 16-19 in training:
- The training must be unpaid or pay £728 or less a month on average
- It must be government-approved
- It must average more than 12 hours of supervised training per week

While the apprenticeship is government-approved (being government-funded), without knowing the payment amount, I can't give a definitive answer. However, many intermediate apprenticeships, especially for 17-year-olds, may fall under this threshold.

I should also check if the person meets other eligibility criteria, such as UK residency and immigration status.

Thank you for that information. For Child Benefit eligibility, the payment amount is important, as the apprenticeship must pay £728 or less per month on average.

Since you're not sure about the exact amount, I would recommend checking this with Ryan's employer or training provider.

Are you normally living in the UK? (This is another key factor for Child Benefit eligibility.)

2026-01-19T13:03:29.292136 [actor]: Ryan just started apprenticeship this month living in UK yes

2026-01-19T13:03:35.971255 [root_agent]: #thought: The person has confirmed they are living in the UK, which satisfies the residency requirement for Child Benefit eligibility. They've also mentioned that Ryan just started his apprenticeship this month.

Since Ryan has just started, they might not yet have a clear picture of his monthly pay. This is understandable, but it remains a key factor for eligibility.

Let me consider what we know so far:
1. Ryan is 17 and on a government-funded intermediate apprenticeship (qualifies as approved training)
2. Ryan lives at home with the parent/guardian
3. The person is living in the UK
4. The payment amount for the apprenticeship is unknown

Most requirements appear to be met, but the payment threshold is still a crucial unknown factor.

I should also check if there are any high-income considerations, as parents earning over a certain threshold may be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Thank you for confirming you live in the UK. Since Ryan has just started his apprenticeship, I understand you might not know his exact pay yet.

Based on what you've told me, you may be eligible for Child Benefit since:
- Ryan is under 20 and in approved training
- He lives with you
- You live in the UK

However, eligibility depends on Ryan's apprenticeship paying £728 or less per month on average. You'll need to confirm this once you have this information.

Do you have an individual income over £50,000 per year? (This affects whether you might have to pay a tax charge on Child Benefit.)

2026-01-19T13:03:36.946350 [actor]: Don't know exact pay amount for Ryan's apprenticeship what happens

2026-01-19T13:03:43.511751 [root_agent]: #thought: The person seems concerned about not knowing Ryan's exact apprenticeship pay amount and wants to know what this means for their Child Benefit eligibility. They haven't answered about their own income, but that's secondary to the apprenticeship payment question.

I should explain the options they have given this uncertainty, and what steps they should take.

Based on the eligibility rules, the £728 per month threshold is important, and without knowing this information, it's hard to give a definitive answer about eligibility.

Thank you for your concern. Not knowing Ryan's exact apprenticeship pay at this stage is understandable since he just started. Here's what you can do:

1. You can still apply for Child Benefit now if Ryan was previously eligible (before turning 16). Your claim can continue while he's in approved training.

2. When you receive information about Ryan's monthly pay, you can then determine ongoing eligibility:
   - If it's £728 or less per month on average, you remain eligible
   - If it's more than £728 per month, you would need to notify HMRC as eligibility would cease

3. You can contact Ryan's employer or training provider to ask about the expected monthly payment.

4. For specific guidance on your situation, you can also contact the Child Benefit Office directly for advice.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-19T13:03:44.624059 [actor]: What if apprenticeship pays more than £728

2026-01-19T13:03:51.119055 [root_agent]: #thought: The person is asking specifically about what happens if Ryan's apprenticeship pays more than the £728 per month threshold. This is an important question that directly affects eligibility.

According to the eligibility rules on gov.uk, Child Benefit stops if the child aged 16-19 in training is paid more than £728 a month on average. This is a clear cut-off point.

I should explain this clearly and mention when the benefit would stop, and any notification requirements.

If Ryan's apprenticeship pays more than £728 per month on average, unfortunately you would no longer be eligible for Child Benefit for him. Here's what would happen:

1. Child Benefit would stop from the date that Ryan's pay exceeds this threshold.

2. You would need to notify the Child Benefit Office as soon as you become aware that his pay exceeds £728 per month.

3. If you don't notify them and continue to receive Child Benefit when you're no longer eligible, you might have to pay back any overpaid benefits.

4. The £728 threshold is based on the average monthly pay, so if his pay fluctuates but averages more than £728 per month, you would still be ineligible.

If Ryan's circumstances change again in the future (for example, if his pay decreases or he starts a different type of education or training), you might become eligible again and could reapply.

2026-01-19T13:03:52.298437 [actor]: So I'm not eligible for child benefit because of apprenticeship in England?

2026-01-19T13:03:57.767167 [root_agent]: #thought: The person seems to be misunderstanding or making an assumption that they're automatically ineligible for Child Benefit because their son is on an apprenticeship in England. This isn't necessarily the case, and I need to clarify this.

The key factor isn't that Ryan is on an apprenticeship in England, but rather how much the apprenticeship pays. Government-funded apprenticeships in England can qualify as approved training for Child Benefit purposes, as long as they meet the payment criteria.

I should clarify this misunderstanding and reiterate the actual determining factor.

I want to clarify - being on an apprenticeship in England does not automatically make you ineligible for Child Benefit. In fact, government-funded apprenticeships like Ryan's are generally considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes.

The key factor is how much the apprenticeship pays:

- If Ryan's apprenticeship pays £728 or less per month on average, you ARE eligible for Child Benefit
- Only if it pays more than £728 per month on average would you be ineligible

Since you mentioned Ryan just started his apprenticeship this month and you don't yet know the exact amount he'll be paid, you can't determine eligibility with certainty right now. 

I'd recommend checking with Ryan's employer or training provider about his expected monthly pay to determine your eligibility.

2026-01-19T13:03:59.200697 [actor]: I looked it up intermediate apprenticeship in England not eligible for child benefit according to gov website

2026-01-19T13:04:06.543745 [root_agent]: #thought: The person seems to have found information suggesting intermediate apprenticeships in England are not eligible for Child Benefit. This conflicts with my understanding based on the provided links, so I need to carefully consider this.

Looking at the eligibility criteria from the gov.uk links:
1. Child Benefit can continue for a child under 20 who is in approved education or training
2. For training, it must be unpaid or pay £728 or less per month on average
3. It must be government-approved

There is no blanket exclusion for intermediate apprenticeships in England that I'm aware of from the provided links. However, many apprenticeships might pay above the £728 threshold, which could make them ineligible.

It's possible the person found information indicating that standard payments for intermediate apprenticeships typically exceed the £728 threshold, or there might be another specific rule I'm not seeing in the provided links.

I should acknowledge what they've found while clarifying the general rules I have access to.

Thank you for looking into this further. If you've found specific information on the government website stating that intermediate apprenticeships in England are not eligible for Child Benefit regardless of payment amount, that would be important information.

Based on the general eligibility rules I have access to, apprenticeships can qualify as approved training for Child Benefit if they:
- Pay £728 or less per month on average
- Are government-approved
- Include more than 12 hours of supervised training per week

However, it's possible that:
1. Intermediate apprenticeships in England typically pay above the £728 threshold
2. Or there may be a specific rule about this type of apprenticeship that I don't have in my information

Could you share where on the gov.uk website you found this specific information about intermediate apprenticeships? This would help me provide you with more accurate guidance.

2026-01-19T13:04:10.967205 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent initially suggested the user might be eligible for Child Benefit if the apprenticeship paid under £728 per month, but this contradicts UK government rules which specifically state intermediate apprenticeships in England are not eligible for Child Benefit regardless of payment amount.
