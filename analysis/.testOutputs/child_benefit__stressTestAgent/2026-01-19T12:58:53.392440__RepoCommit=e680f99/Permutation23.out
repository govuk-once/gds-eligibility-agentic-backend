2026-01-19T13:08:28.313311 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you assess whether you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To determine this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:08:30.320101 [actor]: I'll now act as a UK resident seeking information about child benefit eligibility. I'll be obtuse, not answer questions directly, use search-engine-like speech patterns, and won't explain context.

daughter sarah 12 years old

2026-01-19T13:08:31.539977 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your 12-year-old daughter Sarah. 

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask if Sarah normally lives with you?

2026-01-19T13:08:32.410515 [actor]: not living together buy groceries clothes

2026-01-19T13:08:34.336060 [root_agent]: I understand that your 12-year-old daughter Sarah doesn't live with you, but you provide financial support by buying groceries and clothes for her.

Does someone else have the main responsibility for looking after Sarah's day-to-day care? This would be the person she lives with most of the time.

2026-01-19T13:08:35.352657 [actor]: ex wife has her maintenance payments no regular

2026-01-19T13:08:39.147390 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that your ex-wife has your daughter Sarah living with her, and you make maintenance payments, though not regularly.

Based on the UK government's rules for Child Benefit, the person who has main responsibility for a child is usually the person who is eligible to claim Child Benefit. Since your ex-wife has day-to-day care of Sarah, she would typically be the eligible person to claim.

However, if you believe you have equal or main responsibility for Sarah's care, you may be able to make a claim. The UK government would need to determine which claim has priority based on your specific circumstances.

Would you like to know more about how Child Benefit claims are determined when parents are separated?

2026-01-19T13:08:40.346043 [actor]: buy bulk groceries clothes 120 pounds every 4 weeks

2026-01-19T13:08:43.662430 [root_agent]: I understand that you provide support by buying bulk groceries and clothes worth £120 every 4 weeks for your daughter.

This financial contribution is important, but for Child Benefit eligibility, the UK government primarily considers who has the main day-to-day responsibility for the child.

Since your daughter lives with your ex-wife, your ex-wife is likely the person eligible to claim Child Benefit. Your financial contributions, while valuable, don't automatically qualify you for Child Benefit if you don't have main responsibility for your daughter's day-to-day care.

Would you like me to explain if there are any circumstances where you might be able to claim Child Benefit instead of your ex-wife?

2026-01-19T13:08:44.471800 [actor]: am i eligible yes or no

2026-01-19T13:08:46.811755 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, no, you would not likely be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your daughter.

Since your daughter Sarah lives with your ex-wife who has the day-to-day care responsibility, your ex-wife would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit, not you. Your financial contributions through groceries and clothes are important but don't change the eligibility criteria, which is primarily based on who the child lives with and who has main responsibility for the child's care.

2026-01-19T13:08:50.367601 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the person with day-to-day care responsibility (the ex-wife) is eligible for Child Benefit, not the person who provides some financial support but doesn't have the child living with them.
