2026-01-27T22:07:51.790866 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The expected outcome was "Eligible (via Exception)" but the agent incorrectly stated that Child Benefit cannot be claimed for Rashid because he is married, without exploring the exception that applies when the married child lives with and depends on the claimant.
