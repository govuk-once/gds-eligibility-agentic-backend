The agent focused on the ex-wife's eligibility based on day-to-day care, but did not recognize that the user's regular contributions (£120 every 4 weeks, averaging £30/week) exceed the required Child Benefit rate threshold of £26.05, which would make the user eligible under the lump sum contribution criteria.
