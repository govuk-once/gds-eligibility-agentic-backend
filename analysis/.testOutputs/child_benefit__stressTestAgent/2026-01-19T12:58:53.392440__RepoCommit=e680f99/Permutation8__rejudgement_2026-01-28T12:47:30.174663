The expected outcome is "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)" but the agent stated they would need to pay back the "full amount" of Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge. Since Fiona earns £75,000, which is between £60,000 and £80,000, she would only need to pay back a portion of the benefit (not the full amount) through a tax charge calculated at 1% for every £200 over £60,000.
