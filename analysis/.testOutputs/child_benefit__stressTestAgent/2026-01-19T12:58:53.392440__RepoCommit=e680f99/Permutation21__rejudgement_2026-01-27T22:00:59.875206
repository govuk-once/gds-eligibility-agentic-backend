2026-01-27T22:07:49.731349 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent gave incorrect information by stating the weekly rate for Sam would be £25.60, when according to the expected outcome, both parents should receive the higher rate of £26.05 weekly for each child as the "eldest child" in their respective households. This is a failure because the agent didn't provide the correct payment amount.
