2026-01-19T13:01:38.238268 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess this.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:01:39.179441 [actor]: child benefit Ruby 4 year old

2026-01-19T13:01:40.472665 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you're asking about Child Benefit for Ruby, who is 4 years old.

Is Ruby living with you, or are you responsible for raising her?

2026-01-19T13:01:41.218186 [actor]: yes lives with me and James

2026-01-19T13:01:42.822074 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that Ruby lives with you and James.

Are you or James currently living in the UK?

2026-01-19T13:01:43.698656 [actor]: UK London

2026-01-19T13:01:45.116307 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know you're living in London, UK.

Is either you or James being paid more than £60,000 per year (before tax)?

2026-01-19T13:01:45.899526 [actor]: Fiona salary £75000

2026-01-19T13:01:49.810087 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that your salary is £75,000.

Since your individual income is over £60,000 per year, you're still eligible to claim Child Benefit, but you would need to pay back the full amount through what's called the 'High Income Child Benefit Charge' via Self Assessment tax return.

You have two options:
1. You can claim Child Benefit and pay the tax charge through Self Assessment
2. You can opt not to receive Child Benefit payments (to avoid the tax charge) but still register your claim - this helps protect your National Insurance credits which can be important for your State Pension

Does James also have an income? If so, what is his approximate annual income?

2026-01-19T13:01:50.547250 [actor]: James 20000

2026-01-19T13:01:55.144942 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared, here's your Child Benefit eligibility situation:

Since Ruby is 4 years old, lives with you in the UK, and you are responsible for her, you are eligible for Child Benefit.

However, since your personal income is £75,000 (which is above the £60,000 threshold), you would need to pay back the full amount of Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge if you choose to receive the payments. 

James's income of £20,000 is below the threshold, so if he were to claim Child Benefit instead of you, your household could receive the full amount without having to pay it back through the tax charge.

You have these options:
1. You claim and receive payments but pay them back through Self Assessment
2. You claim but opt out of receiving payments (this protects your National Insurance credits)
3. James claims the Child Benefit (if he's also responsible for Ruby)

Would you like me to explain any of these options in more detail?

2026-01-19T13:01:59.020702 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly explained that the individual is eligible for Child Benefit for their 4-year-old child Ruby who lives with them in the UK, but since their income is £75,000 (above the £60,000 threshold), they would need to pay back the full amount through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
