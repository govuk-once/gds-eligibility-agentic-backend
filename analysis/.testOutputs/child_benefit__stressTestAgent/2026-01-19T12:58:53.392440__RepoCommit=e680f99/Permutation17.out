2026-01-19T13:06:19.183592 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:06:20.597515 [actor]: I need to play the role of a UK resident seeking benefit information. I'll engage with the agent who's trying to determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

2026-01-19T13:06:22.590645 [root_agent]: I'll need to understand your situation better to determine your Child Benefit eligibility.

When you mention "army kids Germany base," are you indicating that you're a member of the UK armed forces stationed in Germany with your children? This would help me understand your specific circumstances.

2026-01-19T13:06:25.444793 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you're on a military posting overseas with your two children who are 8 and 10 years old, along with your wife on the base.

Do you or your wife normally live in the UK when not on this military posting? (This helps determine if you maintain UK residency status)

2026-01-19T13:06:26.745357 [actor]: British armed forces stationed in Germany family together on base

2026-01-19T13:06:29.924214 [root_agent]: I understand you're in the British armed forces stationed in Germany with your family living together on base.

Since you're a member of the UK armed forces posted overseas, you're treated as living in the UK for Child Benefit purposes.

Based on what you've shared so far, with children aged 8 and 10 living with you, you would generally be eligible for Child Benefit as:
- Your children are under 16
- As a member of UK armed forces stationed abroad, you maintain UK residency status
- You have responsibility for the children

Would you like me to ask about any other factors that might affect your eligibility, such as income levels that could trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge?

2026-01-19T13:06:32.021310 [actor]: Based on my military posting, both children eligible then?

2026-01-19T13:06:33.427820 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that UK armed forces members stationed overseas with children under 16 are eligible for Child Benefit as they maintain UK residency status.
