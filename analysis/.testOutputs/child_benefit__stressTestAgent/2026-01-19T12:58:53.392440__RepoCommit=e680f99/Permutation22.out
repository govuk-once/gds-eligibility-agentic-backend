2026-01-19T13:08:04.584291 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T13:08:05.363098 [actor]: child in hospital

2026-01-19T13:08:07.072953 [root_agent]: I understand that your child is currently in hospital. Thank you for sharing that important information.

Are you the person who is mainly responsible for this child? (This would typically mean you would normally care for them when they're not in hospital.)

2026-01-19T13:08:07.906957 [actor]: Arthur my son hospital

2026-01-19T13:08:10.022599 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that your son Arthur is in the hospital.

Since Arthur is your son and is currently in hospital, this is an important consideration for Child Benefit eligibility. 

How long has Arthur been in the hospital so far? (The rules can vary depending on whether it's been less than 12 weeks or longer.)

2026-01-19T13:08:10.899074 [actor]: hospital 10 weeks home 2 weeks hospital again 3 weeks now

2026-01-19T13:08:14.430256 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about Arthur's situation. I understand he was in the hospital for 10 weeks, then home for 2 weeks, and is now back in the hospital for 3 weeks.

Based on the UK government guidelines, you can continue to receive Child Benefit when your child is temporarily in hospital. Since Arthur's current hospital stay has been for 3 weeks (and the previous one was 10 weeks with a break in between), this falls within the temporary period where Child Benefit would typically continue.

Is Arthur under 16 years old, or under 20 if he's in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:08:15.171136 [actor]: Arthur 7 years old

2026-01-19T13:08:17.304561 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Arthur is 7 years old.

Since Arthur is 7 years old and is your son who would normally live with you (when not in hospital), you would generally be eligible for Child Benefit. The temporary hospital stays do not affect your eligibility.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T13:08:18.281616 [actor]: no income that high

2026-01-19T13:08:22.676059 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that neither you nor a partner has an individual income over £60,000 per year.

Based on all the information you've provided:
- Arthur is your 7-year-old son
- He is currently in hospital (after previous hospital stays)
- You are his parent and responsible for him
- Neither you nor a partner has an income over £60,000

I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit. You can receive the full Child Benefit amount without any High Income Child Benefit Charge being applied.

If you haven't already applied, you can claim Child Benefit by filling out the CH2 form, which is available on the UK government website. The current weekly rates are £25.60 for your eldest or only child and £16.95 for any additional children.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility or how to claim it?

2026-01-19T13:08:26.451808 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that a child temporarily in hospital still qualifies for Child Benefit, and properly assessed eligibility based on the child's age and parent's income level.
