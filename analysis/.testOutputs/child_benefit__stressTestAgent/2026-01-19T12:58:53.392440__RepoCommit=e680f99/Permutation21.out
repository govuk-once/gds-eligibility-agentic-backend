2026-01-19T13:07:43.993464 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine whether you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a series of questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:07:45.743081 [actor]: I need to role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the rules to be obtuse, not directly answer questions, and speak like I'm using search terms.

Sam 10 years Ella 8 years divorce

2026-01-19T13:07:47.781808 [root_agent]: I notice you've provided some information about your family situation. To help determine your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to understand if you're responsible for these children.

Do Sam (10 years) and Ella (8 years) live with you or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards their upkeep?

2026-01-19T13:07:48.635210 [actor]: Sam live with me divorce Tina has Ella different houses

2026-01-19T13:07:50.681224 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that Sam lives with you, while Ella lives with Tina following your divorce.

Do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit rates (currently £25.60 per week for your eldest child and £16.95 per week for additional children) towards Ella's upkeep?

2026-01-19T13:07:51.682463 [actor]: No payment to Ella Tina responsibility Sam my responsibility only

2026-01-19T13:07:54.690755 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that you have responsibility for Sam who lives with you, while Tina has responsibility for Ella.

Based on the information provided, it appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit for Sam (10 years old) who lives with you and is under 16 years of age.

You would not be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Ella since she lives with Tina who has responsibility for her care.

May I ask if you work and have an individual income over £60,000 per year? This might affect how much Child Benefit you can actually keep.

2026-01-19T13:07:55.560465 [actor]: Income 40000 pounds Sam lives with me

2026-01-19T13:07:59.251525 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your income information. Since your income is £40,000 per year, you will be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit amount for Sam without any High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on all the information you've provided:

1. You are eligible for Child Benefit for Sam (10 years old) who lives with you
2. You would receive the full amount (currently £25.60 per week) for Sam
3. You are not eligible to claim for Ella as she lives with and is the responsibility of Tina

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to fill out a CH2 claim form which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility or the claims process?

2026-01-19T13:08:02.605362 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that the person is eligible for Child Benefit for Sam who lives with them, and not for Ella who lives with Tina and is her responsibility.
