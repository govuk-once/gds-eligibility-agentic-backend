2026-01-19T13:12:57.558552 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T13:13:00.078221 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about Child Benefit in relation to your son and custody arrangements.

To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you tell me if your son currently lives with you?

2026-01-19T13:13:01.474165 [actor]: son mark in jail 10 weeks already

2026-01-19T13:13:03.587878 [root_agent]: I understand that your son Mark is currently in jail for 10 weeks. Thank you for sharing this information.

For Child Benefit eligibility purposes, I need to understand your situation a bit more. Before Mark went to jail, was he living with you, and were you responsible for him? Also, may I ask how old Mark is?

2026-01-19T13:13:04.500732 [actor]: he's 15 i claim benefit before custody

2026-01-19T13:13:08.001460 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand Mark is 15 years old and you were claiming Child Benefit for him before he went into custody.

Regarding your Child Benefit eligibility while Mark is in custody: 

If your child is in custody (either in prison, young offender institution, or secure children's home) as a result of a court sentence, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks of custody.

Since you mentioned Mark has been in jail for 10 weeks already, your Child Benefit payments may have been affected. Have you received any notification about changes to your Child Benefit payments since Mark went into custody?

2026-01-19T13:13:09.056082 [actor]: no letters just wondering if I still get money

2026-01-19T13:13:14.197191 [root_agent]: I understand your concern about whether you'll still receive Child Benefit payments for Mark.

Based on UK government guidelines, Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks when a child is in custody following a court sentence. Since Mark has been in custody for 10 weeks already, it's likely that your Child Benefit payments should have stopped.

However, the system doesn't always update immediately, which might explain why you haven't received any notification yet. It's important to note that if you continue to receive payments that you're no longer entitled to, you may have to repay them later.

I would recommend:

1. Contacting the Child Benefit Office directly to inform them about Mark's situation
2. Asking them about the current status of your payments
3. Inquiring about when payments might resume if/when Mark returns to live with you

You can reach the Child Benefit Office on 0300 200 3100 (Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm).

Would you like to know anything else about this situation?

2026-01-19T13:13:18.270351 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks when a child is in custody following a court sentence, and since the son has been in jail for 10 weeks, the benefit should have stopped.
