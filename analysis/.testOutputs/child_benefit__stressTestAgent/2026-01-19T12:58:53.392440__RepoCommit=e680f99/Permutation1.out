2026-01-19T12:58:55.696015 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I need to ask you a series of questions, one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T12:58:56.643549 [actor]: Child benefit eligibility son Leo 8 years old Manchester

2026-01-19T12:58:58.070233 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand you have a son named Leo who is 8 years old and you're in Manchester.

Is Leo living with you? Or, to put it another way, are you responsible for Leo?

2026-01-19T12:58:59.139719 [actor]: Yes home with me and husband Tom

2026-01-19T12:59:00.800185 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Leo lives at home with you and your husband Tom.

Is Leo a child that you or your husband are raising as your own? This could include a biological child, adopted child, or a child you're looking after.

2026-01-19T12:59:01.838359 [actor]: Leo our son UK school

2026-01-19T12:59:03.479864 [root_agent]: I understand that Leo is your son and he attends school in the UK. 

Is Leo under 16 years old? (I can see you mentioned he's 8, but I'm confirming this for eligibility purposes.)

2026-01-19T12:59:04.221647 [actor]: 8 years old primary school

2026-01-19T12:59:05.590245 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Leo is 8 years old and in primary school.

Do either you or your husband individually earn over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T12:59:06.500513 [actor]: Teacher salary 35000 my part-time 15000

2026-01-19T12:59:09.959569 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that one of you is a teacher earning £35,000, and you work part-time earning £15,000.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit for your 8-year-old son Leo. 

Since both you and your husband earn under £50,000 individually, you would be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount without the High Income Child Benefit Charge applying.

For one child, the Child Benefit rate is currently £25.60 per week for your eldest or only child.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T12:59:12.439152 [actor]: That's good news about being eligible. Will get 25.60 weekly for Leo. How apply online?

2026-01-19T12:59:13.984944 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the family is eligible for Child Benefit for their 8-year-old son Leo, with the correct weekly amount of £25.60, since both parents earn under £50,000 individually.
