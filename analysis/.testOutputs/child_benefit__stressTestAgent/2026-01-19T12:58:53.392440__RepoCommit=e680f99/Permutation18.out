2026-01-19T13:06:34.980209 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:06:36.083580 [actor]: Child benefit my son studies full time

2026-01-19T13:06:37.488929 [root_agent]: I see that you have a son who studies full time. Thank you for sharing that information.

How old is your son who is studying full time?

2026-01-19T13:06:38.255248 [actor]: Dev nineteen A-levels

2026-01-19T13:06:39.613481 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son Dev is 19 years old and studying A-levels.

Is Dev living with you, or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards looking after him?

2026-01-19T13:06:40.480443 [actor]: Lives with me pays nothing studying

2026-01-19T13:06:43.674980 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Dev lives with you and is studying.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. Your son Dev is 19 years old (under 20)
2. He is studying A-levels, which is considered approved education
3. He lives with you
4. You are responsible for him

Child Benefit can be paid for children under 20 who are in approved education, which includes A-levels.

Is Dev's other parent claiming Child Benefit for him, or is anyone else receiving Child Benefit payments for him?

2026-01-19T13:06:44.607414 [actor]: No other claims birthday next month twentieth

2026-01-19T13:06:46.984366 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Dev.

I need to make you aware of something important: since Dev will be turning 20 next month, your Child Benefit for him will stop on his 20th birthday. Child Benefit can only be paid for young people under 20 who are in approved education.

Would you like me to provide information on how to apply for Child Benefit for the remaining time until his birthday, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-19T13:06:47.983433 [actor]: So not eligible after birthday?

2026-01-19T13:06:50.393842 [root_agent]: That's correct. You will not be eligible for Child Benefit for Dev after his 20th birthday next month.

Child Benefit can only be paid for:
- Children under 16
- Young people under 20 who are in approved education or training

Once Dev turns 20, even though he is still studying A-levels, you will no longer be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him. The payments will automatically stop when he reaches his 20th birthday.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or any other support you might be eligible for?

2026-01-19T13:06:52.468779 [actor]: I see. Thank you for explaining. Won't get money after birthday.

2026-01-19T13:06:54.555619 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately informed the user they are currently eligible for Child Benefit because their 19-year-old son is in approved education (A-levels), but also correctly advised that eligibility will end when the son turns 20 next month.
