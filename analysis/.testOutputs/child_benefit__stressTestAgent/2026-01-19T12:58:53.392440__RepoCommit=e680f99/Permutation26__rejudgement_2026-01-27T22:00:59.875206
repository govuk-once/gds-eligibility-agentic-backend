The agent provided accurate information - a person can claim Child Benefit for a child who lives elsewhere if they contribute at least the amount of the Child Benefit rate, which the father does when combined with grandmother's contribution (£30 total, exceeding the £24 threshold). The expected outcome was "Eligible" which matches what the agent ultimately concluded.
