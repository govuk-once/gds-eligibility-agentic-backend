2026-01-27T22:07:44.035551 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge. The agent failed to correctly apply the "Linking Rule" for hospital stays. Since Arthur returned to hospital within 28 days (after just 15 days at home), his hospital stays should be linked, totaling 13 weeks (10+3), which exceeds the 12-week limit. The correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible" since Arthur has been in hospital for a cumulative period exceeding 12 weeks.
