2026-01-27T22:08:16.420848 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I agree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly suggested eligibility might depend on the payment amount when intermediate apprenticeships in England specifically disqualify a child from Child Benefit regardless of payment level, contradicting the expected outcome that Karen is not eligible.
