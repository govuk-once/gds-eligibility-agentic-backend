While the agent did not explicitly state the expected outcome "Eligible (via Exception)", they correctly explained that Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks in care but indicated the user might still be eligible due to the weekend stays, and appropriately advised contacting HMRC to explain the specific circumstances.
