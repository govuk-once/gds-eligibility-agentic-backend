2026-01-26T14:41:33.672213 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T14:41:35.390183 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll interact with the agent until they provide me with an eligibility outcome.

Yes, I do have responsibility for my son Dev who lives with me. He's currently studying full-time for his A-levels.

2026-01-26T14:41:36.552572 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I'll continue asking questions to determine your eligibility for Child Benefit.

How old is your son Dev?

2026-01-26T14:41:37.660671 [actor]: Dev is 19 years old now, but he'll be turning 20 next month. He's still in the middle of his A-level studies.

2026-01-26T14:41:39.914920 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Child Benefit usually stops on August 31st after a child turns 16, but it can continue until they're 20 if they stay in approved education or training. However, there's an age limit for Child Benefit eligibility.

Based on your son's age, I need to confirm: is Dev currently 19 years old and studying for A-levels at school or college (not university)?

2026-01-26T14:41:41.693342 [actor]: Yes, that's correct. Dev is currently 19 years old and he's studying for his A-levels at the local college. He's not at university yet - he's hoping to go next year after he completes his A-levels.

2026-01-26T14:41:43.688871 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information.

Since Dev is 19 years old and is studying for his A-levels at a college (which counts as approved education), he would currently be within the age eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

However, I need to ask: will Dev be continuing his education after he turns 20 next month? And is this still part of his A-level studies at the college?

2026-01-26T14:41:45.569393 [actor]: Yes, Dev will be continuing with his A-level studies after his 20th birthday next month. It's the same course - he'll just be turning 20 in the middle of the academic year. He plans to complete his A-levels which will finish at the end of this academic year.

2026-01-26T14:41:48.544604 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification.

I need to inform you that Child Benefit generally stops when a child turns 20, even if they're still in approved education or training. 

Based on the information you've provided:
- Your son Dev is currently 19 and eligible for Child Benefit while studying A-levels
- However, once he turns 20 next month, you will no longer be eligible for Child Benefit for him, even though he's continuing the same course

This means you're currently eligible to receive Child Benefit for Dev, but this eligibility will end when he reaches his 20th birthday next month.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-26T14:41:51.054476 [actor]: So I understand that I can continue receiving Child Benefit for Dev until his 20th birthday next month, but after that, I won't be eligible anymore even though he's still studying the same A-level course? That seems a bit unfair since he's still in education, but I understand those are the rules. Will I need to notify anyone when he turns 20, or will the payments just stop automatically?

2026-01-26T14:41:53.152417 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit continues while the child is in approved education until they turn 20, at which point it stops regardless of continued education.
