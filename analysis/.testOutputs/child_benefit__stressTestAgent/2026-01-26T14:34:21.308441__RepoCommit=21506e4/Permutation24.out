2026-01-26T14:44:09.266553 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions one by one.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:44:10.597350 [actor]: Yes, I have responsibility for my son Tom who is 14 years old.

2026-01-26T14:44:12.184561 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your son Tom who is 14 years old.

Does Tom live with you? Or if not, do you pay at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate toward his upkeep?

2026-01-26T14:44:13.596726 [actor]: Well, currently Tom isn't living with me. He has severe behavioral needs and has been in a residential school for 10 weeks now. The local council is paying for his placement there.

2026-01-26T14:44:17.001186 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand Tom is currently in a residential school due to his behavioral needs, with the local council funding his placement.

For Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in residential accommodation (like a residential school), there are specific rules:

1. You can usually continue to get Child Benefit if your child is in residential accommodation because of their special educational needs or disabilities, and the placement is being funded by the local council.

2. Child Benefit can continue for up to 12 weeks if your child is expected to return to live with you after their time in residential care.

How long is Tom expected to stay at the residential school? Is this expected to be a temporary arrangement where he will return to live with you?

2026-01-26T14:44:19.568015 [actor]: Tom's placement is part of his educational plan for his special needs. It's a long-term arrangement, but he does come home for school holidays and some weekends. The residential school is the best place for his educational needs right now, but I'm still his parent and responsible for him when he's not at school. The local council is funding it because of his specific behavioral needs that require specialized support.

2026-01-26T14:44:22.979997 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining Tom's situation more clearly. Based on what you've shared:

Since Tom is in residential accommodation due to his special educational needs with local council funding, and he regularly returns home during holidays and some weekends, you would typically remain eligible for Child Benefit.

The important factors here are:
1. The placement is for educational purposes related to his special needs
2. You maintain parental responsibility
3. He returns to your home regularly during holidays and weekends
4. The local authority is funding his placement

These circumstances generally allow you to continue receiving Child Benefit even though Tom is in residential accommodation, as you still maintain responsibility for him and he returns to your care regularly.

Is there anything else about your situation that might affect your Child Benefit eligibility that you'd like me to address?

2026-01-26T14:44:25.083188 [actor]: No, that covers my situation. I'm glad to hear I'm still eligible for Child Benefit while Tom is at his residential school. Thank you for confirming that for me. I was worried that his placement might affect my benefits.

2026-01-26T14:44:27.407584 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit while their child is in residential accommodation for special educational needs, as the child returns home regularly during holidays and weekends.
