2026-01-27T18:52:04.286920 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly determined Mark was not eligible. According to the rules, a non-resident parent who contributes more than the Child Benefit amount (Mark gives £150, exceeding the £113/month rate) can claim if the resident parent isn't claiming, which Jenny isn't. The outcome should be "Eligible."
