2026-01-26T14:53:59.599074 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years of age, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:54:01.755336 [actor]: I'll role-play as a person asking about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hello. Yes, I have an 8-year-old daughter, but she's been in the hospital for 14 weeks now. I visit her every day for hours to keep her company, but the hospital provides everything she needs like food, clothes, and other necessities, so I don't buy those things for her while she's there.

2026-01-26T14:54:05.133145 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, and I'm sorry to hear about your daughter's hospitalization. That must be a difficult time for you both.

Based on what you've shared, I need to understand your specific situation with regard to Child Benefit eligibility. 

For children in hospital, the rules state that you can usually continue to get Child Benefit if your child is in hospital. The important factor is whether you're still considered responsible for your child during this period.

Since you visit your daughter regularly and maintain your parental role, even though the hospital is currently providing her immediate necessities, you would typically still be considered responsible for her.

May I ask if you were receiving Child Benefit for your daughter before she was hospitalized?

2026-01-26T14:54:07.282980 [actor]: Yes, I was receiving Child Benefit for her before she went into the hospital. I've been a single parent raising her on my own since she was born. I'm just worried because someone told me that after 12 weeks in hospital, I might not be eligible anymore. But I'm there every single day with her, just not buying things since the hospital provides everything.

2026-01-26T14:54:10.672841 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your concern about the 12-week period.

The good news is that you can continue to receive Child Benefit while your daughter is in hospital, regardless of how long she stays there. There isn't a 12-week limit for hospital stays that would affect your Child Benefit eligibility.

Since you were receiving Child Benefit before her hospitalization, you remain eligible as you're still responsible for your daughter - demonstrated by your daily visits and continued parental role. The fact that the hospital is temporarily providing necessities doesn't change your status as the person responsible for her care.

Your Child Benefit should continue as normal throughout her hospital stay. You don't need to notify HMRC about the hospitalization unless your circumstances change in other ways.

Is there anything else about your Child Benefit that you're concerned about?

2026-01-26T14:54:13.183649 [actor]: I'm still a bit confused. I was told specifically that after 12 weeks, there might be an issue because I don't spend money on her while she's in the hospital. The hospital provides all her food, clothes, and everything else she needs. I just visit her every day for hours, but I don't actually buy anything for her right now. Does that matter? Will I still get the payments even though I'm not financially supporting her at the moment?

2026-01-26T14:54:18.130443 [root_agent]: I understand your concern, and I want to clarify this for you.

For Child Benefit purposes, being responsible for a child isn't just about financial expenditure at any given moment. The rules specifically address hospital stays, and there is no 12-week rule that would stop your Child Benefit when your child is in hospital.

According to the government guidance, you can continue to receive Child Benefit while your child is in hospital regardless of the length of stay. The hospital providing necessities (food, clothing, etc.) during this temporary period does not affect your eligibility. Your regular visits demonstrate that you maintain responsibility for your child.

The information you received about a 12-week limit might be confusing Child Benefit rules with other benefits or may simply be incorrect. For Child Benefit specifically, your payments should continue throughout your daughter's hospital stay without interruption, even though you're not currently having to spend money on her everyday needs.

What matters is that you remain her parent with responsibility for her overall care, which you clearly are by visiting her daily and maintaining your parental role.

2026-01-26T14:54:20.945437 [actor]: Oh, that's a relief to hear. I was really worried that I might lose the Child Benefit because I'm not spending money on her at the moment. Thank you for clarifying that. I'll continue visiting her every day of course, and hopefully she'll be able to come home soon. I appreciate your help with this information.

2026-01-26T14:54:23.573362 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit continues during hospital stays regardless of length, and that the parent remaining responsible (through daily visits) maintains eligibility even when the hospital provides necessities.
