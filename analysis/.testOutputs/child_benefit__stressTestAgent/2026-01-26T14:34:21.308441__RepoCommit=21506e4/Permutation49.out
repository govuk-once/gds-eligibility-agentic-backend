2026-01-26T14:55:58.759524 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:56:00.251978 [actor]: I'll help you determine your eligibility for Child Benefit by role-playing as a user in this conversation.

Hello, yes I have a son named Tom who is 17 years old. He's taking a computer coding course at the moment.

2026-01-26T14:56:02.666797 [root_agent]: I'll continue helping you determine your eligibility for Child Benefit.

Thank you for that information about your 17-year-old son Tom who is taking a computer coding course. To understand if this education qualifies, could you please tell me if Tom's computer coding course is considered approved education or training? This would typically be a non-advanced education course (like A-levels or equivalent) or an approved training course.

2026-01-26T14:56:05.105542 [actor]: The coding course Tom is taking isn't a standard educational course like A-levels. It's actually a specific computer coding course that his future employer is paying for. He doesn't get paid while taking it, but the company covers all the course fees as part of an agreement that he'll join them after he completes it. It's like a pre-employment training arrangement.

2026-01-26T14:56:08.581452 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about Tom's coding course. I need to determine if this type of training qualifies for Child Benefit purposes.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears Tom's training may not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes. Typically, approved education would be non-advanced education like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or certain approved training courses.

Since this is a pre-employment training arrangement paid for by a future employer, it may be considered more as preparation for specific employment rather than qualifying education or training under Child Benefit rules.

Could you tell me if Tom lives with you full-time?

2026-01-26T14:56:09.986449 [actor]: Yes, Tom lives with me full-time at our home. He's been living with me his whole life. The coding course is just during weekdays, so he comes home every evening.

2026-01-26T14:56:13.840901 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Tom lives with you full-time. That's an important factor for Child Benefit eligibility.

Based on what you've shared so far, it appears that while you have responsibility for Tom and he lives with you full-time, the specific type of training he's undertaking (pre-employment training paid for by a future employer) likely doesn't qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.

For Child Benefit to continue past age 16, the young person needs to be in what's defined as approved education (such as A-levels or equivalent) or approved training (which typically means unpaid training arranged by the government).

May I ask if you've been receiving Child Benefit for Tom previously, or is this a new application?

2026-01-26T14:56:15.666843 [actor]: Yes, I've been receiving Child Benefit for Tom ever since he was born. I was just wondering if I could continue to receive it now that he's 17 and doing this course. I wasn't sure if this type of training would count as approved education or not.

2026-01-26T14:56:20.305852 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Since you've been receiving Child Benefit for Tom since he was born, it's important to know that continuing to receive it now depends on whether his current activity meets the criteria for approved education or training.

Based on what you've described about Tom's computer coding course (being pre-employment training arranged and paid for by a future employer), it likely doesn't qualify as "approved education or training" under Child Benefit rules. 

Approved education typically includes:
- A-levels or similar qualifications
- T levels
- Scottish Highers
- NVQs up to level 3
- Home education (if started before age 16)

Approved training typically refers to unpaid training courses arranged by government schemes.

Since Tom's course appears to be outside these categories, you may no longer be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him. I would recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly to inform them of Tom's current situation, as continuing to claim when not eligible could result in having to pay back any overpayments.

Is there anything else about Tom's situation that you think might be relevant to your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T14:56:23.226965 [actor]: I see. I didn't realize that this type of arrangement wouldn't count as approved education or training. That answers my question - it sounds like I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit for Tom since his course is arranged by his future employer rather than being a standard educational qualification or government training scheme.

Thank you for explaining this clearly. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them of the change in Tom's circumstances.

2026-01-26T14:56:25.586895 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that a pre-employment training course paid for by a future employer doesn't qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes for a 17-year-old.
