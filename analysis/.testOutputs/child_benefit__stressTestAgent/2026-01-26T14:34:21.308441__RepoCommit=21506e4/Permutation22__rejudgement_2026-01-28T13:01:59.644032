2026-01-28T13:08:43.342071 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly stated there is no time limit for hospital stays affecting Child Benefit eligibility. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" because Arthur has been in hospital for a cumulative 13 weeks (10 weeks + 3 weeks), exceeding the 12-week limit, and the stays are linked because he returned within 28 days (after 15 days).
