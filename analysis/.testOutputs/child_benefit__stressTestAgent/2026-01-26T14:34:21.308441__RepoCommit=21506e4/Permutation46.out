2026-01-26T14:54:25.169022 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:54:26.502957 [actor]: I'll help by role-playing as someone in the specified situation.

Yes, I have responsibility for my child. I have a 4-year-old daughter that I take care of.

2026-01-26T14:54:27.697529 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your 4-year-old daughter. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask: Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:54:28.677430 [actor]: Yes, I do live in the UK. I've been here for about two years now.

2026-01-26T14:54:30.095167 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you've been in the UK for about two years, I need to understand your immigration status. Do you have the right to live in the UK (such as being a UK citizen, having settled status, or having the right to reside)?

2026-01-26T14:54:31.230938 [actor]: I have Pre-Settled Status in the UK. I moved here from Germany about two years ago.

2026-01-26T14:54:32.555708 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Having Pre-Settled Status means you have the right to live in the UK, which is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

My next question is: Is your 4-year-old daughter living with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:54:33.480521 [actor]: Yes, my daughter lives with me here in the UK. We share a flat together.

2026-01-26T14:54:34.836306 [root_agent]: Thank you. Since your daughter lives with you in the UK, that's positive for your eligibility.

Next question: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T14:54:35.831180 [actor]: No, my income is nowhere near £60,000. I'm actually unemployed at the moment and looking for work.

2026-01-26T14:54:37.611581 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. The fact that your income is below £60,000 is relevant to your eligibility.

Next question: Is anyone else (such as another parent or guardian) already claiming Child Benefit for your daughter?

2026-01-26T14:54:39.235975 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for my daughter.

2026-01-26T14:54:43.315806 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else is claiming Child Benefit for your daughter.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have responsibility for your 4-year-old daughter
- You live in the UK with Pre-Settled Status
- Your daughter lives with you in the UK
- Your income is below £60,000
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for your daughter

It appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit. With Pre-Settled Status, you have the right to reside in the UK, which meets one of the key eligibility requirements. You can apply for Child Benefit using form CH2, which is available on the GOV.UK website, or you can apply online.

The current rates for Child Benefit are £25.60 per week for your first child and £16.95 for each additional child, typically paid every 4 weeks.

Would you like to know more about the application process?

2026-01-26T14:54:46.047528 [actor]: Actually, I should mention that I've already been claiming Child Benefit for a while now. I've been unemployed and claiming as a "jobseeker" with my Pre-Settled Status. I've been looking for work for about 95 days now, and I don't have any job offers lined up yet. I'm just wondering if my eligibility might change soon?

2026-01-26T14:54:52.338183 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that additional context. This is an important detail that could affect your ongoing eligibility.

With Pre-Settled Status, if you're relying on your status as a "jobseeker" to establish your right to reside for benefit purposes, there may be time limitations to consider. Generally, EU citizens with Pre-Settled Status who are jobseekers can maintain their right to claim certain benefits for a reasonable period while genuinely seeking work.

However, this "reasonable period" is typically considered to be around 91 days (approximately 3 months), and you mentioned you've been looking for work for about 95 days. This could potentially affect your ongoing eligibility for Child Benefit.

To maintain your eligibility, you would typically need to either:

1. Find employment
2. Have another basis for right to reside (such as being self-sufficient with comprehensive health insurance, or being a family member of someone with a qualifying right to reside)
3. Demonstrate that you have a genuine chance of finding work and are continuing to seek employment actively

Have you been in touch with the Jobcentre Plus or received any guidance about your jobseeker status recently?

2026-01-26T14:54:54.330162 [actor]: No, I haven't spoken to anyone at Jobcentre Plus about my status lately. I've been applying for jobs regularly but haven't had much luck. I didn't realize there was a time limit on being a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status. This is concerning - does this mean I might lose my Child Benefit soon?

2026-01-26T14:55:00.809389 [root_agent]: I understand your concern about this situation. This is indeed important to address.

Based on the information you've shared, there is a potential risk to your ongoing Child Benefit eligibility. While having Pre-Settled Status itself doesn't expire, the basis of your right to reside as a jobseeker may be time-limited for benefit purposes.

I would strongly recommend:

1. Contact the Jobcentre Plus as soon as possible to discuss your current situation and get advice specific to your circumstances.

2. Speak directly with the Child Benefit office (HMRC) to explain your situation and ask about your ongoing eligibility. You can reach them at 0300 200 3100.

3. Consider seeking advice from a welfare rights advisor or organization like Citizens Advice, who can provide free guidance on benefit entitlements and immigration status issues.

While I can't predict exactly what will happen in your specific case, maintaining evidence of your genuine efforts to find work is important. Documentation of job applications, interviews, and any skills training you're undertaking could help demonstrate that you continue to have a genuine chance of finding employment.

It's better to address this proactively rather than risk an overpayment situation if your eligibility status changes. Would you like information about any additional support you might be eligible for during this time?

2026-01-26T14:55:03.518742 [actor]: This is really worrying. I didn't know about the 91-day limit. I'll definitely contact the Jobcentre Plus and the Child Benefit office right away. I've been keeping records of all my job applications, so hopefully that will help. 

Yes, I'd appreciate any information about other support I might be eligible for while I continue my job search. My daughter and I really depend on that Child Benefit payment.

2026-01-26T14:55:06.248054 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that a person with Pre-Settled Status claiming as a "jobseeker" for more than 91 days may risk losing their benefit eligibility, which matches the situation described in the scenario.
