2026-01-26T14:49:08.752485 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To make this assessment, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T14:49:09.882206 [actor]: Yes, my son Rashid lives with us. He's 17 years old.

2026-01-26T14:49:11.500942 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now I need to understand more about your situation regarding Child Benefit eligibility. 

Is your son Rashid in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or certain other training courses.

2026-01-26T14:49:12.538309 [actor]: Yes, Rashid is studying for his A-Levels right now. He's in full-time education.

2026-01-26T14:49:13.661942 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: Is your or your partner's individual income over £60,000 per year? (This is relevant for the High Income Child Benefit Charge.)

2026-01-26T14:49:14.674626 [actor]: No, neither my wife nor I earn over £60,000 per year.

2026-01-26T14:49:18.727572 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've told me so far, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit. You have a 17-year-old son who is in full-time approved education (A-Levels), and neither you nor your partner earn over the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold of £60,000.

Child Benefit can typically be paid for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training, which applies in your case with Rashid.

Just to confirm, is there any other information about your situation that might affect your eligibility? For example, is Rashid receiving any benefits in his own right, or is there any change in his educational status planned in the near future?

2026-01-26T14:49:20.632728 [actor]: Well, there is something I should mention. Rashid recently got married to his girlfriend who is also 17, and she's moved into our house. They're both still in school. I still support Rashid financially and want to continue claiming Child Benefit for him if possible.

2026-01-26T14:49:24.105623 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that important information.

This changes the situation significantly. If Rashid is married, he would not be eligible for Child Benefit. According to UK government rules, Child Benefit stops if the child gets married or forms a civil partnership, even if they're still in approved education and under 20 years old.

Since Rashid is now married and living with his spouse (even though they're living in your home and you continue to support him financially), you would no longer be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him.

If you're currently receiving Child Benefit for Rashid, you should inform the Child Benefit Office about this change in circumstances as soon as possible to avoid any potential overpayments that might need to be paid back.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or any other support you might be eligible for?

2026-01-26T14:49:26.244293 [actor]: I see. That's disappointing to hear. I didn't realize his marriage would affect the Child Benefit. Even though they're both still in school and I'm still supporting him financially, I can't claim anymore?

2026-01-26T14:49:28.680729 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit stops when a child gets married, regardless of their age or educational status, which aligns with UK government rules.
