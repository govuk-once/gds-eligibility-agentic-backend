2026-01-26T14:40:00.956531 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T14:40:02.023841 [actor]: I have a 6-year-old son named Noah.

2026-01-26T14:40:03.540997 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. So you have a 6-year-old son named Noah. That's helpful to know.

Is Noah living with you? (This helps me understand if you have responsibility for him in your home.)

2026-01-26T14:40:04.733267 [actor]: Actually, right now Noah is staying with his grandmother. I'm recovering from surgery, so he's been with her for about 6 weeks now.

2026-01-26T14:40:05.968140 [root_agent]: I understand that Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother while you recover from surgery.

Is this arrangement intended to be temporary, or is it a permanent living arrangement for Noah?

2026-01-26T14:40:07.769609 [actor]: It's definitely temporary. He's just staying with her while I recover from my surgery. He should be back home with me in a couple of weeks.

2026-01-26T14:40:09.576212 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. 

Since this is a temporary arrangement while you recover from surgery, and Noah will be returning to live with you in a couple of weeks, this shouldn't affect your Child Benefit eligibility.

May I ask, do you normally provide the main day-to-day care for Noah when he's living with you?

2026-01-26T14:40:10.914267 [actor]: Yes, I'm a single mother and I normally provide all his day-to-day care when he's with me.

2026-01-26T14:40:12.818789 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since you normally provide the day-to-day care for Noah as a single mother, and he's only temporarily staying with his grandmother while you recover, you would generally be eligible for Child Benefit.

Are you currently living in the UK? (This is another important eligibility factor)

2026-01-26T14:40:13.790862 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-26T14:40:15.866997 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Based on what you've told me so far, it appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit because:
1. You have responsibility for a child under 16 (your 6-year-old son Noah)
2. You normally provide day-to-day care for him
3. You live in the UK
4. Noah is only temporarily staying with his grandmother while you recover from surgery

One more question: Does your individual income exceed £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T14:40:16.866284 [actor]: No, my income is nowhere near that amount.

2026-01-26T14:40:19.778942 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your income details.

Based on all the information you've provided, I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit. Since your income is below £60,000, you would be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit payment without any High Income Child Benefit Charge.

The temporary arrangement with Noah staying at his grandmother's while you recover from surgery doesn't affect your eligibility, as you normally have responsibility for him and provide his day-to-day care.

If you're not already claiming Child Benefit, you can apply online or by post. The benefit can be backdated for up to 3 months from when your application is received.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T14:40:21.465899 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for Child Benefit. That's a relief to hear that the temporary arrangement with my son staying at his grandmother's won't affect my eligibility. I don't have any other questions right now.

2026-01-26T14:40:25.004545 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that temporary childcare arrangements during the mother's recovery from surgery don't affect eligibility for Child Benefit since she normally provides day-to-day care for her child.
