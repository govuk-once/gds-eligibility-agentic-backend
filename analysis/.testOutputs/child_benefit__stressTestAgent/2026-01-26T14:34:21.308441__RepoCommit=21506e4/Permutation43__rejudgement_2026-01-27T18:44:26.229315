2026-01-27T18:51:46.080274 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that Callum's Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland makes him ineligible for Child Benefit. The guidance actually indicates that in Scotland specifically, Modern Apprenticeships are not considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes (unlike Welsh apprenticeships which have an exception), making the correct outcome "Not Eligible" as expected.
