2026-01-26T14:53:04.689457 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your situation.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:53:06.668002 [actor]: Hi there, I'm Callum's father from Glasgow. My son is 17 years old and he's recently started a Modern Apprenticeship here in Scotland. I was wondering if I'm still eligible for Child Benefit for him now that he's in this apprenticeship program.

2026-01-26T14:53:08.512974 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. 

To determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit for your 17-year-old son Callum who has started a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, I need to know if this apprenticeship program qualifies as "approved education or training" under Child Benefit rules.

Does Callum's Modern Apprenticeship include some classroom-based learning alongside the work experience component?

2026-01-26T14:53:10.581988 [actor]: Yes, his Modern Apprenticeship does include some classroom learning at a local college, along with his on-the-job training. He spends about one day a week at the college and the rest of the time working with a local company. It's a proper apprenticeship program where he's learning a trade.

2026-01-26T14:53:12.009102 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

For Child Benefit purposes, I need to understand if Callum is being paid during this Modern Apprenticeship. Does he receive any wages or payment as part of this apprenticeship program?

2026-01-26T14:53:13.822519 [actor]: Yes, Callum does receive payment for his apprenticeship. He gets a wage from the company he's working with - it's not a huge amount, but they do pay him weekly for the work he does. I think that's standard for apprenticeships these days.

2026-01-26T14:53:17.022867 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared, it appears that Callum's situation may affect your Child Benefit eligibility. Since he is receiving wages from his apprenticeship, this would typically be considered "advanced education" rather than "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.

Generally, Child Benefit can continue for children in approved education (like A-levels or Scottish Highers) until age 19, but paid apprenticeships where the young person receives a wage are usually classified differently.

May I ask how much Callum earns weekly from his apprenticeship? This could be relevant to the final determination.

2026-01-26T14:53:18.695625 [actor]: He gets about £170 per week from his apprenticeship. It's not a huge amount, but it helps him with his expenses. He's still living at home with me though, and I'm still supporting him financially in many ways.

2026-01-26T14:53:22.741102 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to advise you that Callum's Modern Apprenticeship likely makes him ineligible for Child Benefit continuation. This is because:

1. He is receiving payment (£170 per week) for his apprenticeship work
2. Paid apprenticeships are typically considered "advanced education" rather than "approved education or training" under Child Benefit rules

According to UK government guidelines, Child Benefit usually stops after August following a child's 16th birthday if they start paid work of more than 24 hours per week, even if this is part of training like an apprenticeship.

Since Callum is 17 and receiving wages for his apprenticeship, you would likely not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for him. I would recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office directly to confirm this assessment based on your specific circumstances and to discuss when payments should stop if you're currently receiving them.

2026-01-26T14:53:25.003694 [actor]: I see, thank you for explaining that. I wasn't aware that his apprenticeship would make him ineligible for Child Benefit. It's a bit disappointing since I'm still supporting him at home, but I understand the rules now. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office to confirm this and see about stopping the payments if needed. Thanks for your help with clarifying this for me.

2026-01-26T14:53:27.784786 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent incorrectly stated that a paid apprenticeship makes a child ineligible for Child Benefit. According to gov.uk guidance, approved training includes apprenticeships in England, and similar schemes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
