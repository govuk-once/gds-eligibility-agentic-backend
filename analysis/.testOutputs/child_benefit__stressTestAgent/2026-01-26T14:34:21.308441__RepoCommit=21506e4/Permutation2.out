2026-01-26T14:34:46.872776 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:34:48.144036 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for my daughter Priya. She's 17 and currently studying for her A-levels at a local sixth-form college here in London.

2026-01-26T14:34:50.073895 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since your daughter Priya is 17 and studying for her A-levels at a sixth-form college, this is considered approved education, which is good for Child Benefit eligibility.

Is Priya living with you, or does she live with someone else?

2026-01-26T14:34:51.237697 [actor]: Yes, Priya lives with me. It's just the two of us in our home in London. I'm a single father taking care of her.

2026-01-26T14:34:52.549241 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know that Priya lives with you.

Do you or your daughter Priya live in the UK? (This includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland)

2026-01-26T14:34:53.606265 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. As I mentioned, we're based in London.

2026-01-26T14:34:54.917983 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you both live in the UK.

Next question: Is your daughter Priya a UK citizen, or does she have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:34:55.750680 [actor]: Yes, Priya is a UK citizen.

2026-01-26T14:34:56.699243 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Is your annual individual income more than £60,000?

2026-01-26T14:34:57.425360 [actor]: No, my annual income is £40,000.

2026-01-26T14:35:02.476752 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information about your income.

Based on the information you've shared:

1. You are responsible for your 17-year-old daughter Priya who is studying A-levels at a sixth-form college (approved education)
2. Priya lives with you
3. Both of you live in the UK
4. Priya is a UK citizen
5. Your annual income is £40,000

I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit. Since your individual income is below £50,000, you would be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount. (If your income were between £50,000 and £60,000, you would receive a reduced amount through the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge).

You can apply for Child Benefit using the CH2 form, which you can find on the gov.uk website. Once approved, payments are usually made every 4 weeks.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T14:35:04.760999 [actor]: That's great news! Thank you for confirming my eligibility for Child Benefit. It will definitely help with Priya's education expenses. I'll go ahead and look for the CH2 form on the gov.uk website to apply. I don't have any other questions right now.

2026-01-26T14:35:09.494818 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a parent with a 17-year-old in approved education (A-levels), correctly confirmed UK residency requirements were met, and properly assessed that the £40,000 income would qualify for full Child Benefit.
