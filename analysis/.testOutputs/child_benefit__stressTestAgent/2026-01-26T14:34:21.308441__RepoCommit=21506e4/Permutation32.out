2026-01-26T14:48:11.787721 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your eligibility according to UK government rules.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:48:13.286399 [actor]: I'll help you by assuming the role of a UK resident in the given situation to determine eligibility for Child Benefit.

Yes, I have responsibility for my son John, who is 17. He's currently living with me.

2026-01-26T14:48:14.691321 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son John is 17 and living with you, I need to ask: Is John in approved education or training? This would include full-time education such as A-levels, NVQs, or similar approved courses.

2026-01-26T14:48:16.055920 [actor]: Yes, John is attending a local college, but he's only re-sitting two GCSEs. His course involves about 6 hours of supervised study each week. The rest of the time he's mostly just at home gaming.

2026-01-26T14:48:17.426180 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to understand more about John's education status.

Is John's course considered approved education by the education authority? For Child Benefit purposes, approved education typically requires at least 12 hours per week of supervised study in qualifying education.

2026-01-26T14:48:19.239836 [actor]: No, I don't think it's considered approved education then. His college course is only 6 hours of supervised study per week for re-sitting two GCSEs. That's all the formal education he's doing right now. The rest of his time he just spends at home, mostly gaming.

2026-01-26T14:48:22.023905 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that information. Since John is 17 years old and is not in what would be considered approved education (as his course involves only 6 hours of supervised study per week, which is less than the required minimum of 12 hours per week), I need to inform you that you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for him.

Child Benefit can be paid for children under 16, or between 16 and 20 if they're in approved education or training. For education to qualify, it typically needs to involve at least 12 hours per week of supervised study.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or any other support you might be eligible for?

2026-01-26T14:48:24.744820 [actor]: I see. So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because John's course doesn't have enough supervised study hours to count as approved education. That's disappointing, but I understand. I was hoping for some financial support while he's trying to improve his GCSEs.

Do you know if there are any other benefits I might be able to claim to help support him while he's studying part-time?

2026-01-26T14:48:27.251106 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available for a 17-year-old who is only attending 6 hours of supervised study per week, as approved education requires at least 12 hours per week.
