2026-01-26T14:36:49.401578 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T14:36:51.438904 [actor]: Hello there. Yes, I do have a child, but it's a bit of a complicated situation. My son Jack is 14, but he was placed in local authority care about 3 months ago. However, he does come home to stay with me every weekend - he arrives Friday evening and leaves Sunday evening.

2026-01-26T14:36:52.989503 [root_agent]: I understand your situation with Jack. Thank you for explaining.

Since Jack has been placed in local authority care but still visits you regularly on weekends, I need to ask: Do you contribute financially to Jack's upkeep or maintenance in any way?

2026-01-26T14:36:54.618861 [actor]: Yes, I do contribute to Jack's upkeep. When he comes to stay with me on weekends, I provide his meals, clothes, and other necessities he needs while he's with me. I also buy him things he needs for school and his other activities even though he's in care during the week.

2026-01-26T14:36:56.471586 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since Jack is in local authority care but you still contribute to his upkeep during his regular weekend visits, I need to understand a bit more about the arrangement.

Are you receiving any fostering allowance or maintenance payments from the local authority regarding Jack?

2026-01-26T14:36:57.920556 [actor]: No, I don't receive any fostering allowance or maintenance payments from the local authority regarding Jack. I'm his father and I cover the expenses when he's with me from my own income.

2026-01-26T14:36:59.584360 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

To better understand your situation, could you tell me if Jack was receiving Child Benefit before he went into local authority care? If so, were you the person receiving it?

2026-01-26T14:37:01.222371 [actor]: Yes, I was receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into local authority care. I've been a single father raising him, and I was the one receiving the benefit until he went into care about 3 months ago.

2026-01-26T14:37:03.012885 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to understand if your Child Benefit payments have already stopped. Have you received any notification from HMRC about changes to your Child Benefit since Jack went into care, or are you still receiving payments?

2026-01-26T14:37:04.864093 [actor]: I'm still receiving the payments. I haven't received any notification from HMRC about changes to my Child Benefit since Jack went into care. I wasn't sure if I should still be getting them given the situation, which is why I'm checking about my eligibility now.

2026-01-26T14:37:09.278225 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

According to the UK government's rules, when a child goes into local authority care, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks. However, since you continue to contribute financially to Jack's upkeep and he regularly returns home to stay with you on weekends, you may still be eligible to receive Child Benefit.

In your specific situation, since Jack spends regular time with you (every weekend) and you continue to financially support him, you should contact HMRC's Child Benefit Office to explain your circumstances. You should inform them about Jack's current situation, including:
- That he's in local authority care
- That he stays with you every weekend
- That you continue to financially support him

They will be able to make an assessment based on your specific circumstances and advise whether you remain eligible to receive the benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?

2026-01-26T14:37:12.425426 [actor]: Actually, based on what you've told me, I think I understand my situation now. Since Jack has been in care for more than 8 weeks but regularly stays with me for two nights in a row every weekend (Friday and Saturday nights), I should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit. I'll contact HMRC's Child Benefit Office to confirm and explain my specific circumstances just to make sure everything is in order.

Thank you for your help with this. It's been quite helpful.

2026-01-26T14:37:15.411756 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that when a child goes into local authority care, Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks, but since the child regularly stays with the parent on weekends and the parent continues to provide financial support, they should contact HMRC to explain their circumstances for assessment.
