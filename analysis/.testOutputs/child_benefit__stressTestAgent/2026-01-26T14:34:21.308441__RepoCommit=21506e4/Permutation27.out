2026-01-26T14:46:05.918020 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:46:07.407364 [actor]: I'm Chloe and I'm 15 years old. I have a baby daughter named Mia. I live with my parents but I want to know if I can claim Child Benefit for my baby myself.

2026-01-26T14:46:09.285005 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context, Chloe. I'll help determine if you can claim Child Benefit for your daughter Mia.

Since you are 15 years old and have a baby daughter, I need to understand your specific situation better to determine eligibility.

Are you the main person responsible for taking care of Mia on a day-to-day basis?

2026-01-26T14:46:10.525715 [actor]: Yes, I take care of Mia myself. My parents help sometimes, but I'm her mother and I'm responsible for her daily care.

2026-01-26T14:46:14.368909 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Chloe. 

Based on the UK government's Child Benefit eligibility rules, you can indeed claim Child Benefit for your daughter Mia even though you are 15 years old. Since you are the person mainly responsible for Mia's day-to-day care, you are eligible to claim.

There are no age restrictions on who can claim Child Benefit - what matters is that you are the person mainly responsible for the child. In your case, as Mia's mother who provides her daily care, you qualify.

Would you like me to explain what Child Benefit provides and how you can apply for it?

2026-01-26T14:46:16.111512 [actor]: Yes please, I'd like to know what Child Benefit provides and how I can apply. Will claiming affect anything else? My parents currently get Child Benefit for me - will that be affected if I claim for Mia?

2026-01-26T14:46:22.373545 [root_agent]: I'll explain what Child Benefit provides, how to apply, and address your concerns about existing benefits.

Child Benefit provides:
- £25.60 per week for your first child (Mia)
- The payments are usually made every 4 weeks into your bank, building society, or credit union account

How to apply:
- Complete form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office
- You'll need to send Mia's birth certificate with your application
- As you're under 16, you may need help setting up a bank account to receive the payments

Regarding your concerns:
- Your parents' Child Benefit for you will not be affected by you claiming for Mia
- They can continue to receive Child Benefit for you until you turn 16, or up to 20 if you stay in approved education or training

One important consideration: If either you or your parents earn over £60,000 per year, the person claiming would need to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge. However, since you're 15, I assume this likely won't apply to you personally.

Is there anything specific about the application process you'd like me to explain further?

2026-01-26T14:46:24.933556 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you. I don't earn anything right now - I'm still in school. I'll talk to my parents about helping me get the CH2 form and setting up a bank account. 

So just to confirm, I am eligible to claim Child Benefit for Mia even though I'm only 15?

2026-01-26T14:46:28.717087 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. You are definitely eligible to claim Child Benefit for Mia even though you're only 15 years old. There is no minimum age requirement for claiming Child Benefit - what matters is that you are the person mainly responsible for caring for Mia on a day-to-day basis, which you've confirmed you are.

Since you're still in school and don't earn anything, you won't need to worry about the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Talking to your parents about helping you get the CH2 form and setting up a bank account is a good plan. They can help you with the paperwork and banking arrangements since these might be more challenging to navigate at 15. The Child Benefit Office will also be able to provide guidance if you have any difficulties with the application process.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T14:46:31.218629 [actor]: No, I think that answers all my questions. Thank you for confirming I'm eligible for Child Benefit for my daughter Mia even though I'm 15. I'll get help from my parents with the form and setting up a bank account.

2026-01-26T14:46:34.485079 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed the 15-year-old parent that she is eligible to claim Child Benefit for her baby as there is no minimum age requirement, only that she is the main person responsible for the child's care.
