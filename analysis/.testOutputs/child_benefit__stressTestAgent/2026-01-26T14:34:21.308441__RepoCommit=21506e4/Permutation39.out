2026-01-26T14:50:52.996702 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children or are you responsible for raising any children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T14:50:54.103615 [actor]: I have two adopted children - a 6 year old and an 8 year old. We adopted them as a sibling pair.

2026-01-26T14:50:55.236335 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. That's helpful to know. 

Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:50:56.138714 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK with my partner Helen and our two adopted children.

2026-01-26T14:50:57.713971 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK with your partner and your adopted children.

Are you or your partner subject to immigration control with a stipulation that says you cannot claim public funds?

2026-01-26T14:50:58.779199 [actor]: No, neither of us is subject to immigration control. We're both UK citizens.

2026-01-26T14:50:59.966765 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Do either you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T14:51:01.532150 [actor]: No, neither of us earns that much. We both work part-time so we can care for the children properly. They have some special needs that require extra attention.

2026-01-26T14:51:06.859839 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. 

Based on what you've told me, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You are responsible for two adopted children aged 6 and 8
2. You live in the UK
3. Neither you nor your partner is subject to immigration control
4. Neither you nor your partner earns over £60,000 per year (which would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

As adoptive parents, you have the same entitlement to Child Benefit as biological parents. Child Benefit is currently £25.60 per week for your eldest or only child, and £16.95 per week for each additional child.

You can apply for Child Benefit online or by post using form CH2, which you can find on the government website. If you haven't already applied, I would recommend doing so, as payments can only be backdated for up to 3 months from the date your application is received.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T14:51:08.572711 [actor]: That's very helpful, thank you. I should mention that we do receive an Adoption Allowance from the Local Authority because the children have special needs. Does that affect our eligibility for Child Benefit at all?

2026-01-26T14:51:12.282450 [root_agent]: Thank you for mentioning that additional information.

No, receiving an Adoption Allowance from the Local Authority because of your children's special needs does not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit. 

The Adoption Allowance is separate from Child Benefit, and they can be received concurrently. The Adoption Allowance is designed to help with the additional costs associated with caring for children with special needs, while Child Benefit is a universal benefit available to most people raising children in the UK, regardless of income or circumstances (though it may be partially or fully taxed back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge for higher earners).

You remain eligible for Child Benefit based on the information you've provided. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement?

2026-01-26T14:51:14.962698 [actor]: That's great news. I'm glad to hear we can receive both the Adoption Allowance and Child Benefit. I was worried they might be mutually exclusive, like I've heard fostering allowances can be. We'll definitely apply for the Child Benefit right away. Thank you for clarifying everything for us.

2026-01-26T14:51:17.571909 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for adoptive parents, correctly explaining that they can receive both Child Benefit and Adoption Allowance concurrently.
