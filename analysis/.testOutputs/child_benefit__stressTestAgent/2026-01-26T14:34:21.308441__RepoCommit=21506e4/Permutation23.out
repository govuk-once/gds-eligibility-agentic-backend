2026-01-26T14:43:49.917253 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T14:43:51.195657 [actor]: I have a 12-year-old daughter named Sarah, but she doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother.

2026-01-26T14:43:53.051708 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that you have a 12-year-old daughter named Sarah who lives with her mother rather than with you.

Since your child doesn't live with you, there are some specific considerations regarding Child Benefit eligibility. 

May I ask if you contribute financially to Sarah's upbringing through child maintenance payments or other financial support?

2026-01-26T14:43:54.614120 [actor]: Yes, I don't pay weekly maintenance payments, but every 4 weeks I buy a large bulk order of groceries and clothes for Sarah that costs around £120. I deliver these directly to her mother's house for Sarah's use.

2026-01-26T14:43:57.978638 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you contribute by providing groceries and clothes worth around £120 every 4 weeks directly to Sarah.

In cases where a child doesn't live with you, your eligibility for Child Benefit becomes more complex. Generally, Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with (in this case, Sarah's mother).

For someone who doesn't have main responsibility for the child, they would typically need to show they're paying at least the same amount as the weekly Child Benefit rate toward the child's upkeep, and that amount should be equal to or more than what the other person contributes.

Could I ask if Sarah's mother currently receives Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-26T14:43:59.135858 [actor]: I believe she does receive Child Benefit for Sarah. I'm not completely sure, but I think she's been claiming it since Sarah was born.

2026-01-26T14:44:02.587254 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Sarah's mother is likely already receiving Child Benefit for Sarah, and she is the person Sarah lives with, you would generally not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah.

Under UK rules, only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child. The benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with, which in this case is Sarah's mother.

While you do provide financial support through groceries and clothes, the Child Benefit would continue to go to the primary caregiver where the child resides.

If your circumstances were to change in the future - for example, if Sarah came to live with you - then you could apply for Child Benefit at that time.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other potential support available?

2026-01-26T14:44:05.160680 [actor]: I understand that I'm not eligible since Sarah lives with her mother and she already receives the Child Benefit. That makes sense. I was just wondering if I could claim anything given that I do contribute financially to Sarah's upbringing. Thank you for explaining this to me.

2026-01-26T14:44:07.383289 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is paid to the parent the child lives with (Sarah's mother) and that only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child.
