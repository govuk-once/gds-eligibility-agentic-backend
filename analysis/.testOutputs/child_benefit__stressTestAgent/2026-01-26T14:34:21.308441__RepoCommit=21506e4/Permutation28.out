2026-01-26T14:46:36.063351 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility correctly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First question: Are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:46:37.509594 [actor]: Hello there! Yes, I'm living in the UK right now with my 5-year-old son. I'm taking care of him while we're here.

2026-01-26T14:46:38.819692 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. That's helpful information.

May I ask, what is your immigration status in the UK? For example, are you a UK citizen, settled, have indefinite leave to remain, or are you on a visa?

2026-01-26T14:46:40.385613 [actor]: I'm actually from the US and I'm here on a tourist visa. It's a standard 6-month visitor visa. My son is traveling with me on his own visitor visa as well.

2026-01-26T14:46:44.132801 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared, I need to inform you that you would not be eligible for UK Child Benefit. 

To qualify for Child Benefit, you need to have the right to reside in the UK. Being on a tourist/visitor visa doesn't meet this requirement. Child Benefit is generally available to those who:
- Have settlement status in the UK
- Have indefinite leave to remain
- Are UK or Irish citizens
- Have refugee status or humanitarian protection

Additionally, tourist visas have conditions that don't allow access to public funds, which includes benefits like Child Benefit.

Is there anything else I can help clarify about this for you?

2026-01-26T14:46:46.435476 [actor]: Oh, I see. I didn't realize that my tourist visa wouldn't qualify me for Child Benefit. That makes sense though, since we're just visiting temporarily. Thank you for explaining this to me. I appreciate you taking the time to check my eligibility and explaining the requirements clearly.

2026-01-26T14:46:49.007065 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed the user that they are ineligible for Child Benefit while on a tourist visa, as visitor visas do not grant the right to reside in the UK for benefit purposes and have a "no recourse to public funds" condition.
