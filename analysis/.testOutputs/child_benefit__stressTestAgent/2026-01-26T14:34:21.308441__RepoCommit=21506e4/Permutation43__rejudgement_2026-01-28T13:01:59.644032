2026-01-28T13:09:12.781774 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that Callum's Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland makes him ineligible for Child Benefit. Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland are not considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes when the apprentice is receiving wages, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
