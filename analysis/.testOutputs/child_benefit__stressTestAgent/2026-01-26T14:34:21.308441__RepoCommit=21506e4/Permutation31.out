2026-01-26T14:47:56.651946 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess this.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T14:47:57.861770 [actor]: I'll role-play as someone inquiring about child benefit eligibility.

Yes, I have a child that I'm responsible for - my daughter Emma.

2026-01-26T14:47:58.880086 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask:

How old is your daughter Emma?

2026-01-26T14:47:59.571306 [actor]: She's 18 years old.

2026-01-26T14:48:01.199134 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to know more about your 18-year-old daughter's current situation.

Is Emma currently in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved courses.

2026-01-26T14:48:02.040569 [actor]: She's just started university - she's in her first year of a 3-year Bachelor's degree program.

2026-01-26T14:48:06.039834 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've told me, your daughter Emma is 18 years old and has started university for a Bachelor's degree program. 

I need to inform you that Child Benefit typically stops on August 31st after a child turns 16, but it can continue if they stay in approved education or training. However, university education or higher education courses do not qualify as approved education for Child Benefit purposes.

Since Emma is attending university, she is unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit can continue for children in approved education such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or certain vocational qualifications up to level 3, but not for university-level education.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available for university students?

2026-01-26T14:48:08.231464 [actor]: I see. I didn't realize that university education doesn't qualify for Child Benefit. That's disappointing. Are there any other benefits or financial support we might be eligible for since she's still living at home with me while attending university?

2026-01-26T14:48:10.166237 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit stops when a child goes to university, as higher education does not qualify as approved education for Child Benefit purposes.
