2026-01-26T14:41:54.499474 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T14:41:56.009545 [actor]: Yes, I have a daughter named Holly. She's 9 years old. She stays with me 3 days a week, and with her mother Sue the other 4 days. We're separated.

2026-01-26T14:41:58.157562 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that you have a 9-year-old daughter named Holly who stays with you for 3 days a week, while she stays with her mother Sue for 4 days a week.

To determine your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to understand a bit more about your arrangement with Sue. 

When parents are separated, typically only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child. Is Sue currently receiving Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-26T14:41:59.833344 [actor]: I'm not entirely sure if Sue is currently receiving Child Benefit for Holly. We both buy her clothes and food when she's with each of us. We've been disagreeing about who should claim the benefit. I think we might have both submitted claims to HMRC because we couldn't agree on who should receive it.

2026-01-26T14:42:03.316031 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining the situation. I understand this can be complicated when parents are separated.

When both parents submit claims for Child Benefit for the same child, HMRC will need to determine who has the main responsibility for the child. Since Holly spends 4 days with Sue and 3 days with you, Sue may be considered to have the main responsibility based on the amount of time Holly spends with each of you.

However, there are other factors HMRC considers beyond just the number of days, such as:
- Who pays for major costs (clothing, school meals, etc.)
- Who handles school matters
- Who arranges childcare
- Who pays for activities, healthcare needs, etc.

Have you and Sue tried to reach an agreement about who has the main responsibility for Holly?

2026-01-26T14:42:06.269120 [actor]: We've tried to discuss it, but we can't seem to agree. We both feel we contribute significantly to Holly's upbringing. I handle a lot of her school matters and activities when she's with me, and I pay for her clothes, food, and other needs during my time with her. Sue does the same when Holly is with her. 

The fact that she has Holly for 4 days versus my 3 days seems like a small difference to base such an important decision on. Is there any way we could share the benefit, or does it have to go to just one of us?

2026-01-26T14:42:10.286882 [root_agent]: I understand your perspective, and it's clear you both contribute significantly to Holly's upbringing.

Unfortunately, Child Benefit can only be paid to one person for a child. There isn't an option to split or share the benefit between two parents. When parents can't agree, HMRC will make a decision based on all the information available about who has the main responsibility.

Since Holly stays with Sue for 4 days and with you for 3 days, HMRC may initially consider Sue to have main responsibility. However, if you believe you have equal or greater responsibility despite the days split, you can explain your circumstances to HMRC.

If both of you have submitted claims, HMRC will likely contact both of you to gather more information before making a decision. They'll look at all aspects of Holly's care, not just where she spends more nights.

Would you like me to explain what other factors HMRC might consider in determining who has main responsibility?

2026-01-26T14:42:11.956037 [actor]: Yes, I would like to know what other factors HMRC considers beyond just the number of days. That might help me understand if I have a reasonable case. I'm also wondering if their decision can be appealed if I disagree with it.

2026-01-26T14:42:18.314613 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to explain the other factors HMRC considers when determining who has main responsibility for a child in separated families.

Beyond the number of days the child stays with each parent, HMRC looks at:

1. Who handles the majority of the child's day-to-day needs (meals, clothing, etc.)
2. Who is primarily responsible for school matters (parents' evenings, homework, etc.)
3. Who arranges and pays for childcare if needed
4. Who pays for major expenses like school trips, activities, and healthcare needs
5. Who the child's school or doctor contacts first in case of emergency
6. Who claims other benefits for the child (if applicable)
7. The overall pattern of care and who takes primary responsibility for the child's welfare

Regarding appeals, yes - if you disagree with HMRC's decision, you do have the right to appeal. You would need to:
1. First ask for a mandatory reconsideration of the decision
2. If you still disagree after the reconsideration, you can appeal to an independent tribunal

When making your case, it would help to provide evidence of your involvement in Holly's life and the responsibilities you take on, especially in the areas I've mentioned above.

Do you feel you have evidence showing your significant involvement in these aspects of Holly's life?

2026-01-26T14:42:21.920052 [actor]: Yes, I think I do have evidence of my involvement. I keep all the receipts for Holly's clothes, school supplies, and activities I pay for. I'm also very involved with her school - I attend parents' evenings and help with homework when she's with me. I take her to her swimming lessons every Saturday too.

I understand now that HMRC will look at the whole picture. If they decide Sue should get the benefit, I'll consider the appeal process you mentioned. 

So just to be clear - once HMRC makes their decision, only one of us will receive Child Benefit for Holly, is that right?

2026-01-26T14:42:25.701531 [root_agent]: That's correct. Only one person can receive Child Benefit for Holly, regardless of your shared parenting arrangement. Once HMRC makes their decision, either you or Sue will be the designated recipient.

It sounds like you have good documentation of your involvement in Holly's life, which is helpful if you need to present your case. Keeping receipts, showing your involvement in her education, and taking her to regular activities like swimming lessons are all relevant factors HMRC would consider.

If HMRC determines that Sue should receive the benefit and you disagree with this decision, you can request a mandatory reconsideration within one month of the decision. If you're still not satisfied after the reconsideration, you can then appeal to an independent tribunal.

Would you like to know anything else about how Child Benefit works in separated families, or do you have other questions about the process?

2026-01-26T14:42:28.423548 [actor]: Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I think I understand how it works now - only one of us can receive the Child Benefit, and if we can't agree, HMRC will make the decision based on all factors, not just the number of days.

I appreciate your help and will wait to see what HMRC decides based on both our claims. If needed, I'll follow the appeal process you outlined.

2026-01-26T14:42:31.597618 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility when parents are separated, explaining that only one parent can claim, typically the one with main responsibility, and correctly outlined the factors HMRC considers beyond just days spent with each parent.
