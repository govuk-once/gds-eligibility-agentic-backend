2026-01-26T14:40:50.605401 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this accurately, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T14:40:53.941258 [actor]: I'll help you by acting as a person inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

I'm Hannah, a 39-year-old UK resident whose son is currently receiving specialized medical treatment abroad.

"Yes, I have a son, Oliver. He's 14 years old, but he's not currently living with me. He has a rare medical condition and has been sent to a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I'm still in the UK, but I pay for his incidental costs and visit him whenever I can."

2026-01-26T14:40:56.051108 [root_agent]: Thank you for the information, Hannah. I understand your son Oliver is currently receiving specialized medical treatment in the USA.

For Child Benefit purposes, if a child is away from home for medical treatment, they are typically still considered as living with you.

Could you tell me if you're ordinarily resident in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:40:57.516745 [actor]: "Yes, I am ordinarily resident in the UK. I've lived here all my life and this is my permanent home. I only travel to the USA occasionally to visit Oliver at the hospital, but my home and work are here in the UK."

2026-01-26T14:40:58.782453 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're ordinarily resident in the UK, Hannah.

Is anyone else (such as Oliver's other parent) claiming Child Benefit for Oliver already?

2026-01-26T14:41:00.104854 [actor]: "No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Oliver. I'm his primary caregiver and I handle all of his financial matters. His father isn't involved in his care."

2026-01-26T14:41:01.900519 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hannah.

Since Oliver is 14 years old, I need to confirm: is he in approved education or training? This would typically mean full-time education like school or college.

2026-01-26T14:41:03.732476 [actor]: "Yes, Oliver is normally in full-time education at his school here in the UK. He's just temporarily away for this medical treatment. The hospital in the USA has actually arranged for some tutoring while he's there so he doesn't fall too far behind with his studies, but he's still enrolled in his regular school back home."

2026-01-26T14:41:06.802278 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hannah. 

Based on what you've shared, it appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. Your son Oliver is under 16 and in full-time education
2. You are ordinarily resident in the UK
3. Oliver is normally living with you (being temporarily away for medical treatment doesn't change this)
4. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

Even though Oliver is currently receiving treatment abroad, this temporary absence for medical reasons doesn't affect your eligibility. The UK government considers children who are away from home for medical treatment as still living with their parent or guardian for Child Benefit purposes.

Is there anything specific about the Child Benefit process you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-26T14:41:10.266485 [actor]: "That's a relief to hear. Thank you for confirming I'm still eligible even though Oliver is currently abroad for treatment. I was worried that since he's been gone for over 3 months now, it might affect the benefit. 

I don't have any other questions right now - I just wanted to make sure I'm still eligible while he's receiving his treatment overseas. It's good to know this won't affect the Child Benefit payments, as the extra expenses with his treatment and my visits to see him have been quite significant."

2026-01-26T14:41:12.865814 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Hannah remains eligible for Child Benefit while her child is temporarily abroad for medical treatment, as temporary absence for medical reasons doesn't affect eligibility.
