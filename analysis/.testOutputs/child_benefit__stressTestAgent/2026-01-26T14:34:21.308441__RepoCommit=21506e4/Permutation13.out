2026-01-26T14:39:37.965777 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you one question at a time to understand your situation better.

Do you have any children living with you who are under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:39:39.235278 [actor]: Yes, I have a 4-year-old girl named Maya living with me. She's been placed with us by the adoption agency, though the final adoption order hasn't been granted by the court yet.

2026-01-26T14:39:40.522894 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about Maya. I need to understand a bit more about your situation to determine your Child Benefit eligibility.

What is your relationship to Maya currently? Are you fostering her through an adoption process?

2026-01-26T14:39:42.077308 [actor]: Yes, my wife Zara and I have been approved as adopters. Maya has been placed with us by the adoption agency and has moved into our home. We're currently going through the adoption process, but the final adoption order hasn't been granted by the court yet.

2026-01-26T14:39:43.825971 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. I understand that you and your wife Zara are approved adopters and Maya is placed with you while awaiting the final adoption order.

Are you or your wife responsible for the day-to-day care of Maya? This would include things like providing meals, clothing, and other necessities.

2026-01-26T14:39:46.086838 [actor]: Yes, we are fully responsible for Maya's day-to-day care. We provide her meals, clothing, and all other necessities. She lives with us full-time now that she's been placed in our home, and we're taking care of all her needs while we wait for the adoption to be finalized.

2026-01-26T14:39:48.331931 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Maya.

Do either you or your wife have an individual income over £60,000 per year? (This affects whether you'd need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, though you could still claim the benefit.)

2026-01-26T14:39:49.357975 [actor]: No, neither of us has an individual income over £60,000 per year.

2026-01-26T14:39:53.888957 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since neither you nor your wife has an individual income over £60,000 per year, you won't need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on the information you've provided:

1. Maya is a child under 16 living with you
2. You and your wife are responsible for her day-to-day care as approved adopters
3. Maya has been placed with you by the adoption agency

You appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Maya, even though the final adoption order hasn't been granted yet. As the person responsible for the child's day-to-day care, you can claim Child Benefit during this pre-adoption period.

To make a claim, you would need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office. You'll need to include Maya's birth certificate or adoption agency documentation with your application.

Would you like me to explain anything else about Child Benefit or how to apply?

2026-01-26T14:39:56.755489 [actor]: That's great news! I'm glad to hear we can claim Child Benefit for Maya even before the adoption is finalized. We'll definitely look into filling out the CH2 form right away. Thank you for confirming our eligibility and explaining what we need to do next.

2026-01-26T14:39:59.075121 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that as approved adopters responsible for Maya's day-to-day care, they are eligible for Child Benefit even before the final adoption order is granted.
