2026-01-26T14:34:23.211442 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you who you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T14:34:24.337320 [actor]: Yes, my son Leo lives with me and my husband. He's 8 years old and we take care of him.

2026-01-26T14:34:25.743976 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand if Leo is a qualifying child.

Is Leo your biological child, adopted child, or a child you're looking after (such as a fostered child)?

2026-01-26T14:34:26.712762 [actor]: Yes, Leo is my biological son. My husband Tom and I are his parents.

2026-01-26T14:34:27.897799 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now, is Leo under 16 years old, or under 20 and in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:34:28.866009 [actor]: Yes, Leo is 8 years old and he's currently in primary school.

2026-01-26T14:34:30.163190 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Leo live with you in the UK? (By this I mean, is your home and Leo's main home in the United Kingdom?)

2026-01-26T14:34:31.218192 [actor]: Yes, we all live together in Manchester. Our home is in the UK.

2026-01-26T14:34:33.252784 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you all live together in Manchester, UK.

Do you or your husband have immigration status that would prevent you from claiming public funds in the UK? For example, are there any visa restrictions or conditions on your stay in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:34:34.328644 [actor]: No, we don't have any immigration restrictions. Both my husband and I are UK nationals.

2026-01-26T14:34:35.904411 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your immigration status.

Is your or your husband's individual income over £60,000 per year? (This is relevant for the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-26T14:34:37.236059 [actor]: No, neither of us earns that much. My husband Tom works as a teacher earning £35,000 a year, and I work part-time earning £15,000.

2026-01-26T14:34:40.770735 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your income information.

Based on the information you've provided, you are eligible for Child Benefit for your son Leo because:

1. Leo is your biological child
2. He is 8 years old (under 16)
3. He lives with you in the UK
4. You and your husband are UK nationals without immigration restrictions
5. Neither you nor your husband has an income over £60,000

Since both you and your husband earn less than £50,000 individually, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge, meaning you'll receive the full Child Benefit payment without having to pay any of it back through tax.

You can claim Child Benefit by filling out a CH2 form and sending it to the Child Benefit Office. Would you like me to provide any further information about how to claim?

2026-01-26T14:34:42.910217 [actor]: That's great news! I'm glad to hear we're eligible for Child Benefit for Leo. Yes, I would appreciate some information about how to apply using the CH2 form and where to send it. Thank you for confirming our eligibility.

2026-01-26T14:34:45.374937 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that the family is eligible for Child Benefit for their 8-year-old son Leo, correctly assessed all eligibility criteria, and provided accurate information about the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
