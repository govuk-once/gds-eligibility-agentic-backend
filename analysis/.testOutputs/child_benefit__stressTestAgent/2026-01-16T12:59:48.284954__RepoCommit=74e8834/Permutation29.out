2026-01-16T13:13:40.591782 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T13:13:42.247255 [actor]: I'll now play the role of a person asking about child benefit eligibility, following the scenario about Jordan.

2026-01-16T13:13:43.177606 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you're roleplaying as Jordan. 

To assess eligibility, let’s start with your son. How old is your son?





2026-01-16T13:13:44.157846 [actor]: no I'm Steve Jordan my son 17 years old

2026-01-16T13:13:44.979136 [root_agent]: Thank you, Steve. That's helpful.

Is your son currently in full-time education or an approved training course?

2026-01-16T13:13:45.961105 [actor]: Jordan finished school last year not doing anything now just stays home all day

2026-01-16T13:13:47.487137 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Since your son is 17 and no longer in full-time education or an approved training course, Child Benefit will generally stop at the end of the month he turns 18. 

However, there are exceptions if he has a disability. Does your son have any disabilities?





2026-01-16T13:13:48.348808 [actor]: no disabilities lazy doesn't want job or college

2026-01-16T13:13:50.138047 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Steve. As your son doesn't have a disability and isn't in education or training, Child Benefit will end when he turns 18.

Now, let's consider your own circumstances. Are you working, or do you receive any form of state pension or other benefits? (This helps determine *your* eligibility to claim, as the parent/guardian).

2026-01-16T13:13:51.177305 [actor]: work full time construction company

2026-01-16T13:13:52.297364 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Working full-time doesn't affect your eligibility to receive Child Benefit, as long as you meet the other criteria.

Finally, is your son living with you?

2026-01-16T13:13:53.171449 [actor]: yes lives with me only

2026-01-16T13:13:55.572030 [root_agent]: Okay, Steve. Based on the information you've provided:

*   You are working full-time.
*   Your son is 17, not in full-time education or training, and has no disabilities.
*   He lives with you full-time.

Currently, you *are* eligible to receive Child Benefit until your son turns 18. Once he turns 18, the payments will stop, as he isn't meeting the education/training requirements.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T13:13:56.773656 [actor]: Child benefit until 18 ok thank you

2026-01-16T13:13:59.275997 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. Child Benefit stops when a child reaches 16 years unless they continue in approved education or training, and the agent incorrectly stated eligibility would continue until age 18 for a 17-year-old not in education or training.
