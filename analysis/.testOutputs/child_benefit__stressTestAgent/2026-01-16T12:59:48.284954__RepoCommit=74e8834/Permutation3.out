2026-01-16T13:00:35.722220 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (This helps determine if you are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T13:00:36.764340 [actor]: child benefit son Ben 17 left school

2026-01-16T13:00:39.079697 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. It's helpful to know you're referring to claiming for a son named Ben who is 17 and has left school.

According to the guidelines, Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 18. However, it can continue if the young person is:

*   **Continuing in approved education or training.**

Is Ben currently in approved education or training? For example, is he studying A-Levels, an apprenticeship, or a university course?

2026-01-16T13:00:40.188533 [actor]: looking for apprenticeship not in school

2026-01-16T13:00:42.246635 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Ben has left school and is currently looking for an apprenticeship, but isn't currently *in* school or an apprenticeship.

According to the rules, Child Benefit can continue if a young person is actively seeking work, or is in approved training. However, this is usually for a limited time after leaving education.

To confirm, how long ago did Ben leave school? (Please give me an approximate date or number of months/weeks).

2026-01-16T13:00:43.267804 [actor]: june now august

2026-01-16T13:00:45.890351 [root_agent]: Okay, so Ben left school in June and it is now August – meaning it’s been roughly two months since he finished school.

Child Benefit can continue to be paid for a young person who is actively seeking work or training for up to 20 weeks after they leave approved education or training. 

Since it’s been two months (approximately 8 weeks) since Ben left school, you are still within that 20-week timeframe. 

To be certain, could you confirm Ben is actively looking for work or an apprenticeship? (e.g., applying for jobs, attending interviews, contacting employers)?

2026-01-16T13:00:46.689518 [actor]: careers service registered

2026-01-16T13:00:50.327922 [root_agent]: That’s good to know – registering with the careers service is a positive step and demonstrates active effort in seeking work.

Based on the information you’ve provided:

*   Your son Ben is 17.
*   He left school in June.
*   It is now August (approximately 8 weeks since leaving school).
*   He is actively seeking an apprenticeship and is registered with the careers service.

It *appears* you are likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Ben, as he is within the 20-week timeframe for actively seeking work or training after leaving school.

However, it's important to note that HMRC (the organisation that pays Child Benefit) may require evidence to support his continued eligibility.

Would you like me to summarise this information, or is there anything else I can help you with?





2026-01-16T13:00:51.204418 [actor]: Yes my son is registered careers service

2026-01-16T13:00:54.381349 [root_agent]: Great! Just to confirm, so I have everything clear - you've confirmed your son *is* registered with the careers service, which supports his active search for an apprenticeship.

Based on all the information you’ve provided, it seems you *should* be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for your son. As long as he continues to actively seek work or an apprenticeship, and remains under 20 weeks since leaving school, you should be fine.

While I can offer this assessment based on the provided rules, HMRC makes the final decision. It’s a good idea to keep a record of his job search activities, in case they ask for evidence.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit or anything else related to this?

2026-01-16T13:00:58.163908 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a 17-year-old who left school in June, is actively seeking an apprenticeship, and is registered with careers service - correctly noting eligibility continues for up to 20 weeks after leaving education.
