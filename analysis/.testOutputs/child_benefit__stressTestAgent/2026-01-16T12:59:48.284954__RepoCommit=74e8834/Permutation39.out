2026-01-16T13:17:45.225699 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).



**My thought process:**

I need to establish who "you" are in relation to a child to begin assessing eligibility. The rules focus on parents or guardians. Asking age is a neutral starting point and doesn't immediately reveal sensitive information. I’m adhering to the 'one question at a time' rule and being polite. I will cross-reference answers with the provided Gov.UK links as we proceed.

2026-01-16T13:17:46.332134 [actor]: Adopted children special needs receive local authority money

2026-01-16T13:17:49.106594 [root_agent]: Thank you for the extra information. To clarify, are *you* the parent or legal guardian of a child, or are you asking on behalf of someone else?



**My thought process:**

The previous response about adopted children and local authority funding is relevant background, but doesn’t directly answer my initial question about *who* I’m assessing eligibility *for*. It’s essential to confirm if “you” are the claimant (parent/guardian) or if this is about someone else’s situation. This clarifies the perspective for applying the eligibility criteria from the provided links. I'm keeping the questioning focused on the person I'm conversing with – as per the instructions.

2026-01-16T13:17:49.976127 [actor]: We adopted two children with special needs

2026-01-16T13:17:52.900706 [root_agent]: That's good to know, thank you. To assess potential eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please confirm if both of the children you adopted currently live with you?

**My thought process:**

Now I understand "you" are a parent/guardian through adoption. The children having special needs is noted (relevant if hospital/care considerations arise later), but the primary eligibility factor is residency. The provided link [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility) states the child must live with the claimant. I am focusing on gaining factual information to compare with the defined criteria.

2026-01-16T13:17:53.660160 [actor]: Sibling pair both live with us yes

2026-01-16T13:17:56.658255 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that both children live with you. Could you please tell me your date of birth?

**My thought process:**

The children living with the claimant is a key positive factor for eligibility. Now I need to assess the parent/guardian's eligibility. The Gov.UK guidance ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)) outlines requirements related to the claimant's National Insurance number and earnings, which are often tied to age and work history. Asking for the date of birth is a discreet way to start checking these aspects. I'm maintaining the 'one question at a time' approach.

2026-01-16T13:17:57.465525 [actor]: Born 1979 April

2026-01-16T13:18:00.606823 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently employed or self-employed, and earning over £120 a week (before tax)?

**My thought process:**

Knowing the date of birth (born 1979 April) allows me to estimate the claimant’s age – approximately 45 years old. The crucial next step is to determine if they meet the earnings threshold. The Gov.UK link ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)) clearly states an earnings requirement for the main claimant. I’m specifically asking about employment *and* earnings to cover both employed and self-employed scenarios. I’m continuing to avoid multiple questions at once.

2026-01-16T13:18:01.734500 [actor]: Part time work teaching. £400 weekly.

2026-01-16T13:18:04.115182 [root_agent]: That's very helpful, thank you. Do you have a valid National Insurance number?

**My thought process:**

The claimant earns £400 weekly, which is well above the £120 threshold. This is a positive indicator for eligibility. Now, I need to verify they have a valid National Insurance number, as this is a fundamental requirement (stated in [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)). I am keeping the question focused and straightforward.

2026-01-16T13:18:04.951807 [actor]: Yes got NI number

2026-01-16T13:18:09.162809 [root_agent]: Great. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you are the adoptive parent of two children who live with you, were born in 1979, earn over £120 a week, and have a National Insurance number – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

However, to be completely certain, it's best to officially check using the online tool or by contacting HMRC directly. Would you like me to summarise the key points we’ve covered?

**My thought process:**

All the key criteria appear to be met: parental relationship (through adoption), child residency, sufficient earnings, and a National Insurance number. I am providing a *likely* eligibility assessment, but crucially including a disclaimer and suggesting official verification. This is important because I am an AI and cannot provide definitive legal or financial advice. Summarising the points offers a final check with the user, ensuring we haven’t missed anything. I am adhering to the guidance by not providing direct links to the tool, but implying its existence.

2026-01-16T13:18:12.341838 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly assessed that as an adoptive parent of two children living with me, earning £400 weekly, and having a National Insurance number, I am eligible for Child Benefit.
