2026-01-16T13:00:59.398644 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T13:01:00.501635 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility.

My daughter Sofia money help

2026-01-16T13:01:01.492755 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. It sounds like you are asking about Child Benefit for your daughter, Sofia. 

To begin assessing eligibility, could you please tell me how old Sofia is?

2026-01-16T13:01:02.300182 [actor]: Sofia 18 years old

2026-01-16T13:01:03.963102 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. According to the rules, generally Child Benefit stops when a child turns 18. However, there are exceptions if your daughter is:

*   continuing in full-time education
*   an approved apprenticeship
*   volunteering

Is Sofia currently in full-time education, undertaking an approved apprenticeship, or volunteering?

2026-01-16T13:01:04.883240 [actor]: work job receptionist 30 hours

2026-01-16T13:01:06.710623 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. As Sofia is 18 years old and working 30 hours a week as a receptionist, she is no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit typically ends when a young person reaches 18 and is no longer in full-time education or approved training.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on other benefits you might be eligible for?

2026-01-16T13:01:10.435689 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent was right that Child Benefit stops when a child turns 18 unless they are in full-time education, an approved apprenticeship, or certain types of training, which doesn't apply here as Sofia is working 30 hours per week as a receptionist.
