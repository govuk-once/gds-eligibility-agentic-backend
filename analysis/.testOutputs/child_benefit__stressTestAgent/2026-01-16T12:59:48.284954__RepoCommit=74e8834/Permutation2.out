2026-01-16T13:00:18.592119 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is? (or how old *are* your children, if you have more than one)

2026-01-16T13:00:20.666387 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility based on the provided context. I'll be playing the role of Amit, a 45-year-old single father with a 17-year-old daughter named Priya who is studying A-levels.

2026-01-16T13:00:22.029552 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. So, your daughter Priya is 17 years old and a student in further education – specifically, studying A-levels. That's helpful!

To confirm, is Priya currently living with you?

2026-01-16T13:00:22.817617 [actor]: live together london

2026-01-16T13:00:23.983179 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. So Priya lives with you in London. 

To help me understand your situation a bit better, could you tell me about your own employment status? Are you currently employed, self-employed, or not currently working?

2026-01-16T13:00:24.871692 [actor]: full-time job income 40000

2026-01-16T13:00:26.217638 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you have a full-time job with an income of £40,000.

Now, just to be completely sure, is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Priya? For example, does her mother contribute financially and claim it, or another family member?

2026-01-16T13:00:27.157225 [actor]: single dad only me

2026-01-16T13:00:30.377603 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s clear – you are the only parent claiming or intending to claim for Priya.

Based on the information you've provided – you are employed with an income of £40,000, Priya is 17 and studying A-levels, and lives with you – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

However, Child Benefit can be affected by your income. As your income is £40,000, you may be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge. This means you might have to pay some or all of the Child Benefit back in your Self Assessment tax return.

Would you like me to explain the High Income Child Benefit Charge in more detail, or are you happy with this initial assessment?

2026-01-16T13:00:34.424164 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that with a 17-year-old daughter in further education (A-levels), living with the parent, the user is eligible for Child Benefit, but may be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge due to the £40,000 income.
