2026-01-16T13:09:15.260153 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (Child Benefit eligibility depends on your age).



**My Thoughts:**

I am starting with age as a primary eligibility factor. The rules state you must be responsible for a child to claim, and your age impacts whether *you* specifically are eligible – specifically, being under 20, or meeting certain educational requirements if over 20. I'm focusing on the person *asking* about eligibility first, as the prompt specifies.

2026-01-16T13:09:16.440768 [actor]: I'll roleplay a user in this scenario about child benefit eligibility.

old woman raising granddaughter need money

2026-01-16T13:09:19.665819 [root_agent]: Hello! Thank you for providing that context. It's wonderful that you are caring for your granddaughter.

To help me understand your situation and assess eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please tell me your age? Knowing your age will help me determine if any additional criteria apply.



**My Thoughts:**

The user is clarifying they are roleplaying as an older woman raising her granddaughter. This is helpful context! I'm still starting with age, as it's a fundamental eligibility criterion, but I'm now mindful that the 'educational requirements' that apply to over-20s likely won't be relevant. I am focusing on *her* age, as she is the one claiming.

2026-01-16T13:09:20.689947 [actor]: 60 raising 14 year old girl parents gone

2026-01-16T13:09:23.200407 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's good to know.

Now, is this 14-year-old girl living with you permanently?



**My Thoughts:**

Okay, the user is 60 and raising a 14-year-old granddaughter whose parents are no longer in the picture. Being over 20 removes the educational requirements. The key now is establishing the living arrangement – the child needs to be living *with* the claimant to be eligible. I’m referencing the core eligibility criteria and the 'child lives with someone else’ guidance.

2026-01-16T13:09:23.993269 [actor]: yes she lives with me all the time

2026-01-16T13:09:26.067445 [root_agent]: That's good to hear.

Are you currently employed, and if so, how many hours per week do you typically work?



**My Thoughts:**

The child living with the claimant permanently is a key eligibility factor established. Now I need to determine if income affects eligibility. While Child Benefit isn't *means-tested* in the traditional sense, high income can affect the rate through the High Income Child Benefit Charge. Knowing her working hours will help me potentially flag this.

2026-01-16T13:09:26.937066 [actor]: retired no work pension only

2026-01-16T13:09:29.767002 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Since you are retired and receive a pension, that simplifies things. 

Just to confirm, are you this child's legal guardian, or do you have formal care arrangements in place?



**My Thoughts:**

Okay, no income from work means the High Income Child Benefit Charge doesn't apply. Now, I need to assess if the claimant has the legal right to claim for the child. Legal guardianship or formal care arrangements establish this. The gov.uk guidance doesn’t explicitly require this *for grandparents*, but it's a good check to ensure the claim would be valid. I’m referencing the core eligibility criteria.

2026-01-16T13:09:30.644807 [actor]: no papers just look after her since parents left

2026-01-16T13:09:35.175121 [root_agent]: Thank you for being honest about that. While formal papers aren’t always necessary, it can sometimes make the process smoother.

Given the circumstances – you are over 60, the 14-year-old lives with you full-time, and you are providing her care following the departure of her parents – you *appear* to be eligible for Child Benefit. However, because you don’t have formal guardianship, it is possible HMRC may request further information to confirm the care arrangements.

Would you like me to summarise the key things you might need to have ready when you apply?



**My Thoughts:**

This is a slightly grey area. While the core eligibility criteria (age of claimant, child living with claimant) are met, the lack of formal guardianship *could* raise questions from HMRC. However, grandparents are frequently in this position. I’m phrasing the response carefully as “appear to be eligible” and offering to summarise application requirements to be helpful, and to prepare the user for potential additional requests. I'm not guaranteeing eligibility but indicating a high likelihood. I'm also avoiding giving legal advice.

2026-01-16T13:09:36.098715 [actor]: so i can get money for lucia? how much

2026-01-16T13:09:40.377151 [root_agent]: Yes, you could be able to get money to help with the costs of raising Lucia.

As of the 2024/2025 tax year, the full weekly rate of Child Benefit is £24.00 for your first child. Because Lucia is your only child, you would receive this full amount.

However, please be aware that Child Benefit is paid every four weeks, so you wouldn’t receive exactly £24.00 per week. It’s paid in three-weekly installments followed by a four-weekly installment.



**My Thoughts:**

The user wants to know about the amount. I’m providing the current (2024/2025) full rate and clarifying that it’s paid four-weekly, not weekly, to avoid confusion. I’m assuming Lucia is the first child, as that wasn’t specified otherwise. I avoided giving a precise four-weekly amount, as that would require calculation and could become outdated.

2026-01-16T13:09:43.860053 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a grandparent raising a 14-year-old child who lives with them full-time, and correctly stated the current rate.
