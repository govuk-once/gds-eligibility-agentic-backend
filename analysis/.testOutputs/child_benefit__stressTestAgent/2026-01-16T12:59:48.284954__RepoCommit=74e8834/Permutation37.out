2026-01-16T13:16:47.046948 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the person claiming for a child, or are a young person potentially eligible yourself).

2026-01-16T13:16:48.823756 [actor]: I'll help by roleplaying as a user trying to determine eligibility for child benefit, responding to the agent's question. Following the instructions to be obtuse and respond like search queries:

child benefit nina living with me not my child

2026-01-16T13:16:50.535026 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. It sounds like Nina lives with you, but isn't your child. 

To clarify, are you Nina’s parent, or do you have parental responsibility for her? Or are you someone else, like a grandparent or other family member, who is mainly looking after her? Knowing this will help me understand the situation better.





2026-01-16T13:16:51.464221 [actor]: nina friend daughter illness living with me temporary arrangement council knows

2026-01-16T13:16:53.079855 [root_agent]: Thank you for the extra details. So Nina is a friend's daughter, she's living with you temporarily due to illness, and the council is aware of the arrangement.

To help me assess eligibility, could you tell me how long Nina has been living with you, and how long is this arrangement expected to last? Knowing the duration is important.

2026-01-16T13:16:54.281279 [actor]: mother illness serious nina ten years old living with me months more local authority notified private fostering arrangement

2026-01-16T13:16:56.108305 [root_agent]: Okay, so Nina is 10 years old, her mother is seriously ill, she’s been living with you for several months, and this is a private fostering arrangement that the local authority has been notified about. 

To clarify, are you claiming Child Benefit *for* Nina, or are you asking on behalf of Nina’s mother? Establishing who is claiming is important for eligibility.

2026-01-16T13:16:57.282912 [actor]: caring for nina mother friend too ill money my own council not paying me fostering allowance

2026-01-16T13:17:00.047066 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. You are caring for Nina, her mother is your friend and is too ill to care for her, you are using your own money to support Nina, and you’re not receiving a fostering allowance from the council.

Given this information, and based on the rules around Child Benefit, it seems likely you *may* be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina, as you are providing care for her and she isn't living with her parent due to their illness. However, parental responsibility is a key factor. 

Do you have legal parental responsibility for Nina, or has her mother formally transferred parental responsibility to you?

2026-01-16T13:17:01.430730 [actor]: not legal responsibility just private arrangement mother knows council informed no money from government for nina care

2026-01-16T13:17:04.109431 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you don’t have legal parental responsibility for Nina, and this is a private arrangement with her mother’s knowledge and the council’s awareness. You are also not receiving any government funding for her care.

According to the guidance, even without legal parental responsibility, you *can* claim Child Benefit for a child if you are the main person caring for them. However, there are conditions. Specifically, Nina’s mother must not be receiving Child Benefit for her.

Could you confirm whether Nina’s mother is currently claiming Child Benefit for her? It’s important to know this to determine your eligibility.

2026-01-16T13:17:05.285522 [actor]: mother stopped claiming benefits when nina came to me nobody claiming now supporting nina myself private fostering

2026-01-16T13:17:09.299872 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful. Her mother stopped claiming benefits when Nina came to live with you, and currently, no one is claiming Child Benefit for Nina, and you are supporting her financially under this private fostering arrangement.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you *are* likely eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina. You are the main carer, she isn’t living with her parent, her mother isn’t claiming, and it's a temporary arrangement due to her mother’s illness.

However, to be absolutely certain, you might want to double-check the specific details on the government website: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else).

Would you like me to summarise the key reasons why you appear eligible? Or is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T13:17:12.322796 [actor]: I see that I'm eligible for child benefit since I'm caring for Nina in a private fostering arrangement. Nobody claiming now, mother stopped benefits when nina moved in with me. Thank you for the information.

2026-01-16T13:17:14.325806 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that in a private fostering arrangement where the person is the main carer, no one else is claiming benefits for the child, and the arrangement is known to authorities, they are eligible for Child Benefit.
