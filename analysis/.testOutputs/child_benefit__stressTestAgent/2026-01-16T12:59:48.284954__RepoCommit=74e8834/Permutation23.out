2026-01-16T13:10:38.374065 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (I need to assess *your* eligibility, not the child's.)

2026-01-16T13:10:39.966224 [actor]: I'll play the role of a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility. I'll follow the instructions to be obtuse, speak like I'm using search terms, and not directly answer questions.

Kevin child benefit daughter Sarah

2026-01-16T13:10:41.733114 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. And thank you for the name – Kevin.

To clarify, are you Kevin, and are you applying for Child Benefit in relation to your daughter, Sarah? 

To begin assessing eligibility, could you please tell me your National Insurance number? (You don't have to provide it if you prefer not to, but it will help me understand your eligibility.)

2026-01-16T13:10:42.864939 [actor]: National Insurance number private information daughter Sarah 12 years old

2026-01-16T13:10:44.720297 [root_agent]: You are right to be cautious about sharing your National Insurance number, and I understand your concern about private information. That's perfectly alright – you don’t *have* to provide it.

Okay, so your daughter Sarah is 12 years old. That’s helpful. 

Now, to assess your eligibility, could you tell me if you are employed, self-employed, or not currently working?

2026-01-16T13:10:45.702869 [actor]: work full time factory fifty years old

2026-01-16T13:10:47.166570 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you work full-time in a factory, and you are 50 years old.

To clarify, are you married to or in a civil partnership with Sarah’s other parent? Or are you Sarah’s sole carer?

2026-01-16T13:10:48.101142 [actor]: not married daughter lives with mother buy groceries clothes

2026-01-16T13:10:50.169757 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So you are not married to Sarah’s mother, and Sarah primarily lives with her mother. You contribute by buying groceries and clothes.

Given this information, it seems Sarah is living primarily with her mother. Generally, Child Benefit is paid to the person who is mainly looking after the child. 

To be certain, roughly how many days a week does Sarah live with you?

2026-01-16T13:10:51.220634 [actor]: not live with daughter buy groceries clothes £120 every four weeks deliver to mother

2026-01-16T13:10:53.852999 [root_agent]: Thank you for the clarification. So Sarah doesn’t live with you at all, and you provide financial support of £120 every four weeks, delivered to her mother.

Based on the information provided, and according to the guidelines, it’s unlikely you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit. Child Benefit is usually paid to the person who is primarily responsible for the child's care. As Sarah lives with her mother and you provide financial support, the mother would generally be the one eligible to claim.

Would you like me to double-check anything, or clarify any part of this?

2026-01-16T13:10:57.646956 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is usually paid to the person primarily caring for the child, which in this case is Sarah's mother, not Kevin who only provides financial support.
