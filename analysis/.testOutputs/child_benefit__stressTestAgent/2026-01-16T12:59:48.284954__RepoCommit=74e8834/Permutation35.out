2026-01-16T13:16:02.567850 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T13:16:03.990921 [actor]: I need to help you determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, but I'll need to ask you questions as if I'm a user seeking this information, following the role provided.

benefit child

2026-01-16T13:16:05.482025 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for the clarification! My apologies, I misunderstood. I need to ask *as if I am the parent/guardian* seeking information.

Right then... I think I might be eligible for Child Benefit, but I'm not sure. First off, how old is the child you might be claiming for?

2026-01-16T13:16:06.399174 [actor]: son 17 school A levels

2026-01-16T13:16:07.530267 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful. A 17-year-old son studying A-Levels.

Now, is this child dependent on you financially? In other words, do you provide them with the majority of their financial support?

2026-01-16T13:16:08.289360 [actor]: yes father house

2026-01-16T13:16:10.050377 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you are the father and live with your son, and you financially support him.

Are you working, or do you have any income from self-employment? If so, roughly how much do you earn *per week* before tax? Don't worry about being exact, an estimate is fine. This is because there’s an earnings limit that can affect eligibility.

2026-01-16T13:16:10.876779 [actor]: working normal job not important

2026-01-16T13:16:12.262751 [root_agent]: Okay, you're working a normal job. It *is* important, though, as earnings can affect eligibility, even if it's not a large amount.

To be certain, could you tell me if your gross weekly income (before tax and National Insurance) is more than £500?

2026-01-16T13:16:13.087097 [actor]: no worry about money just eligibility

2026-01-16T13:16:15.378224 [root_agent]: I understand you're not worried about the money, just the eligibility – thank you for clarifying. It's good to be sure!

Given the information so far – your son is 17, studying A-Levels, financially dependent on you, and your income is under £500 per week – it *looks* like you would be eligible for Child Benefit. However, to be absolutely certain, I need to ask one more question.

Are you responsible for your son’s care and upbringing?

2026-01-16T13:16:16.657480 [actor]: yes my son lives with me 

no wait he got married

2026-01-16T13:16:19.051941 [root_agent]: Oh, that changes things! Thank you for letting me know.

Because your son is 17 *and* is married, he is no longer eligible for Child Benefit, regardless of whether he is in full-time education. Marriage generally ends a child’s eligibility, even if they are still dependent.

I apologise for the initial assessment - the change in circumstances is significant.

2026-01-16T13:16:22.383198 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that a 17-year-old who is married is not eligible for Child Benefit, even though they are in full-time education.
