2026-01-29T12:56:58.754308 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine whether you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To get started, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:57:00.755110 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. I have a son, Ryan, he's 17. I'm responsible for him and he lives at home with me.

2026-01-29T12:57:03.970647 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know you have a 17-year-old son named Ryan living with you.

Since Ryan is 17 (over 16 but under 20), my next question is:

**Is Ryan currently in approved education or training?** 

This could include things like:
- A-levels or Scottish Highers
- T-levels
- NVQs up to level 3
- Home education (if it started before he turned 16)
- Certain types of training courses

2026-01-29T12:57:06.175009 [actor]: Yes, he's in training. He's just started an Intermediate Apprenticeship - it's government-funded. He left school and only just began it.

2026-01-29T12:57:08.920108 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail about Ryan's Intermediate Apprenticeship.

Let me ask an important follow-up question:

**Is Ryan receiving any payment or salary as part of his Intermediate Apprenticeship?**

The reason I ask is that apprenticeships can be different from other types of approved education or training when it comes to Child Benefit eligibility, and whether he's being paid can affect this.

2026-01-29T12:57:10.898241 [actor]: Yes, he is getting paid. He gets an apprentice wage - it's not much, but he does receive a salary as part of the apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T12:57:15.542065 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Ryan receives a salary as part of his apprenticeship.

Unfortunately, this is an important factor. **Paid apprenticeships typically don't count as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.** Since Ryan is 17 (over 16) and is doing a paid apprenticeship rather than unpaid education or training, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for him.

Child Benefit for young people aged 16-19 generally applies when they're in full-time non-advanced education (like A-levels) or unpaid approved training, but paid apprenticeships fall outside this criteria.

However, before I give you a final answer, let me ask one more question to be thorough:

**Do you have any other children under 16, or any other children aged 16-19 who are in full-time non-advanced education or unpaid approved training?**

2026-01-29T12:57:17.025485 [actor]: No, Ryan is my only child. It's just the two of us.

2026-01-29T12:57:20.642056 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Ryan is your only child.

Based on the information you've provided, **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** at this time. Here's why:

- Ryan is 17 years old (over the age of 16)
- He is in a paid Intermediate Apprenticeship
- Paid apprenticeships do not count as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes
- Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds only applies when they're in full-time non-advanced education (like A-levels or similar) or unpaid approved training

**Important note:** If Ryan's circumstances change in the future - for example, if he were to leave his apprenticeship and enter full-time non-advanced education before turning 20 - you could potentially become eligible at that point and should reapply.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T12:57:24.415833 [actor]: No, that's clear. Thank you for explaining it to me. I understand now that because Ryan is doing a paid apprenticeship, I'm not eligible. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T12:57:26.672975 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that paid apprenticeships do not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes for young people aged 16-19, and correctly concluded that the claimant is not eligible since Ryan (17) is in a paid Intermediate Apprenticeship and is their only child.
