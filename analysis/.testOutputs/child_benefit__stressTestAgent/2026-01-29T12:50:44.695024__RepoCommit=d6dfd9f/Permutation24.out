2026-01-29T13:04:59.266844 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T13:05:01.142608 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Tom, who's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T13:05:02.745594 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Does Tom normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T13:05:04.724694 [actor]: Well, he did until recently. He's moved into a residential school because of his severe behavioral needs. The local council is paying for it. He's been there for 10 weeks now.

2026-01-29T13:05:06.971527 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. This is an important detail for determining your eligibility.

**Does Tom come home to stay with you during school holidays or on some weekends?**

2026-01-29T13:05:08.911218 [actor]: Yes, he does come home during the school holidays and some weekends.

2026-01-29T13:05:10.357511 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Tom?**

2026-01-29T13:05:11.909451 [actor]: Yes, I am currently receiving Child Benefit for Tom.

2026-01-29T13:05:14.269349 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, let me ask one more important question:

**Is the local authority (council) paying the full cost of Tom's accommodation and maintenance at the residential school, or are you contributing toward these costs?**

2026-01-29T13:05:15.958278 [actor]: The local authority is paying the full cost - I'm not contributing anything towards it.

2026-01-29T13:05:21.286029 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you of an important rule regarding Child Benefit eligibility:

**You are no longer eligible to receive Child Benefit for Tom.**

Here's why: When a child is in residential care or accommodation for more than 8 weeks, and the local authority is paying the full cost of their accommodation and maintenance, Child Benefit stops being payable from the Monday following the 8th week.

Since Tom has been at the residential school for 10 weeks and the local council is paying the full cost, your Child Benefit entitlement would have stopped after the 8-week period.

**What you should do:**
You need to contact the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible to inform them of Tom's situation. They will need to know:
- When Tom moved into residential care
- That the local authority is paying the full cost

This will prevent any overpayment that you might have to pay back later.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?

2026-01-29T13:05:27.013296 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that Child Benefit stops "from the Monday following the 8th week," meaning eligibility ends after week 8. However, according to the government guidance, Child Benefit continues to be payable until the end of week 12 when a child is in residential care funded by the local authority. Since the child has been there for 10 weeks, the parent should still be eligible for Child Benefit until week 12.
