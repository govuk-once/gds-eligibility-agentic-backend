2026-01-29T12:57:29.290201 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T12:57:31.046081 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have an 18-year-old son who's studying for his A-levels. He lives with me.

2026-01-29T12:57:33.124752 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for your son? This means you live with him and you're the one who pays for things like his food, clothes, and other living costs.

2026-01-29T12:57:34.781143 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for him. He lives with me and I pay for his food, clothes, and all his living costs.

2026-01-29T12:57:36.667151 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask: Do you normally live in the UK? This is an important requirement for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-29T12:57:38.082531 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I'm a UK resident.

2026-01-29T12:57:39.989342 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for your son? 

This is important because only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child.

2026-01-29T12:57:41.916596 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for him. It's just me looking after him.

2026-01-29T12:57:46.825112 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. ✓ You have an 18-year-old son who is under 20 years old
2. ✓ He is in approved education (studying for his A-levels)
3. ✓ You are responsible for him - he lives with you and you pay for his living costs
4. ✓ You normally live in the UK
5. ✓ Nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for him

You meet the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. You should be able to make a claim.

Just one thing to be aware of: if you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 a year, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means you would have to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through your tax return. However, this doesn't affect your eligibility to claim - you can still claim even if you're subject to this charge.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:57:48.624378 [actor]: Oh, I should mention - my son has been claiming Universal Credit in his own right to help with his personal living costs. Does that affect anything?

2026-01-29T12:57:51.370551 [root_agent]: That's an important detail to mention, thank you.

Let me ask you a clarifying question: Even though your son is claiming Universal Credit in his own right, does he still live with you in your household, and are you still the main person responsible for providing for him (such as paying for his accommodation, food, and other living costs)?

This helps me understand whether you still meet the "responsible for" requirement for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-29T12:57:53.981945 [actor]: Yes, he definitely still lives with me in my household. I'm still the main person providing for him - I pay for the accommodation, his food, and all his other living costs. He's using the Universal Credit for his own personal expenses, but I'm covering everything else.

2026-01-29T12:57:57.788173 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on this additional information, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit. The key factors remain:

1. ✓ Your son lives with you in your household
2. ✓ You are the main person responsible for him and paying for his accommodation, food, and living costs
3. ✓ He's under 20 and in approved education (A-levels)
4. ✓ You live in the UK
5. ✓ Nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for him

The fact that your son is claiming Universal Credit for his own personal expenses doesn't automatically disqualify you from claiming Child Benefit, as long as you remain the person responsible for him and he continues to live with you.

However, I should note that the interaction between Universal Credit and Child Benefit can be complex. You should be aware that when you claim Child Benefit, it may affect your son's Universal Credit entitlement, as household circumstances can impact Universal Credit calculations.

Does this answer your question about eligibility, or is there anything else you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T12:58:01.253830 [actor]: That makes sense, thank you. So I am eligible to claim then. I appreciate your help with this.

2026-01-29T12:58:03.575668 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, a young person aged 16-19 is NOT eligible for Child Benefit if they are claiming Universal Credit or certain other benefits in their own right, regardless of living arrangements or who provides their care.
