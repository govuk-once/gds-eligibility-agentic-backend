2026-01-29T12:51:17.197768 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T12:51:19.050186 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter who lives with me.

2026-01-29T12:51:20.623383 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

How old is your daughter?

2026-01-29T12:51:22.075406 [actor]: She's 17 years old.

2026-01-29T12:51:23.976822 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Is your daughter still in full-time non-advanced education or approved training?

2026-01-29T12:51:25.695981 [actor]: Yes, she is. She's studying full-time for her A-levels at a local sixth-form college.

2026-01-29T12:51:27.590515 [root_agent]: That's great, thank you for confirming that.

Now, are you the person who is primarily responsible for your daughter? In other words, do you have main responsibility for her day-to-day care?

2026-01-29T12:51:29.184747 [actor]: Yes, I am. She lives with me and I'm responsible for her day-to-day care. I'm a single father.

2026-01-29T12:51:30.938375 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Do you or your daughter usually live in the UK?

2026-01-29T12:51:32.485354 [actor]: Yes, we both live in London.

2026-01-29T12:51:35.000843 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

One final question: do you have what's called the "right to reside" in the UK? This typically means you're a UK citizen, have settled status, or have certain immigration permissions that allow you to access public funds.

2026-01-29T12:51:36.520447 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK resident and have the right to reside here.

2026-01-29T12:51:41.137059 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. 

Here's why:
- You have a child (your 17-year-old daughter) who you're responsible for
- She lives with you and you have main responsibility for her day-to-day care
- She's under 20 years old and in full-time approved non-advanced education (A-levels)
- You both live in the UK
- You have the right to reside in the UK

You meet the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. However, please be aware that:
- Child Benefit is usually paid until a child turns 16, or up to age 20 if they stay in approved education or training
- There may be tax implications if you or your partner earn over £50,000 per year (known as the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for your daughter. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T12:51:43.482912 [actor]: No, that's very helpful, thank you. I earn £40,000, so it sounds like I won't have to worry about that tax charge. I appreciate your help!

2026-01-29T12:51:48.746907 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria (child under 20 in approved education, UK residence, right to reside, primary responsibility) and correctly concluded eligibility for Child Benefit, while also appropriately mentioning the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
