2026-01-29T12:54:28.390038 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T12:54:29.858458 [actor]: Yes, I do. My son Jack is 14 years old.

2026-01-29T12:54:32.085428 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Are you responsible for Jack? This means do you live with him and are you the person who is mainly responsible for looking after him?**

2026-01-29T12:54:34.066254 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. Jack was placed in local authority care about 3 months ago, but he comes home to stay with me every weekend - he arrives Friday evening and leaves Sunday evening. So I'm responsible for him during those times.

2026-01-29T12:54:36.268335 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that situation. This is an important detail.

Let me ask you a follow-up question to understand this better:

**During the weekdays when Jack is in local authority care, does the local authority receive any payments or allowances for looking after him?**

2026-01-29T12:54:37.834767 [actor]: Yes, the local authority does receive payments for looking after Jack during the week while he's in their care.

2026-01-29T12:54:39.966203 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now I need to ask:

**Has the local authority been looking after Jack for more than 8 weeks continuously (even though he comes home on weekends)?**

This is important because there are specific rules about Child Benefit when a child is in local authority care for extended periods.

2026-01-29T12:54:41.860995 [actor]: Yes, it's been about 3 months now, so that's more than 8 weeks that he's been in their care.

2026-01-29T12:54:45.583261 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that **you are not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation**.

Here's why:

When a child has been looked after by a local authority for more than 8 weeks, and the local authority is receiving payments or allowances for the child's care, Child Benefit stops being payable. This applies even though Jack comes home to you on weekends.

The 8-week period is counted continuously from when Jack entered local authority care, regardless of weekend visits home.

**However**, if Jack's care arrangement changes in the future - for example, if he returns to live with you full-time - you would be able to claim Child Benefit again at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T12:54:51.038565 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, when a child in care comes home regularly (such as every weekend), the parent may still be entitled to Child Benefit as an exception to the 8-week rule, making this an "Eligible (via Exception)" case rather than ineligible.
