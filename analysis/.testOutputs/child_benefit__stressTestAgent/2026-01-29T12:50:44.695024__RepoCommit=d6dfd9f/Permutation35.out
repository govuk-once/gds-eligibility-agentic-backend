2026-01-29T13:11:27.716092 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T13:11:29.482875 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. I have a 17-year-old son who is currently doing his A-Levels, so he's in full-time education.

2026-01-29T13:11:32.509788 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your 17-year-old son who is doing A-Levels would potentially qualify since he's under 20 and in approved education.

Now, my next question:

**Does your son live with you, or if not, do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards his upkeep?**

2026-01-29T13:11:34.444721 [actor]: Yes, he lives with us - with me and my wife. He still lives at home in our house.

2026-01-29T13:11:36.363783 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Next question:

**Are you or your partner already claiming Child Benefit for your son, or is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-29T13:11:38.168740 [actor]: No, nobody is currently claiming Child Benefit for him. That's why I'm asking - I want to start claiming for him.

2026-01-29T13:11:40.220422 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

My next question:

**Are you and your son both living in the UK currently?**

2026-01-29T13:11:41.623206 [actor]: Yes, we're both living in the UK.

2026-01-29T13:11:44.698081 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you.

Now, one more important question:

**Do you have immigration or nationality restrictions that might affect your right to claim benefits in the UK? For example, are you and your son both British citizens, or do you have settled status or another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits?**

2026-01-29T13:11:46.212020 [actor]: Yes, we're both British citizens, no immigration issues at all.

2026-01-29T13:11:51.422849 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

✓ You have a child (your 17-year-old son) under 20 who is in approved full-time education (A-Levels)
✓ He lives with you
✓ No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for him
✓ You both live in the UK
✓ You're both British citizens with no immigration restrictions

You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit for your son.

**One important thing to be aware of:** If either you or your partner has an individual income over £60,000 a year, you may need to pay a tax charge called the High Income Child Benefit Charge. This means you might have to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through your tax return, though you can still claim it.

**Would you like to know more about the High Income Child Benefit Charge, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-29T13:11:54.503444 [actor]: Oh, that's good to know about the tax charge, but actually there's something I should mention. My son recently got married - he married his girlfriend a few months ago. She's 17 as well and she's moved into our house with us. Does that change anything? Can I still claim for him even though he's married?
