2026-01-29T12:53:52.944481 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you are responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:53:55.793893 [actor]: Yes, I have a daughter. She's 6 years old, but she's been in hospital for quite a while now - about 14 weeks. I'm still responsible for her though, I visit her every day and I spend money on things she needs like books, pyjamas, and special food. I spend about £30 a week on these things for her.

2026-01-29T12:53:58.183650 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I'm sorry to hear your daughter has been in hospital.

The good news is that a child being in hospital doesn't automatically disqualify you from Child Benefit, especially since you're clearly still responsible for her and contributing to her costs.

Let me ask you the next question: **Do you currently live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:54:00.068357 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I'm here with my daughter - well, she's in the hospital here, but I live nearby so I can visit her every day.

2026-01-29T12:54:02.476666 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Next question: **Are you the only person claiming Child Benefit for your daughter, or is someone else (such as another parent, guardian, or relative) also claiming or planning to claim Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-29T12:54:04.422345 [actor]: No, it's just me claiming. No one else is claiming for her - I'm her main carer, even though she's in hospital at the moment.

2026-01-29T12:54:06.289959 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Next question: **Do you have immigration status that allows you to claim benefits in the UK? For example, are you a British citizen, have settled status, or have the right to reside and claim benefits here?**

2026-01-29T12:54:07.953389 [actor]: Yes, I'm a British citizen, so there's no issue with my immigration status.

2026-01-29T12:54:11.093473 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to assess one more important aspect regarding your daughter's hospital stay.

**Has the hospital or local authority informed you that they are contributing to the cost of supporting your daughter during her stay, or are you bearing all the costs of her care and needs yourself?**

(This is important because if the hospital or local authority is covering the full cost of her accommodation and maintenance, it could affect your eligibility after a certain period.)

2026-01-29T12:54:13.618140 [actor]: The hospital is providing her medical care and accommodation of course, but I'm the one paying for her personal things - the books, pyjamas, and special food she likes. I spend about £30 a week on these extras for her. The hospital hasn't said anything about covering these costs, I just buy them myself because she needs them and I want to make sure she's comfortable.

2026-01-29T12:54:19.554595 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. That's very helpful.

Let me think through your situation carefully:

**Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

1. ✓ You have a child under 16 who you are responsible for
2. ✓ You live in the UK
3. ✓ You are a British citizen
4. ✓ You are the only person claiming for your daughter
5. ✓ You are contributing to the cost of looking after your child (spending approximately £30 per week on her needs)

**Regarding your daughter's hospital stay:** The key factor is that you are still contributing to her costs while she's in hospital. According to the rules, you can continue to claim Child Benefit for a child in hospital as long as you're contributing to the cost of supporting them - which you clearly are with your £30 weekly spending on books, pyjamas, and special food.

The 12-week rule (where Child Benefit might stop if a child has been in hospital or care for more than 12 weeks) typically applies when a local authority or hospital is paying for **all** the costs of accommodation and maintenance. Since you are contributing financially to your daughter's needs, this demonstrates you're still responsible for her.

**You should be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your daughter.**

Would you like to know how to apply, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-29T12:54:22.401963 [actor]: Thank you so much for explaining that! That's a relief to hear. I was worried that because she's been in hospital for so long, I might not be able to claim anymore. It's good to know that the money I spend on her things makes a difference. I think I understand my eligibility now, thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T12:54:26.095042 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user qualifies for Child Benefit via the exception for children in hospital when the parent continues to contribute to their costs, correctly noting that the 12-week rule doesn't apply because the user is spending £30/week on the child's personal needs.
