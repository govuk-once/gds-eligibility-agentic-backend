2026-01-29T12:52:58.428475 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:53:00.028790 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Sofia. She's 18 years old.

2026-01-29T12:53:02.092422 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Sofia is 18, I need to ask:

**Is Sofia currently in approved education or training?**

(This is important because Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training.)

2026-01-29T12:53:04.131716 [actor]: No, she's not. She actually left school two years ago when she was 16. She's been working as a receptionist for a while now - she works about 30 hours a week.

2026-01-29T12:53:08.760238 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Based on the information you've provided, I need to inform you about your eligibility:

Since Sofia is 18 years old, left education at 16, and is now working 30 hours a week, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for her**.

Child Benefit generally stops when a young person:
- Turns 16 (unless they stay in approved education or training)
- Or reaches 20 years old (if they're still in approved education or training)
- Or leaves approved education or training

In Sofia's case, Child Benefit would have stopped when she turned 16 and left school, as she didn't continue in approved education or training.

**Do you have any other children that you're responsible for?** If so, you may be eligible for Child Benefit for them.

2026-01-29T12:53:10.653132 [actor]: No, Sofia is my only child. So I'm not eligible then. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T12:53:15.023467 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 16 and leaves education, and correctly determined that the user is not eligible since Sofia is 18, left school at 16, and is working full-time rather than being in approved education or training.
