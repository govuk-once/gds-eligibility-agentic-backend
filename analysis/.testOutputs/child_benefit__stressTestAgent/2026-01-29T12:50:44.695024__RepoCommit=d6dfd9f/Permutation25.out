2026-01-29T13:05:29.185964 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T13:05:31.165004 [actor]: Yes, I have a son, Leo. He's 5 years old.

2026-01-29T13:05:32.862099 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does Leo live with you, or are you the main person responsible for him?**

2026-01-29T13:05:34.991115 [actor]: Well, that's the thing... Leo has been in local authority care for about 10 weeks now. He doesn't live with me at the moment. But my husband - he's Leo's stepfather - has been sending £30 a week to the carer to help with Leo's upkeep.

2026-01-29T13:05:37.044906 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. This is an important detail for determining eligibility.

Let me ask a follow-up question: **Is Leo expected to be in local authority care for more than 8 weeks in total, or is this a temporary arrangement that will end soon?**

2026-01-29T13:05:38.803403 [actor]: It's already been 10 weeks, so yes, it's been more than 8 weeks now.

2026-01-29T13:05:41.085543 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. 

One more important question: **Is your husband (Leo's stepfather) making these £30 weekly payments toward Leo's upkeep as part of a formal arrangement, or are these voluntary contributions?**

2026-01-29T13:05:43.364562 [actor]: They're voluntary contributions. My husband just sends the money to help out with Leo's costs - there's no formal arrangement or anything like that. We just want to help support Leo even though he's in care.

2026-01-29T13:05:49.107178 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Unfortunately, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.** Here's why:

When a child is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, the person who can claim Child Benefit is the person who is caring for the child - in this case, Leo's carer. Since Leo has been in care for 10 weeks, this threshold has been exceeded.

However, there is an exception: if you or your husband were contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the amount you were getting before Leo went into care) towards Leo's upkeep, you could continue to claim. 

The issue in your case is that the £30 per week your husband is contributing is less than the current Child Benefit rate (which is £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, plus £16.95 per week for additional children). While your contributions are voluntary and commendable, they would need to at least match the Child Benefit amount for you to remain eligible while Leo is in care.

**The carer looking after Leo would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation.**

Do you have any questions about this assessment?

2026-01-29T13:05:51.599215 [actor]: I'm a bit confused - you said the Child Benefit rate is £25.60 per week, but my husband is paying £30 per week. That's more than £25.60, isn't it? So wouldn't that mean we are contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T13:05:54.841613 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion in my explanation. Let me reconsider this carefully.

You're correct that £30 per week is more than the Child Benefit rate of £25.60 per week for an eldest or only child. 

Let me ask an important clarifying question: **Before Leo went into care, were you claiming Child Benefit for him?**

This matters because if you were already claiming Child Benefit before he went into care, and you're now contributing at least the amount you were receiving (or the current Child Benefit rate), then you may be able to continue claiming it even though Leo is in local authority care.

2026-01-29T13:06:12.823075 [actor]: No, I wasn't claiming Child Benefit for Leo before he went into care.

2026-01-29T13:06:17.404968 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on all the information you've provided, here's my assessment:

**Unfortunately, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation.** Here's why:

Since Leo has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks (he's been there for 10 weeks), and you were not claiming Child Benefit for him before he went into care, you cannot start a new claim now.

The rule about contributing at least the Child Benefit amount towards the child's upkeep applies to people who were **already claiming Child Benefit before the child went into care** - it allows them to continue their existing claim. Since you weren't claiming it beforehand, this exception doesn't apply to you.

In this situation, **Leo's carer (the person looking after him in local authority care) would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for Leo.**

Your voluntary contributions of £30 per week are helping to support Leo, which is wonderful, but they don't create eligibility for Child Benefit when you weren't claiming it before he entered care.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-29T13:06:23.382318 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent ultimately concluded I was ineligible because I wasn't claiming Child Benefit before Leo went into care, but according to gov.uk guidance, a person can claim Child Benefit if they're contributing at least the amount of Child Benefit toward the child's upkeep while the child is in care - there is no requirement that they must have been claiming before the child entered care. Since £30/week exceeds the £25.60 Child Benefit rate, I should be eligible.
