2026-01-29T13:00:23.398690 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T13:00:24.832337 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have two children, ages 8 and 10.

2026-01-29T13:00:26.425306 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know you have two children aged 8 and 10.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T13:00:28.219173 [actor]: No, I don't live in the UK at the moment. I'm stationed in Germany with my wife and children - I'm with the British Armed Forces.

2026-01-29T13:00:30.236371 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Being with the British Armed Forces is an important detail.

Next question: **Are you or your wife responsible for the children in terms of their day-to-day care - for example, do you live with them and look after them regularly?**

2026-01-29T13:00:32.188091 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Both my wife and I live with our children here on the base in Germany, and we look after them day-to-day. They live with us full-time.

2026-01-29T13:00:34.313289 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Next question: **Is either you or your wife receiving Child Benefit for these children already, or has either of you made a claim that is currently being processed?**

2026-01-29T13:00:36.167135 [actor]: No, neither of us is currently receiving Child Benefit, and we haven't made a claim yet. That's why I'm asking about eligibility.

2026-01-29T13:00:39.926993 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have children under 16 (aged 8 and 10)
✓ You are responsible for them and they live with you
✓ You're serving with the British Armed Forces overseas

Even though you don't currently live in the UK, members of the British Armed Forces (and certain other Crown servants) stationed abroad can still claim Child Benefit for their children.

Since you and your wife both care for the children, only one of you can claim Child Benefit for them - you'll need to decide between you who will make the claim.

You should be able to proceed with making a Child Benefit claim for your two children.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T13:00:42.033000 [actor]: No, that's very helpful, thank you. I'm glad to know we're eligible despite being stationed abroad. We'll discuss who should make the claim and get that sorted out.

2026-01-29T13:00:45.434029 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that UK Armed Forces personnel stationed abroad are eligible for Child Benefit, correctly gathered all relevant information (children under 16, responsible for day-to-day care, no existing claim), and properly advised that only one parent can claim.
