2026-01-29T12:56:37.221846 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:56:40.453644 [actor]: Yes, I do. I foster a child named Liam. He's 12 years old and lives with me.

2026-01-29T12:56:42.520885 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Is Liam in local authority care, or do you foster him privately?** 

In other words, did the local authority place Liam with you, or is this a private fostering arrangement?

2026-01-29T12:56:44.015294 [actor]: The local authority placed Liam with me. The local council pays me a fostering allowance that covers his accommodation and maintenance.

2026-01-29T12:56:46.225598 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

**Does the fostering allowance you receive from the local council fully cover all of Liam's accommodation and maintenance costs, or do you contribute additional money yourself towards his living expenses?**

2026-01-29T12:56:47.716484 [actor]: The fostering allowance fully covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance costs.

2026-01-29T12:56:51.035808 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to let you know that **you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam**.

This is because when a child is placed with foster parents by a local authority and the local authority pays a fostering allowance that fully covers the child's accommodation and maintenance, the foster carer cannot claim Child Benefit for that child.

Child Benefit is not payable when the local authority is already meeting the full cost of looking after the child through the fostering allowance.

**Do you have any other children in your household that you're responsible for?** If so, you may be eligible for Child Benefit for them.

2026-01-29T12:56:54.100000 [actor]: No, Liam is the only child in my household. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T12:56:56.572582 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that foster carers are not eligible for Child Benefit when the local authority has placed the child and provides a fostering allowance that fully covers the child's accommodation and maintenance costs, which aligns with the government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility for children in care.
