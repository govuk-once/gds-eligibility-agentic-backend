2026-01-29T13:08:02.122622 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T13:08:03.788430 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a 5-year-old son who is with me.

2026-01-29T13:08:06.011549 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Are you responsible for your 5-year-old son? This means you live with him and are responsible for paying for things like his food, clothes, and housing.**

2026-01-29T13:08:07.899708 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for him. He lives with me and I pay for all his food, clothes, and everything he needs.

2026-01-29T13:08:09.884745 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

**Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on your right to live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T13:08:11.672318 [actor]: Yes, I'm here on a tourist visa - a standard 6-month visitor visa from the US. I'm not working while I'm here.

2026-01-29T13:08:13.371816 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

**How long have you been in the UK on your tourist visa, and how long are you planning to stay?**

2026-01-29T13:08:15.222925 [actor]: I've been here for about 2 months now, and I'm planning to stay for a few more months within my 6-month visa allowance.

2026-01-29T13:08:19.730578 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to inform you that **you are not eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:

**Immigration Status:** To be eligible for Child Benefit, you must either be:
- Living in the UK, or
- Not subject to immigration control

A standard visitor visa (tourist visa) means you are subject to immigration control with restrictions on your right to live in the UK. Visitor visas are temporary and do not grant you the right to access public funds, which includes Child Benefit.

Child Benefit is available to people who have the right to reside in the UK without restrictions - such as British citizens, those with settled status, or those with certain visa types that allow access to public funds. A 6-month tourist visa does not meet these criteria.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T13:08:23.309400 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing but I understand. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T13:08:25.484462 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that someone on a standard 6-month tourist/visitor visa from the US is subject to immigration control and does not have the right to access public funds including Child Benefit, which requires the right to reside in the UK without restrictions.
