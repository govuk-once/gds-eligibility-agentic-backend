2026-01-29T13:09:31.020895 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T13:09:32.668947 [actor]: Yes, I do. I've got a son, John. He's 17 and lives with me.

2026-01-29T13:09:34.321549 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is your son John still in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T13:09:36.362126 [actor]: Well, he's at college. He left school and he's redoing a couple of GCSEs - just two of them. Goes in for about 6 hours a week for his classes.

2026-01-29T13:09:38.566007 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail. Let me ask you a follow-up question about this:

Is John studying these GCSEs full-time (meaning they're considered full-time education by the college), or are they classified as part-time courses?

2026-01-29T13:09:40.916564 [actor]: They're part-time. It's only 6 hours a week of actual lessons - the rest of the time he's just at home, mostly gaming to be honest.

2026-01-29T13:09:43.016014 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Let me ask you another important question:

Does John receive any benefits in his own right, such as Universal Credit, Income Support, or Employment and Support Allowance?

2026-01-29T13:09:44.905506 [actor]: No, he doesn't get any benefits himself. He's not working or claiming anything - just doing his part-time course and spending the rest of his time at home.

2026-01-29T13:09:46.633928 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask one more question to complete my assessment:

Are you responsible for John - meaning do you live with him and are you the person who is primarily responsible for him?

2026-01-29T13:09:48.467409 [actor]: Yes, that's right. He lives with me - I'm his father, Pete. I'm the one looking after him.

2026-01-29T13:09:53.879687 [root_agent]: Thank you, Pete, for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to inform you about John's eligibility:

**Unfortunately, John would not qualify you for Child Benefit in his current circumstances.**

Here's why: Child Benefit can be claimed for young people aged 16-19 if they are in **full-time approved education or training**. However, John is only attending part-time education (6 hours per week of GCSE classes), which does not meet the full-time education requirement.

For education to count as full-time, it generally needs to be:
- More than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience
- During term time

Since John's course is part-time with only 6 hours per week, this wouldn't qualify as full-time education for Child Benefit purposes.

If John were to enroll in a full-time course in the future, you could then apply for Child Benefit at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-29T13:09:55.836124 [actor]: No, that's clear enough. Disappointing, but I understand. Thanks for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T13:10:00.311155 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a 17-year-old attending only 6 hours per week of part-time GCSE classes does not meet the full-time education requirement (which requires more than 12 hours per week of supervised study) for Child Benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds.
