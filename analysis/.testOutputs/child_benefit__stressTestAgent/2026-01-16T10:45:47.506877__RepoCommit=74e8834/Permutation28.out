2026-01-16T11:00:08.021623 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you assess whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to confirm you are the parent or legal guardian claiming for the child).

2026-01-16T11:00:09.163801 [actor]: Hi there! I'm currently in the UK with my son, he's 5 years old. Wondering about child benefit eligibility.

2026-01-16T11:00:10.430772 [root_agent]: Thank you for the information. That's a great starting point!

Now, are you in paid work, or do you have a qualifying income? (Even if you aren’t working, you might still be eligible based on your income).

2026-01-16T11:00:11.285406 [actor]: Tourist visa United States six months not working

2026-01-16T11:00:12.465948 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that you are in the UK on a tourist visa and are not currently working. 

To confirm, are you the primary carer for your son? (This means you are mainly responsible for bringing him up).

2026-01-16T11:00:13.377122 [actor]: Yes taking care of my son during our trip

2026-01-16T11:00:14.183898 [root_agent]: Thank you. And just to be clear, your son is currently living with you in the UK during this trip?

2026-01-16T11:00:15.221075 [actor]: Yes he's here with me for the full 6 months

2026-01-16T11:00:18.160338 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

Given that you are on a tourist visa, not working, and your son is 5 years old and living with you for the full 6 months of your stay in the UK, you are **not** eligible for Child Benefit. 

Child Benefit is generally only available to people who are legally resident in the UK, and those with a tourist visa are not considered legally resident. Additionally, the benefit is designed for those working or having a qualifying income – which doesn't apply in your current situation.

I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with? Perhaps information on other support available to visitors in the UK?





2026-01-16T11:00:19.305926 [actor]: I understand now.

2026-01-16T11:00:21.438274 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that someone on a tourist visa is not considered legally resident in the UK and therefore not eligible for Child Benefit.
