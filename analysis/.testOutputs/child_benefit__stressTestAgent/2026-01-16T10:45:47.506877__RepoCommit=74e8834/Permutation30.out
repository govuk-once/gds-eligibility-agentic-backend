2026-01-16T11:00:50.682917 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-16T11:00:51.624491 [actor]: Child benefit UK eligibility

2026-01-16T11:00:53.087350 [root_agent]: Thank you for the clarification. It's good to know you're asking about UK Child Benefit eligibility. 

To begin assessing your potential eligibility, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T11:00:53.921117 [actor]: I'm Lucas 35

2026-01-16T11:00:54.629955 [root_agent]: Thank you, Lucas. That's helpful!

Now, do you have any children under 20 years old?

2026-01-16T11:00:55.453873 [actor]: Two children ages 5 and 7

2026-01-16T11:00:56.507131 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. That's good to know.

Are you responsible for the care of these children? (i.e. do they live with you and are you providing their main care?)

2026-01-16T11:00:57.286474 [actor]: my children live with me wife

2026-01-16T11:00:58.685271 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your children live with you and your wife.

Is either you or your wife currently receiving a taxable benefit (like Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support, or Universal Credit)? I understand this can be a complex question, so just a yes or no to start is fine.

2026-01-16T11:00:59.423497 [actor]: no benefits

2026-01-16T11:01:00.594063 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know.

Now, is either you or your wife earning over £50,000 per year? This is before tax and any other deductions. Again, a simple yes or no is perfect for now.

2026-01-16T11:01:01.510044 [actor]: wife earn lot money 65k year

2026-01-16T11:01:03.424248 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know your wife earns £65,000 per year. 

Because your wife’s income is over £50,000, Child Benefit may be reduced. Do you know if your wife is a 'high income child benefit charge' payer? (This means she’s actively claimed Child Benefit and then paid some back through self-assessment, or opted out of receiving it).

2026-01-16T11:01:04.382146 [actor]: don't know about high income charge I'm the one who claimed child benefit

2026-01-16T11:01:05.762934 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you claimed the Child Benefit. Since your wife earns over £50,000, and you have claimed the benefit, it sounds like the high income child benefit charge may apply to you. 

To confirm - is your wife currently employed?

2026-01-16T11:01:06.629418 [actor]: yes Emily works full time

2026-01-16T11:01:07.300440 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And just to be absolutely clear, is your wife the biological mother of both children?

2026-01-16T11:01:08.152046 [actor]: we're married both our children

2026-01-16T11:01:10.598486 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you are married and both children are yours.

Based on the information you’ve provided: you are claiming Child Benefit, your wife earns over £50,000, and she is employed full-time. This means you will likely need to report the Child Benefit as income on your (or your wife’s) Self Assessment tax return and potentially pay a High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Do you want me to explain the High Income Child Benefit Charge in a little more detail, or would you like me to summarise your likely eligibility?

2026-01-16T11:01:11.458285 [actor]: what happens with charge

2026-01-16T11:01:15.477736 [root_agent]: Certainly. The High Income Child Benefit Charge means that for every £100 of income *above* £50,000, you have to repay 1% of the total Child Benefit you received that tax year.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Income between £50,001 and £60,000:** You repay 1% of the Child Benefit for each £100 earned over £50,000.
*   **Income above £60,000:** You repay 100% of the Child Benefit you received.

So, as your wife earns £65,000, you'll need to repay a portion of the Child Benefit. The exact amount will depend on the total Child Benefit you receive for the year. You declare this and pay it through your Self Assessment tax return.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to give you an example calculation?

2026-01-16T11:01:16.298186 [actor]: who pays it then?

2026-01-16T11:01:18.967039 [root_agent]: That’s a good question! The person whose income is over £50,000 is responsible for reporting the Child Benefit and paying the charge. In your case, since your wife earns over £50,000, she would typically be the one to declare it on *her* Self Assessment tax return.

However, if she doesn't usually file a Self Assessment tax return, *you* would need to register for one to report the charge and repay the Child Benefit.

Essentially, it's the higher earner who handles the charge through the Self Assessment process. Does that clarify who pays it?

2026-01-16T11:01:20.227227 [actor]: so I'm eligible but wife pays back?

2026-01-16T11:01:22.846952 [root_agent]: You've understood it perfectly, Lucas!

Yes, that's correct. You *are* eligible to receive Child Benefit for your two children. However, because your wife’s income exceeds £50,000, a portion of that Child Benefit will need to be repaid through the High Income Child Benefit Charge – and it will be your wife (or you, if she doesn't usually file a tax return) who handles that repayment via a Self Assessment tax return.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit or the charge?

2026-01-16T11:01:27.018387 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Lucas is eligible for Child Benefit but would be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge due to his wife's £65,000 income, requiring partial repayment through Self Assessment.
