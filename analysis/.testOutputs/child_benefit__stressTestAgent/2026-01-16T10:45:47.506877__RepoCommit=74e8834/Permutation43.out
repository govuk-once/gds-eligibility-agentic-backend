2026-01-16T11:09:18.801454 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for the child, and your age can influence eligibility).

2026-01-16T11:09:20.058068 [actor]: I'll help you by role-playing as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Callum apprenticeship 17 glasgow father

2026-01-16T11:09:21.408532 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying! So you are Callum, 17 years old, undertaking an apprenticeship in Glasgow, and are a father.

To help me understand your situation better, could you please tell me – do you have sole responsibility for your child, or do others share this responsibility?

2026-01-16T11:09:22.741936 [actor]: I'll continue role-playing as the person in the given situation.

No father of Callum I am living with son modern apprenticeship

2026-01-16T11:09:24.213658 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you are the father of Callum, and you are currently living with your son. You are also undertaking a modern apprenticeship.

To confirm, is your son under 20 years old and in approved full-time education, or an approved apprenticeship? Knowing this will help me determine eligibility.





2026-01-16T11:09:25.129635 [actor]: 17 Callum my son not me apprenticeship he is

2026-01-16T11:09:26.698143 [root_agent]: Apologies for the misunderstanding! My mistake - I was getting us mixed up.

So, *your* son Callum is 17 and doing a modern apprenticeship. And you are his father, living with him.

To clarify, are you currently working more than 8 hours a week? This is relevant to the earnings limit for Child Benefit.

2026-01-16T11:09:27.567338 [actor]: Yes working full time glasgow callum apprenticeship

2026-01-16T11:09:29.102391 [root_agent]: Okay, so you are working full-time in Glasgow, and your son Callum is 17 and completing an apprenticeship.

To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me roughly what your weekly gross income is (that's before tax and other deductions)? A general range is fine.

2026-01-16T11:09:30.051480 [actor]: £600 weekly gross income apprenticeship modern Scottish

2026-01-16T11:09:31.284277 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your weekly gross income is £600, and you're earning this through a modern apprenticeship in Scotland.

Just to be absolutely sure, is anyone else legally responsible for Callum, such as another parent who contributes financially or has parental rights?

2026-01-16T11:09:32.309206 [actor]: No ex-wife moved away years ago no contact

2026-01-16T11:09:36.654190 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It sounds like you are the sole legal guardian and financially responsible parent for Callum.

Based on the information you've provided – you are working over 8 hours a week with a gross weekly income of £600, your son is 17 and doing a modern apprenticeship – it appears you *may* be eligible for Child Benefit. However, the earnings limit for the 2024/2025 tax year is £50,000 per year. Your income of £600 per week equates to £31,200 per year, which is below this threshold. 

However, Child Benefit can be affected if your income is over £50,000. There's a tapered reduction - for every £100 earned over £50,000, Child Benefit is reduced by £1.

Do you want me to explain the tapered reduction in more detail, or would you like me to move on to confirming other eligibility criteria, such as your National Insurance number?

2026-01-16T11:09:37.658636 [actor]: Callum's apprenticeship is it approved?

2026-01-16T11:09:39.262282 [root_agent]: That’s a very good question – checking if Callum’s apprenticeship is ‘approved’ is important!

To be eligible, Callum’s apprenticeship needs to be an approved apprenticeship with a registered training provider. Do you know if his apprenticeship is with a provider listed on the government’s register of apprenticeship training providers?





2026-01-16T11:09:40.202587 [actor]: Modern apprenticeship in Scotland he is doing

2026-01-16T11:09:41.619168 [root_agent]: Okay, a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland. These are generally approved, but to be completely certain, could you tell me what Callum’s apprenticeship is *in* - what trade or area is he training in? Knowing the specific apprenticeship will allow me to double-check its approval status.

2026-01-16T11:09:42.501825 [actor]: Construction apprenticeship Scottish modern scheme

2026-01-16T11:09:45.852009 [root_agent]: Thank you. A Construction Apprenticeship under the Scottish Modern Apprenticeship scheme is indeed a recognised and approved apprenticeship for Child Benefit purposes. 

So, to recap, you are working full-time earning £600 gross per week, you have sole responsibility for your 17-year-old son Callum who is undertaking an approved Construction Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, and his mother has no contact.

Based on this, it seems likely you *are* eligible for Child Benefit, although your Child Benefit may be reduced due to your income being above £50,000 (the tapered reduction applies).

To be absolutely sure, would you be willing to share the first two letters of your postcode? This isn't essential, but helps confirm residency in the UK, which is a basic requirement.

2026-01-16T11:09:48.179804 [actor]: Actually, I need to correct some information. Based on the situation provided to me, I wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit. In England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, you generally cannot get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship. This is different from the Welsh exception.

2026-01-16T11:09:51.126108 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that the parent would "likely" be eligible for Child Benefit when a child on an apprenticeship in Scotland is not eligible for Child Benefit according to government guidelines.
