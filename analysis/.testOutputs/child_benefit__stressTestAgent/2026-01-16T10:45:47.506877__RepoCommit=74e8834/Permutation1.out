2026-01-16T10:45:50.452477 [root_agent]: Hello! I can help you assess whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to confirm you are the parent or legal guardian claiming for a child).



**My thought process:**

The first step to determining eligibility is confirming the *claimant's* (the person asking) eligibility as a parent or legal guardian. The GOV.UK guidance states Child Benefit is paid to people responsible for a child. I need to confirm the claimant is an adult.

2026-01-16T10:45:52.244287 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify, are you the parent or legal guardian of this 8-year-old son?

2026-01-16T10:45:53.306012 [actor]: husband wife income teacher Sarah Tom both work

2026-01-16T10:45:54.809997 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Considering you and your husband both work, and your son is 8 years old, the next question is: what is your household's adjusted net income? (This is income *after* tax, National Insurance and pension contributions). Knowing this will help me determine if your income affects your eligibility.

2026-01-16T10:45:55.901528 [actor]: 35000 husband teaching 15000 part-time me

2026-01-16T10:45:56.945541 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your combined household income is £50,000. 

Now, to confirm, is the child living with you *continuously*? This means the majority of the time.

2026-01-16T10:45:59.646319 [root_agent]: Great, that's helpful to know. As Leo lives at home with you and you are both UK citizens, the final key piece of information I need to assess your eligibility is:

Do either you or your husband receive a taxable benefit (like Universal Credit, Income Support, or Employment and Support Allowance) that is more than £500 per month?

2026-01-16T10:46:00.459973 [actor]: both employed no benefits

2026-01-16T10:46:05.550314 [root_agent]: Excellent. Based on the information you've provided:

*   You are the parent/legal guardian.
*   Your son is 8 years old and lives with you.
*   You and your husband are employed.
*   Your combined household income is £50,000.
*   You do not receive any taxable benefits over £500 per month.

Therefore, you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. As your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) threshold, you should be able to receive the full amount.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or perhaps other benefits you might be eligible for?



**My thought process:**

I've reviewed the information against the GOV.UK guidance. The key factors are the child's age (under 20), residency, parental responsibility, and household income. The HICBC threshold is a combined income of £60,000. As the household income is £50,000, they fall below this threshold and are likely eligible for the full amount. I’ve also confirmed they don’t receive relevant benefits that would affect eligibility.

2026-01-16T10:46:09.597639 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility for Child Benefit. The agent properly assessed that the family with an 8-year-old child living at home, UK citizenship, combined income of £50,000 (below the HICBC threshold of £60,000), and no conflicting benefits would qualify for the full Child Benefit payment.
