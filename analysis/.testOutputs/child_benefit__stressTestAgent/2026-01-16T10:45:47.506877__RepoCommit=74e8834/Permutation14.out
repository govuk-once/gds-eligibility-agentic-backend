2026-01-16T10:52:34.825250 [root_agent]: Hello! I can help you with that. To assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask you a few questions. 

First, how old are you? (Child Benefit is paid to the parent or guardian of a child, and your age can sometimes be a factor in determining eligibility)

2026-01-16T10:52:36.110092 [actor]: Noah grandmother surgery

2026-01-16T10:52:38.068708 [root_agent]: Thank you for the additional context. It sounds like you are applying for Child Benefit in relation to a child named Noah, and that Noah's grandmother recently had surgery. I will keep this in mind as we go through the questions, but for now, let's focus on *your* specific situation to determine *your* eligibility.

To clarify, are *you* Noah’s parent or legal guardian?

2026-01-16T10:52:38.988420 [actor]: My name Sophie single mother Noah 6 years old my mother taking care after surgery

2026-01-16T10:52:40.412701 [root_agent]: Thank you, Sophie. That’s very helpful. So, you are Noah’s single mother, and Noah is 6 years old. Your mother is currently caring for Noah while she recovers from surgery.

To confirm, are you currently living in the United Kingdom? Child Benefit eligibility requires residency in the UK.

2026-01-16T10:52:41.195338 [actor]: UK citizen yes

2026-01-16T10:52:43.132180 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. You are a UK citizen and currently living in the United Kingdom.

Now, are you working, and if so, approximately how much do you earn per week *before* tax? This is because your income can affect your Child Benefit payments, particularly if you earn over a certain threshold. Don't worry about being exact, an approximate figure is fine. If you aren't working currently, please just say so.

2026-01-16T10:52:44.124554 [actor]: Working part time £320 week

2026-01-16T10:52:45.523465 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. You are working part-time and earn approximately £320 per week before tax.

Now, considering Noah is 6 years old, is he currently in full-time education? This includes attending school, college, or doing an approved training course.

2026-01-16T10:52:46.173121 [actor]: School yes

2026-01-16T10:52:47.949623 [root_agent]: Excellent. Noah is in school, which is good to know. 

Just to be absolutely certain, and considering the information about your mother providing care after her surgery, is Noah living with you the majority of the time? Or is he primarily living with your mother currently? According to the rules, the child needs to be living with the person claiming the benefit for the majority of the time.

2026-01-16T10:52:49.002824 [actor]: Noah my mother 6 weeks because of my surgery recovery

2026-01-16T10:52:51.549638 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Sophie. So Noah is currently living with your mother for the past 6 weeks due to her recovery from surgery.

According to the rules, Child Benefit is usually paid to the person who is mainly looking after the child. Since Noah is living with your mother for the past 6 weeks, and she is providing his main care during that time, it might be more appropriate for *your mother* to claim Child Benefit. 

However, there are exceptions. Are you still providing financial support for Noah during this time, even though he is living with your mother?

2026-01-16T10:52:52.850578 [actor]: No she not claim benefit. I have surgery not mother. Noah stay with grandmother because I have surgery

2026-01-16T10:52:56.049511 [root_agent]: My apologies, Sophie! I seem to have gotten confused and incorrectly assumed your mother was the one who had surgery. Thank you for correcting me - *you* had surgery, and Noah is staying with his grandmother while you recover.

Okay, that changes things. Since Noah is staying with his grandmother *because you are recovering from surgery*, and you are his parent, this falls under a specific circumstance. According to the guidance, you can continue to claim Child Benefit while Noah is being cared for by someone else due to your illness.

To confirm one last thing: is your surgery expected to last a defined period, or is it ongoing with an uncertain recovery timeline? Knowing this will help determine how long you can continue to claim without needing to update your information.

2026-01-16T10:52:56.966322 [actor]: 6 weeks staying with grandmother temporary

2026-01-16T10:52:59.701230 [root_agent]: Okay, that's very clear. Noah is staying with his grandmother for a temporary period of 6 weeks because of your surgery.

Based on the information you've provided, and referencing the guidance, **you are likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit.** The rules state that you can continue to claim if a child is being cared for by someone else temporarily due to your illness. 

Since it’s a temporary arrangement of 6 weeks, you shouldn't need to notify anyone unless the arrangement changes.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, Sophie? Perhaps you'd like me to summarise the key points regarding your eligibility?

2026-01-16T10:53:03.955659 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately advised that Sophie remains eligible for Child Benefit while Noah stays temporarily with his grandmother due to Sophie's surgery recovery, which aligns with the rules for temporary care arrangements.
