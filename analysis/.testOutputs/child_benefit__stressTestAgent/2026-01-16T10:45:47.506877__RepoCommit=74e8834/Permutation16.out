2026-01-16T10:53:29.117360 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T10:53:30.311361 [actor]: Hello! I'll help you figure out if you're eligible for child benefit by role-playing as a user based on the provided context.

child benefit eligibility son hospital America

2026-01-16T10:53:31.530935 [root_agent]: Thank you for the context. It seems you are role-playing a user whose son is in hospital, and potentially in America. 

To clarify, are *you* the parent or legal guardian of the child you are referring to?





2026-01-16T10:53:32.444473 [actor]: yes parent son Oliver hospital USA 15 weeks treatment

2026-01-16T10:53:33.671509 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming you are the parent of Oliver, who is currently receiving 15 weeks of treatment in a hospital in the USA.

To understand your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old *you* are?

2026-01-16T10:53:34.586462 [actor]: 39 UK resident son special treatment

2026-01-16T10:53:35.661502 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you are 39 years old and a UK resident, and your son Oliver is receiving special treatment in the USA.

Now, is Oliver under 20 years old?

2026-01-16T10:53:36.528564 [actor]: Oliver 14 rare condition specialist hospital

2026-01-16T10:53:37.937753 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Oliver is 14 years old and receiving specialist hospital treatment for a rare condition.

Given Oliver is 14 and receiving hospital treatment, and you are a UK resident, Child Benefit *may* still be payable. To confirm, does Oliver live with you?

2026-01-16T10:53:38.868973 [actor]: Oliver USA hospital 15 weeks I visit pay costs

2026-01-16T10:53:41.387502 [root_agent]: Okay, so Oliver is currently in the USA receiving hospital treatment for 15 weeks, and you are visiting and paying costs associated with his care. This means he is not currently living with you.

According to the guidance, Child Benefit can continue to be paid for a child who is temporarily living abroad, including for hospital treatment. However, there are conditions.

Could you please confirm, is Oliver still considered a member of your household, even while he is receiving treatment in the USA? (For example, do you intend for him to return to live with you once his treatment is complete?)

2026-01-16T10:53:42.625784 [actor]: Yes return UK after treatment temporary USA specialist

2026-01-16T10:53:45.969662 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. That's helpful to know that Oliver will return to the UK after his treatment and that his stay in the USA is temporary for specialist care.

Based on the information you've provided – you are a UK resident, Oliver is 14, he is receiving specialist hospital treatment in the USA, and he will return to live with you after his treatment – you are *likely* to be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit.

However, to be absolutely sure and to ensure a smooth process, you may need to inform HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) about Oliver’s hospital stay.

Would you like me to summarise the key points we’ve covered, or would you like to know more about informing HMRC?

2026-01-16T10:53:48.547871 [actor]: I understand now. Thank you for telling me about my eligibility for child benefit with Oliver being in the USA hospital. Good to know I can still receive benefits while he gets treatment.

2026-01-16T10:53:50.407966 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit can continue to be paid when a child is temporarily abroad for hospital treatment, as long as they remain part of the household and will return afterward.
