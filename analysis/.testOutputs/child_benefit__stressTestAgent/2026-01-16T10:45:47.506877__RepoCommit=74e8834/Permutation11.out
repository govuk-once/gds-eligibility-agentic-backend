2026-01-16T10:51:08.754129 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child, as eligibility is based on that relationship).

2026-01-16T10:51:09.970153 [actor]: I'll play the role of Karen based on the scenario you provided. Let me interact with the benefits agent.

Karen (44) son Ryan 17 apprentice

2026-01-16T10:51:11.069734 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. So you are Karen, aged 44, and your son Ryan is 17 and currently an apprentice.

To confirm, is Ryan living with you?

2026-01-16T10:51:12.153561 [actor]: yes live at home with me

2026-01-16T10:51:13.392344 [root_agent]: Thank you. And to clarify, is Ryan in full-time education, or is his apprenticeship considered full-time? (This is because Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 16, unless they are in approved education or training).

2026-01-16T10:51:14.266989 [actor]: apprenticeship intermediate government funded england

2026-01-16T10:51:15.664912 [root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. An intermediate apprenticeship in England that is government funded *is* considered approved education or training. 

Now, regarding your National Insurance number – do you have a National Insurance number? (This is a requirement to claim Child Benefit).

2026-01-16T10:51:16.378556 [actor]: yes have national insurance number

2026-01-16T10:51:17.673384 [root_agent]: Great. Finally, to check eligibility, could you tell me roughly what your annual income is? (There's a threshold where Child Benefit starts to reduce, depending on your income - or is stopped altogether if your income is above a certain amount). Just an estimate is fine.

2026-01-16T10:51:18.536703 [actor]: 25 thousand pounds yearly

2026-01-16T10:51:22.533230 [root_agent]: Thank you. Based on the information you've provided:

*   You are over 16.
*   You are the parent/guardian of a child.
*   Your son Ryan is 17 and undertaking a government-funded intermediate apprenticeship in England, which qualifies as approved education.
*   He lives with you.
*   You have a National Insurance number.
*   Your annual income is £25,000.

Because your income is £25,000, and the threshold for reducing Child Benefit is £50,000 (for the 2024/2025 tax year), you *are* eligible to receive the full amount of Child Benefit for Ryan. However, keep in mind that if your income rises above £50,000, the amount of Child Benefit you receive will be reduced.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to clarify anything?





2026-01-16T10:51:23.822909 [actor]: I understand now, thank you for confirming I'm eligible.

2026-01-16T10:51:26.509898 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Karen is eligible for Child Benefit because her son Ryan is 17, in an approved apprenticeship, lives with her, and her income (£25,000) is below the £50,000 threshold where Child Benefit begins to reduce.
