2026-01-26T15:19:01.590750 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you assess your eligibility for Child Benefit in the UK. To determine this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T15:19:04.036785 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the situation where I'm James who doesn't live with my child but pays £50 weekly for maintenance due to a Court Order.

I don't live with my child. The child lives with their mother, but I do pay £50 a week in child maintenance because there's a Court Order requiring me to do so.

2026-01-26T15:19:06.871386 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since the child doesn't live with you but lives with their mother, typically the person who the child lives with (in this case, the mother) would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.

The fact that you pay child maintenance through a Court Order is important, but it doesn't automatically qualify you for Child Benefit. Child Benefit is usually paid to the person who has main responsibility for raising the child.

May I ask if you provide any care for the child, such as regular overnight stays?

2026-01-26T15:19:09.201660 [actor]: I see my child on weekends, usually every other weekend. They stay overnight with me on those visits, but their mother has main custody. I only pay the maintenance because the court forces me to, it's not voluntary. Does that make a difference for child benefit?

2026-01-26T15:19:13.555120 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that additional information. Based on what you've shared:

You see your child every other weekend with overnight stays
The child's mother has main custody
You pay court-ordered child maintenance

This situation doesn't qualify you to claim Child Benefit. Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who has main responsibility for the child, which in this case appears to be the child's mother.

The occasional overnight stays (every other weekend) don't meet the threshold for split Child Benefit payments, which would require a more equal sharing arrangement where the child regularly lives with both parents.

The fact that you pay child maintenance, whether court-ordered or voluntary, doesn't affect Child Benefit eligibility - these are separate systems.

Is there any other aspect of your situation regarding care for the child that you think might be relevant to Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T15:19:16.143835 [actor]: No, that's pretty much my situation. I just wasn't sure if I could claim anything since I'm paying maintenance, even if it's court-ordered. So it sounds like I'm not eligible for Child Benefit, and the mother would be the one who can claim it since she has main custody. That makes sense. Thanks for explaining.

2026-01-26T15:19:18.369337 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent was correct in explaining that Child Benefit is typically paid to the person with main responsibility for the child (in this case the mother), and that paying court-ordered maintenance does not qualify someone for Child Benefit.
