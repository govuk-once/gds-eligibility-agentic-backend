2026-01-26T15:10:21.228626 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First question: Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T15:10:22.459836 [actor]: Hi there! Yes, I do have my 5-year-old son living with me. We're actually visiting the UK right now.

2026-01-26T15:10:24.233270 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To further assess your eligibility for Child Benefit in the UK, I need to ask: Are you normally living in the UK? By this, I mean do you usually reside in the UK rather than just visiting?

2026-01-26T15:10:25.536114 [actor]: No, we're not normally living in the UK. I'm a US citizen, and we're just visiting on a tourist visa for six months. We're about two months into our stay at the moment.

2026-01-26T15:10:29.637814 [root_agent]: I understand. Thank you for that clarification.

Based on the information you've provided, you would not be eligible for UK Child Benefit. Child Benefit is available to those who are living in the UK (not just visiting) and are responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training).

Since you're a US citizen visiting the UK on a tourist visa rather than normally living in the UK, you don't meet the residence requirement for Child Benefit eligibility.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about benefits or services during your stay in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:10:32.117225 [actor]: Oh, I see. That makes sense since we're just visiting temporarily. Thank you for explaining that. No other questions at the moment about benefits - I was just curious about what might be available while we're here. We're enjoying our UK visit so far!

2026-01-26T15:10:34.532948 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit requires normally living in the UK, not just visiting on a tourist visa.
