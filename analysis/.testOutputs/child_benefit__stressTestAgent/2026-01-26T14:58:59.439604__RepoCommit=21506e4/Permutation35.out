2026-01-26T15:13:25.337306 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First question: Are you responsible for raising a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:13:26.974126 [actor]: Hello there. Yes, I'm responsible for my son Rashid. He's 17 years old and still lives with us at home. He's currently studying for his A-Levels.

2026-01-26T15:13:28.523081 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know that you're responsible for your 17-year-old son who's studying for his A-Levels.

Next question: Does your son normally live with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-26T15:13:30.137940 [actor]: Yes, my son Rashid lives with us at home. He recently got married to his girlfriend who is also 17, and she has moved in with us too. They're both living in our family home while he finishes his A-Levels.

2026-01-26T15:13:32.587696 [root_agent]: I understand that your son Rashid lives with you along with his wife, and they're both 17 and living in your family home while he completes his A-Levels.

Next question: Is your son's annual income less than £18,826 (including any money from part-time jobs, investments, etc.)?

2026-01-26T15:13:34.552630 [actor]: Yes, Rashid doesn't have much income at all. He's focused on his studies right now and doesn't have a job. He certainly earns well below that amount - basically no income of his own apart from occasional pocket money we give him.

2026-01-26T15:13:35.945101 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know that Rashid has minimal income and is focused on his studies.

Next question: Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:13:37.094212 [actor]: No, neither my wife nor I earn anywhere near £60,000. Our combined household income is actually below that figure.

2026-01-26T15:13:38.811662 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about your household income.

Next question: Do you or your partner have the right to live in the UK (such as being a UK citizen, having settled status, or having indefinite leave to remain)?

2026-01-26T15:13:39.826765 [actor]: Yes, we're UK citizens. We've lived here all our lives.

2026-01-26T15:13:45.270920 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your residency status.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit for your son Rashid because:

1. You are responsible for raising a child who is under 20 and in approved education (A-Levels)
2. Your son lives with you
3. Your son's personal income is minimal and well below the threshold
4. Your household income is below £60,000 (if it were between £50,000-£60,000, you would still be eligible but would need to pay a tax charge)
5. You have the right to live in the UK as UK citizens

One additional point to note is that since your son is married, this could potentially affect eligibility in some circumstances. However, because he continues to live in your home, you continue to be responsible for him, and he remains in approved education, you should still be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him.

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to complete and submit form CH2, which can be done online through the UK government website.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:13:48.376407 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know about my eligibility for Child Benefit for Rashid. I'm glad to hear I can still claim it even though he's married, since he's still living with us and we're still supporting him while he finishes his education. I wasn't sure if his marriage would affect things, so that's a relief. I'll look into completing that CH2 form online. That's all I needed to know for now.

2026-01-26T15:13:50.687096 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, if a child is married or in a civil partnership, they are not eligible for Child Benefit, regardless of their living situation or education status.
