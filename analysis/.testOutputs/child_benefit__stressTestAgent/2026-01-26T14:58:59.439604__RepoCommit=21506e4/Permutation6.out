2026-01-26T15:00:40.047726 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T15:00:41.618699 [actor]: I have a 6-year-old daughter named Chloe, but she's currently in the hospital. She's been there for 14 weeks now due to a serious condition. I visit her every day.

2026-01-26T15:00:43.336724 [root_agent]: I understand your situation with Chloe. Thank you for sharing that information.

Since your daughter is in the hospital, I need to ask: are you still responsible for her care even though she's currently in the hospital? For example, are you making decisions about her care and maintaining regular contact with her?

2026-01-26T15:00:45.757087 [actor]: Yes, I am still responsible for her care. I visit her daily at the hospital, make decisions about her treatment with the doctors, and I'm still her parent and guardian. I bring her things she needs like books, pajamas, and special food - I spend about £30 a week on these items for her.

2026-01-26T15:00:47.311143 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're maintaining your parental responsibility for Chloe while she's in the hospital.

Is Chloe normally living with you when she's not in the hospital? In other words, is your home her usual residence?

2026-01-26T15:00:48.572614 [actor]: Yes, she normally lives with me at home. This hospital stay is just temporary while she receives treatment for her condition. Our home is definitely her usual residence.

2026-01-26T15:00:49.514926 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. 

Could you tell me if you're a UK resident?

2026-01-26T15:00:50.465619 [actor]: Yes, I am a UK resident.

2026-01-26T15:00:51.636219 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

May I ask if you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:00:52.915144 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that amount. My income is well below £60,000 per year.

2026-01-26T15:00:56.616949 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all this information.

Based on what you've shared, I can confirm that you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter Chloe. This is because:

1. You are a UK resident
2. You are responsible for Chloe, continuing to make decisions about her care and visiting her regularly
3. Your home is Chloe's normal residence, and her hospital stay is temporary
4. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold

When a child is in hospital, Child Benefit can continue to be paid as long as you're still responsible for the child and maintain regular contact, which you are doing by visiting daily and providing for her needs.

If you haven't already applied for Child Benefit, you may wish to do so. The payment is typically £25.60 per week for your first child.

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or how to claim it?

2026-01-26T15:00:59.048846 [actor]: That's great news, thank you for confirming I'm eligible. I was worried that because she's been in the hospital for more than 12 weeks that I might lose the benefit. I'm glad to hear I can continue receiving it while I support her through her treatment. I'll make sure to apply right away.

2026-01-26T15:01:01.279264 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit can continue to be paid when a child is in hospital, as long as the parent maintains responsibility and regular contact, which the user is doing.
