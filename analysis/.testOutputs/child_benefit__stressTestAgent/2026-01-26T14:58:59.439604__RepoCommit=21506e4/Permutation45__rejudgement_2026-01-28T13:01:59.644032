2026-01-28T13:07:23.849838 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly advised that the user was eligible for Child Benefit. According to Child Benefit rules, if a child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks (which is the case here - 14 weeks) AND the parent is not regularly spending money on the child's care (which Maria confirmed she isn't), then Child Benefit is not payable. The agent provided incorrect information about eligibility.
