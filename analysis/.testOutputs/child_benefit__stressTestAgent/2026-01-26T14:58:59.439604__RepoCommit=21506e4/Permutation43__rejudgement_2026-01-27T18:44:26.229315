2026-01-27T18:50:07.986174 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated the parent was eligible for Child Benefit. According to UK guidelines, Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland are not approved training for Child Benefit purposes, and parents cannot generally claim Child Benefit for children doing apprenticeships in Scotland.
