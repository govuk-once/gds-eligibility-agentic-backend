2026-01-26T15:03:02.256212 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time, to assess your eligibility based on UK government rules.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:03:03.463615 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for my son Liam. He's 18 years old and still living at home with me while he's studying for his A-levels.

2026-01-26T15:03:05.421210 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Liam is 18 and studying for A-levels, that's helpful to know.

Is Liam in full-time non-advanced education, such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or similar approved education?

2026-01-26T15:03:06.666354 [actor]: Yes, he's currently studying for his A-levels at the local college. He's in his final year now.

2026-01-26T15:03:08.145774 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. A-levels do qualify as approved education, which is good.

Do you normally live in the UK? (This can include England, Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland)

2026-01-26T15:03:09.003329 [actor]: Yes, we live in Manchester. We've been here all our lives.

2026-01-26T15:03:10.549311 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Living in Manchester means you meet the UK residency requirement.

Is Liam living with you most of the time? Or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-26T15:03:11.665271 [actor]: Yes, Liam lives with me full-time. It's just the two of us at home now. He's estranged from his father.

2026-01-26T15:03:13.276923 [root_agent]: I understand that Liam lives with you full-time. Thank you for sharing that information.

Are you subject to immigration control with "no recourse to public funds" conditions, or do you have any immigration restrictions that might affect your eligibility for benefits?

2026-01-26T15:03:14.383514 [actor]: No, I don't have any immigration restrictions. As I mentioned, we've lived in Manchester our whole lives. I'm a UK citizen.

2026-01-26T15:03:15.673401 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Being a UK citizen without immigration restrictions is important for eligibility.

One more question: Is your individual income over £60,000 per year? (This is important because of the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-26T15:03:17.065913 [actor]: No, my income is nowhere near that amount. I work part-time as an administrative assistant at a local school, and I earn about £18,000 per year.

2026-01-26T15:03:20.474086 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your income.

Based on all the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You're responsible for Liam, who is 18 and studying for A-levels (approved full-time non-advanced education)
2. You both live in the UK (Manchester)
3. Liam lives with you full-time
4. You're a UK citizen with no immigration restrictions
5. Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold of £60,000

You should be able to receive Child Benefit until Liam completes his A-levels or turns 20, whichever comes first. If you haven't already applied, you can claim Child Benefit through the official UK government website.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:03:22.417753 [actor]: Actually, there's something I should mention that might be important. Liam has recently started receiving Universal Credit in his own right. He qualified for it due to his personal circumstances, even though he lives with me. Would that affect my Child Benefit claim?

2026-01-26T15:03:27.077807 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing this important additional information about Liam receiving Universal Credit.

This is an important consideration. If Liam is 18 and claiming Universal Credit in his own right, this could affect your Child Benefit claim.

Generally, Child Benefit can continue while a young person is in approved education (like A-levels) until they turn 20. However, if a young person aged 16 or over claims benefits in their own name (like Universal Credit), this can affect the Child Benefit claim for them.

Based on UK government guidelines, when a young person claims benefits in their own right, they are typically considered to be financially independent, which may mean you can no longer claim Child Benefit for them.

To be absolutely certain about your specific situation, I would recommend:

1. Contacting the Child Benefit Office directly for guidance on your particular case
2. When speaking with them, explain that your 18-year-old son is in approved education but also receiving Universal Credit

They can provide definitive advice about whether you can continue to receive Child Benefit under these specific circumstances.

2026-01-26T15:03:29.645300 [actor]: Thank you for that information. I didn't realize that Liam getting Universal Credit might affect my Child Benefit. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office to check on this specific situation. It sounds like I might not be eligible anymore since he's getting his own benefits now, even though he's still in education and living with me.

2026-01-26T15:03:32.435770 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that while the parent would normally be eligible for Child Benefit for an 18-year-old in approved education, the fact that the child is receiving Universal Credit in their own right likely affects this eligibility, and recommended contacting the Child Benefit Office for definitive advice.
