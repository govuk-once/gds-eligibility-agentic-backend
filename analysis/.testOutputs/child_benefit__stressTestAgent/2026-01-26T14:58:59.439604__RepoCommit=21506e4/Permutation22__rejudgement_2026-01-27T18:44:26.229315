The agent incorrectly stated there is no time limit for Child Benefit when a child is in hospital, when in fact there is a 12-week limit. Since Arthur has been in hospital for a cumulative 13 weeks (with gaps less than 28 days which trigger the linking rule), Jenny would not be eligible for Child Benefit unless she's bearing costs for his maintenance, which wasn't established.
