2026-01-26T15:10:36.429527 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility based on the UK government rules.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:10:37.970383 [actor]: I do have a child, yes. My son Jordan is 17 years old.

2026-01-26T15:10:40.474820 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your 17-year-old son Jordan. 

Since Jordan is over 16 but under 20, I need to ask: Is Jordan currently in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or certain other approved courses.

2026-01-26T15:10:42.389232 [actor]: No, Jordan isn't in any education or training at the moment. He finished his GCSEs last year but didn't go on to college or anything. He's not working either right now.

2026-01-26T15:10:45.469109 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, it appears you wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit for Jordan. Child Benefit is typically paid for children under 16, or for those between 16 and 20 who are in approved education or training.

Since Jordan is 17 and not currently in approved education or training, he doesn't meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

If Jordan's situation changes and he decides to enter approved education or training before he turns 20, you could then become eligible and apply for Child Benefit at that time.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other potential support options?

2026-01-26T15:10:47.672170 [actor]: That's disappointing to hear, but I understand. Is there any kind of extension or grace period? Jordan has been having a tough time figuring out what to do next. He lives with me - I'm his dad, Steve. Would it make any difference if he registered with a careers service or something like that?

2026-01-26T15:10:53.710417 [root_agent]: I understand your concern about Jordan's situation, Steve. It can be challenging when young people are figuring out their next steps.

Unfortunately, there is no grace period or extension for Child Benefit in this specific situation. The rules are quite specific - for a child aged 16-19, they must be in what's classified as "approved education or training" to qualify.

Simply registering with a careers service wouldn't make Jordan eligible for Child Benefit purposes. The approved education or training needs to be more formalized, such as:
- A-levels or Scottish Highers
- NVQs and other vocational qualifications up to level 3
- T levels
- Home education (if it started before age 16 or after 16 with local authority approval)
- Certain traineeships

If Jordan decides to enroll in one of these approved courses or training programs, you could then apply for Child Benefit. The benefit can be backdated for up to 3 months from when you make the claim.

Would you like me to provide information about other types of support that might be available for Jordan or for your family during this transition period?

2026-01-26T15:10:56.005227 [actor]: I appreciate the information. Yes, I'd be interested in hearing about any other types of support that might be available for Jordan or for our family during this time. What options might there be for a 17-year-old who's not currently in education or working?

2026-01-26T15:11:02.788210 [root_agent]: I understand this is an important time for both you and Jordan. While I can't provide comprehensive benefits advice, I can suggest some potential options to look into:

1. **Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA)** - Jordan may be eligible if he's actively seeking work. At 17, he would typically need to claim income-based JSA.

2. **Youth support services** - Local councils often have youth services that provide guidance, mentoring, and support for young people aged 16-19 who are not in education, employment, or training (often called NEET support).

3. **Traineeships** - These can help young people get ready for work or an apprenticeship by providing essential skills and work experience.

4. **The Prince's Trust** - Offers programs to help young people develop skills and confidence.

5. **Careers advice** - The National Careers Service provides free careers information and advice.

6. **Universal Credit** - In some circumstances, 16-17 year olds can claim Universal Credit, though there are specific conditions.

7. **Local Authority support** - Some local authorities have specific programs or financial support for young people in transition.

For the most accurate and up-to-date advice tailored to Jordan's specific situation, I'd recommend:

- Contacting your local Jobcentre Plus
- Speaking with your local council's youth services department
- Visiting Citizens Advice for personalized guidance

Would you like me to explain any of these options in more detail?

2026-01-26T15:11:05.960795 [actor]: That's really helpful, thanks. I think I'll look into the youth support services and maybe the Prince's Trust programs to start with. Jordan needs something to give him direction and confidence right now. I appreciate you explaining why we're not eligible for Child Benefit and suggesting these alternatives. I'll contact our local council about youth services tomorrow.

2026-01-26T15:11:08.450398 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available for a 17-year-old who is not in approved education or training.
