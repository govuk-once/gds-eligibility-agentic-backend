2026-01-26T15:00:18.020434 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T15:00:19.447281 [actor]: I'm a divorced father. My son Lucas, who's 10 years old, lives with his ex-wife Jenny. I don't live with my son, but I do send £150 every month to Jenny specifically for Lucas's food and clothes.

2026-01-26T15:00:21.741706 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since your son Lucas lives with your ex-wife Jenny rather than with you, this affects your Child Benefit eligibility.

Based on your situation as a non-resident parent who provides financial support, I need to understand a bit more about any formal arrangements.

Do you have a family-based arrangement, court order, or any formal agreement regarding who receives Child Benefit for Lucas?

2026-01-26T15:00:23.805799 [actor]: There's no formal agreement about Child Benefit specifically. We just have an informal arrangement where I send the £150 monthly for Lucas's expenses. Jenny hasn't mentioned claiming Child Benefit for him, and as far as I know, she isn't claiming it.

2026-01-26T15:00:27.432167 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me explain how Child Benefit works in your situation.

Generally, Child Benefit is paid to the person who the child lives with. Since Lucas lives with Jenny, she would normally be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, even if there's no formal agreement about it specifically.

As the non-resident parent who doesn't have Lucas living with you, you wouldn't typically be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, despite your financial contributions through the monthly payments.

If Jenny isn't claiming Child Benefit for Lucas, she may want to consider doing so as she would likely be eligible. However, this would be her decision to make.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation or Child Benefit in general?

2026-01-26T15:00:29.671243 [actor]: So just to be clear, I can't claim Child Benefit for Lucas at all even though I'm contributing financially to his upkeep and his mother isn't claiming it? I thought that since I'm sending more money than the Child Benefit amount (which I heard is about £113 per month) and nobody else is claiming it, I might be eligible to claim it myself.

2026-01-26T15:00:33.882391 [root_agent]: I understand your reasoning, but I need to clarify how Child Benefit eligibility works:

You're correct that you're contributing financially to Lucas's upkeep, which is commendable. However, Child Benefit eligibility isn't primarily based on who provides financial support - it's based on who the child lives with.

Since Lucas lives with Jenny (your ex-wife) full-time, she is considered responsible for him in terms of Child Benefit eligibility, even if she hasn't claimed it yet. The rules specify that Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with, regardless of financial contributions from others.

The amount you contribute (£150 monthly) exceeding the Child Benefit rate doesn't change this fundamental eligibility criterion.

If no one is claiming Child Benefit for Lucas, the entitlement remains with Jenny as the parent Lucas lives with, not with you as the non-resident parent.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit that might be relevant to your situation?

2026-01-26T15:00:36.589305 [actor]: I see. So even though Jenny isn't claiming it, I'm still not eligible because Lucas lives with her full-time. That's disappointing, but I understand the rules now. I'll mention to Jenny that she should consider claiming Child Benefit for Lucas since she's eligible. Thanks for explaining this to me.

2026-01-26T15:00:38.757738 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with (Jenny), not to the non-resident parent making financial contributions.
