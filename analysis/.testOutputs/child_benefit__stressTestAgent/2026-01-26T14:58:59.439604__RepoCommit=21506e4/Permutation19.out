2026-01-26T15:05:50.675800 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to determine your eligibility.

First, are you responsible for raising a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:05:52.500728 [actor]: I'm Pete, and I'm separated from my ex-partner Sue. We have a daughter named Holly who is 9 years old. Holly stays with me 3 days a week and with Sue for 4 days a week. We both buy clothes and food for her and share responsibility for her care. I was wondering if I'm eligible to claim Child Benefit for Holly.

2026-01-26T15:05:56.123450 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Pete. I understand your situation with your daughter Holly and your co-parenting arrangement with Sue.

In cases where a child spends time living with different people, only one person can receive Child Benefit for that child. Since Holly stays with Sue for 4 days a week and with you for 3 days a week, Sue would typically be considered the main caregiver as Holly spends more time with her.

However, if Sue agrees not to claim Child Benefit for Holly, or if there are other factors that might make you the main person responsible for Holly, you could potentially claim it instead.

Has Sue already claimed Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-26T15:05:58.597437 [actor]: Yes, I believe Sue has already claimed Child Benefit for Holly. But I've also submitted a claim to HMRC because I don't think it's fair. I take care of Holly for almost half the week, and I spend just as much on her needs as Sue does. We couldn't agree between ourselves on who should claim the benefit, so we both decided to apply.

2026-01-26T15:06:02.822468 [root_agent]: I understand your perspective, Pete, and I appreciate that you're both actively involved in caring for Holly.

In situations where both parents have submitted a claim for Child Benefit for the same child, HMRC will make a decision based on certain criteria. Since Holly spends more time living with Sue (4 days compared to your 3 days), HMRC is likely to consider Sue as the main caregiver and award the Child Benefit to her.

When parents cannot agree, HMRC looks at factors such as:
- Who the child lives with most of the time
- Who has the main responsibility for the child's day-to-day care
- Who pays for the majority of the child's costs

Since you've both already submitted claims, HMRC will review both applications and make a determination. If you disagree with their decision once it's made, you can appeal it.

Would you like to know about any other options you might have in this situation?

2026-01-26T15:06:05.671098 [actor]: I see. So even though I contribute significantly to Holly's care, the fact that she stays with Sue one more day a week will likely mean Sue gets the Child Benefit. That's disappointing, but I understand that HMRC has to make a decision somehow.

What happens after HMRC reviews our applications? Will they contact both of us? And is there anything I can do to strengthen my case if I feel I should be the one receiving the benefit?

2026-01-26T15:06:10.782560 [root_agent]: You're right, Pete. HMRC does need to make a decision based on certain criteria, and the number of days is one factor they consider.

After HMRC reviews both applications, they will contact both you and Sue to inform you of their decision. They will explain which claim has been approved and provide reasons for their decision.

If you want to strengthen your case, you could:

1. Provide evidence of your financial contributions to Holly's care (receipts for clothing, school expenses, activities, etc.)

2. Document your involvement in important aspects of Holly's life, such as attending parent-teacher meetings, medical appointments, or other significant events

3. If your arrangement changes and Holly begins spending equal or more time with you, make sure to inform HMRC

4. If there are special circumstances that make you the main caregiver despite the day split (for example, if you handle most school matters or healthcare decisions), highlight these

If you disagree with HMRC's decision once it's made, you can request a mandatory reconsideration within one month of the decision. If you're still not satisfied after this review, you can appeal to an independent tribunal.

Would you like more information about the appeals process or any other aspect of Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:06:14.102212 [actor]: Thanks for explaining the process. I think I understand now that HMRC will review both our claims and make a decision based on various factors, though it sounds like Sue may have an advantage due to the extra day Holly spends with her.

I'll gather evidence of my financial contributions and my involvement in Holly's life, just in case. Hopefully, HMRC will consider all aspects of our situation.

I believe I have all the information I need for now about my eligibility for Child Benefit. I'll wait to hear from HMRC about their decision on our competing claims.

2026-01-26T15:06:17.276285 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that in split custody situations, only one person can receive Child Benefit, and when both parents claim, HMRC typically awards it to the parent the child lives with most (in this case Sue, who has Holly 4 days vs Pete's 3 days).
