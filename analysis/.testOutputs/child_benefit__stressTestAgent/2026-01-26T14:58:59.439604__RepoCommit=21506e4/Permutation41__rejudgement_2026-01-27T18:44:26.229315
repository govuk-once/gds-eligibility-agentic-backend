2026-01-27T18:50:05.945062 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed to provide the correct outcome. According to the expected outcome, Martin should be eligible for Ben (Full Rate) and not eligible for Jerry by requesting unequal splitting of his contribution, but the agent incorrectly stated that Martin is not eligible for any Child Benefit.
