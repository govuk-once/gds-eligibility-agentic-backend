2026-01-26T15:17:51.549638 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:17:55.367268 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a UK resident inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

I need to respond to the agent's question about whether I'm responsible for a child living with me in the UK.

Based on my situation, I'm Maria, and my 8-year-old daughter has been in the hospital for 14 weeks. I visit her every day but don't spend money on her needs as the hospital provides everything.

I'll respond naturally as someone in this situation would:

Yes, I'm responsible for my 8-year-old daughter. She's actually been in the hospital for the past 14 weeks though. I visit her every day for hours, but she's not physically living with me at the moment because of her hospital stay.

2026-01-26T15:17:58.410652 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Maria. I understand your daughter is currently in the hospital for an extended period, and you visit her regularly.

This is important to know. When a child is in hospital, you can still typically claim Child Benefit even though they're not physically living with you at the moment. The hospital stay is considered temporary.

May I ask, were you already receiving Child Benefit for your daughter before she went into the hospital?

2026-01-26T15:18:00.170715 [actor]: I'll continue roleplaying as Maria in this scenario:

Yes, I've been receiving Child Benefit for my daughter before she went into the hospital. I'm a single mom and have been claiming the benefit since she was born. It's been really helpful for us.

2026-01-26T15:18:02.259028 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Maria. Since you were already receiving Child Benefit for your daughter before her hospital admission, you can continue to receive it while she's in the hospital.

The hospital stay is considered temporary and doesn't affect your eligibility, regardless of how long the stay is. Even though the hospital is currently providing for her daily needs, you remain responsible for her overall care and welfare.

Is your daughter expected to return to live with you after she's discharged from the hospital?

2026-01-26T15:18:04.246808 [actor]: Yes, of course she will be coming back to live with me once she's discharged. Our home is all set up waiting for her. The doctors haven't given me an exact discharge date yet, but I'm hoping it will be soon. I miss having her at home.

2026-01-26T15:18:07.566042 [root_agent]: I understand, and that's good to know. Since your daughter will be returning to live with you after her hospital stay, and you were receiving Child Benefit before her admission, you remain eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit during this period.

Child Benefit continues during temporary absences like hospital stays regardless of the duration, as you remain responsible for her care overall. You don't need to notify the Child Benefit Office about this temporary hospital stay unless it becomes permanent or your circumstances change in other ways.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement during your daughter's hospital stay?

2026-01-26T15:18:10.742620 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm still eligible. Actually, I was a bit worried because I heard something about benefits changing if a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks. My daughter has been in for 14 weeks now, and I visit her every day, but the hospital provides everything she needs - all her food, clothes, and medical supplies. I don't actually spend any money on her care at the moment. Does that affect anything?

2026-01-26T15:18:14.871341 [root_agent]: I understand your concern, Maria. There's sometimes confusion about different benefit rules.

For Child Benefit specifically, there is no 12-week rule that would affect your eligibility. Child Benefit continues regardless of how long your daughter remains in the hospital, even though it's been 14 weeks already. This is because:

1. The hospital stay is considered temporary
2. You remain responsible for your daughter
3. She will be returning to your home after discharge
4. You were claiming Child Benefit before her hospital admission

The fact that you're not currently paying for her daily needs while she's in the hospital doesn't affect your Child Benefit eligibility. The hospital providing her immediate care and necessities is normal during hospitalization, but you remain her parent and primary caregiver overall.

This differs from some other benefits which might have different rules regarding hospital stays, which might be where you heard about a 12-week limit.

Is your mind more at ease regarding your Child Benefit continuation now?

2026-01-26T15:18:17.221355 [actor]: Yes, that's really put my mind at ease. I was getting worried that I might lose the benefit since I haven't been spending money on her while she's in the hospital. It's good to know I'll still receive it. The hospital staff has been great about providing everything she needs right now, but I'll need the benefit when she comes home. Thank you for clarifying that for me.

2026-01-26T15:18:20.125151 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent was correct that Child Benefit continues during a child's temporary hospital stay regardless of duration, as the parent remains responsible for the child's overall care.
