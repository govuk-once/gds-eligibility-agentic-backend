2026-01-26T15:07:26.772906 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:07:28.750310 [actor]: I'll need to answer as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll role-play this conversation based on the provided context.

Yes, I have a daughter named Sarah who is 12 years old, but she doesn't live with me. I'm 50 years old.

2026-01-26T15:07:30.782518 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that you have a 12-year-old daughter named Sarah who doesn't live with you.

Since your child doesn't live with you, I need to understand more about the living arrangement. Does Sarah live with someone else, such as the other parent or guardian?

2026-01-26T15:07:31.810777 [actor]: Yes, Sarah lives with her mother. We're separated, and Sarah lives with her mum full-time.

2026-01-26T15:07:34.060475 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that Sarah lives with her mother full-time since you're separated.

When a child lives with someone else, usually only one person can claim Child Benefit for that child, and it's typically the person the child lives with (in this case, Sarah's mother).

May I ask if you contribute financially to Sarah's upbringing through child maintenance payments?

2026-01-26T15:07:35.418623 [actor]: I don't pay weekly maintenance payments, but every 4 weeks I buy a large bulk order of groceries and clothes for Sarah that costs about £120. I deliver these directly to her mother for Sarah's use.

2026-01-26T15:07:39.217092 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that you contribute to Sarah's upbringing by providing groceries and clothes worth about £120 every 4 weeks, rather than making formal maintenance payments.

Based on the UK government rules, since Sarah lives full-time with her mother and you don't have main responsibility for her day-to-day care, you would not typically be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah. Child Benefit is usually paid to the person who has main responsibility for the child, which appears to be Sarah's mother in this situation.

Your contributions through groceries and clothes are valuable support for Sarah, but they don't typically qualify you for Child Benefit when Sarah lives full-time with her mother.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility that might be relevant to your situation?

2026-01-26T15:07:40.543027 [actor]: So just to be clear, even though I'm providing about £30 per week worth of support through these bulk purchases, I'm not eligible because Sarah lives with her mother full-time?

2026-01-26T15:07:44.269377 [root_agent]: That's correct. According to UK government rules, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who has main responsibility for caring for the child on a day-to-day basis, which in this case is Sarah's mother since Sarah lives with her full-time.

While your financial contribution of approximately £30 per week in goods is significant and important support for Sarah, it doesn't change the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. The benefit is designed to go to the person with whom the child primarily lives and who has responsibility for their day-to-day care.

If circumstances were to change significantly - such as if Sarah began living with you for an equal or greater amount of time - then the eligibility situation might be different. But based on the current arrangement you've described, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah.

2026-01-26T15:07:46.008366 [actor]: I understand now. Thank you for explaining that. Since Sarah lives with her mother full-time, I'm not eligible for Child Benefit even though I provide financial support through these regular bulk purchases.

2026-01-26T15:07:48.725429 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately informed me that Child Benefit is paid to the person with main responsibility for the child's day-to-day care (Sarah's mother in this case), and my financial contributions through groceries and clothes don't qualify me when Sarah lives full-time with her mother.
