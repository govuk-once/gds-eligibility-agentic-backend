According to the rules, there is a 12-week limit for hospital stays, and the "linking rule" applies since Arthur returned to hospital within 28 days of leaving. Since Arthur has been in hospital for a cumulative 13 weeks (10+3), Jenny is not eligible for Child Benefit unless she's spending money on his upkeep.
