2026-01-26T15:05:27.140678 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To do this, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you who you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T15:05:28.745226 [actor]: I'll play the role of a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll engage with the agent as someone matching the situation described.

Hello, yes, I have my son Dev who I'm responsible for. He lives with me.

2026-01-26T15:05:29.695133 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. How old is your son Dev?

2026-01-26T15:05:31.024366 [actor]: My son Dev is 20 now. He just had his birthday in the middle of this term. He's 20 years old.

2026-01-26T15:05:32.467085 [root_agent]: I understand your son Dev is 20 years old. Is Dev currently in education or training? If so, could you tell me what type of education or training he is in?

2026-01-26T15:05:34.004534 [actor]: Yes, Dev is in full-time education. He's studying for his A-levels at the local sixth form college. He turned 20 during this current term, but he's still completing his A-level courses.

2026-01-26T15:05:36.105737 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to check a few more details about Dev's education.

Is Dev's education considered "approved" education? This typically includes A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, Scottish Highers, or other similar qualifications provided through schools or colleges, rather than advanced education like university degrees.

2026-01-26T15:05:37.845328 [actor]: Yes, he's doing his A-levels at the local sixth form college. It's definitely approved education - just standard A-levels, not university or anything advanced like that. He's completing his final year of A-levels now.

2026-01-26T15:05:39.527490 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Now, I need to understand your household income situation. 

Is there anyone in your household (you or a partner) who has an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:05:41.097757 [actor]: No, my income is around £50,000 per year. I don't have a partner living with me - it's just me and Dev in our household. So no one in our household has an income over £60,000.

2026-01-26T15:05:44.362058 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that your son Dev would not be eligible for Child Benefit. This is because Child Benefit can only be claimed for children under 16 years old, or under 20 years old if they're in approved education or training. However, the upper age limit is strictly "up to their 20th birthday" - not beyond.

Since Dev has already turned 20, he has passed the age threshold for Child Benefit eligibility, even though he is still completing his A-levels.

If you have any other children under 16 (or under 20 and in approved education), they may still be eligible for Child Benefit.

2026-01-26T15:05:46.887783 [actor]: I see. So even though Dev is still in the middle of his A-levels, because he's turned 20 now, we're not eligible for Child Benefit anymore. That's unfortunate timing with him still being in his studies, but I understand there's an age cutoff. Thank you for explaining this to me.

2026-01-26T15:05:48.887870 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available once a child turns 20, even if they remain in approved education, which aligns with UK government rules.
