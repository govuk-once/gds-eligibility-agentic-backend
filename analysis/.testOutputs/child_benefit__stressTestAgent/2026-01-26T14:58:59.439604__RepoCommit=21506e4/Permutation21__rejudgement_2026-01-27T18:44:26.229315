2026-01-27T18:49:47.443053 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed to address the specific question asked about the "eldest child rate" in the final message. According to the given scenario, both parents should receive the higher rate of £26.05 for their respective children since they each have the "eldest" child in their household after separation. The agent did not confirm this critical detail which was part of the expected outcome.
