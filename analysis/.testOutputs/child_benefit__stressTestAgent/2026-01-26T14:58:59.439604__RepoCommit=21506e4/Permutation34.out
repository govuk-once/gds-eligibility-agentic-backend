Let me help assess whether you're eligible for Child Benefit based on UK government rules. I'll need to ask several questions to determine this, but I'll ask them one at a time.

First, I should establish if they have a child or children they're responsible for, as this is the fundamental requirement for Child Benefit.

Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To start, may I ask if you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T15:12:51.899765 [actor]: I'm Lisa. My son Mark is 15 years old but he's been sentenced to a youth custody center for 6 months. He's been there for 10 weeks now. I was receiving Child Benefit for him before he went into custody, but I'm not sure if I'm still eligible.

Thank you for providing that context, Lisa. This is a specific situation regarding Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in custody.

Based on the information from gov.uk about Child Benefit eligibility, I need to check the rules about children in care or custody.

Looking at the information from https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, Child Benefit stops if a child goes into prison, youth custody, or other detention for more than 8 weeks.

Lisa mentioned that her son Mark has been in a youth custody center for 10 weeks now, which is longer than the 8-week threshold. Since it's been more than 8 weeks, she would no longer be eligible for Child Benefit for Mark.

I should ask if she has informed HMRC about this change in circumstances.

Thank you for that information, Lisa. Based on UK government rules, Child Benefit typically stops if a child goes into youth custody or detention for more than 8 weeks. Since your son Mark has been in custody for 10 weeks now, which exceeds the 8-week threshold, I'm afraid you are no longer eligible to receive Child Benefit for him during this period.

Have you already informed HMRC (HM Revenue and Customs) about Mark's situation?

2026-01-26T15:12:59.507376 [actor]: No, I haven't informed HMRC about this yet. I wasn't sure what the rules were or if I needed to tell them. So you're saying I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore because Mark has been in custody for more than 8 weeks? Will I get it back when he comes home?

2026-01-26T15:13:07.540367 [root_agent]: #Thinking
Lisa hasn't informed HMRC yet, and she's asking two important questions:
1. Whether she's no longer eligible since Mark has been in custody for over 8 weeks
2. Whether she'll get Child Benefit back when Mark returns home

Let me address these based on the government guidance:

According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, Child Benefit stops after a child has been in custody for more than 8 weeks. Since Mark has been there for 10 weeks, she is no longer eligible.

As for when Mark returns home, the same guidance indicates that she should be able to claim Child Benefit again when he's released and returns to living with her, as long as she's still responsible for him and he meets the other eligibility criteria (under 16, or under 20 and in approved education or training).

I should also advise her that she needs to inform HMRC about this change in circumstances, as continuing to receive benefits she's not entitled to could potentially lead to an overpayment that might need to be repaid.
#End_thinking

That's correct, Lisa. Since Mark has been in custody for more than 8 weeks (10 weeks now), you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit for him during this period.

The good news is that yes, you should be able to claim Child Benefit again when Mark is released and returns to live with you, assuming he'll still be under 16 (or under 20 if he goes into approved education or training).

I would recommend contacting HMRC as soon as possible to inform them about Mark's situation. This is important because if you continue to receive payments you're not eligible for, it could result in an overpayment that you might need to pay back later. You can report this change in circumstances through your Child Benefit online account or by contacting the Child Benefit Office directly.

Would you like me to explain how you can contact HMRC about this?

2026-01-26T15:13:09.313654 [actor]: Yes, that would be helpful. I didn't realize I needed to tell them about this. How do I contact HMRC to let them know about Mark's situation? And do you know how soon after he comes home I can start receiving the benefit again?

2026-01-26T15:13:17.758223 [root_agent]: #Thinking
Lisa is asking for two pieces of information:
1. How to contact HMRC to inform them about Mark's situation
2. How soon after Mark's return she can receive Child Benefit again

For contacting HMRC, I should provide her with the options available. Although I was instructed not to provide links, I can share contact information.

The main ways to contact the Child Benefit Office are:
- Through the online Child Benefit service
- By phone
- By mail

For the second question about when she can restart receiving benefits, based on the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, she should be able to claim Child Benefit again as soon as Mark returns home, but she'll need to inform HMRC when this happens. The benefit doesn't automatically restart - she'll need to notify them of the change in circumstances.
#End_thinking

I'd be happy to help with that information, Lisa.

To contact HMRC about Mark's situation, you have several options:

1. By phone: Call the Child Benefit Helpline at 0300 200 3100 (Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm). Have your National Insurance number and Child Benefit reference number ready if possible.

2. By post: Write to:
   Child Benefit Office
   PO Box 1
   Newcastle Upon Tyne
   NE88 1AA

3. Online: If you have a Government Gateway account, you can report changes through your online Child Benefit account.

Regarding when you can start receiving the benefit again: You should contact HMRC as soon as Mark returns home. The benefit doesn't restart automatically - you'll need to notify them of his return. Once you've informed them that Mark is back in your care, the benefit can typically be reinstated from the date he returns home, assuming he still meets all other eligibility criteria (such as age and education requirements).

When you contact them, explain both the current situation and when you expect Mark to return home. They can advise you on any specific documentation you might need to provide when the time comes.

2026-01-26T15:13:19.880343 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that. I'll call the Child Benefit Helpline to let them know about Mark's situation. And I'll make sure to contact them again when he comes home in about 4 months to restart the payments. That's really helpful information.

2026-01-26T15:13:22.992397 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops after a child has been in custody for more than 8 weeks (Lisa's son had been in custody for 10 weeks), and correctly advised that she could claim again when her son returns home.
