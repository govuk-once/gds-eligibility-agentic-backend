2026-01-26T15:01:52.045928 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:01:53.944872 [actor]: I need to respond as if I'm someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility in the UK. Based on my context, I'm Lars, a German citizen with Pre-Settled Status in the UK.

Yes, I have responsibility for my son Hans who is 5 years old.

2026-01-26T15:01:55.857629 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Lars. Since you have responsibility for your 5-year-old son Hans, that's an important first criterion.

As you mentioned you're a German citizen with Pre-Settled Status in the UK, I need to ask: Does your son Hans live with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:01:57.155878 [actor]: Yes, my son Hans lives with me here in the UK. We moved here together recently.

2026-01-26T15:01:58.999172 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that Hans lives with you in the UK.

Since you mentioned you have Pre-Settled Status, I need to ask: Do you have the right to reside in the UK? This would typically be the case with Pre-Settled Status, but I want to confirm.

2026-01-26T15:02:00.142060 [actor]: Yes, I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme, which gives me the right to reside in the UK. I moved here recently from Germany.

2026-01-26T15:02:01.874722 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you have the right to reside in the UK through your Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme.

Next question: Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control that states "no recourse to public funds"?

2026-01-26T15:02:03.329947 [actor]: No, I'm not subject to immigration control with "no recourse to public funds." My Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme allows me access to public funds.

2026-01-26T15:02:04.482523 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your Pre-Settled Status allows you access to public funds.

Does anyone else receive Child Benefit for Hans already?

2026-01-26T15:02:05.570657 [actor]: No, nobody else receives Child Benefit for Hans. It's just me taking care of him.

2026-01-26T15:02:08.961645 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else receives Child Benefit for Hans.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears that you are likely eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have responsibility for Hans, who is 5 years old (under 16)
2. Hans lives with you in the UK
3. You have the right to reside in the UK through your Pre-Settled Status
4. You're not subject to immigration control that restricts access to public funds
5. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Hans

One final question: Are you (or your partner, if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year? If so, you'd still be eligible but might have to pay a tax charge known as the 'High Income Child Benefit Charge'.

2026-01-26T15:02:10.286986 [actor]: No, I'm currently unemployed and looking for work. I've registered as a jobseeker. I don't earn anywhere near £60,000 per year.

2026-01-26T15:02:14.099892 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're currently unemployed and not earning anywhere near £60,000 per year, you wouldn't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on all the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for your son Hans. You meet all the key criteria:

1. You have responsibility for Hans, who is 5 years old
2. Hans lives with you in the UK
3. You have the right to reside in the UK through your Pre-Settled Status
4. You're not subject to immigration control restrictions
5. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Hans
6. You're not earning over the threshold that would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge

You can apply for Child Benefit through the UK government website. The standard rate for your first child would be £24.00 per week (as of my last update, though rates may change).

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:02:15.666920 [actor]: That's great news! I'm happy to hear I'm eligible for Child Benefit for Hans. Yes, I would appreciate information on how to apply for it.

2026-01-26T15:02:18.021321 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Lars, with Pre-Settled Status, caring for his 5-year-old son Hans in the UK, is eligible for Child Benefit as all eligibility criteria were met.
