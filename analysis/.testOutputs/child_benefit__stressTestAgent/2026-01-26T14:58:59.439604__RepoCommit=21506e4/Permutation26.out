2026-01-26T15:09:12.165342 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you a few questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T15:09:13.891633 [actor]: Hi there. I'm Mo, I'm 40 years old. I have a son named Zahid who's 15, but he actually lives with my sister (his aunt). I still want to support him though, and I was wondering if I could get Child Benefit.

2026-01-26T15:09:16.664506 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context, Mo. I understand that your son Zahid is 15 and lives with your sister.

In situations where a child doesn't live with you, there are specific rules about Child Benefit eligibility. 

Since Zahid lives with your sister, typically the person who the child lives with would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit. However, let me ask: Do you contribute at least the same amount as the weekly rate of Child Benefit toward caring for Zahid?

2026-01-26T15:09:18.474240 [actor]: Yes, I send my sister £15 every week for Zahid. And my mother (Zahid's grandmother) also sends my sister another £15 per week to help support him. My sister isn't claiming any Child Benefit for him at the moment.

2026-01-26T15:09:22.549698 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mo. I understand you send £15 weekly to your sister for Zahid, and your mother also sends £15 weekly. You've also mentioned that your sister isn't currently claiming Child Benefit for Zahid.

The current weekly Child Benefit rate for an eldest or only child is £25.60, and for additional children it's £16.95 per child. Based on what you've told me, the combined contribution from you and your mother is £30 per week, which exceeds the Child Benefit rate.

For you to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid even though he lives with your sister, you would need to:

1. Be contributing at least the same amount as the weekly Child Benefit rate (which you appear to be doing combined with your mother)
2. Have your sister agree that you should be the person claiming Child Benefit

Is your sister in agreement that you should be the person to claim Child Benefit for Zahid?

2026-01-26T15:09:24.020822 [actor]: Yes, my sister is fine with me claiming the Child Benefit. She knows I want to help support Zahid financially, and she's not interested in claiming it herself. So she's completely in agreement with me claiming it.

2026-01-26T15:09:27.386369 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your sister agrees with you claiming Child Benefit for Zahid. 

Based on what you've shared, it appears you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid because:
1. You contribute financially to his care (along with your mother)
2. The total contribution exceeds the weekly Child Benefit rate
3. Your sister, who Zahid lives with, agrees that you should claim it
4. No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for him

Let me ask one more important question: Is Zahid in full-time education or approved training? This is important because Child Benefit typically stops on August 31st after a child turns 16, but can continue if they stay in approved education or training.

2026-01-26T15:09:28.551094 [actor]: Yes, Zahid is in full-time education. He's still in school and working toward his GCSEs right now. He's doing well in his studies too.

2026-01-26T15:09:33.235894 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mo. It's good to hear that Zahid is doing well in his studies.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears that you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid because:

1. You contribute financially to his care, and the total contribution exceeds the weekly Child Benefit rate
2. Your sister, who Zahid lives with, agrees that you should claim it
3. No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for him
4. Zahid is 15 and in full-time education, which means he meets the age requirement (Child Benefit can continue until a child turns 16, and potentially up to age 20 if they remain in approved education or training)

You would need to apply for Child Benefit by filling out the Child Benefit claim form CH2, explaining your circumstances. You should mention that Zahid lives with your sister, that you contribute financially to his care, and that your sister agrees to you claiming the benefit.

You can find the Child Benefit claim form on the UK government website. Would you like me to explain anything else about the application process?

2026-01-26T15:09:36.127859 [actor]: That's great news! I'm happy to hear that I can claim Child Benefit for Zahid. I'll make sure to fill out the CH2 form and explain all the circumstances you mentioned. No further questions at the moment - you've been very helpful in explaining everything. I'll go ahead with the application process. Thank you!

2026-01-26T15:09:38.944190 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that the user may be eligible for Child Benefit because they contribute financially above the weekly rate, have agreement from the sister who Zahid lives with, no one else is claiming the benefit, and Zahid is in approved education.
