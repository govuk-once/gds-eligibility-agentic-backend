2026-01-27T18:49:36.276964 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly determined the user was ineligible for Child Benefit when they should be eligible. According to UK guidance, providing regular contributions that equal or exceed the weekly Child Benefit rate (£30/week vs £26.05 threshold) can qualify someone for Child Benefit even if they don't live with the child.
