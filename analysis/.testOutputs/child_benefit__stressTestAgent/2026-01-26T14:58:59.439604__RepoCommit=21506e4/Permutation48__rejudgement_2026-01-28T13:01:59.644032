2026-01-28T13:07:50.387559 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly informed the user they were eligible for Child Benefit. HNC courses are considered "advanced education" (Level 4), but Child Benefit is only available for children in "non-advanced" education (up to Level 3/A-Level standard). The expected outcome was "Not Eligible."
