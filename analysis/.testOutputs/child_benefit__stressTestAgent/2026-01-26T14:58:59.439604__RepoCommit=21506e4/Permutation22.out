2026-01-26T15:07:01.600972 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:07:03.029561 [actor]: I'll play the role of Jenny, a mother with a son who has been in the hospital.

Hello, yes I have a son named Arthur who is 7 years old.

2026-01-26T15:07:04.962803 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your situation, Jenny. I understand you have a 7-year-old son named Arthur.

Since Arthur is under 16, you potentially qualify for Child Benefit based on his age. Now I'd like to ask: Are you responsible for Arthur's care? By this I mean, do you normally live with him or are you his main caregiver?

2026-01-26T15:07:06.621772 [actor]: Yes, I am Arthur's mother and his main caregiver. He normally lives with me, but he's been in the hospital quite a bit recently. He was in for 10 weeks, then came home for about 2 weeks, but unfortunately got sick again and had to go back to the hospital. He's been back in for 3 weeks now.

2026-01-26T15:07:09.444245 [root_agent]: I understand, Jenny. I'm sorry to hear that Arthur has been in the hospital for extended periods. This must be a difficult time for both of you.

Regarding your Child Benefit eligibility: You can continue to receive Child Benefit for a child who is in hospital, as this is considered a temporary absence from home. There's no limit to how long you can claim Child Benefit while your child is in hospital, as long as you're still responsible for their care and you regularly visit or maintain contact with them.

May I ask, do you visit or maintain contact with Arthur while he's in the hospital?

2026-01-26T15:07:11.009751 [actor]: Yes, I visit Arthur at the hospital almost every day. I bring him clean clothes, his favorite toys, and books to read. I try to be there for him as much as possible during this difficult time. The hospital staff know me well by now since I spend so much time there with him.

2026-01-26T15:07:13.787693 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Jenny. It's clear you're maintaining close contact with Arthur and continuing to fulfill your parental responsibilities while he's in the hospital.

Based on what you've told me, you remain eligible for Child Benefit during Arthur's hospital stays. The fact that you visit him regularly, bring him personal items, and maintain your parental role means you're still responsible for his care even during this temporary hospital admission.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement while Arthur is in the hospital?

2026-01-26T15:07:16.729895 [actor]: That's a relief to hear that I'm still eligible. I was worried because between his two hospital stays, he's been in for a total of 13 weeks now (10 weeks initially, then home for 2 weeks, and now another 3 weeks). I had heard something about a 12-week rule for children in hospitals, so I wasn't sure if I'd still get the benefit. Is there any time limit I should be aware of, or does it not matter how long he stays in the hospital?

2026-01-26T15:07:19.971142 [root_agent]: I understand your concern about the time limit, Jenny. Let me clarify this for you.

For children in hospital, there is actually no time limit on how long you can continue to receive Child Benefit. The 12-week rule you may have heard about applies to children in residential care or similar settings, but not to children in hospital.

Since Arthur is in hospital for medical treatment and you continue to visit him regularly and maintain your parental responsibilities, you remain eligible for Child Benefit regardless of how long his hospital stay lasts. The hospital stays, even though they've been lengthy, are considered temporary absences from home.

So you can be reassured that your Child Benefit should continue without interruption during Arthur's hospital stay, no matter how long his treatment takes.

2026-01-26T15:07:22.241645 [actor]: Oh, that's really helpful to know! I was getting quite worried about our finances with all of these hospital stays. So even if Arthur needs to stay in hospital for several more months, I'll still continue to receive the Child Benefit? That's a weight off my mind. Thank you for clarifying that for me.

2026-01-26T15:07:25.256356 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent incorrectly stated there is no time limit for Child Benefit when a child is in hospital. According to gov.uk, Child Benefit can only continue for up to 12 weeks if the child is in hospital, unless the parent bears some of the costs of the child's accommodation or maintenance.
