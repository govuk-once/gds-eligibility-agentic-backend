2026-01-26T15:11:09.936596 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T15:11:10.976149 [actor]: Yes, I have two children living with me. My son is 5 and my daughter is 3.

2026-01-26T15:11:12.330807 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. That's helpful to know.

Are you responsible for raising these children who live with you? This means you're the main person who takes care of them day-to-day.

2026-01-26T15:11:13.860857 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for raising my children. My wife and I both take care of them, but I handle most of the day-to-day childcare since I work fewer hours than she does.

2026-01-26T15:11:15.542530 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that you're responsible for raising your children along with your wife.

May I ask if you or your wife are already receiving Child Benefit for these children?

2026-01-26T15:11:16.754111 [actor]: No, neither of us is currently receiving Child Benefit for our children. We've never applied for it before.

2026-01-26T15:11:18.592704 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Do you or your wife have an individual income over £60,000 per year? (This is relevant because of the High Income Child Benefit Charge that might apply.)

2026-01-26T15:11:19.810610 [actor]: I earn about £18,000 per year, but my wife Emily earns £65,000 annually.

2026-01-26T15:11:24.598190 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your household income.

Since your wife's individual income is over £60,000 per year, your family can still claim Child Benefit, but you should be aware that the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply. This means that if your wife claims it, or if you claim it and live with your wife, the benefit would effectively be canceled out by the tax charge.

You have two options:
1. You can claim Child Benefit but opt out of receiving payments to avoid the tax charge
2. You can claim and receive the payments, but your wife would need to pay back the entire amount through the tax system via Self Assessment

Even if you opt out of receiving payments, registering for Child Benefit can help protect your State Pension and ensure your children get their National Insurance number automatically before they turn 16.

Would you like me to ask any further questions about your eligibility, or would you like more details about either of these options?

2026-01-26T15:11:27.040499 [actor]: So if I understand correctly, we can still claim the Child Benefit, but since my wife earns over £60,000, we'd have to pay it all back through her taxes? 

Even though I would be the one claiming it and receiving it in my bank account, she would still be the one who has to pay the tax charge?

2026-01-26T15:11:31.821015 [root_agent]: You've understood the key points correctly, but let me clarify how it works:

Yes, you can claim Child Benefit as the main caregiver, and it would be paid into your bank account. However, since you live with your wife whose individual income is over £60,000, the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply.

The tax charge always applies to the highest earner in the household where Child Benefit is received - in this case, your wife. She would need to pay back 100% of the Child Benefit through her Self Assessment tax return, regardless of which one of you actually receives the payment.

So even though you would receive the payments in your bank account, your wife would have to register for Self Assessment (if she isn't already) and pay back the equivalent amount through the tax system.

That's why many families in your situation choose to claim but opt out of receiving payments - this way you still register for Child Benefit (protecting your National Insurance credits and ensuring your children get their National Insurance numbers automatically) without having to deal with the tax charge.

2026-01-26T15:11:35.052052 [actor]: I see now, thank you for explaining. That seems a bit complicated, but I understand. So even though I would be the claimant receiving the money, Emily would be the one who has to pay it all back since she's the higher earner. 

We'll need to decide if it's worth claiming and paying it back, or just claiming but opting out of the payments. 

I appreciate your help in understanding how this works for our situation.

2026-01-26T15:11:38.029321 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that while the family can claim Child Benefit, they would be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge since one parent earns over £60,000, meaning the full amount would need to be repaid through Self Assessment.
