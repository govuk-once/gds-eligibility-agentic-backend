2026-01-26T14:59:39.692284 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:59:42.519256 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility.

I'm Gary, a 50-year-old father with a 17-year-old son named Ben who lives with me. Ben left school in June and didn't go to college, but he's registered with the local youth careers service and is actively looking for an apprenticeship. It's currently August, so it's been less than 20 weeks since he left education.

To respond to the agent's first question:

Yes, I'm responsible for my son Ben. He's 17 and has recently left school, but he's registered with the careers service and looking for an apprenticeship.

2026-01-26T14:59:44.970165 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Gary. I understand you have a 17-year-old son named Ben who recently left school and is registered with the local youth careers service while looking for an apprenticeship.

Since Ben is over 16, I need to check if he meets the criteria for approved education or training. May I ask if Ben is registered with a careers service, local authority support service, Connexions, or similar organization that helps young people find work or education?

2026-01-26T14:59:46.457692 [actor]: Yes, he's registered with our local youth careers service. They're helping him look for apprenticeship opportunities in the area. He's been meeting with his advisor regularly since he left school in June.

2026-01-26T14:59:48.428674 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Gary. It's helpful to know that Ben is registered with your local youth careers service and is actively working with an advisor to find apprenticeship opportunities.

Is Ben participating in any training programs provided by the careers service while he's looking for an apprenticeship?

2026-01-26T14:59:50.376435 [actor]: No, he's not in any training programs right now. He's just working with his advisor at the careers service who's helping him search for apprenticeship positions and prepare for interviews. They've been helping him with his CV and application forms, but he's not enrolled in any formal training yet - he's mainly focused on finding the right apprenticeship opportunity.

2026-01-26T14:59:51.818346 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Gary. 

Since Ben is 17, not in approved education or training currently, but is registered with a careers service, I need to confirm one more thing: Has it been less than 20 weeks since he left approved education (his school)?

2026-01-26T14:59:52.953909 [actor]: Yes, it's definitely been less than 20 weeks. He only left school in June, and it's currently August, so it's been about 2 months since he finished school.

2026-01-26T14:59:55.705748 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Gary. Since Ben left school in June and it's currently August, it has been less than 20 weeks since he left approved education.

Based on the information you've provided:
- Ben is 17 years old
- He's registered with a careers service
- It's been less than 20 weeks since he left approved education

You should be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Ben. When a young person leaves approved education or training, Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks if they register with a careers service, Connexions, local authority support service, or similar organization that helps young people find work or education.

Is Ben living with you full-time?

2026-01-26T14:59:56.950321 [actor]: Yes, Ben lives with me full-time. It's just the two of us in the house since his mother isn't in the picture anymore.

2026-01-26T15:00:00.346368 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Ben lives with you full-time, Gary.

Based on all the information you've provided, you are eligible for Child Benefit for Ben because:

1. You are responsible for Ben, who is 17 years old
2. Ben is registered with a careers service after leaving school
3. It has been less than 20 weeks since he left approved education
4. Ben lives with you full-time

You can continue receiving Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when Ben left education in June, as long as he remains registered with the careers service. This extension gives young people time to find work or further education opportunities.

If Ben starts an approved education or training program before the 20-week period ends, your Child Benefit could continue until he reaches 19 or completes the course.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T15:00:02.627884 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for Child Benefit for Ben during this transition period. I'm glad to hear I can continue receiving it while he's looking for an apprenticeship. That helps a lot with our household budget.

2026-01-26T15:00:04.931278 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately stated that Gary is eligible for Child Benefit for his 17-year-old son who left school less than 20 weeks ago and is registered with a careers service.
