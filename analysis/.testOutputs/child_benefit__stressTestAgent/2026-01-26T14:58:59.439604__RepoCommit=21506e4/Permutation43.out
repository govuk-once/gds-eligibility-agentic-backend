2026-01-26T15:16:57.805490 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you several questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:16:59.399161 [actor]: I'll now role-play as a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hello there. Yes, I have a son named Callum who is 17 years old. He lives with me in Glasgow. I'm a single father raising him on my own.

2026-01-26T15:17:01.395747 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about your son Callum. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask: Is Callum currently in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved courses.

2026-01-26T15:17:03.850254 [actor]: Oh, Callum isn't in school anymore. He's actually just started a Modern Apprenticeship here in Glasgow a few months ago. He's learning a trade and getting some money for it too, which helps a bit with our expenses, but it's not much.

2026-01-26T15:17:05.831892 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to determine if Callum's Modern Apprenticeship qualifies as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Could you please tell me if Callum's apprenticeship is unpaid or if it's a paid apprenticeship where he earns more than £264 per week (after tax and expenses)?

2026-01-26T15:17:07.588576 [actor]: His apprenticeship is paid, but he definitely doesn't earn anywhere near £264 per week after tax. He's just starting out, so I think he gets about £150 a week at the moment. It's his first proper job-type thing since leaving school.

2026-01-26T15:17:09.414996 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Callum is under 20 and in a paid apprenticeship earning less than £264 per week, this likely qualifies as approved education or training.

Next question: Do you live in the UK? And are you a UK citizen, have settled status, or have permission to live in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:17:10.954905 [actor]: Yes, we've always lived in the UK. We're in Glasgow, Scotland. I was born here, so I'm definitely a UK citizen. Been living in the same area for most of my life actually.

2026-01-26T15:17:12.458994 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK citizen living in the UK.

Now I need to ask about Callum's living situation: Does Callum live with you full-time, or does he split time between your home and another person's home?

2026-01-26T15:17:13.765046 [actor]: Callum lives with me full-time. It's just the two of us in our flat. Has been that way since his mum left when he was little.

2026-01-26T15:17:14.993005 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now I need to ask about your income: Do you or a partner you live with have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:17:16.623981 [actor]: No, my income is nowhere near £50,000. I work in maintenance at a local factory. I make about £28,000 a year, and I don't have a partner. It's just me supporting Callum.

2026-01-26T15:17:20.445977 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about your income.

Based on everything you've shared, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have responsibility for Callum, who is 17 years old
2. Callum is in approved education/training (a paid apprenticeship earning less than £264 per week)
3. You and Callum live in the UK and you are a UK citizen
4. Callum lives with you full-time
5. Your individual income is below the £50,000 threshold (at which point Child Benefit starts to be taxed)

You should be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Callum until he turns 20, as long as he continues in his approved apprenticeship and your circumstances don't change significantly.

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:17:23.094945 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know I'm eligible for Child Benefit. That's great news and will really help with our finances.

Actually, I just wanted to double-check about Callum's apprenticeship. I wasn't sure if his Modern Apprenticeship would count or not. So I can continue receiving it until he turns 20 as long as he stays in this apprenticeship?

Yes, I would appreciate some information on how to apply.

2026-01-26T15:17:24.278142 [actor]: I've invoked the exit_loop function as requested since the agent has provided an eligibility determination regarding your Child Benefit claim.

2026-01-26T15:17:25.781488 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that a 17-year-old on a paid Modern Apprenticeship earning less than £264 weekly qualifies for Child Benefit until age 20.
