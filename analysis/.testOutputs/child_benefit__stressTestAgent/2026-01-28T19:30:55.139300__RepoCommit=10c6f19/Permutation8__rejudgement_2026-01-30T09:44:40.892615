**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit but subject to a tax charge**, which aligns perfectly with the expected outcome: "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)."

The agent's assessment was accurate and comprehensive:

1. **Eligibility confirmation**: The agent clearly stated "You are eligible for Child Benefit for Ruby" (✓)

2. **Tax charge identification**: The agent correctly identified that the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) applies because Fiona earns £75,000, which exceeds the £60,000 threshold

3. **Charge calculation**: The agent accurately calculated that approximately 75% of the benefit would need to be paid back (1% for every £200 over £60,000: £75,000 - £60,000 = £15,000 ÷ £200 = 75%)

4. **Clear communication of options**: The agent explained both options available (claim and pay back, or opt out of payments while still registering)

The user's final acknowledgment ("ok so eligible then need to pay back some got it") confirms they understood the outcome correctly. The evaluation judge also marked this as a pass (✓), agreeing that eligibility was correctly determined with the HICBC implications properly explained.

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome precisely: eligible for the benefit, but subject to the tax charge.
