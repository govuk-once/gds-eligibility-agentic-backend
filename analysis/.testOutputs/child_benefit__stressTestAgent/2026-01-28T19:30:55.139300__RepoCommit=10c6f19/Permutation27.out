2026-01-28T19:47:52.303453 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child (or children) under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T19:47:54.011100 [actor]: bby 6 months old can i clam

2026-01-28T19:47:56.552656 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information! So you have a 6-month-old baby - that's great.

Now I need to ask you:

**Are you responsible for the child? This means you live with the child and are looking after them, or you're paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent in kind) towards looking after them?**

2026-01-28T19:47:58.087267 [actor]: yes i look after bby live with parents tho

2026-01-28T19:48:00.636834 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you look after your baby and you live with your parents.

Let me ask you this:

**Are you the main person responsible for the baby, or is someone else (such as one of your parents) the main person looking after the baby?**

This is important because usually only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, and it should be the person who has main responsibility.

2026-01-28T19:48:02.289669 [actor]: i am main person i want to clam for my bby

2026-01-28T19:48:04.611984 [root_agent]: That's good to know - you are the main person responsible for your baby.

Now I need to ask:

**Do you normally live in the UK? Or if you're not in the UK right now, are you a Crown servant (like a diplomat or member of HM Forces) or living with a Crown servant?**

2026-01-28T19:48:05.937520 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T19:48:08.558970 [root_agent]: Excellent! You live in the UK and are the main person responsible for your 6-month-old baby.

Let me ask you one more important question:

**Are you or your partner subject to immigration control? This means, do you need permission to enter or stay in the UK, and does that permission say you have "no recourse to public funds"?**

2026-01-28T19:48:09.879098 [actor]: no im british born here

2026-01-28T19:48:13.309366 [root_agent]: Perfect! Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on what you've told me:
- You have a 6-month-old baby (under 16, so eligible)
- You are the main person responsible for looking after your baby
- You live with your baby in the UK
- You are British and not subject to immigration control

**You are eligible for Child Benefit!**

Even though you live with your parents, as long as you are the main person responsible for your baby, you can claim Child Benefit.

You can apply for Child Benefit online or by post. The benefit is usually paid every 4 weeks, and for one child it's currently £25.60 per week (rates may vary, so check the current amount when you apply).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:48:15.033008 [actor]: ok thx can i clam then

2026-01-28T19:48:19.113336 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am eligible for Child Benefit based on the correct criteria: having a child under 16 (6-month-old baby), being the main person responsible for the child, living in the UK, and not being subject to immigration control. The agent also correctly noted that living with parents does not affect eligibility as long as I am the main person responsible for the baby.
