2026-01-28T19:40:34.163026 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:40:35.709115 [actor]: child in hospital abroad for treatment rare condition 15 weks

2026-01-28T19:40:37.863420 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child who is currently in hospital abroad for treatment of a rare condition for 15 weeks.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Is this child normally living with you (when they're not in hospital), and are you responsible for them?**

2026-01-28T19:40:39.604417 [actor]: yes pay for costs visit when can he 14

2026-01-28T19:40:41.923759 [root_agent]: Thank you. So to clarify - you have a 14-year-old child who normally lives with you, you're responsible for them and pay for their costs, and you visit them when you can while they're receiving treatment abroad.

Now I need to ask: **Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:40:43.587547 [actor]: yes uk resident son oliver treatment usa

2026-01-28T19:40:45.610813 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. So you're a UK resident, and your 14-year-old son Oliver is receiving treatment in the USA.

Let me ask you this: **Have you been receiving Child Benefit for Oliver before he went to the USA for treatment, or would this be a new claim?**

2026-01-28T19:40:47.081115 [actor]: need to know if eligible paying for evrything specialist hospital

2026-01-28T19:40:49.051361 [root_agent]: I understand - you need to know if you're eligible for Child Benefit while Oliver is receiving specialist treatment in the USA, as you're paying for everything.

Let me ask: **Is Oliver expected to return to live with you in the UK once his treatment is completed?**

2026-01-28T19:40:50.625985 [actor]: yes returning after treatment finishes still responsble for him

2026-01-28T19:40:55.630959 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Oliver will be returning to the UK after his treatment and that you remain responsible for him.

Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ You are responsible for Oliver (aged 14, so under 16)
✓ You normally live together in the UK
✓ Oliver is only temporarily abroad for hospital treatment
✓ He is expected to return to live with you after treatment

**Important points about your situation:**

- Child Benefit can continue to be paid when a child is temporarily in hospital, including when they're in hospital abroad
- Since Oliver is receiving treatment and will return home, this is considered a temporary absence
- You remain responsible for him and are paying for his costs

**Next step:** If you haven't already claimed Child Benefit, you can make a claim. If you're already receiving it, it should continue during his hospital treatment abroad.

Would you like to know how to make a claim, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-28T19:41:00.974614 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Child Benefit can continue when a child is temporarily in hospital abroad for treatment and will return to the UK, which aligns with the government guidance that temporary absences for hospital treatment do not affect eligibility.
