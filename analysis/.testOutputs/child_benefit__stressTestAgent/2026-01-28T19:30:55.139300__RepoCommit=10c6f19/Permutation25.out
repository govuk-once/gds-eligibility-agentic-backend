2026-01-28T19:45:52.480149 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are either:
- Under 16 years old, or
- Under 20 years old and in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T19:45:53.912140 [actor]: child in care can i get benefit

2026-01-28T19:45:55.705193 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you about your specific situation:

Is the child you're asking about currently in local authority care, or are they living with you?

2026-01-28T19:45:57.090779 [actor]: child 5 years old care 10 weeks

2026-01-28T19:45:59.394778 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So the child is 5 years old and has been in care for 10 weeks.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand: Is this child expected to be in local authority care for more than 8 weeks in total, or will they be returning to live with you within 8 weeks from when they entered care?

2026-01-28T19:46:00.720567 [actor]: been there 10 weeks alredy

2026-01-28T19:46:03.152121 [root_agent]: I understand - the child has already been in care for 10 weeks.

Based on the rules, if a child is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, you normally stop being eligible for Child Benefit for that child.

However, to give you complete information, let me ask: Were you receiving Child Benefit for this child before they went into care?

2026-01-28T19:46:04.757067 [actor]: yes was getting it before

2026-01-28T19:46:08.306183 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Based on the information you've provided:

- Your child is 5 years old (under 16)
- They have been in local authority care for 10 weeks
- You were receiving Child Benefit before they went into care

**Unfortunately, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit for this child.** When a child is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, Child Benefit stops, as the local authority becomes responsible for the child during that time.

Since your child has been in care for 10 weeks (which is more than the 8-week limit), your Child Benefit eligibility has ended.

If your child returns to live with you in the future, you would be able to claim Child Benefit again at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T19:46:09.669465 [actor]: husband pays carer 30 pounds week for child

2026-01-28T19:46:12.183612 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. Let me clarify your situation:

Is the child living with a private foster carer (someone your family is paying directly), or are they in **local authority care** (placed by social services)?

This is an important distinction because the rules are different depending on the type of care arrangement.

2026-01-28T19:46:13.795306 [actor]: local authority care but husband sends money to carer

2026-01-28T19:46:17.340861 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So the child is in **local authority care** (placed by social services), and your husband is sending money to the carer as well.

The fact that your husband is sending money to the carer doesn't change the eligibility rules. When a child is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, the person who was previously claiming Child Benefit (you) is no longer eligible, regardless of whether the family is contributing financially.

The local authority is responsible for the child during this time, which is why Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks in their care.

So my previous answer stands: **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** while your child remains in local authority care beyond 8 weeks.

Is there anything else about your Child Benefit situation you'd like me to help clarify?

2026-01-28T19:46:18.856068 [actor]: husband pays upkeep does that count

2026-01-28T19:46:22.681319 [root_agent]: I understand your question - you're asking if the fact that your husband is paying towards the child's upkeep changes the eligibility.

Unfortunately, **no, it doesn't change the eligibility**. 

When a child is in local authority care (placed by social services), the key factor for Child Benefit eligibility is who has legal responsibility for the child. Once a child has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, Child Benefit stops - even if parents are contributing money towards their child's care.

The local authority has responsibility for the child during this period, which is why Child Benefit cannot continue to be paid to you, regardless of any financial contributions your husband is making to the carer.

So the answer remains: **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** while your child is in local authority care beyond the 8-week period.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-28T19:46:24.232179 [actor]: paying upkeep to carer makes eligible gov.uk says

2026-01-28T19:46:28.431931 [root_agent]: Thank you for mentioning that - let me reconsider this carefully based on the government guidance.

You're right to question this. Let me ask an important clarifying question:

When you say your husband is paying the carer, is this:
- A private arrangement where YOU are paying someone (a friend, relative, or private foster carer) to look after your child, OR
- The child is formally placed by the local authority in foster care, and you're voluntarily sending money to help with costs?

This distinction is crucial because the rules are different. If you're paying someone at least the same as Child Benefit or the foster parent's allowance to look after your child in a **private arrangement**, you may still be eligible even if the child lives elsewhere.

Which situation applies to you?

2026-01-28T19:46:30.141776 [actor]: local authority placed child husband pays 30 pounds week to the foster carer

2026-01-28T19:46:33.947947 [root_agent]: Thank you for being clear about this. Let me think carefully about the specific rules.

You've told me:
- The child is placed by the local authority in foster care
- Your husband pays £30 per week to the foster carer

This is an important detail. According to the guidance, if you're contributing at least the rate of Child Benefit (or the foster parent's allowance from the local authority) towards your child's upkeep, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit even though the child doesn't live with you.

To assess this properly, I need to know: Is the £30 per week your husband pays **at least as much as** either:
- The weekly Child Benefit rate, OR  
- The foster parent's allowance that the local authority pays to the foster carer?

Do you know if £30 per week meets or exceeds either of these amounts?

2026-01-28T19:46:35.474498 [actor]: dont know amounts just know 30 pounds week

2026-01-28T19:46:40.329703 [root_agent]: That's okay. Let me give you some context to help figure this out.

The current Child Benefit rate is approximately £24 per week for the eldest or only child, and about £16 per week for additional children.

Since your husband is paying £30 per week, this is **more than** the Child Benefit rate for one child.

However, there's another amount to consider - the foster parent's allowance from the local authority, which varies but is typically much higher than £30 per week.

Here's my important question: Is your husband paying at least the **same amount** that the local authority pays the foster carer as their fostering allowance? 

If you don't know the foster parent's allowance amount, you would need to find this out from the local authority to determine your eligibility. The rule is that you need to be contributing at least as much as the foster allowance OR the Child Benefit rate - whichever applies in your situation.

Do you know what the local authority pays the foster carer, or could you find this out?

2026-01-28T19:46:42.206894 [actor]: husband pays the 30 every week does that make me eligble

2026-01-28T19:46:46.105721 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, let me think through this carefully:

- Your child is in local authority foster care
- Your husband pays £30 per week to the foster carer
- £30 per week is MORE than the Child Benefit rate (approximately £24 per week for one child)

According to the government guidance, if you're contributing towards your child's upkeep at a rate that's at least equal to the Child Benefit amount OR the foster parent's allowance, you may remain eligible for Child Benefit even when the child is in care.

Since £30 per week exceeds the Child Benefit rate, **you may be eligible for Child Benefit**.

However, I should mention that you would need to inform the Child Benefit Office about:
- Your child being in local authority care
- The payments you're making towards their upkeep

They will make the final determination based on your specific circumstances.

Would you like to know anything else about this situation or how to contact the Child Benefit Office?

2026-01-28T19:46:47.377506 [actor]: so am i eligible or not

2026-01-28T19:46:50.276724 [root_agent]: Based on what you've told me:

**Yes, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because your husband is paying £30 per week towards your child's upkeep, which is more than the Child Benefit rate.

The key rule is: if you're contributing at least the amount of Child Benefit towards your child's care, you can remain eligible even when the child is in local authority foster care.

However, you **must inform the Child Benefit Office** about your child being in care and the payments you're making. They will confirm your eligibility and ensure your claim continues correctly.

Is there anything else you need help with regarding Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:46:53.305363 [actor]: ok thanx

2026-01-28T19:46:55.393662 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly applied the rule that parents can remain eligible for Child Benefit when their child is in local authority care if they contribute at least the Child Benefit rate toward the child's upkeep, and £30/week exceeds this threshold.
