**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit while their son is in residential accommodation paid for by the council. However, the expected outcome clearly states: **"Eligible (until week 12)."**

According to the scenario details and gov.uk guidance on children in residential accommodation:
- Children in residential accommodation (distinct from "Care"/fostering) retain Child Benefit eligibility for **12 weeks**
- The child has been in residential accommodation for **10 weeks**
- Therefore, the parent should **still be eligible** for Child Benefit (for another 2 weeks until the 12-week limit is reached)

The agent failed to communicate this critical 12-week rule for residential accommodation. Instead, the agent incorrectly advised that eligibility stops immediately when the council pays for residential accommodation, telling the user "you are not eligible for Child Benefit while your son is living full-time at the council-funded residential school."

The evaluation judge's note that this "aligns with the expected outcome" appears to be an error, as the agent's conclusion of "not eligible" directly contradicts the expected outcome of "Eligible (until week 12)."
