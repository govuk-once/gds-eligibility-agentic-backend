2026-01-28T19:46:57.267962 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T19:46:58.721975 [actor]: child benfit eligibilty zahid 15 yrs old

2026-01-28T19:47:00.505400 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child named Zahid who is 15 years old.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Is Zahid living with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-28T19:47:01.915520 [actor]: lives with aunt

2026-01-28T19:47:03.745864 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Zahid lives with his aunt.

To help determine your eligibility, I need to understand more about the situation. Are you responsible for Zahid in any way, such as contributing to his upkeep or care, even though he lives with his aunt?

2026-01-28T19:47:05.141710 [actor]: send money £15 week

2026-01-28T19:47:07.030856 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you contribute £15 per week towards Zahid's upkeep, even though he lives with his aunt.

Let me ask: Does Zahid's aunt currently receive Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-28T19:47:08.406740 [actor]: aunt dosnt claim no

2026-01-28T19:47:10.117991 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that the aunt doesn't claim Child Benefit for Zahid.

Now I need to understand your relationship to Zahid better. Are you Zahid's parent?

2026-01-28T19:47:11.435899 [actor]: yes im his father mo

2026-01-28T19:47:13.860412 [root_agent]: Thank you, Mo. So to summarize what you've told me:
- You're Zahid's father
- Zahid is 15 years old
- He lives with his aunt
- You contribute £15 per week towards his upkeep
- His aunt doesn't claim Child Benefit for him

I have one more important question: Is there anyone else who contributes more than you do towards Zahid's care and upkeep, or are you the main person financially supporting him?

2026-01-28T19:47:15.195633 [actor]: my mother sends £15 too

2026-01-28T19:47:16.994257 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mo. So both you and your mother each send £15 per week towards Zahid's upkeep.

Let me ask: Does your mother live with Zahid and his aunt, or does she live separately like you do?

2026-01-28T19:47:18.446450 [actor]: she lives seprate

2026-01-28T19:47:20.955675 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Mo.

So to understand the situation fully:
- You send £15 per week
- Your mother sends £15 per week
- Both of you live separately from Zahid
- Zahid lives with his aunt

One final question: Does Zahid's aunt contribute towards his upkeep as well, or does she only provide accommodation while you and your mother provide the financial support?

2026-01-28T19:47:22.791535 [actor]: aunt just gives him place to stay we send the money

2026-01-28T19:47:27.998252 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mo. Let me reflect on your situation based on the Child Benefit eligibility rules.

Based on what you've told me:
- You're Zahid's father and he's 15 years old (so under 16)
- Zahid lives with his aunt who provides accommodation but doesn't contribute financially
- You and your mother each contribute £15 per week towards his upkeep (£30 total per week)
- Neither you nor your mother lives with Zahid
- The aunt doesn't claim Child Benefit

In situations where a child doesn't live with you, only one person can claim Child Benefit, and it should be the person who contributes most to the child's upkeep. Since you and your mother contribute equally (£15 each), you would need to decide between yourselves who should claim.

However, if the aunt is providing full-time care and accommodation, she might actually be considered as contributing more than either of you individually, even if she's not providing money.

Let me ask: Would you say the aunt is the main person looking after Zahid on a day-to-day basis - cooking meals, doing laundry, taking him to appointments, etc.?

2026-01-28T19:47:29.631041 [actor]: aunt just housing we pay for evrything food clothes all of it

2026-01-28T19:47:34.544649 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Mo. That's an important detail - you and your mother between you are paying for everything including food and clothes, and the aunt is only providing the housing.

In this situation, since you and your mother are jointly the main contributors to Zahid's upkeep (contributing equally at £15 each per week), one of you could be eligible to claim Child Benefit.

However, since you both contribute exactly the same amount, you would need to decide between yourselves who should make the claim, as only one person can receive Child Benefit for Zahid.

**You could be eligible for Child Benefit if:**
- You and your mother agree that you should be the one to claim it
- You make the claim as the person responsible for Zahid

Is there a particular reason you're asking about this now - are you considering making a claim for Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:47:36.080805 [actor]: so I can claim then yes?

2026-01-28T19:47:39.668359 [root_agent]: Yes, Mo, based on what you've told me, you could be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid because:

1. Zahid is 15 years old (under 16)
2. You're his father
3. You're contributing to his upkeep (£15 per week)
4. The aunt isn't claiming Child Benefit for him
5. You and your mother are paying for all his needs (food, clothes, etc.)

However, there's one important point: since you and your mother both contribute equally, only ONE of you can claim. You'll need to agree between yourselves who will make the claim - either you or your mother, but not both.

If you both agree that you should be the one to claim, then yes, you can make a claim for Child Benefit.

Do you and your mother agree that you should be the one to claim it?

2026-01-28T19:47:41.148192 [actor]: ok yes eligible thank you

2026-01-28T19:47:43.754185 [root_agent]: You're welcome, Mo! 

Just to be clear: you could be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid, provided you and your mother have agreed that you will be the one to claim (since only one person can claim for the same child).

If you decide to go ahead and make a claim, you'll need to apply for Child Benefit through the official channels.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T19:47:50.172620 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user (Mo) could be eligible for Child Benefit since Zahid is 15 (under 16), Mo is the father contributing to upkeep, the aunt doesn't claim Child Benefit, and Mo and his mother jointly pay for all of Zahid's needs. The agent correctly noted that only one person can claim and that Mo and his mother must agree on who claims, which they did.
