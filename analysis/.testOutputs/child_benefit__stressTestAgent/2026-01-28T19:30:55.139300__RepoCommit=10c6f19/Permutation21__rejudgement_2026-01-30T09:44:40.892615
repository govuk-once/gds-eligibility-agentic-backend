**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user (Robert) is **eligible for Child Benefit for Sam**, which aligns with the expected outcome that "Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)."

**Analysis:**

1. **Robert's situation (the user in this conversation):**
   - Has Sam (10 years old) living with him
   - Is responsible for Sam's care
   - Is a British citizen in the UK
   - No one else is claiming for Sam
   - **Conclusion:** Eligible for Child Benefit at the higher "eldest child" rate (£26.05)

2. **Tina's situation (mentioned but not the user):**
   - Has Ella (8 years old) living with her
   - Is claiming Child Benefit for Ella
   - **Conclusion:** Also eligible for Child Benefit at the higher "eldest child" rate (£26.05)

According to the guidance, when families split and children are divided between parents, each parent is entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for the eldest child in their specific household. The agent correctly determined Robert's eligibility for Sam, which represents one half of the expected outcome "Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)."

While the agent didn't explicitly discuss Tina's eligibility (as she wasn't the user), the agent's assessment of Robert's eligibility is correct and consistent with the expected outcome.
