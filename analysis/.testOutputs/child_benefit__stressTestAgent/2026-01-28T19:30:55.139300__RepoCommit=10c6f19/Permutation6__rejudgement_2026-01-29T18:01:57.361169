**Justification:** The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit**, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

The agent properly identified and applied the hospital stay exception rules:

1. **Correctly recognized the 12-week threshold**: The agent acknowledged that the child has been in hospital for 14 weeks (exceeding the standard 12-week limit)

2. **Properly identified the exception**: The agent correctly determined that the user remains eligible because:
   - The parent is still paying for the child's maintenance (£30/week on books, pyjamas, special food)
   - The hospital/local authority is NOT contributing towards maintenance costs
   - The parent maintains regular contact (daily visits)

3. **Communicated the outcome clearly**: The agent explicitly stated "you should be eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter" and explained the reasoning

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome that Mary (the user) retains eligibility beyond the 12-week limit due to the exception for parents who continue to spend money regularly on their child's upkeep while in hospital.
