2026-01-29T18:21:29.676692 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:** The agent accurately identified the key disqualifying factor: the user is a registered foster carer receiving a full fostering allowance from the local authority that covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance. The agent correctly explained that "when a local authority pays towards a child's accommodation or maintenance (which they do through fostering allowances), the foster carer cannot claim Child Benefit for that child." This aligns precisely with the eligibility rules stated in the government guidance, which specifies that you cannot claim Child Benefit for a fostered child if the council is paying for their accommodation or maintenance. The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
