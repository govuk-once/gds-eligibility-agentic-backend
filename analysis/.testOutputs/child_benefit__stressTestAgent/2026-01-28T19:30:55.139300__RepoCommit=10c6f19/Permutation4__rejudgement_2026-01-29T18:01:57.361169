**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Child's Age and Education Status**: Sofia is 18 years old, left school 2 years ago, and is working as a receptionist. She is not in approved education or training.

2. **Eligibility Rules Applied Correctly**: According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit stops when a child turns 16 unless they continue in approved education or training (up to age 20). Since Sofia left school at approximately 16 and has been working for 2 years, she does not meet the education/training requirement.

3. **Agent's Communication**: The agent clearly stated: "You are not eligible for Child Benefit" and provided accurate reasoning based on Sofia's age, work status, and lack of approved education/training.

4. **Alignment with Expected Outcome**: The scenario explicitly states the outcome should be "Not Eligible" because Sofia "works 30 hours a week as a receptionist" and "is not taking any courses." The agent's determination matches this expected outcome perfectly.

The agent demonstrated proper understanding of Child Benefit eligibility rules and communicated the correct ineligibility determination to the user.
