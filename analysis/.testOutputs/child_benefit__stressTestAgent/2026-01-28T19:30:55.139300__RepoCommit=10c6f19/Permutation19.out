2026-01-28T19:42:15.871406 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T19:42:17.543351 [actor]: child benefit daughter 9 years old seprated

2026-01-28T19:42:19.560987 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 9-year-old daughter and you're separated.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Does your daughter live with you?

2026-01-28T19:42:21.155386 [actor]: she stays with me 3 days week ex has her 4 days clothes food for her both

2026-01-28T19:42:23.983418 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your daughter splits her time between you and your ex-partner, with you having her 3 days a week and your ex having her 4 days a week, and you both provide for her needs.

This is an important situation because only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child, even when care is shared.

Let me ask you: Is anyone currently claiming Child Benefit for your daughter?

2026-01-28T19:42:25.867431 [actor]: both submitd claims cant agree who shud get it

2026-01-28T19:42:28.812126 [root_agent]: I understand - you've both submitted claims and can't agree on who should receive the Child Benefit.

When parents can't agree on who should get Child Benefit for a shared child, HMRC has specific rules to determine who is eligible. The key factor is who has "main responsibility" for the child.

Let me ask you this: Does your daughter have one main home where she is registered (for example, for school, GP, or other official purposes), or is she registered at both addresses equally?

2026-01-28T19:42:30.572414 [actor]: daughter registered school gp at ex address more days there

2026-01-28T19:42:35.474628 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is helpful in understanding your situation.

Based on what you've told me, your daughter is registered at your ex-partner's address for school and GP services, and she also spends more time there (4 days versus your 3 days).

Under the Child Benefit rules, when parents share care and can't agree, HMRC determines who has "main responsibility" for the child. The factors they consider include:

- Who the child lives with for the greater part of the time
- Where the child is registered (school, GP, etc.)
- Who provides day-to-day care

In your situation, since your daughter spends more time at your ex-partner's address and is registered there for school and GP, **your ex-partner would likely be considered to have main responsibility and therefore be eligible to claim the Child Benefit**.

However, you do have the right to challenge this decision if you believe you should be the one to receive it. You would need to provide evidence of your contribution to your daughter's care.

Is there anything else about your caring arrangements that you think is important for determining main responsibility?

2026-01-28T19:42:40.596018 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly assessed that since the daughter spends more time (4 days vs 3 days) at the ex-partner's address and is registered there for school and GP services, the ex-partner would have main responsibility and therefore be eligible for Child Benefit, while the user would not be eligible.
