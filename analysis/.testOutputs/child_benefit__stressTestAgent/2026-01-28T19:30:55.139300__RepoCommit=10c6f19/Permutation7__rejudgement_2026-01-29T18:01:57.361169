**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit**, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Child's age criteria met**: The son is 14 years old (under 16) ✓

2. **Responsibility criteria met**: The user confirmed they are responsible for the child ✓

3. **Care situation properly assessed**: The agent recognized that while the child is in a care home during weekdays, the regular weekend stays (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) create an exception to the typical "8-week care rule"

4. **Exception rule correctly applied**: According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in care, if a child spends at least one night a week at home (or 2 nights in a row), the parent can still claim. The user's son stays Friday AND Saturday nights consecutively every week, clearly meeting this threshold.

5. **Accurate outcome communicated**: The agent explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit" and provided clear reasoning

The agent successfully identified this as an exception case where despite the child being in local authority care, the regular overnight stays (2+ consecutive nights weekly) preserve the parent's entitlement to Child Benefit. This matches the expected outcome perfectly.
