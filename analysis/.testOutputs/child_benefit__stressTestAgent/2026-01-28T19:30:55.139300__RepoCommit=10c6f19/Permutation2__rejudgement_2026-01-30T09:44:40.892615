**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis of the agent's assessment:**

1. **Responsibility (Criteria 1):** ✓ The agent confirmed Amit is responsible as a single father living with his daughter.

2. **Child's Age and Education (Criteria 2):** ✓ The agent correctly identified that the daughter doing A-levels in sixth form qualifies as "approved education" for children under 20.

3. **Residency (Criteria 3):** ✓ The agent confirmed they live in London (UK residency).

4. **Living Arrangements (Criteria 4):** ✓ The agent confirmed the daughter lives with Amit.

5. **State Support (Criteria 5):** ✓ No indication of hospital/care situation.

6. **High Income Charge (Criteria 6):** ✓ The agent correctly noted the £40,000 income is below the £50,000 threshold, so no High Income Child Benefit Charge applies.

The agent systematically verified all relevant criteria and reached the correct conclusion that Amit is eligible for Child Benefit. The communication was clear, accurate, and matches the expected outcome.
