2026-01-28T19:43:14.097032 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:43:15.603477 [actor]: child benifit divorse sam 10 years old

2026-01-28T19:43:17.635077 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So I understand you have a child named Sam who is 10 years old, and there's a divorce situation involved.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Does Sam normally live with you?**

2026-01-28T19:43:19.256149 [actor]: yes sam lives with me robert ella with tina

2026-01-28T19:43:21.870448 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Sam lives with you, and it sounds like there are other children (Robert and Ella) who live with Tina.

Let me focus on Sam who lives with you. My next question is:

**Are you responsible for Sam? By this I mean, do you provide for Sam's day-to-day needs such as food, clothing, and care?**

2026-01-28T19:43:23.587533 [actor]: no im robert ella 8 lives with tina

2026-01-28T19:43:25.862475 [root_agent]: I apologize for the confusion. Let me clarify to make sure I understand correctly:

**So your name is Robert, Ella is 8 years old and lives with Tina, and Sam (10 years old) lives with you. Is that correct?**

2026-01-28T19:43:27.588310 [actor]: sam lives me robert divorse tina ella lives tina

2026-01-28T19:43:29.960139 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So to confirm I understand:

- You are going through a divorce with Tina
- Sam (10 years old) lives with you
- Ella (8 years old) lives with Tina
- You are Robert

Now, focusing on Sam who lives with you:

**Are you responsible for Sam's day-to-day care? This means do you provide for Sam's needs such as food, clothing, and looking after them?**

2026-01-28T19:43:31.584700 [actor]: yes sam lives with me i look after sam

2026-01-28T19:43:33.535126 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that. So Sam lives with you and you look after Sam.

My next question is:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:43:34.766604 [actor]: uk yes live here

2026-01-28T19:43:36.754625 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. So you live in the UK and Sam lives with you here.

My next question is:

**What is your immigration status in the UK? Are you a British citizen, or do you have settled status, or another type of visa/immigration status?**

2026-01-28T19:43:38.285186 [actor]: british citizen born here

2026-01-28T19:43:40.283446 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you. So you're a British citizen born in the UK, Sam (10 years old) lives with you, and you're responsible for Sam's care.

My next question is:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Sam, or are you applying for the first time?**

2026-01-28T19:43:41.773360 [actor]: applying first time can i get child benifit

2026-01-28T19:43:44.567442 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided so far, you appear to meet the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit:

- You have a child (Sam, aged 10) who is under 16
- Sam lives with you
- You're responsible for Sam
- You're a British citizen living in the UK

I have one more important question:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Sam? For example, is Tina (or anyone else) already receiving Child Benefit for Sam?**

2026-01-28T19:43:45.983340 [actor]: no tina claims for ella only sam with me

2026-01-28T19:43:48.892150 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for that information.

Based on everything you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Sam**. Here's why:

✓ Sam is 10 years old (under 16)
✓ Sam lives with you
✓ You're responsible for Sam's day-to-day care
✓ You're a British citizen living in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Sam

Since this is your first time applying, you'll need to make a claim for Child Benefit. 

**Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit, or would you like to know what to do next to apply?**

2026-01-28T19:43:53.739465 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for Sam based on all the correct criteria: Sam is under 16, lives with the user, the user is responsible for Sam's care, the user is a UK resident with British citizenship, and no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Sam.
