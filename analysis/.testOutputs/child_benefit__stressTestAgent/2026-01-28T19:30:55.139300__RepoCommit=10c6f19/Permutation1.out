2026-01-28T19:30:57.594690 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:30:59.234698 [actor]: ya got kid 8 yers old

2026-01-28T19:31:00.825344 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child who is 8 years old.

Next question: **Does the child normally live with you?**

2026-01-28T19:31:02.240908 [actor]: kid lives here yes

2026-01-28T19:31:04.831255 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Your child lives with you.

Next question: **Are you and your partner's combined income over £60,000 per year, or does either of you individually earn more than £50,000 per year?**

(This is important because it affects whether you might have to pay a tax charge, though it doesn't stop you from claiming Child Benefit.)

2026-01-28T19:31:07.395850 [actor]: husband teacher me working part time

2026-01-28T19:31:09.927066 [root_agent]: I understand you work part time and your husband is a teacher.

To help me assess your situation properly: **Does either you or your husband have an individual income of £50,000 or more per year?**

(If you're not sure of the exact amount, an approximate figure would help.)

2026-01-28T19:31:11.546211 [actor]: no he makes 35000 i make less

2026-01-28T19:31:14.499485 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit. Let me just confirm a few more details:

**Is your 8-year-old child a British citizen, or do they have settled status or the right to live in the UK?** 

Also, **are you yourself living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:31:16.110547 [actor]: we british live in manchester

2026-01-28T19:31:19.770898 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided:

- You have an 8-year-old child
- The child lives with you
- You're responsible for the child
- You're British and living in the UK (Manchester)
- Neither you nor your husband earns over £50,000 individually

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Since neither of you earns over £50,000 per year, you won't have to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means you can receive the full benefit without any tax implications.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, such as how to apply or how much you might receive?

2026-01-28T19:31:25.188169 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all relevant criteria (child under 16, living with applicant, UK residency, income below £50,000 threshold) and correctly concluded eligibility for Child Benefit without providing any incorrect information throughout the conversation.
