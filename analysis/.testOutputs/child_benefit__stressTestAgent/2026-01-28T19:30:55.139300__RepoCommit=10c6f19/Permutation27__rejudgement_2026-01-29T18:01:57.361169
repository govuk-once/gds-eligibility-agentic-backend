**Justification:**

The agent determined the user was eligible for Child Benefit, which is technically correct in terms of basic eligibility criteria. However, the agent **failed to communicate a critical piece of information** that directly affects the expected outcome.

According to the scenario context, this is "**Permutation 27: The Minor Parent (Claiming for self)**" where:
- Chloe is 15 years old with a baby
- She can technically claim, BUT
- **"You'll usually get more if [someone responsible for you] claims... on your behalf"**
- **If Chloe claims, her parents might lose the Child Benefit they get for Chloe**

The expected outcome explicitly states: "**Eligible (Though potentially financially suboptimal)**"

The agent never:
1. Asked the user's age (crucial given the scenario involves a 15-year-old)
2. Explained that while eligible, this might not be financially optimal
3. Warned that claiming could affect parents' Child Benefit for the user
4. Suggested the alternative of having parents claim on their behalf

The agent gave a simple "you are eligible" without the important caveat about financial suboptimality. While the eligibility determination is correct, the **communication of the outcome is incomplete** because it omits the "though potentially financially suboptimal" aspect that is central to this scenario's expected outcome.
