**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct adoption guidance**: The agent properly understood that as an approved adopter with a child placed in their care, the user can claim Child Benefit even though the final adoption order has not been granted. The agent explicitly stated: "You can claim Child Benefit as an approved adopter once the child is placed with you and living with you, even before the adoption is legally finalized."

2. **Thorough eligibility verification**: The agent systematically verified all relevant criteria:
   - Child is 4 years old (under 16) ✓
   - Child lives with the applicant ✓
   - Applicant is responsible for the child ✓
   - Applicant lives in the UK ✓
   - Income under £60,000 (no High Income Child Benefit Charge) ✓

3. **Clear communication**: The agent provided a clear, definitive statement of eligibility with supporting rationale.

This aligns with official guidance (gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else) which states that approved adopters can claim as soon as the child comes to live with them, without waiting for the final adoption order.

The evaluation judge's assessment (✓) also confirms the agent reached the correct conclusion.
