2026-01-28T19:33:41.268990 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:33:42.991896 [actor]: child hospital long time how do i get money

2026-01-28T19:33:45.789955 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. I understand you're asking about getting Child Benefit while a child is in hospital for a long time.

Let me ask you a clarifying question: **Is the child you're responsible for currently in hospital, and if so, how long have they been there (or how long are they expected to stay)?**

This is important because there are specific rules about Child Benefit when a child is in hospital for extended periods.

2026-01-28T19:33:47.423340 [actor]: daugter in hosptal 14 weeks visit evry day

2026-01-28T19:33:50.060003 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks and you visit every day.

This is helpful information. Now let me ask: **Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your daughter, or are you applying for the first time?**

This will help me give you the right guidance about your eligibility while she's in hospital.

2026-01-28T19:33:51.658335 [actor]: need to know if i can get it she is 6 years old

2026-01-28T19:33:54.206591 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your daughter is 6 years old and has been in hospital for 14 weeks, and you're checking if you can get Child Benefit for her.

Let me ask you: **Are you the person who is responsible for your daughter - meaning, did she normally live with you before going into hospital, and do you still have parental responsibility for her?**

2026-01-28T19:33:55.794223 [actor]: yes she lives with me i am her mum

2026-01-28T19:33:58.074944 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. You're her mum and she normally lives with you.

Now, an important question about the hospital stay: **Is the hospital stay being paid for by the NHS, or are you paying for it privately?**

This affects the Child Benefit rules for children in hospital.

2026-01-28T19:33:59.488056 [actor]: nhs hosptal not paying anything myself

2026-01-28T19:34:01.951576 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Now let me ask: **After your daughter has been in the NHS hospital for 12 weeks (84 days), has the hospital been contributing towards the cost of her maintenance or care?**

This is an important factor in determining Child Benefit eligibility when a child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks.

2026-01-28T19:34:03.658547 [actor]: dont understand what maintenence means visit every day spend money on books pyjamas special food for her

2026-01-28T19:34:06.870232 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining - I can see you're spending your own money on books, pyjamas, and special food for her during her hospital stay.

Let me clarify my question: **Has the hospital or local authority told you that they are now providing financial support or paying for her care and accommodation costs (beyond the medical treatment itself)?**

What I'm trying to find out is whether the hospital has officially taken over responsibility for covering the costs of looking after her - not the medical treatment, but her day-to-day care while she's there.

2026-01-28T19:34:08.506965 [actor]: no hospital not paying me anything i spend my own money 30 pounds a week on her things

2026-01-28T19:34:10.995219 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So you're spending your own money (£30 a week) on her things, and the hospital isn't providing you with any financial support for her maintenance.

Let me ask one more important question: **Are you (or your partner if you have one) responsible for any other children under 16, or is your 6-year-old daughter your only child?**

2026-01-28T19:34:12.640676 [actor]: she is my only child just want to know if i get the benfit

2026-01-28T19:34:17.514536 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me give you an assessment based on what you've told me.

**Based on your situation, you should be eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter.**

Here's why:

✓ Your daughter is 6 years old (under 16)
✓ She normally lives with you and you're her mum with parental responsibility
✓ You're still paying for her maintenance yourself (£30/week on books, pyjamas, special food)
✓ You visit her every day
✓ The hospital/local authority is NOT contributing towards the cost of her maintenance

Even though your daughter has been in an NHS hospital for 14 weeks (which is more than 12 weeks), **you can still claim Child Benefit because you are still paying for her maintenance costs and the hospital is not contributing towards these costs.**

The rule is that Child Benefit can continue after 12 weeks in hospital if you're still responsible for contributing to the child's maintenance costs - which you clearly are.

**You should apply for or continue claiming Child Benefit for your daughter.**

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-28T19:34:19.146163 [actor]: ok thank you

2026-01-28T19:34:23.037577 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit because they are still contributing to their daughter's maintenance costs (£30/week) while she is in hospital, and the hospital is not contributing towards these costs, which is the correct exception to the 12-week hospital rule.
