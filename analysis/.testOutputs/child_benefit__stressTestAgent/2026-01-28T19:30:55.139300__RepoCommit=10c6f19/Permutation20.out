2026-01-28T19:42:42.509381 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:42:44.003208 [actor]: granddaughter living with me 14 years old

2026-01-28T19:42:46.628099 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have your 14-year-old granddaughter living with you.

Next question: **Are you the main person responsible for your granddaughter? This means you're the person who is mainly looking after her on a day-to-day basis.**

2026-01-28T19:42:48.393553 [actor]: yes i pay for evrything she needs food clothes school stuff

2026-01-28T19:42:50.310015 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know. It sounds like you're providing for her daily needs.

Next question: **Does your granddaughter normally live with you? In other words, is your home her main residence where she usually stays?**

2026-01-28T19:42:51.935194 [actor]: yes she lives here with me her parents cant look after her

2026-01-28T19:42:53.731525 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's clear you're the main carer for your granddaughter.

Next question: **Do you currently live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:42:55.272368 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T19:42:56.925732 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you.

Next question: **What is your immigration status in the UK? For example, are you a UK citizen, do you have settled status, or do you have a different immigration status?**

2026-01-28T19:42:58.553518 [actor]: uk citizen

2026-01-28T19:43:00.632731 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: **Are you or your partner (if you have one) already claiming Child Benefit for your granddaughter, or is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-28T19:43:02.046962 [actor]: no nobody claiming for her

2026-01-28T19:43:06.600261 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your granddaughter. Here's why:

✓ Your granddaughter is 14 years old (under 16)
✓ She lives with you as her main residence
✓ You are responsible for her on a day-to-day basis
✓ You live in the UK and are a UK citizen
✓ No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for her

Since your granddaughter's parents can't look after her and she lives with you permanently, you qualify as the person responsible for her care.

**Next steps:** You should apply for Child Benefit. You can do this online or by post using a claim form.

**One important thing to note:** If you or your partner has an individual income over £60,000 a year, you may need to pay a tax charge (called the High Income Child Benefit Charge), though you can still claim the benefit.

Would you like any clarification about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T19:43:11.704441 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the grandmother is eligible for Child Benefit because she is the main carer for her 14-year-old granddaughter who lives with her, she is a UK citizen, and no one else is claiming the benefit for the child.
