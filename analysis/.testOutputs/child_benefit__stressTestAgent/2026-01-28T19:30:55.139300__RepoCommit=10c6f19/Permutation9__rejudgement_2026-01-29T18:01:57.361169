**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that Lars is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is that he should be **eligible**.

**Key facts from the transcript:**
1. Lars is a German citizen with Pre-Settled Status
2. He was working in Germany before moving to the UK
3. He has registered as a jobseeker and is actively looking for work
4. He has a 5-year-old son living with him for whom he is responsible

**Why the agent was wrong:**

The agent stated: "being a jobseeker alone may not provide you with a qualifying right to reside" and concluded Lars is "may **not be currently eligible**."

However, according to the eligibility criteria provided in the scenario and confirmed by the evaluation judge's feedback, **EU citizens with pre-settled status who were previously working in an EU country and are now registered jobseekers with a genuine prospect of work DO have a qualifying right to reside for Child Benefit purposes**.

The agent failed to recognize that Lars's previous work history in Germany, combined with his current status as a registered jobseeker actively seeking work, gives him the necessary "right to reside" qualification. The scenario explicitly states: "Holders of Pre-Settled Status can claim Child Benefit if they are working or meet specific 'right to reside' tests, such as being a registered jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work."

The agent's conclusion directly contradicts the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
