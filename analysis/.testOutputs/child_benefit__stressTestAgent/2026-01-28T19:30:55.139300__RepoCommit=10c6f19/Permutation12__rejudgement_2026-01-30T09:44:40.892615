**Justification:**

The expected outcome for this scenario is **"Not Eligible"** because the child (Liam, age 18) is claiming Universal Credit in his own right. According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, you stop getting Child Benefit if the child starts getting Universal Credit (or certain other benefits) in their own right.

The agent failed to communicate this outcome. Instead, the agent:

1. Initially stated the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" before learning about the UC claim
2. After learning about the UC claim, repeatedly stated they could not give a "definitive yes or no answer"
3. Claimed the guidance "does not specifically address whether a young person claiming Universal Credit in their own name can still be considered a qualifying young person"
4. Directed the user to contact HMRC rather than communicating the clear rule

However, the eligibility rules are clear: if a child receives Universal Credit in their own right, Child Benefit stops/is not available. This is explicitly stated in the official guidance. The agent should have communicated that based on the son claiming UC independently, the user would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit.

The agent's refusal to provide a clear answer contradicts the expected outcome of "Not Eligible" and fails to communicate the correct eligibility determination to the user.
