2026-01-29T18:21:55.733905 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user (Major Thompson, a Crown servant in the British Armed Forces) is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome. The agent's reasoning was sound:

1. **Correctly applied the Crown servant exception**: The agent recognized that as a UK Armed Forces member stationed abroad, the user is "treated as ordinarily resident in the UK for Child Benefit purposes" even while living in Germany. This directly addresses Criteria 2 (Exceptions for Abroad), where Crown servants posted overseas are exempt from the standard UK residency requirement.

2. **Verified all necessary criteria**: The agent confirmed:
   - The children (ages 8 and 10) are under 16
   - The user is responsible for them (they live with him on base)
   - No child benefit is being received from Germany or another country
   - The UK is the user's main home

3. **Clear eligibility determination**: The agent explicitly stated "**You are eligible for Child Benefit**" and provided appropriate reasoning.

The agent also appropriately addressed the High Income Child Benefit Charge consideration while clarifying it doesn't affect basic eligibility. The outcome communicated by the agent aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of eligibility based on the Crown servant exception.
