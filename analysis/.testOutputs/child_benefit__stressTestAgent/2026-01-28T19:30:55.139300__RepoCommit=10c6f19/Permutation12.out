2026-01-28T19:37:16.553932 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:37:18.206386 [actor]: child benefit for son living with me

2026-01-28T19:37:20.130755 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a son living with you.

**How old is your son?**

(Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)

2026-01-28T19:37:21.560780 [actor]: son 18 studying a levels

2026-01-28T19:37:24.070366 [root_agent]: Thank you. Your son is 18 and studying A-levels, which is approved education, so that's within the age criteria.

**Are you responsible for your son? This means do you live with him and either:**
- Pay for things like food, clothes, or housing for him, OR
- Receive Child Benefit for him already?

2026-01-28T19:37:25.528555 [actor]: yes he lives with me i pay for everything

2026-01-28T19:37:27.728633 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's good - you're responsible for him as you live together and you pay for his needs.

**Do you normally live in the UK?**

(This is important as you generally need to live in the UK to claim Child Benefit)

2026-01-28T19:37:29.007015 [actor]: yes uk resident

2026-01-28T19:37:31.343598 [root_agent]: Excellent. Now I need to ask about your son's education status to confirm eligibility.

**Is your son in full-time non-advanced education or approved training?**

(A-levels count as non-advanced education. Full-time generally means more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience)

2026-01-28T19:37:32.816164 [actor]: yes a levels full time

2026-01-28T19:37:35.189963 [root_agent]: Perfect. Your son's full-time A-level studies qualify as approved education.

Now I need to ask an important question about your household situation:

**Is anyone else in your household also claiming Child Benefit for your son, or could anyone else potentially claim for him?**

(Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child)

2026-01-28T19:37:36.719184 [actor]: no just me only parent he lives with

2026-01-28T19:37:39.433672 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

One final important question:

**Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?**

(If either you or a partner you live with earns over £60,000, you can still claim Child Benefit, but you may have to pay some or all of it back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-28T19:37:40.812244 [actor]: no low income single parent

2026-01-28T19:37:45.060779 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why you qualify:

✓ You have a son under 20 who is in full-time approved education (A-levels)
✓ You're responsible for him - he lives with you and you pay for his needs
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him
✓ Your income is below £60,000, so you won't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge

**You should be able to claim Child Benefit for your son.**

If you're not already receiving it, you can make a claim. If you're already receiving it, you should be able to continue receiving it while he remains in full-time education up until his 20th birthday (or until he finishes his course if that's earlier).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:37:46.845290 [actor]: wait son gets universal credit himself does that matter

2026-01-28T19:37:49.525112 [root_agent]: That's an important detail to clarify. Let me ask:

**Does your son claim Universal Credit in his own name because he's considered an independent household, or is he part of your Universal Credit claim?**

(This matters because if your son is claiming benefits as an independent person in his own right, rather than being part of your household claim, it could affect Child Benefit eligibility - as he may not be considered your dependent)

2026-01-28T19:37:51.082114 [actor]: he claims it himself in his own name independent

2026-01-28T19:37:53.543223 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that - this is important information.

**Does your son pay you rent or contribute to household costs from his Universal Credit, or does he live with you rent-free as your dependent child?**

(I need to understand whether he's living with you as an independent adult who happens to share your home, or whether he's still living as your dependent child despite claiming his own benefits)

2026-01-28T19:37:55.354221 [actor]: no rent he is my child just he gets his own benefits for living costs

2026-01-28T19:37:58.331748 [root_agent]: I understand. Let me ask one more clarifying question to assess this properly:

**Is your son's Universal Credit claim based on him being treated as a separate household (for example, because he's working or considered capable of work), or is there another specific reason why he claims independently rather than being included in any claim you might have?**

(This helps me understand whether he's still considered a dependant child for Child Benefit purposes, even though he receives his own benefits)

2026-01-28T19:37:59.902723 [actor]: he claims because of his circumstances for personal living costs still studying a levels

2026-01-28T19:38:03.827764 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. This is a complex situation that I need to think through carefully.

Let me ask an important question to help assess this properly:

**Has anyone at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) or HMRC told you that your son claiming Universal Credit would affect your Child Benefit, or are you currently receiving Child Benefit for him already while he claims Universal Credit?**

(The reason I'm asking is because the interaction between a child claiming their own benefits and a parent's Child Benefit eligibility can be complex. If he's still in full-time approved education and living with you as your dependent child, you may still be eligible - but if he's claiming UC as an independent person, this could potentially affect things. I want to understand what's actually happened in practice in your situation)

2026-01-28T19:38:05.720424 [actor]: havent claimed yet thats why im asking if i can

2026-01-28T19:38:08.530412 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying - that's very helpful to know you haven't claimed yet.

This is a complex situation. Let me ask one more important question:

**Is your son expected to look for work as part of his Universal Credit claim, or is he exempt from work requirements because he's a full-time student?**

(This matters because if he's claiming UC with work requirements, he may be treated as an independent adult rather than a dependent child, which could affect Child Benefit eligibility. However, if he's exempt from work requirements due to being a student, the situation may be different)

2026-01-28T19:38:10.232431 [actor]: hes studying full time so exempt from work requirements

2026-01-28T19:38:14.852798 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is a nuanced situation that requires careful consideration.

Based on what you've told me:
- Your 18-year-old son lives with you as your dependent child
- You pay for everything for him
- He's studying A-levels full-time (approved education)
- He claims Universal Credit independently but is exempt from work requirements due to being a student
- You haven't claimed Child Benefit yet

**This is a complex area.** Generally, if a young person is claiming Universal Credit in their own right as an independent person, this can affect whether they're considered a "qualifying young person" for Child Benefit purposes - even if they're still in education.

**My recommendation:** Before you apply for Child Benefit, you should contact HMRC's Child Benefit helpline directly to explain your specific situation. They can give you definitive advice on whether your son claiming UC independently affects your eligibility, given that he's still studying full-time and living with you as a dependent.

The situation isn't entirely clear-cut from the standard guidance, and I want to ensure you get accurate information specific to your circumstances.

Would you like any other information about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:38:16.374904 [actor]: so am i eligible or not need clear answer

2026-01-28T19:38:21.167516 [root_agent]: I understand you need a clear answer, but I must be honest with you:

**I cannot give you a definitive yes or no answer in this specific situation.**

Here's why: The fact that your son is claiming Universal Credit in his own name as an independent person creates uncertainty about whether he still qualifies as a "child" or "qualifying young person" for Child Benefit purposes, even though he's studying full-time A-levels and living with you.

The standard Child Benefit rules don't clearly address this specific combination of circumstances in the guidance I have access to.

**What you need to do:** Contact HMRC Child Benefit directly on **0300 200 3100** to explain:
- Your son is 18, studying full-time A-levels
- He lives with you and you support him
- He claims Universal Credit independently (but is exempt from work requirements)

They will be able to check your specific situation against their detailed rules and give you a definitive answer.

I apologize I can't be more definitive, but I don't want to give you incorrect information that could affect your claim.

2026-01-28T19:38:22.773587 [actor]: just tell me what the rules say about uc claimants

2026-01-28T19:38:28.441794 [root_agent]: Let me be clear about what I can determine from the official Child Benefit guidance:

**The guidance I have access to does not specifically address whether a young person claiming Universal Credit in their own name can still be considered a "qualifying young person" for Child Benefit purposes.**

The rules I can see state that for someone aged 16-19 to qualify, they must be in approved education or training. Your son meets this - he's doing A-levels full-time.

However, the guidance doesn't explicitly cover the interaction between:
- A young person being in approved education (which normally qualifies them), AND
- That same young person claiming Universal Credit as an independent person

**This is a gap in the publicly available guidance I'm working from.** The interaction between UC claims and Child Benefit eligibility for young people in education isn't detailed in the standard eligibility pages.

This is genuinely a situation where HMRC would need to apply their detailed internal rules, which aren't fully published in the guidance available to me.

I apologize for not being able to give you the specific rule you're asking about - it simply isn't clearly stated in the resources I have.

2026-01-28T19:38:29.865111 [actor]: ok thanks for help

2026-01-28T19:38:31.757234 [root_agent]: You're welcome. I'm sorry I couldn't give you a more definitive answer, but I hope the information was still helpful.

Best of luck with contacting HMRC - they should be able to give you a clear answer about your specific situation.

Take care!

2026-01-28T19:38:37.692932 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent appropriately recognized a complex edge case (child claiming UC independently while in full-time education) that isn't clearly covered in standard guidance, declined to give a definitive determination without proper authority, and correctly directed the user to contact HMRC for a definitive answer rather than potentially providing incorrect information.
