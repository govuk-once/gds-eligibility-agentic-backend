**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user (Pete) is **not eligible** for Child Benefit in this scenario, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of shared care situation**: The agent properly identified that both parents are responsible for the child but that only one can receive Child Benefit.

2. **Appropriate application of priority rules**: The agent correctly explained that HMRC uses "main responsibility" criteria when parents cannot agree, considering:
   - Time spent with each parent (4 days with ex vs 3 days with user)
   - Registration address for school and GP (at ex's address)
   - Day-to-day care arrangements

3. **Accurate outcome communication**: The agent clearly stated: "your ex-partner would likely be considered to have main responsibility and therefore be eligible to claim the Child Benefit" - effectively communicating that Pete (the user) is not eligible and Sue (the ex-partner) is eligible.

4. **Proper application of HMRC decision mechanism**: When parents dispute who should claim and HMRC must decide, the person with whom the child lives most of the time typically receives priority. Since Holly stays with Sue 4 days versus Pete's 3 days, Sue would be awarded the benefit.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome: **Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible**.
