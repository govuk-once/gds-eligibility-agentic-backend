**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct identification of key facts:**
   - The child (Emma, 12) does not live with the applicant (Mike)
   - Mike contributes only £10/week for food
   - Mike has minimal involvement (only a birthday present once a year)
   - The mother does not currently claim Child Benefit

2. **Correct application of eligibility criteria:**
   - The agent accurately identified that when a child doesn't live with the applicant, they must contribute **at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay** (£25.60-26.05/week for the eldest child)
   - Mike's £10/week contribution falls significantly short of this threshold
   - The agent correctly noted the lack of regular contact and involvement in day-to-day care

3. **Clear communication:**
   - The agent provided a clear "not eligible" determination
   - Gave three specific reasons supporting this conclusion
   - Appropriately suggested the mother should claim instead

The agent's assessment aligns perfectly with the scenario parameters and the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** based on Criteria 1 (insufficient financial contribution to meet the responsibility threshold).
