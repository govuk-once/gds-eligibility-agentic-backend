2026-01-28T19:34:25.020952 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:34:26.693168 [actor]: son 14 yrs old care home weeknds home

2026-01-28T19:34:29.260171 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old son who is in a care home but comes home on weekends.

Let me ask you the next question: **Are you responsible for your son? That is, do you contribute at least the same amount as anyone else towards the costs of looking after him, including during the weekends when he's home with you?**

2026-01-28T19:34:31.059923 [actor]: yes responsible he stays friday satday sunday evry week

2026-01-28T19:34:32.872867 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son stays with you every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday each week, and you are responsible for him.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:34:34.278478 [actor]: live uk yes

2026-01-28T19:34:36.250024 [root_agent]: Thank you. One more important question to determine your eligibility:

**Does anyone else currently claim Child Benefit for your son?** For example, does the care home or another person claim it?

2026-01-28T19:34:37.786823 [actor]: no one else claim just me want to know if can claim

2026-01-28T19:34:41.877723 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ Your son is 14 years old (under 16)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are responsible for your son
✓ Your son stays with you regularly (every weekend - Friday through Sunday)
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

Even though your son is in a care home during the week, the fact that he comes home to stay with you every weekend and you are responsible for him means you can claim Child Benefit. The rules allow for situations where a child is in care but regularly stays with a parent or guardian.

**You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit.** 

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the claiming process?

2026-01-28T19:34:46.965316 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user is eligible for Child Benefit via the exception for children in care who regularly stay with a parent, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (via Exception)".
