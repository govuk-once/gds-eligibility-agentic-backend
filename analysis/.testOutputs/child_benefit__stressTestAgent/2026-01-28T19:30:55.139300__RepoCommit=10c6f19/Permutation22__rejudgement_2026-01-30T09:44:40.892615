**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly assessed the eligibility outcome. Here's why:

**Expected Outcome:** Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Eligible

**Critical Error - The "Linking Rule":**

The agent failed to apply the hospital "linking rule" which states that if a child returns to hospital within 28 days of leaving, the separate hospital stays are treated as one continuous period for the purpose of the 12-week limit.

**The Facts:**
- First hospital stay: 10 weeks
- Time at home: 2 weeks (14 days) 
- Second hospital stay: 3 weeks (ongoing)
- Gap between stays: 2 weeks (14 days) - **less than 28 days**

**Correct Application:**
Since Arthur returned to hospital within 28 days (he returned after only 14 days), the stays must be linked: 10 weeks + 3 weeks = 13 cumulative weeks in hospital. This exceeds the 12-week threshold, meaning Child Benefit eligibility ceases after the cumulative 12th week (unless the parent is spending money on the child's upkeep, which wasn't established).

**Agent's Mistake:**
The agent stated: "As long as each individual hospital stay doesn't exceed 12 weeks, you should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit." This is incorrect - the agent treated the stays as separate rather than applying the linking rule.

The agent's eligibility determination directly contradicts the expected outcome.
