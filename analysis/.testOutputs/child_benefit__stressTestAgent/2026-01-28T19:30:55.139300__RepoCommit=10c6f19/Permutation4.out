2026-01-28T19:32:31.623832 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:32:36.190228 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you a specific question to clarify:

**Is your 18-year-old daughter currently in approved education or training (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or similar qualifications)?**

This is important because Child Benefit can continue for children aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training, but it generally stops when they turn 16 if they're working instead.

2026-01-28T19:32:40.947702 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on what you've told me:

**Your 18-year-old daughter who left school 2 years ago and is working as a receptionist would not qualify you for Child Benefit**, as she is over 16 and not in approved education or training.

However, let me ask you another question:

**Do you have any other children under the age of 16, or any children aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T19:32:45.727572 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided:

**You are not eligible for Child Benefit** because:

- Your only child, Sofia, is 18 years old
- She left school 2 years ago and is working as a receptionist
- She is not in approved education or training

Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 16, unless they continue in approved education or training (in which case it can continue until they turn 20). Since Sofia is working and not in education or training, you would not qualify for Child Benefit for her.

If Sofia's circumstances change and she returns to approved education or training before she turns 20, you may be able to claim Child Benefit again at that time.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:32:49.154546 [actor]: ok thanx

2026-01-28T19:32:51.457982 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because their only child (Sofia, age 18) left school 2 years ago and is working as a receptionist rather than being in approved education or training, which is required for Child Benefit to continue beyond age 16.
