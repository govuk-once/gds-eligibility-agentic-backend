**Justification:**

The agent communicated an **incorrect eligibility outcome** that does not agree with the expected outcome.

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Eligible only until 31st August (approximately 8-9 weeks from when the son left school in late June)

**Why the agent was wrong:**

According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, there is a specific extension provision for 16 and 17-year-olds who have left education and are registered with an approved careers service (like Connexions or the youth careers service) while actively seeking work, training, or an apprenticeship. This extension allows Child Benefit to continue for **up to 20 weeks** from when they left education.

In this scenario:
- Ben is 17 years old
- He left school in late June
- He is registered with the local youth careers service
- He is actively looking for an apprenticeship
- It is currently August (within the 20-week window)

The agent repeatedly stated that registration with the careers service "does not extend your Child Benefit entitlement beyond the 31st August" and that "Simply being registered with the careers service and looking for an apprenticeship, unfortunately, doesn't count." This is factually incorrect according to the government's own guidance on the 20-week extension period.

The agent should have informed the user that they are eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when their son left education, not just until the end of August.
