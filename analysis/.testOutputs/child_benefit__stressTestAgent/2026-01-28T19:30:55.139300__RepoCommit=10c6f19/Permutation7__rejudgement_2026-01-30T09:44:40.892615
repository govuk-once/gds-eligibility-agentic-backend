**Justification:**

The agent accurately identified that the user (David) is eligible for Child Benefit despite his son being in local authority care. This aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

The agent correctly recognized:
1. The basic eligibility criteria were met (child under 16, lives in UK, responsible for child)
2. Most importantly, the **exception to the 8-week care rule** applies because the child "stays with you regularly (every weekend - Friday through Sunday)"

According to the gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in care, payments can continue if the child spends at least one night a week at home or 2 nights in a row. The user explicitly stated the son stays "friday satday sunday evry week" - which clearly meets the "2 nights in a row" threshold (Friday and Saturday nights).

The agent's conclusion that "Even though your son is in a care home during the week, the fact that he comes home to stay with you every weekend and you are responsible for him means you can claim Child Benefit" directly addresses the care exception and matches the expected eligible outcome.
