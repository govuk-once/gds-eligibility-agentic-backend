2026-01-28T19:43:55.926337 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T19:43:57.393582 [actor]: child in hosptal son arthur 7 years old

2026-01-28T19:44:00.165502 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a son named Arthur who is 7 years old and is currently in hospital.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Are you responsible for Arthur? By this I mean, do you normally live with him and are you responsible for his care and upbringing?**

2026-01-28T19:44:01.854532 [actor]: yes i look after him hes my son been in hosptal long time

2026-01-28T19:44:03.721014 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. I understand Arthur is your son, you look after him, and he's been in hospital for a long time.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: **How long has Arthur been in hospital - has it been for more or less than 12 weeks (84 days)?**

2026-01-28T19:44:05.339644 [actor]: he was in for 10 weeks then came home then went back in

2026-01-28T19:44:07.334373 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Arthur had a hospital stay of 10 weeks, came home, and then went back into hospital.

To understand your situation better, I need to ask: **How long has Arthur been in hospital during this current stay - is it more or less than 12 weeks (84 days)?**

2026-01-28T19:44:08.650857 [actor]: been back in for 3 weeks now

2026-01-28T19:44:10.908983 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Arthur has been back in hospital for 3 weeks during this current stay.

Now I need to ask: **When Arthur came home between his hospital stays, how long was he at home with you?**

2026-01-28T19:44:12.410847 [actor]: 2 weeks at home between hosptal stays

2026-01-28T19:44:14.596835 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me ask another important question:

**Are you living in the UK, or are you a Crown servant (such as someone working for the UK government abroad) or a member of HM Forces serving abroad?**

2026-01-28T19:44:15.907952 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T19:44:17.739862 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Now I need to ask: **Are you the only person responsible for Arthur, or does someone else also look after him (such as a partner or another parent)?**

2026-01-28T19:44:19.136181 [actor]: just me look after arthur

2026-01-28T19:44:20.688758 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now I need to ask: **Do you have any other children under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T19:44:22.382933 [actor]: no just arthur

2026-01-28T19:44:27.223558 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility for Child Benefit:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Arthur. Here's why:

✓ Arthur is 7 years old (under 16)
✓ You are responsible for him - he's your son and you look after him
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are the only person responsible for Arthur

**Regarding Arthur's hospital stays:**

Even though Arthur has been in hospital, you can still claim Child Benefit because:
- You can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks (84 days) when a child is in hospital
- Arthur's first stay was 10 weeks, and his current stay is 3 weeks - both are under the 12-week limit
- He came home for 2 weeks between stays, which breaks up the hospital time

As long as each individual hospital stay doesn't exceed 12 weeks, you should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit.

**Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-28T19:44:28.721809 [actor]: ok thank u

2026-01-28T19:44:30.324538 [root_agent]: You're very welcome! I hope Arthur recovers well.

If you need any further help with Child Benefit in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Take care!

2026-01-28T19:44:36.034295 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, consecutive hospital stays count cumulatively if separated by 28 days or less, and Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks. Arthur's stays (10 weeks + 3 weeks = 13 weeks total, separated by only 2 weeks) exceed the 12-week threshold cumulatively, making the parent ineligible after the 12th week.
