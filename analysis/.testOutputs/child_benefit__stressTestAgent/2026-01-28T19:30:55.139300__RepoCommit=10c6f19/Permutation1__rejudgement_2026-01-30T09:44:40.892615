**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

**Analysis of the conversation:**

1. **Criteria 1 (Responsibility):** The agent confirmed the user is responsible for an 8-year-old child - ✓
2. **Criteria 2 (Child's Age):** The child is 8 years old, which is under 16 - ✓
3. **Criteria 3 (Residency):** The family are British nationals living in Manchester, UK - ✓
4. **Criteria 4 (Living Arrangements):** The child lives with the applicant - ✓
5. **Criteria 5 (State Support):** No indication the child is in hospital or care - ✓
6. **Criteria 6 (High Income Charge):** The agent verified that neither parent earns over £50,000 individually (husband earns £35,000, applicant earns less) - ✓

The agent systematically gathered all necessary information and correctly concluded: "You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit." The agent also correctly noted that since neither parent earns over £50,000, there would be no High Income Child Benefit Charge to pay.

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
