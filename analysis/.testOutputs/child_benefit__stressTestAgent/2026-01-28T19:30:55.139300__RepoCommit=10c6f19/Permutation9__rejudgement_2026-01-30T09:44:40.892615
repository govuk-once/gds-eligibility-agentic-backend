**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "You may **not be currently eligible** for Child Benefit as a jobseeker with pre-settled status who has only recently arrived in the UK."

However, the expected outcome is that the user should be **Eligible**.

According to the scenario details and UK government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility:

1. **Lars has Pre-Settled Status** under the EU Settlement Scheme as a German citizen
2. **He is a registered jobseeker** with a genuine prospect of work (he confirmed he's "registered jobseeker" and "actively looking for jobs")
3. **He was previously working in Germany** before moving to the UK (he stated "worked in germany before moving uk")
4. **He has a qualifying child** (5-year-old son) who lives with him and for whom he is responsible

The eligibility criteria explicitly state: "Holders of Pre-Settled Status can claim Child Benefit if they are working or meet specific 'right to reside' tests, such as being a registered jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work. Lars fits this category."

The agent incorrectly concluded that "being a jobseeker alone may not provide you with a qualifying right to reside" and determined Lars was not eligible. This contradicts the established eligibility criteria for this specific situation where a Pre-Settled Status holder who previously worked in an EU country and is now a registered jobseeker does have a qualifying right to reside for Child Benefit purposes.

The agent's communicated outcome directly contradicts the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
