2026-01-28T19:34:48.721874 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:34:50.419010 [actor]: child benefit eligibility chek ruby 4 years old

2026-01-28T19:34:53.132085 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have Ruby who is 4 years old.

Next question: **Does Ruby normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards looking after her?**

(Child Benefit is £25.60 a week for the eldest or only child, and £16.95 a week for each additional child)

2026-01-28T19:34:55.063981 [actor]: yes ruby lives with us shes here

2026-01-28T19:34:57.066760 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Ruby lives with you.

Next question: **Are you and Ruby normally living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:34:58.531782 [actor]: live in uk yes residnt here

2026-01-28T19:35:00.763868 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you both live in the UK.

Next question: **Are you responsible for Ruby? This means you're the main person looking after her day-to-day - for example, you make decisions about her care, education, and wellbeing.**

2026-01-28T19:35:02.098229 [actor]: yes looking after ruby everyday

2026-01-28T19:35:05.428060 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Do you have what's called 'right to reside' in the UK? This usually means you are a British citizen, have settled status, pre-settled status, or have another immigration status that gives you the right to live here permanently or access public funds.**

2026-01-28T19:35:06.970803 [actor]: british citizen right to reside yes

2026-01-28T19:35:10.978635 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me:
- Ruby is 4 years old (under 16)
- She lives with you
- You're responsible for her day-to-day care
- You both live in the UK
- You're a British citizen with right to reside in the UK

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Ruby.**

You would receive £25.60 per week (or £102.40 every 4 weeks) for Ruby as your eldest or only child.

One final important question: **Do you or your partner expect to have an individual income over £60,000 in this tax year?** 

(This won't affect your eligibility, but it may affect whether there's a tax charge to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through what's called the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-28T19:35:12.699564 [actor]: fiona earns 75000 per year

2026-01-28T19:35:15.186844 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. So Fiona earns £75,000 per year.

To give you complete information about the High Income Child Benefit Charge, I need to ask:

**What is your relationship to Fiona - are you partners/living together, or is this a different arrangement?**

(The High Income Child Benefit Charge applies if either you or a partner you live with has an individual income over £60,000)

2026-01-28T19:35:16.804120 [actor]: we live together fiona and james

2026-01-28T19:35:22.572880 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you live together.

**Summary of your Child Benefit eligibility:**

✓ **You are eligible for Child Benefit for Ruby.** You can claim £25.60 per week (£102.40 every 4 weeks).

**Important information about the High Income Child Benefit Charge:**

Since Fiona earns £75,000 per year (which is over £60,000), whoever claims the Child Benefit will need to pay back some of it through the tax system. This is called the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

With an income of £75,000, the charge would be approximately **75% of the Child Benefit received** (the charge is 1% for every £200 over £60,000, up to 100% at £80,000 or above).

**You have two options:**

1. **Claim Child Benefit and pay the charge** - You receive the payments but the higher earner pays back a portion through their tax return
2. **Opt out of receiving payments** - You still register for Child Benefit (which protects Ruby's National Insurance record and future state pension) but choose not to receive the money, so there's no charge to pay back

Does this make sense, or do you have any questions?

2026-01-28T19:35:24.242467 [actor]: ok so eligible then need to pay back some got it

2026-01-28T19:35:27.966502 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately established that the claimant is eligible for Child Benefit for Ruby (4-year-old child living with them in the UK), correctly identified that the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies due to Fiona's £75,000 income exceeding the £60,000 threshold, and properly explained that approximately 75% would need to be paid back through tax.
