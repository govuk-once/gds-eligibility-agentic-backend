2026-01-28T19:36:40.993619 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:36:42.565556 [actor]: child benefit 17 year old apprenticship england

2026-01-28T19:36:45.130816 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask a clarifying question:

**Is your 17-year-old in an approved apprenticeship program in England?**

(Approved apprenticeships and certain training programs can qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes up to age 20.)

2026-01-28T19:36:46.705378 [actor]: yes son ryan aprentice started last week

2026-01-28T19:36:48.873346 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Your son Ryan is 17 and started an approved apprenticeship last week, which is good to know.

Now I need to ask:

**Does Ryan live with you, or are you the person responsible for him?**

2026-01-28T19:36:50.138295 [actor]: lives with me hes 17

2026-01-28T19:36:52.164783 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Ryan lives with you and he's 17.

Now let me ask:

**Are you (or your partner, if you have one) the only person claiming Child Benefit for Ryan, or is someone else also claiming Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T19:36:53.651293 [actor]: nobody claiming thats why im asking can i get it

2026-01-28T19:36:55.554522 [root_agent]: Perfect, that's helpful to know that nobody is currently claiming Child Benefit for Ryan.

Let me ask you this:

**Are you or your partner receiving Child Benefit for any other children at the moment?**

2026-01-28T19:36:57.369982 [actor]: no just ryan hes my only one im karen can i get the benefit or not

2026-01-28T19:36:59.540909 [root_agent]: Thank you, Karen. I understand you're eager to know if you're eligible. I just need to ask one more important question to complete the assessment:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:37:01.418770 [actor]: yes im in england live here always have can i get child benefit for ryan hes doing apprenticship

2026-01-28T19:37:06.646788 [root_agent]: Thank you for your patience, Karen. Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

**Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Ryan!**

Here's why:
- Ryan is 17 years old (under 20) ✓
- He's in an approved apprenticeship (which counts as approved education or training) ✓
- He lives with you and you're responsible for him ✓
- You live in the UK (England) ✓
- Nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Ryan ✓

You meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. You can claim Child Benefit for Ryan while he continues in his approved apprenticeship, up until he turns 20 or leaves the apprenticeship program.

**Important to note:** If your individual income (or your partner's) is over £50,000 per year, you can still claim Child Benefit, but you may have to pay a tax charge called the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Would you like any clarification about anything?

2026-01-28T19:37:10.217822 [actor]: okay thanks got my answer

2026-01-28T19:37:14.512884 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit stops when a young person starts paid work of 24 hours or more per week, even if they are under 20. Apprenticeships are paid employment, and most apprenticeships involve working at least 30 hours per week (including time spent training). The agent failed to ask about the hours Ryan works in his apprenticeship, which is a critical eligibility factor, and incorrectly stated that apprenticeships automatically qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes when they typically disqualify claimants due to being paid work exceeding 24 hours per week.
