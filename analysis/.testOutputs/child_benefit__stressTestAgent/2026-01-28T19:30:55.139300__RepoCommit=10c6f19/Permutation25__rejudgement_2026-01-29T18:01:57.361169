**Justification:**

The expected outcome is **Eligible**, and the agent ultimately concluded the user is eligible for Child Benefit.

The agent properly applied the relevant exception to the 8-week local authority care rule. According to gov.uk guidance on "Child Benefit for children in hospital or care," parents can continue to receive Child Benefit even when their child is in care beyond 8 weeks if they contribute towards the child's upkeep at least the amount of Child Benefit or the fostering allowance.

Key facts:
- Child has been in local authority care for 10 weeks (exceeds 8-week threshold)
- Husband pays £30/week to the foster carer for child's upkeep
- £30/week exceeds the Child Benefit rate (approximately £24/week for eldest/only child)
- The husband's contribution counts as the applicant's contribution since they are married and living together

The agent initially gave an incorrect answer, stating the user was not eligible simply because the child exceeded 8 weeks in care. However, after the user persisted and mentioned the upkeep payments, the agent reconsidered and correctly concluded that **the user is eligible** because the £30/week payment exceeds the Child Benefit threshold.

The final determination matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
