2026-01-28T19:32:53.607654 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:32:55.299460 [actor]: child benefti eligble lucas 10 yrs old send money

2026-01-28T19:32:57.866976 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child named Lucas who is 10 years old, which meets the age requirement.

Now I need to ask: **Are you responsible for Lucas? This means, do you live with him and are you the main person looking after him (paying for things like food, clothes, and housing)?**

2026-01-28T19:32:59.378916 [actor]: send 150 per month jenny food clothes lucas

2026-01-28T19:33:01.648173 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. Let me make sure I understand your situation correctly.

It sounds like you're sending £150 per month to someone named Jenny for Lucas's food and clothes, which suggests Lucas may not be living with you.

**Does Lucas live with you, or does he live with Jenny or someone else?**

2026-01-28T19:33:03.230659 [actor]: lucas lives jenny ex wife divorced

2026-01-28T19:33:06.394720 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Lucas lives with Jenny, your ex-wife, and you send her £150 per month to help with his costs.

This is an important point: Generally, only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, and it's usually the person the child lives with.

Let me ask: **Are you the main person responsible for Lucas, meaning you make the day-to-day decisions about his care and pay for most of his costs? Or does Jenny primarily look after him and make those decisions?**

2026-01-28T19:33:08.337685 [actor]: jenny looks after him but send 150 month for lucas costs

2026-01-28T19:33:11.600055 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, it appears that:

- Lucas lives with Jenny (your ex-wife)
- Jenny is the one who primarily looks after him and makes day-to-day decisions
- You contribute £150 per month towards his costs

In this situation, **Jenny would typically be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit** because she's the person Lucas lives with and who is mainly responsible for him.

However, let me ask one more question to be thorough: **Do you and Jenny share Lucas's care equally - for example, does he spend an equal amount of time living with each of you?**

2026-01-28T19:33:13.335503 [actor]: no lucas lives with jenny all time just send money

2026-01-28T19:33:16.619444 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas** because:

- Lucas lives with Jenny full-time
- Jenny is the person responsible for his day-to-day care
- Child Benefit is claimed by the person the child lives with and who is mainly responsible for them

**Jenny would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas**, as she's the one he lives with and who looks after him.

The £150 you send monthly is child maintenance/support, which is separate from Child Benefit. Jenny can claim Child Benefit regardless of whether you contribute financially.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T19:33:18.121043 [actor]: but jenny not claiming child benefit can i claim then

2026-01-28T19:33:22.342842 [root_agent]: That's a good question. Let me be clear about this:

**No, you still cannot claim Child Benefit for Lucas, even if Jenny is not claiming it.**

The eligibility rules are based on who the child lives with and who is responsible for them, not on whether someone else is currently claiming. Since Lucas lives with Jenny full-time and she is the one looking after him, only she would be eligible to claim.

However, there is one question I should ask: **Is Jenny refusing or unwilling to claim Child Benefit for Lucas? If so, do you know why?**

This is important because if the eligible person (Jenny) won't claim, there may be other considerations, though it wouldn't automatically make you eligible to claim instead.

2026-01-28T19:33:23.872028 [actor]: jenny not claiming dont know why just want claim for lucas contribute money

2026-01-28T19:33:27.915349 [root_agent]: I understand you want to claim because you're contributing money towards Lucas's care, but I need to be clear:

**You cannot claim Child Benefit for Lucas because he doesn't live with you.** The rules state that Child Benefit goes to the person the child lives with and who is responsible for their day-to-day care - which is Jenny in this case.

The fact that Jenny isn't claiming it doesn't transfer eligibility to you. Child Benefit is not based on who provides financial support, but on who the child lives with.

However, let me ask: **Does Lucas ever stay with you regularly - for example, does he spend weekends or certain days of the week living at your home?** 

If there's shared care arrangements where he spends significant time living with you, that could potentially affect the situation.

2026-01-28T19:33:29.389359 [actor]: no just send money 150 month for food clothes exceeds child benefit amount

2026-01-28T19:33:33.355052 [root_agent]: I understand your frustration - you're contributing £150 per month, which is indeed more than the Child Benefit amount (currently around £25 per week for the eldest/only child, which is about £108 per month).

However, I must be clear: **You still cannot claim Child Benefit for Lucas, regardless of how much money you send.**

Child Benefit eligibility is not based on:
- How much money you contribute
- Whether your contribution exceeds the Child Benefit amount
- Whether the other parent is claiming it

It is based on:
- Who the child lives with
- Who is responsible for the child's day-to-day care

Since Lucas lives with Jenny full-time and she looks after him, **only Jenny is eligible to claim Child Benefit**, even if she chooses not to.

The money you send is child maintenance/support, which is separate from Child Benefit and doesn't create eligibility for you.

Is there anything else about your situation or Child Benefit that I can help clarify?

2026-01-28T19:33:39.031168 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately and consistently explained that the user cannot claim Child Benefit because the child (Lucas) lives with the ex-wife (Jenny) full-time, and Child Benefit eligibility is based on who the child lives with and who provides day-to-day care, not on financial contributions.
