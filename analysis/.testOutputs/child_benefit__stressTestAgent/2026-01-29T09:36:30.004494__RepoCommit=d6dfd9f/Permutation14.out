2026-01-29T09:44:13.779269 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T09:44:15.467761 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Noah, who's 6 years old.

2026-01-29T09:44:17.409186 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Do you live in the UK, or are you considered responsible for your son Noah (for example, you live with him and are responsible for his care)?

2026-01-29T09:44:19.987862 [actor]: Well, that's actually a bit complicated right now. I normally live with Noah and I'm responsible for him, but he's currently staying with his grandmother temporarily. I had to have surgery recently and I'm recovering, so it's a family emergency situation. He's been there for about 6 weeks now.

2026-01-29T09:44:22.265333 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. I understand that can be a difficult situation, and I hope your recovery is going well.

To help me assess your eligibility properly, can you tell me: Do you expect Noah to return to live with you once you've recovered, or is this a more permanent arrangement with his grandmother?

2026-01-29T09:44:24.463062 [actor]: Oh yes, he'll definitely be coming back to live with me once I'm fully recovered. This is just temporary while I get back on my feet. It's not a permanent arrangement at all - his grandmother is just helping out during this difficult time.

2026-01-29T09:44:26.387813 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like this is a temporary arrangement during your recovery.

Now, to continue assessing your eligibility: Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Noah, or would this be a new claim?

2026-01-29T09:44:27.855780 [actor]: This would be a new claim - I'm not currently receiving Child Benefit for Noah.

2026-01-29T09:44:29.545993 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now, can you tell me: Are you (or your partner if you have one) responsible for paying National Insurance contributions in the UK, or do you receive certain UK benefits or tax credits?

2026-01-29T09:44:31.643539 [actor]: Yes, I pay National Insurance contributions in the UK. I'm working, so that's all sorted.

2026-01-29T09:44:33.882835 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know, thank you.

One more important question: Is Noah's grandmother claiming Child Benefit for him while he's staying with her during your recovery?

2026-01-29T09:44:35.659584 [actor]: No, she's not claiming Child Benefit for him. She's just helping me out temporarily while I recover - she hasn't made any claim.

2026-01-29T09:44:40.074284 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Noah.**

Here's why:

1. **You have a qualifying child**: Noah is 6 years old, which is under 16
2. **You're responsible for him**: Even though Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother while you recover from surgery, this is a temporary arrangement and he normally lives with you
3. **You're in the UK**: You work and pay National Insurance contributions here
4. **No one else is claiming**: His grandmother isn't claiming Child Benefit for Noah

The fact that Noah is temporarily away from you due to your medical emergency shouldn't affect your eligibility, as you remain responsible for him and he will be returning to live with you once you've recovered.

You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit. Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or the claiming process?

2026-01-29T09:44:42.736691 [actor]: Oh, that's such a relief! Thank you so much for explaining all of that. I was worried that because he wasn't actually living with me right now, I wouldn't be able to claim. That really helps - I don't have any other questions right now.

2026-01-29T09:44:46.488566 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly assessed that temporary absence due to medical emergency does not affect Child Benefit eligibility when the child is expected to return and no one else is claiming, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible."
