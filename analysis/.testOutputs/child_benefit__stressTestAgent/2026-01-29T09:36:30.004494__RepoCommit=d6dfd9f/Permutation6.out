2026-01-29T09:39:25.136365 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T09:39:26.816690 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Chloe. She's 6 years old.

2026-01-29T09:39:28.320378 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Chloe live with you, or does she live with someone else?

2026-01-29T09:39:30.360781 [actor]: Well, she doesn't live with me at the moment. She's been in hospital for about 14 weeks now - she has a serious condition. But I visit her every day and I pay for things she needs while she's there.

2026-01-29T09:39:32.325606 [root_agent]: I'm sorry to hear that Chloe has been unwell. Thank you for sharing that information.

Before Chloe went into hospital, did she live with you?

2026-01-29T09:39:33.843710 [actor]: Yes, she lived with me before she went into hospital.

2026-01-29T09:39:35.491247 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Chloe, or are you applying for the first time?

2026-01-29T09:39:37.427890 [actor]: I'm currently receiving it, but I'm worried about whether I can still get it since she's been in hospital for so long now.

2026-01-29T09:39:39.098503 [root_agent]: I understand your concern. Let me ask you an important question about this:

Is Chloe expected to be in hospital for more than 12 weeks in total?

2026-01-29T09:39:40.767306 [actor]: Yes, she's already been there for 14 weeks, so she's already been in for more than 12 weeks.

2026-01-29T09:39:42.935019 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I have one more important question:

During the time Chloe has been in hospital, have you been contributing to the cost of supporting her - for example, paying for things she needs?

2026-01-29T09:39:44.799886 [actor]: Yes, definitely. I spend about £30 a week on things for her - books, pyjamas, special food she likes. I make sure she has what she needs while she's there.

2026-01-29T09:39:48.882110 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you can continue to receive Child Benefit for Chloe.**

Here's why you remain eligible:

Even though Chloe has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks, you can still get Child Benefit because you are contributing at least £30 a week towards the cost of supporting her. The rules allow you to continue receiving Child Benefit when a child is in hospital long-term, as long as you're contributing to their support.

Since you were receiving Child Benefit before Chloe went into hospital, she lived with you previously, and you're actively contributing to her care costs (which meets the minimum threshold), you remain eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for her.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T09:39:52.591895 [actor]: Oh, that's such a relief! Thank you so much for explaining that. I was really worried I'd lose the benefit. No, I don't have any other questions - you've been very helpful.

2026-01-29T09:39:54.975184 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the exception rule that allows Child Benefit to continue when a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks, provided the parent contributes at least £30 per week to the child's support, which matches the scenario requirements for "Eligible (via Exception)".
