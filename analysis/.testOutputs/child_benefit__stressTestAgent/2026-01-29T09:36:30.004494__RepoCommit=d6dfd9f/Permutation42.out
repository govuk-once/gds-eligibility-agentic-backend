2026-01-29T10:02:49.460696 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child (or children) who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T10:02:51.413469 [actor]: Yes, I do. I'm actually asking about my daughter - she's 17 and she's just started a Foundation Apprenticeship here in Wales. Does that count?

2026-01-29T10:02:54.135722 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. A Foundation Apprenticeship is a good start to explore.

To help me assess this properly, could you tell me: is your daughter's Foundation Apprenticeship an approved education or training course? Specifically, is it full-time (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience)?

2026-01-29T10:02:56.476338 [actor]: Yes, it's definitely full-time - she's there during the week, much more than 12 hours. It's a Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government. She lives with me here in Cardiff.

2026-01-29T10:02:59.539246 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you. Since your daughter is 17, in full-time education, and lives with you, that's looking positive so far.

Now I need to ask: are you responsible for your daughter? By this I mean, do you have the main day-to-day responsibility for looking after her?

2026-01-29T10:03:01.745926 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. She lives with me and I'm her mother - I look after her day-to-day needs, provide for her, all of that. It's just the two of us here.

2026-01-29T10:03:04.062260 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's very helpful.

Now, an important question: do you normally live in the UK? This means you're resident here and not subject to immigration control that would prevent you from claiming benefits.

2026-01-29T10:03:05.831692 [actor]: Yes, we both live here in Cardiff. We're UK residents, no immigration issues or anything like that.

2026-01-29T10:03:08.513404 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now I need to ask about your income: do you or your partner have an individual income of more than £60,000 a year? (This is important because if someone in your household earns over this amount, there may be a High Income Child Benefit Charge that applies.)

2026-01-29T10:03:10.453709 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that amount, and I don't have a partner. It's just me and my daughter.

2026-01-29T10:03:14.403025 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, you appear to be **eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ Your daughter is 17 and in full-time approved education (the Foundation Apprenticeship)
✓ You are responsible for her day-to-day care
✓ She lives with you
✓ You both normally live in the UK
✓ Your income is below £60,000

Since your daughter is under 20 and in approved full-time education or training (which includes apprenticeships), she qualifies as a child for Child Benefit purposes.

You should be able to claim Child Benefit for her. If you haven't already claimed, you can apply online or by post. The benefit continues until she turns 20, or until she leaves full-time approved education or training, whichever comes first.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T10:03:18.374694 [actor]: That's brilliant, thank you so much for explaining that! That's really helpful to know that the Foundation Apprenticeship counts as approved education. I'll go ahead and apply for it then. Thank you!

2026-01-29T10:03:21.119796 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. Foundation Apprenticeships are work-based training programs that typically do not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes, as they are apprenticeships which generally involve employment contracts and do not meet the criteria of full-time non-advanced education required for Child Benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds.
