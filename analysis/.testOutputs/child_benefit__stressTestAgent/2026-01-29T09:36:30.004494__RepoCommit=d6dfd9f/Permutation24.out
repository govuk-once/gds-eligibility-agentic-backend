2026-01-29T09:51:02.120766 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T09:51:03.608158 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Tom, who is 14 years old.

2026-01-29T09:51:05.303417 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Does your son Tom normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T09:51:07.065379 [actor]: Well, he used to live with me, but he moved into a residential school about 10 weeks ago. The local council pays for it because he has severe behavioral needs.

2026-01-29T09:51:09.096877 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. This is an important detail for determining your eligibility.

**Does Tom come home to stay with you during school holidays, or does he remain at the residential school full-time?**

2026-01-29T09:51:10.617825 [actor]: He comes home during the school holidays to stay with me.

2026-01-29T09:51:12.650996 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, let me ask another important question:

**Before Tom moved to the residential school, were you the person receiving Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-29T09:51:14.187960 [actor]: Yes, I was receiving Child Benefit for him before he moved to the residential school.

2026-01-29T09:51:16.063162 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to understand the current arrangement better:

**Since Tom moved to the residential school 10 weeks ago, have you continued to receive Child Benefit for him, or has it stopped?**

2026-01-29T09:51:17.944650 [actor]: I've continued to receive it, but I wanted to check if I'm still eligible since he's been there for 10 weeks now.

2026-01-29T09:51:19.899066 [root_agent]: That's a very responsible question to ask. Let me ask one more important question to give you accurate guidance:

**Is the residential school that Tom attends located in the UK?**

2026-01-29T09:51:21.286521 [actor]: Yes, the residential school is in the UK.

2026-01-29T09:51:26.626692 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, I can now assess your eligibility.

**Good news - you should still be eligible for Child Benefit for Tom.**

Here's why:

- Tom is under 16 years old
- He lives at a residential school that is paid for by the local council
- He comes home to stay with you during school holidays
- You were receiving Child Benefit before he moved to the school

According to the rules, when a child lives away in residential accommodation that is paid for by a local council, you can continue to claim Child Benefit if the child regularly comes home during school holidays - which Tom does.

The key factor is that Tom maintains his connection to your home and returns during holidays. This means you remain his primary caregiver, even though he lives at the school during term time.

You should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit without any issues. Since it's already been 10 weeks and you've been receiving it, this confirms the arrangement is working correctly.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T09:51:33.201694 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on children in care or hospital, Child Benefit can only continue for up to 12 weeks when a child is in residential accommodation paid for by the local council. Since Tom has been at the residential school for 10 weeks, the agent should have informed the parent that eligibility will end at week 12, not that they "should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit without any issues" indefinitely.
