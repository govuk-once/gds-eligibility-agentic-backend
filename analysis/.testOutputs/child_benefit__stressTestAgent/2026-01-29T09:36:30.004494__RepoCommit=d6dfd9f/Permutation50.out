2026-01-29T10:07:31.682267 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T10:07:33.483585 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Fiona. She's 16 and she's living with me here in Edinburgh.

2026-01-29T10:07:35.063914 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is Fiona in full-time non-advanced education or approved training?

2026-01-29T10:07:37.446867 [actor]: Yes, she is! She left school and joined the No One Left Behind programme. That's a training programme here in Scotland.

2026-01-29T10:07:39.219237 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know. Let me ask you a bit more about your situation.

Are you a UK resident, or do you live and work in the UK?

2026-01-29T10:07:40.460982 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK resident. I live and work here in Edinburgh.

2026-01-29T10:07:42.865606 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now, let me ask about your relationship with Fiona.

Are you responsible for Fiona - meaning do you live with her and are responsible for her care, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards looking after her?

2026-01-29T10:07:44.877931 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Fiona lives with me and I'm responsible for her care. I look after her day-to-day needs.

2026-01-29T10:07:46.582709 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me ask one more important question.

Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Fiona?

2026-01-29T10:07:48.143401 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for her. It's just me looking after her.

2026-01-29T10:07:52.429573 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be **eligible for Child Benefit** for Fiona. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Fiona, age 16) who you're responsible for
✓ She lives with you and you're responsible for her care
✓ She's in approved training (the No One Left Behind programme)
✓ You're a UK resident living and working in Edinburgh
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

Since Fiona is 16 and in approved training, you can continue to claim Child Benefit for her. Child Benefit can continue beyond age 16 if the young person is in approved education or training.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit. If you haven't already claimed, you can do so online or by post.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-29T10:07:54.376957 [actor]: No, that's brilliant! Thank you so much for your help. That's exactly what I needed to know. I'll go ahead and apply for it then.

2026-01-29T10:07:58.137154 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on all the correct criteria: the child is 16 and in approved training (No One Left Behind programme in Scotland), the user is responsible for the child's care, they live together in the UK, and no one else is claiming the benefit.
