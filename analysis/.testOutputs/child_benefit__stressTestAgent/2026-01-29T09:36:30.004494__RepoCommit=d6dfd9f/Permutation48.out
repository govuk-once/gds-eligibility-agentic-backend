2026-01-29T10:06:25.515717 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T10:06:27.052331 [actor]: Yes, I have a daughter. She's 18 and she's studying at college.

2026-01-29T10:06:28.886847 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To clarify - is your daughter studying full-time at college, and is this an approved course of education or training?

2026-01-29T10:06:30.479385 [actor]: Yes, she's studying full-time. She's doing a Higher National Certificate - an HNC course.

2026-01-29T10:06:32.317873 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you. An HNC is generally considered approved education.

Now, does your daughter live with you, or does she live with someone else?

2026-01-29T10:06:33.959719 [actor]: She lives with me.

2026-01-29T10:06:36.001314 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now I need to ask about your responsibility for her.

Are you responsible for your daughter? This means you're the person who is mainly responsible for her day-to-day care and upbringing.

2026-01-29T10:06:37.787839 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for her. I'm her parent and I look after her day-to-day needs.

2026-01-29T10:06:39.827464 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I have a few more questions to determine your eligibility.

Do you normally live in the UK? (This means the UK is your main home, even if you travel abroad sometimes.)

2026-01-29T10:06:41.618000 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. This is my main home.

2026-01-29T10:06:43.908095 [root_agent]: Thank you. One more important question:

Are you or your partner's individual income over £50,000 per year, or do you expect it to be over £50,000 in the current tax year?

2026-01-29T10:06:45.644987 [actor]: No, my income is under £50,000.

2026-01-29T10:06:49.833695 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a daughter who is 18 years old and studying full-time on an approved course (HNC)
✓ She lives with you
✓ You are responsible for her day-to-day care
✓ You normally live in the UK
✓ Your income is under £50,000

You can claim Child Benefit for your daughter until she turns 20, as long as she continues in approved full-time education or training.

If you haven't already claimed, you can apply for Child Benefit. If your circumstances change (such as your daughter leaving education, moving out, or your income exceeding £50,000), you should report this as it may affect your eligibility or the amount you receive.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:06:52.085761 [actor]: Thank you, that's really helpful to know. I think I have all the information I need now.

2026-01-29T10:06:56.000695 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated I "appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" when the expected outcome was "Not Eligible" - the agent has therefore failed the test by reaching the wrong conclusion about eligibility.
