2026-01-29T10:03:23.108453 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask: **Do you have a child or children under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:03:25.060763 [actor]: Yes, I have a son who's 17. He lives with me here in Glasgow and he's just started a Modern Apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T10:03:27.897278 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. A Modern Apprenticeship could potentially qualify as approved education or training.

To help me assess this further: **Is your son's Modern Apprenticeship an approved course, and is he studying full-time (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience)?**

2026-01-29T10:03:29.900042 [actor]: Yes, it's a proper Modern Apprenticeship programme - he's doing it full-time, definitely more than 12 hours a week. He's working with a local engineering company as part of it.

2026-01-29T10:03:32.178175 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you. Modern Apprenticeships can qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Now I need to understand your relationship with your son: **Are you the person responsible for your son? This means, do you live with him and are you responsible for his care and upbringing?**

2026-01-29T10:03:34.061146 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me - it's just the two of us here in Glasgow. I'm his father and I'm responsible for him.

2026-01-29T10:03:36.477317 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's very helpful.

Now I need to ask about your residency status: **Are you living in the UK, and do you have the right to reside here? For example, are you a UK citizen, or do you have settled status, or another immigration status that allows you to live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:03:38.267927 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK citizen. Born and raised in Scotland, lived here all my life.

2026-01-29T10:03:41.010054 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

One final question to complete the assessment: **Does anyone else also receive Child Benefit for your son, or does your son live with anyone else who might be claiming Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-29T10:03:42.853688 [actor]: No, it's just me and him. No one else is claiming anything for him.

2026-01-29T10:03:46.672783 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit** for your 17-year-old son.

Here's why you qualify:

✓ Your son is under 20 years old
✓ He's in approved education/training (his full-time Modern Apprenticeship with more than 12 hours per week)
✓ He lives with you and you're responsible for him
✓ You're a UK citizen living in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

You can now apply for Child Benefit if you haven't already done so. The benefit will continue until your son turns 20, or until he finishes or leaves his approved education or training, whichever comes first.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:03:50.119102 [actor]: Thank you so much for your help! That's really clear and helpful. I'll get the application sorted out then. Appreciate it!

2026-01-29T10:03:52.631096 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. Modern Apprenticeships are work-based training that include employment, and according to gov.uk guidance, young people who start paid work (including apprenticeships) are not eligible for Child Benefit as apprenticeships do not count as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.
