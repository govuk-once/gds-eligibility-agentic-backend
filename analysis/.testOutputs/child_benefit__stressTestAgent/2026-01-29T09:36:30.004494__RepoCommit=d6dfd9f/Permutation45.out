2026-01-29T10:04:21.027617 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:04:22.886196 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, she's 8 years old.

2026-01-29T10:04:24.558662 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Does your daughter normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T10:04:26.689426 [actor]: Well, not at the moment. She's been in the hospital for about 14 weeks now. I visit her every single day and spend hours with her to keep her company, but she's been staying there for her treatment.

2026-01-29T10:04:28.988872 [root_agent]: I'm sorry to hear your daughter has been in hospital. It sounds like you're being very supportive.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Before your daughter went into hospital, did she normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T10:04:30.476510 [actor]: Yes, she lived with me before she went into hospital. She's always lived with me.

2026-01-29T10:04:32.686557 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now, regarding her hospital stay: **Is your daughter expected to return home to live with you once her treatment is complete, or are there plans for her to live somewhere else after she leaves hospital?**

2026-01-29T10:04:34.715793 [actor]: Yes, of course she'll come back home to live with me once she's better. There's no plan for her to go anywhere else - she's my daughter and this is her home.

2026-01-29T10:04:36.732033 [root_agent]: That's good to hear. I have a few more questions to determine your eligibility.

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your daughter, or would this be a new claim?**

2026-01-29T10:04:38.908478 [actor]: I'm currently receiving Child Benefit for her, but I'm worried because she's been in hospital for so long now - 14 weeks. I just want to make sure I'm still eligible since she's not at home.

2026-01-29T10:04:40.940062 [root_agent]: That's a very understandable concern, and I'm glad you're checking.

Let me ask you: **Is your daughter in hospital receiving free NHS treatment, or is she in a private hospital where you're paying for her care?**

2026-01-29T10:04:42.418437 [actor]: She's in an NHS hospital receiving free treatment. I'm not paying for her medical care.

2026-01-29T10:04:44.846010 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I have one more important question:

**During the time your daughter has been in hospital, have you continued to contribute to the cost of providing for her - for example, by maintaining her room at home, keeping her belongings, buying things she needs, or contributing to her upkeep in any way?**

2026-01-29T10:04:47.756348 [actor]: Well, I visit her every day for hours to keep her company and support her emotionally. But as for buying things - no, not really. The hospital provides everything she needs - her meals, clothes, everything. So I haven't been spending money on food, clothes, or gifts or anything like that because the hospital takes care of it all.

2026-01-29T10:04:50.794931 [root_agent]: Thank you for being honest about that. I have one final question to complete the assessment:

**Are you paying any contributions towards the cost of your daughter's care or maintenance to the hospital or any other organization while she's been receiving treatment?**

2026-01-29T10:04:52.659644 [actor]: No, I'm not paying any contributions. As I said, it's NHS treatment so it's all free. I'm not paying the hospital anything for her care.

2026-01-29T10:04:58.702092 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, I need to share some important information with you about your Child Benefit eligibility.

**Unfortunately, you are not eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit while your daughter remains in hospital under these circumstances.**

Here's why:

When a child is in hospital receiving free NHS treatment for more than 12 weeks (84 days), you can only continue to receive Child Benefit if you are **contributing to the cost of providing for that child** during their hospital stay.

In your situation:
- Your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks (which is over the 12-week threshold)
- She's receiving free NHS treatment
- The hospital is providing everything she needs (meals, clothes, etc.)
- You're not paying any contributions toward her care or maintenance
- While your emotional support and daily visits are wonderful and important for your daughter, they don't count as financial contributions for Child Benefit purposes

**What you should do:**
You should inform the Child Benefit Office about your daughter's hospital stay as soon as possible. Your Child Benefit payments should have stopped after she had been in hospital for 12 weeks.

Once your daughter returns home to live with you after her treatment, you will become eligible for Child Benefit again and should contact them to restart your payments.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-29T10:05:01.242023 [actor]: Oh no, I see. That's disappointing but I understand. So once she comes home, I can claim it again? That's good to know at least. Thank you for explaining it to me. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office right away to let them know about the situation.

2026-01-29T10:05:05.621327 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks receiving free NHS treatment, and I am not contributing to the cost of her maintenance during this time, which is a requirement under these circumstances according to gov.uk guidance.
