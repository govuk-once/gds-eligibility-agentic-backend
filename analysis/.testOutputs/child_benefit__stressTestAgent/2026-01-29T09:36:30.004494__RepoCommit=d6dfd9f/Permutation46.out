2026-01-29T10:05:07.705030 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:05:09.367833 [actor]: Yes, I do have a child I'm responsible for.

2026-01-29T10:05:11.396134 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

My next question is:

**Is your child under 16 years old, or are they under 20 and in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T10:05:12.847778 [actor]: Yes, my child is under 16.

2026-01-29T10:05:14.534926 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Next, I need to ask:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:05:16.157816 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:05:18.542467 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you the person responsible for the child? This means you're the main person looking after them - they live with you, or you're paying at least the same as Child Benefit or the equivalent amount towards looking after them.**

2026-01-29T10:05:19.893710 [actor]: Yes, I'm the person responsible for the child. They live with me.

2026-01-29T10:05:22.174451 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question:

**Does anyone else currently claim Child Benefit for this child?**

(Only one person can claim Child Benefit for each child, so if someone else is already claiming for them, you wouldn't be able to make a claim.)

2026-01-29T10:05:23.526803 [actor]: No, no one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for this child.

2026-01-29T10:05:27.270813 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for answering all those questions.

Based on the information you've provided:

✓ You have a child under 16
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are responsible for the child and they live with you
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit!**

You meet the basic eligibility criteria. However, please be aware that:

- If you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000, you may need to pay a tax charge (the High Income Child Benefit Charge), though you can still claim
- You'll need to make a formal claim to receive the benefit

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:05:32.729171 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly verified all eligibility criteria (child under 16, UK residence, responsible person, no duplicate claims) and correctly concluded eligibility for Child Benefit, while appropriately mentioning the High Income Child Benefit Charge consideration.
