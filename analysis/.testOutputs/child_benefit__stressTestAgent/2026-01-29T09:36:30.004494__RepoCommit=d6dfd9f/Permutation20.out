2026-01-29T09:47:22.184506 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T09:47:24.019606 [actor]: Yes, I do. I'm looking after my granddaughter Lucia. She's 14 and lives with me.

2026-01-29T09:47:27.064818 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that you're caring for your 14-year-old granddaughter Lucia who lives with you.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for Lucia in terms of providing for her care and upbringing? In other words, do you make decisions about her welfare and pay for things like her food, clothing, and other needs?

2026-01-29T09:47:29.642488 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I pay for everything - her food, clothes, school things, everything she needs. Her parents aren't able to care for her and they don't contribute anything financially. It's just me taking care of her.

2026-01-29T09:47:31.959401 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like you have full responsibility for Lucia's care and upbringing.

Now I need to ask about residency: Do you live in the UK, and does Lucia live with you in the UK?

2026-01-29T09:47:33.662393 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. Lucia lives with me full-time here.

2026-01-29T09:47:36.403855 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Next, I need to ask: Are you or Lucia receiving any benefits or support from your local council for her care? For example, is Lucia in the care of the local authority, or are you receiving fostering allowances or any similar payments?

2026-01-29T09:47:38.444473 [actor]: No, there's nothing like that. There's no court order or fostering arrangement - it's just an informal family arrangement. The council isn't paying for anything. I'm just her grandmother looking after her because her parents can't.

2026-01-29T09:47:41.208893 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's very clear.

I have one more important question: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year? This is relevant because there are special tax considerations for Child Benefit if someone in the household earns above £50,000.

2026-01-29T09:47:42.893101 [actor]: No, I don't have a partner and my income is well below that. I'm 60 and don't earn anywhere near £60,000.

2026-01-29T09:47:47.665435 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions so clearly.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your granddaughter Lucia. Here's why:

✓ You are responsible for Lucia (you're caring for her and paying for her needs)
✓ Lucia is under 16 (she's 14)
✓ You both live in the UK
✓ Lucia lives with you
✓ She is not in local authority care
✓ Your income is below the threshold where tax charges would apply

As Lucia's grandmother who has taken on full responsibility for her care, you can claim Child Benefit. You don't need to be a child's parent to claim - grandparents, other relatives, or even non-relatives who are responsible for a child can claim.

You can apply for Child Benefit online or by post. Would you like any additional information about the application process or anything else related to Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T09:47:50.292100 [actor]: Oh that's such a relief to hear! Thank you so much for explaining it all to me. I wasn't sure if I could claim since I'm not her parent, but knowing that I'm eligible will really help. I think I have all the information I need for now - I'll go ahead and look into making the application. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T09:47:54.344119 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the grandmother is eligible for Child Benefit based on all the relevant criteria: she has responsibility for a child under 16 who lives with her in the UK, the child is not in local authority care, and her income is below the threshold for tax charges.
