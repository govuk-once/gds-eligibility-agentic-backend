2026-01-29T09:56:57.503596 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T09:56:59.339731 [actor]: Hello, yes I am. I'm asking about my son Rashid. He's 17 and still doing his A-Levels at college.

2026-01-29T09:57:01.562080 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Rashid is 17 and doing his A-Levels, that's good - approved education or training can extend eligibility up to age 20.

Now, let me ask: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T09:57:03.322359 [actor]: Yes, we all live in the UK together. Rashid lives with me and my wife in our house.

2026-01-29T09:57:06.019560 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you. 

Next question: **Are you or your wife the person responsible for Rashid? By this I mean, does one of you have the main responsibility for him - for example, living with him day-to-day and being responsible for his care?**

2026-01-29T09:57:08.136682 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm his father and he lives with us. I'm responsible for him - we provide for him, he lives in our house with us.

2026-01-29T09:57:10.599836 [root_agent]: Perfect, that's clear. Thank you.

Now I need to ask: **Are you or your wife getting certain other benefits for Rashid that might affect Child Benefit eligibility - specifically, are either of you receiving Universal Credit or Tax Credits that already include an amount for Rashid?**

2026-01-29T09:57:12.371405 [actor]: No, we're not receiving Universal Credit or Tax Credits for him. We just want to know if we can continue claiming Child Benefit for Rashid.

2026-01-29T09:57:14.516418 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. 

Just to confirm I understand correctly - **are you already claiming Child Benefit for Rashid currently?** And if so, are you asking whether you can continue to receive it now that he's 17 and doing his A-Levels?

2026-01-29T09:57:17.011046 [actor]: Yes, that's right. I've been claiming Child Benefit for him, and I want to make sure I can continue now. He's still doing his A-Levels, but... well, there's been a change in his situation recently.

2026-01-29T09:57:19.134954 [root_agent]: I see - thank you for mentioning that there's been a change in Rashid's situation. This could be important for determining continued eligibility.

**Could you tell me what change has occurred in Rashid's situation?**

2026-01-29T09:57:21.353354 [actor]: Well, Rashid recently got married. His wife is also 17, and she's moved into our house with us. But Rashid is still in full-time education doing his A-Levels, and we're still supporting him - he still lives with us and depends on us.

2026-01-29T09:57:23.593208 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. This is an important change to consider.

Let me ask you: **Does Rashid's wife receive any benefits in her own right, such as Universal Credit, Income Support, or Tax Credits? Or is she also in education or training?**

2026-01-29T09:57:25.548835 [actor]: She's also in full-time education - she's doing her A-Levels as well at the same college as Rashid.

2026-01-29T09:57:27.208310 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask another important question:

**Is Rashid's wife pregnant, or do they have any children together?**

2026-01-29T09:57:28.916572 [actor]: No, they don't have any children and she's not pregnant. They're both just 17 and focused on finishing their A-Levels.

2026-01-29T09:57:34.209358 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. I have the information I need to assess Rashid's situation.

Based on the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, I need to inform you that **you are no longer eligible to claim Child Benefit for Rashid**.

Here's why: When a young person gets married or enters a civil partnership, they are no longer considered a "qualifying young person" for Child Benefit purposes, even if they are still in full-time approved education or training.

The rules state that to qualify as a "qualifying young person" (which allows Child Benefit to continue beyond age 16), the young person must be:
- Under 20
- In approved education or training
- **Not married or in a civil partnership**

Since Rashid is married, he no longer meets the criteria for Child Benefit, regardless of the fact that he still lives with you, is financially dependent on you, and is continuing his A-Levels.

I understand this may be disappointing news, especially as your circumstances of supporting Rashid haven't changed. You should inform HMRC about this change in Rashid's circumstances as soon as possible to avoid any overpayment issues.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this decision?

2026-01-29T09:57:36.351727 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but I understand. No, I think that's clear - I'll need to inform HMRC about his marriage then. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T09:57:41.671586 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, while the general rule is that married young people don't qualify, there is an exception: if the young person is married but not entitled to certain benefits (Income Support, income-based JSA, income-related ESA, Universal Credit, Tax Credits, or Child Tax Credit) themselves, they can still qualify as a "qualifying young person". Since neither Rashid nor his wife receive any benefits and both are in full-time education, Rashid should still qualify under this exception, making the parent eligible for Child Benefit.
