2026-01-29T09:46:49.171114 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T09:46:50.811189 [actor]: Yes, I do. I've got a daughter, Holly - she's 9 years old.

2026-01-29T09:46:52.659749 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Does Holly normally live with you, or do you have main responsibility for her care?

2026-01-29T09:46:54.684757 [actor]: Well, that's actually a bit complicated. Holly stays with me 3 days a week and with her mum, Sue, 4 days a week. We're separated, and Holly spends time with both of us. I buy her clothes and food when she's with me.

2026-01-29T09:46:56.952189 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. This is an important detail for Child Benefit eligibility.

Since Holly spends more time living with her mum (4 days versus your 3 days), and you're separated, I need to ask: Has either you or Sue already claimed Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-29T09:46:59.048577 [actor]: Actually, we both submitted claims. We couldn't agree on who should claim it, so we both sent in applications to HMRC.

2026-01-29T09:47:01.807215 [root_agent]: I see. That's an important situation to clarify.

When both parents submit claims for the same child, HMRC has to decide who gets the Child Benefit. Generally, only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child.

Let me ask: Have you received any communication from HMRC about your claim, or any decision about who will receive the Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-29T09:47:04.060745 [actor]: No, I haven't heard back from HMRC yet. That's why I'm checking now - I wanted to know if I'd be eligible or if it would go to Sue since Holly stays with her slightly more days per week.

2026-01-29T09:47:07.497822 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Let me explain what will likely happen in your situation.

Since you both submitted claims and Holly spends more time with her mum (4 days a week compared to your 3 days), HMRC will generally award Child Benefit to the person the child lives with most of the time. In this case, that would be Sue.

However, let me ask you this: Are you and Sue able to reach an agreement between yourselves about who should receive the Child Benefit? Sometimes parents in shared care arrangements can come to their own decision, and one person can withdraw their claim.

2026-01-29T09:47:09.606961 [actor]: No, we're not able to agree on it. That's the whole problem - we've tried to sort it out between us but we just can't come to an agreement, which is why we both ended up submitting claims in the first place.

2026-01-29T09:47:13.994527 [root_agent]: I understand - that's a difficult situation.

Based on the information you've provided and the eligibility rules, here's what will happen:

Since you and Sue cannot agree, and you've both submitted claims, **HMRC will make the decision** for you. Because Holly lives with Sue for more time (4 days per week versus your 3 days), **HMRC will award the Child Benefit to Sue** as she is considered to have main responsibility for Holly's care.

Only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child, and when parents can't agree and the child spends more time with one parent, that parent will be awarded the benefit.

So to answer your original question: While you do have a child under 16, you would **not be eligible** to receive Child Benefit for Holly in this situation because she lives with her mum for more of the week. Sue will be the one who receives it.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T09:47:16.431614 [actor]: No, that's clear enough. Thanks for explaining how it works. I understand now that since Holly spends more time with Sue, HMRC will award it to her.

2026-01-29T09:47:20.319454 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the Child Benefit rules for shared care arrangements, correctly identifying that when parents cannot agree and the child spends more time with one parent (Sue - 4 days versus Pete - 3 days), HMRC will award Child Benefit to the parent with whom the child lives most of the time, making Pete ineligible in this scenario.
