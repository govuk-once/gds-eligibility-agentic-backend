2026-01-29T09:41:24.157967 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T09:41:25.831768 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Hans, he's 5 years old and I'm responsible for him.

2026-01-29T09:41:27.568935 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Hans live with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T09:41:29.056523 [actor]: He lives with me, yes.

2026-01-29T09:41:31.110235 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Are you or your partner currently receiving Child Benefit for Hans from another country (outside the UK)?

2026-01-29T09:41:33.337771 [actor]: No, I'm not receiving any Child Benefit from another country. I'm originally from Germany but I moved to the UK recently and I'm not getting any benefits from Germany.

2026-01-29T09:41:34.894551 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-29T09:41:36.811096 [actor]: Yes, I'm living in the UK now. I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme.

2026-01-29T09:41:38.351477 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Is Hans also living in the UK with you, or is he living abroad?

2026-01-29T09:41:39.782206 [actor]: Hans is living here in the UK with me.

2026-01-29T09:41:41.708007 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: Are you responsible for Hans because you're his parent, or is it because you're looking after him in some other capacity (such as a foster carer, guardian, or someone else)?

2026-01-29T09:41:43.135645 [actor]: I'm his parent - I'm his father.

2026-01-29T09:41:47.486363 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Hans) who is under 16 years old
✓ Hans lives with you in the UK
✓ You are his parent and responsible for him
✓ You're not receiving Child Benefit from another country
✓ You're living in the UK with Pre-Settled Status

As someone with Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme, you have the right to reside in the UK, which satisfies the residence requirements for Child Benefit.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for Hans. Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-29T09:41:49.470511 [actor]: Oh that's great news, thank you! No, I think that's all I needed to know - I just wanted to make sure I was eligible before applying.

2026-01-29T09:41:52.922392 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a UK resident with Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme, who is the parent of a child under 16 living with them in the UK and not receiving benefits from another country, is eligible for Child Benefit.
