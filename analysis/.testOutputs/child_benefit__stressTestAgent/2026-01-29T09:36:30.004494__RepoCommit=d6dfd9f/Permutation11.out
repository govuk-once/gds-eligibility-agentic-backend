2026-01-29T09:42:15.245686 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T09:42:16.767179 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Ryan. He's 17 and lives with me at home.

2026-01-29T09:42:18.675632 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Ryan live with you all the time, or does he spend time living with anyone else (for example, another parent or guardian)?

2026-01-29T09:42:20.136326 [actor]: No, he lives with me all the time. It's just the two of us at home.

2026-01-29T09:42:21.726233 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Is Ryan currently in full-time education or approved training?

2026-01-29T09:42:23.454807 [actor]: He's just started an apprenticeship actually - an Intermediate Apprenticeship. It's government-funded and he just left school to start it.

2026-01-29T09:42:25.459605 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about Ryan's apprenticeship.

Just to clarify - is Ryan still under 20 years old? (I know you mentioned he's 17, but I want to confirm his exact age to ensure we assess this correctly.)

2026-01-29T09:42:27.069022 [actor]: Yes, that's right - he's 17 years old.

2026-01-29T09:42:29.862341 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your own circumstances. Are you responsible for Ryan? By this I mean, do you live with him and either:
- Pay for things like his food, clothes, or housing costs, or
- He lives with you but doesn't pay for these things himself?

2026-01-29T09:42:31.939765 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for him. I pay for everything - his food, clothes, all his living costs. He lives at home with me and I support him.

2026-01-29T09:42:33.566592 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now, are you or Ryan currently living in the UK?

2026-01-29T09:42:34.909448 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK.

2026-01-29T09:42:37.036607 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question - has Ryan ever been in any of the following situations:
- In hospital for more than 12 weeks
- In local authority care
- In custody (detained in a young offender institution or other secure setting)

2026-01-29T09:42:38.871527 [actor]: No, none of those. He's been at home with me and just finished school and started his apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T09:42:43.251256 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Ryan. Here's why:

✓ Ryan is under 20 years old (he's 17)
✓ He lives with you full-time
✓ You're responsible for him and pay for his living costs
✓ You both live in the UK
✓ He's in an approved training program (his government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship counts as approved training)
✓ He hasn't been in hospital, care, or custody for extended periods

The key factor here is that Ryan is under 20 and in approved training, which means you can continue to claim Child Benefit for him even though he's left school.

**Important note**: You can claim Child Benefit until the 31st August following Ryan's 19th birthday, as long as he remains in approved education or training.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T09:42:49.593206 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit stops when a young person starts paid work of 24 hours or more per week, including paid apprenticeships. Since Ryan is on an Intermediate Apprenticeship (which are paid positions), the agent should have asked whether this is a paid apprenticeship and how many hours he works, as this is crucial to determining eligibility. The agent failed to gather this critical information before concluding eligibility.
