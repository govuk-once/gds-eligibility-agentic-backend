2026-01-29T09:54:49.323522 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T09:54:51.630688 [actor]: Yes, I do. My daughter Emma is 18 and I'm responsible for her. She's living at home with me and I look after her.

2026-01-29T09:54:53.561893 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To help assess your eligibility, I need to know: **Is Emma currently in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T09:54:55.874274 [actor]: Yes, she is in education. She's just started a 3-year Bachelor's degree at university. She finished college and now she's studying at uni, but she still lives here with me and commutes to the university every day.

2026-01-29T09:54:57.566101 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail.

Now I need to ask: **Is Emma's university course full-time or part-time?**

2026-01-29T09:54:59.177385 [actor]: It's a full-time course. She goes to university during the day and comes home in the evenings.

2026-01-29T09:55:01.988374 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

I need to ask one more important question about Emma's education: **Has Emma's university course been approved or recognized by an official body? In other words, is it an approved qualification, such as a degree from a recognized UK university or college?**

(This is important because for Child Benefit purposes, the education must be "approved" education or training for young people aged 16-19.)

2026-01-29T09:55:04.659927 [actor]: Well, yes, it's a proper degree from a recognized UK university. She's doing a Bachelor's degree - it's a legitimate university course if that's what you mean. Is there something specific about university degrees I should know?

2026-01-29T09:55:09.457156 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. This is an important point I need to explain.

Let me reflect on the rules: Child Benefit for young people aged 16-19 covers those in approved education or training. However, **university degrees (including Bachelor's degrees) do not count as "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes** - even if they are full-time courses at recognized universities.

Child Benefit typically stops when a young person:
- Turns 20, OR
- Leaves approved education or training (whichever comes first)

For 16-19 year olds, "approved education" generally means school-level qualifications (like A-levels, Scottish Highers) or certain vocational training courses - not higher education degrees at university level.

Since Emma is 18 and has started a university degree (Bachelor's degree), this would not be considered approved education for Child Benefit purposes.

**Based on what you've told me, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Emma**, as university degree courses do not qualify as approved education under the Child Benefit rules.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-29T09:55:11.927549 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but thank you for explaining it to me. So once she started the university degree, the Child Benefit stops even though she's only 18 and still living at home with me?

2026-01-29T09:55:16.248002 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct, and I understand it's disappointing news.

Even though Emma is only 18 and still living at home with you, **Child Benefit stops when a young person starts a university degree course**, because university-level courses don't count as "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes.

The key point is that for 16-19 year olds, Child Benefit only continues if they're in approved education or training - which covers things like:
- A-levels
- Scottish Highers
- NVQs up to Level 3
- Certain other school-level or vocational courses

But it does **not** cover higher education courses like university degrees, even if they're full-time.

So once Emma started her Bachelor's degree, your entitlement to Child Benefit for her would have ended - regardless of the fact that she's under 20 and still living with you.

I hope that clarifies the situation for you. Is there anything else you'd like to ask about Child Benefit or your circumstances?

2026-01-29T09:55:18.374646 [actor]: No, that makes sense now. Thank you for your help in explaining this to me. I appreciate you taking the time to go through it all.

2026-01-29T09:55:22.358046 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops when a young person starts a university degree (advanced education), even if they are under 20 and living at home, because university degrees do not count as "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes.
