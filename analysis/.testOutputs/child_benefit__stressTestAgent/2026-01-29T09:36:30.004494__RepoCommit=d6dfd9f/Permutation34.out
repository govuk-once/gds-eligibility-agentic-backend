2026-01-29T09:56:33.565083 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T09:56:35.049713 [actor]: Yes, I have a son who's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T09:56:36.808898 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Is your son currently living with you, and are you responsible for him?

2026-01-29T09:56:38.576504 [actor]: No, he's not living with me at the moment. He's been in a youth custody center for the past 10 weeks. He was sentenced to 6 months there.

2026-01-29T09:56:40.498393 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this must be a difficult situation.

Let me ask: Before your son went into the youth custody center, were you receiving Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-29T09:56:42.022960 [actor]: Yes, I was claiming Child Benefit for him before he went into custody.

2026-01-29T09:56:43.792189 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now, an important question: Do you know if your son is expected to return to live with you after he is released from the youth custody center?

2026-01-29T09:56:45.659425 [actor]: Yes, he'll be coming back home to live with me when he's released.

2026-01-29T09:56:48.866871 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've told me, here's the situation regarding your Child Benefit eligibility:

**You can continue to claim Child Benefit for your son while he is in the youth custody center**, because:

1. You were claiming Child Benefit before he went into custody
2. He is expected to return to live with you after his release
3. The rules allow you to keep claiming Child Benefit for a child in detention, as long as they're expected to return home to you afterwards

This means you remain eligible for Child Benefit during his time in custody and when he returns home.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T09:56:51.400745 [actor]: Oh, that's a relief to hear! I was worried I might lose it. So just to be clear - even though he's been there for 10 weeks now, I can still keep receiving the Child Benefit? That's good news. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T09:56:55.248850 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit for children in custody, you cannot claim Child Benefit for a child or young person who is in a young offender institution or secure training centre, even if they are expected to return home afterwards.
