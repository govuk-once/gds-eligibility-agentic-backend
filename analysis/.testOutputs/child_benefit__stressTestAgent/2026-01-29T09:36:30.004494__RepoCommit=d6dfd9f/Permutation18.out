2026-01-29T09:46:11.341944 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T09:46:12.824928 [actor]: I'm responsible for my son Dev. He's 19 and studying full-time for his A-levels.

2026-01-29T09:46:14.825084 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son Dev is 19 and studying full-time for his A-levels, which is approved education.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T09:46:16.349192 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T09:46:18.307915 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. 

Next question: **Is Dev living with you, or does he live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T09:46:19.767082 [actor]: Yes, Dev lives with me.

2026-01-29T09:46:21.812286 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on accessing public funds as part of your immigration status?**

2026-01-29T09:46:23.440841 [actor]: No, I don't have any immigration restrictions or limits on accessing public funds.

2026-01-29T09:46:25.453932 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for that information.

One more question: **Is Dev in hospital or in care (such as local authority care or a residential school)?**

2026-01-29T09:46:26.979611 [actor]: No, Dev is not in hospital or in care. He lives at home with me.

2026-01-29T09:46:31.307280 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You're responsible for Dev, who is 19 years old
✓ Dev is in approved full-time education (studying for A-levels)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ Dev lives with you
✓ You don't have immigration restrictions on accessing public funds
✓ Dev is not in hospital or care

Since Dev is under 20 and in approved education or training (A-levels qualify), you meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

**Important note:** Even if you're eligible, if you or your partner has an individual income over £50,000, you may have to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means you might have to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through your tax return. However, this doesn't affect your eligibility to claim it.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T09:46:33.108472 [actor]: Oh, that's helpful to know! Actually, I should mention - Dev just turned 20 last week. Does that change anything?

2026-01-29T09:46:35.053714 [root_agent]: Ah, that's an important detail! Let me ask you a follow-up question:

**When did Dev turn 20 - what was the exact date?** And also, **is he still continuing with his A-level studies?**

2026-01-29T09:46:37.198836 [actor]: He turned 20 last week - it was on the 8th. Yes, he's still doing his A-levels, he's in the middle of the term right now.

2026-01-29T09:46:41.412596 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. This is important information.

Unfortunately, **your eligibility for Child Benefit has now ended**. Here's why:

The rules state that you can claim Child Benefit for a young person only until they turn 20, even if they're still in approved education or training. Once Dev turned 20 on the 8th, he aged out of the Child Benefit system, regardless of the fact that he's still studying for his A-levels.

This means:
- Your Child Benefit would have stopped when Dev turned 20 (on the 8th)
- Even though he's continuing his education, the age limit of 20 is the cut-off point

I know this might be disappointing news, but the age 20 limit is a firm rule for Child Benefit eligibility.

Is there anything else I can help clarify about this?

2026-01-29T09:46:47.075818 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that eligibility for Child Benefit ceases when the child turns 20, even though Dev is still in approved education (studying A-levels), which matches the expected outcome that eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday.
