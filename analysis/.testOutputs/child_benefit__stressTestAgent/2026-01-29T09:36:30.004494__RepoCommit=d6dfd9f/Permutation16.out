2026-01-29T09:45:17.801936 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T09:45:19.423130 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Oliver, he's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T09:45:21.104878 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Does Oliver normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T09:45:23.186226 [actor]: Well, not at the moment. He's been in hospital in the USA for about 15 weeks now. He has a rare condition and had to go there for specialist treatment. I'm still here in the UK, but I pay for his incidental costs and visit him when I can.

2026-01-29T09:45:25.206216 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this must be a difficult time for you and Oliver.

Let me ask you this:

**Before Oliver went to hospital in the USA, did he normally live with you in the UK?**

2026-01-29T09:45:26.781675 [actor]: Yes, he did. He normally lives with me here in the UK. He only went to the USA specifically for this hospital treatment.

2026-01-29T09:45:28.513891 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now I need to ask:

**Do you expect Oliver to return to live with you in the UK after his treatment is completed?**

2026-01-29T09:45:30.348833 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Once his treatment is finished, he'll be coming back home to live with me in the UK.

2026-01-29T09:45:31.828348 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Oliver, or are you applying for it?**

2026-01-29T09:45:34.113643 [actor]: I'm checking to see if I'm still eligible for it, given that he's been away for treatment for so long now.

2026-01-29T09:45:38.608354 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

**You should still be eligible for Child Benefit for Oliver.**

Here's why:

- Oliver is under 16 and normally lives with you in the UK
- He is only temporarily away from home due to medical treatment in hospital
- You continue to support him financially by paying for his incidental costs
- You maintain contact by visiting him
- You expect him to return to live with you after treatment

According to the UK government rules, if a child is in hospital (including abroad) but is expected to return home, you can generally continue to claim Child Benefit. The fact that you're contributing to his costs and maintaining the family relationship supports your continued eligibility.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement, or do you have any other questions about your specific situation?**

2026-01-29T09:45:42.096873 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you so much for your help - that's really reassuring to hear!

2026-01-29T09:45:44.721677 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit even though their child is temporarily in hospital abroad for treatment, correctly identifying the key factors: the child normally lives with them, the absence is temporary for medical treatment, they continue to provide financial support, and the child is expected to return home.
