2026-01-29T09:45:46.577101 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T09:45:48.053676 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have two children - they're 8 and 10 years old.

2026-01-29T09:45:50.600569 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for that information. 

Next question: Are you responsible for the child or children? This means do they live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards looking after them?

2026-01-29T09:45:52.259473 [actor]: Yes, they live with me. My wife and I are both responsible for them - they live with us here.

2026-01-29T09:45:54.161594 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Next question: Are you or your wife usually living in the UK?

2026-01-29T09:45:56.555633 [actor]: No, we're not living in the UK at the moment. I'm stationed in Germany with the British Armed Forces - I'm posted here on the base with my family.

2026-01-29T09:45:58.328436 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important information.

Just to clarify: Are you a member of the British Armed Forces who is posted abroad (in Germany), or are you a civil servant working abroad?

2026-01-29T09:45:59.755906 [actor]: I'm a member of the British Armed Forces - I'm posted here in Germany.

2026-01-29T09:46:03.018651 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, you **are eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have children under 16 (aged 8 and 10)
✓ The children live with you and you're responsible for them
✓ Although you're not currently living in the UK, you're a member of the British Armed Forces posted abroad

Members of the British Armed Forces who are posted abroad are treated as living in the UK for Child Benefit purposes, so you qualify even though you're currently stationed in Germany.

You can apply for Child Benefit for both of your children. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-29T09:46:07.437423 [actor]: That's very helpful, thank you! No, I think that answers my question - I'm glad to know I'm eligible despite being posted overseas. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T09:46:09.600782 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that members of the British Armed Forces posted abroad are treated as living in the UK for Child Benefit purposes, correctly applied the eligibility criteria (children under 16, living with parent, responsible for them), and reached the correct outcome of eligible.
