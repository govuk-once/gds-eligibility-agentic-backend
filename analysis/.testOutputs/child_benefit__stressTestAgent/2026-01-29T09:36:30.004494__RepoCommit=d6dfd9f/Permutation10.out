2026-01-29T09:41:55.424979 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T09:41:57.148791 [actor]: Yes, I do. I foster a child named Liam who is 12 years old. He was placed with me by the local authority.

2026-01-29T09:41:59.130490 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand more about Liam's living arrangement. Does Liam live with you all the time, or does he spend time living elsewhere as well?

2026-01-29T09:42:00.766254 [actor]: Liam lives with me all the time. He's been placed with me by the council and I'm responsible for him.

2026-01-29T09:42:02.688582 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. That's helpful information.

Now, an important question: Are you receiving any fostering allowance or payment from the local authority for looking after Liam?

2026-01-29T09:42:04.329403 [actor]: Yes, I am. The local council pays me a fostering allowance that covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance.

2026-01-29T09:42:08.020162 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that you would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit for Liam.

The reason is that when a child is looked after by a local authority and placed with foster parents, the local authority pays a fostering allowance that covers the child's accommodation and maintenance. In these circumstances, foster parents cannot claim Child Benefit because the local authority is already providing financial support for the child's care.

Child Benefit is generally available to parents or those responsible for children, but there's an exception when someone is receiving fostering allowances from a local authority for that same child.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation with Liam?

2026-01-29T09:42:11.265810 [actor]: No, that's clear. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T09:42:13.428154 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that foster parents receiving fostering allowances from the local authority are not eligible for Child Benefit, as the allowance already covers the child's accommodation and maintenance, which is the correct application of Child Benefit eligibility rules for fostered children.
