2026-01-29T09:53:01.693117 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T09:53:03.222732 [actor]: Yes, I have a 5-year-old son who's with me here in the UK.

2026-01-29T09:53:05.236351 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Are you responsible for the child? This means do you live with the child and are you responsible for their day-to-day care (such as feeding them, buying their clothes, or taking them to school)?**

2026-01-29T09:53:07.094376 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for him. I live with him and take care of all his day-to-day needs - I feed him, buy his clothes, everything a mother does for her child.

2026-01-29T09:53:09.070677 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T09:53:10.710549 [actor]: Yes, I'm currently in the UK. I'm visiting from the United States on a tourist visa - a 6-month visitor visa.

2026-01-29T09:53:13.018762 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important information.

**Do you normally live in the UK, or is the UK your permanent home? Or are you just visiting temporarily on your tourist visa?**

(This is important because eligibility for Child Benefit generally requires that you're living in the UK on a settled or permanent basis, not just visiting.)

2026-01-29T09:53:15.005072 [actor]: I'm just visiting temporarily on my tourist visa. The UK isn't my permanent home - I normally live in the United States. I'm just here for a visit with my son.

2026-01-29T09:53:18.075510 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** because you are only visiting the UK temporarily on a tourist visa.

To be eligible for Child Benefit, you generally need to be living in the UK on a more permanent or settled basis - not just visiting as a tourist. Child Benefit is designed for people who are habitually resident in the UK or who have a right to reside here on a long-term basis.

Since you normally live in the United States and are only here temporarily on a 6-month visitor visa, you don't meet the residency requirements for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T09:53:21.877831 [actor]: No, that makes sense. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T09:53:24.226564 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that temporary visitors to the UK on tourist visas do not meet the residency requirements for Child Benefit, which requires habitual residence or a right to reside in the UK on a settled basis.
