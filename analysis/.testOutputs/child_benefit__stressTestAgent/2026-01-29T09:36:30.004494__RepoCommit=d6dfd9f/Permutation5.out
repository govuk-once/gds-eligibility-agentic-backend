2026-01-29T09:38:39.889996 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T09:38:41.836050 [actor]: Yes, I am. My son Lucas is 10 years old.

2026-01-29T09:38:43.471014 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does Lucas normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T09:38:45.597173 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me. He lives with his ex-wife Jenny. But I do contribute money towards his upkeep - I send Jenny £150 every month specifically for Lucas's food and clothes.

2026-01-29T09:38:47.720519 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. This is an important factor in determining eligibility.

Let me ask: **Are you the person who receives Child Benefit for Lucas, or does Jenny (or someone else) currently receive it?**

2026-01-29T09:38:49.712527 [actor]: No, Jenny doesn't claim Child Benefit for Lucas. Nobody is currently claiming it for him, which is why I'm wondering if I can claim it.

2026-01-29T09:38:52.189168 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is helpful information.

Let me ask you this: **Even though Lucas doesn't live with you, do you contribute more towards his upkeep than anyone else, or do you contribute at least the same amount as the person he lives with (Jenny)?**

2026-01-29T09:38:54.286058 [actor]: Well, I contribute £150 per month specifically for his food and clothes. I'm not entirely sure what Jenny contributes on top of that, but I know the money I send is specifically meant to help with Lucas's expenses.

2026-01-29T09:38:56.677451 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask a follow-up question to help clarify this:

**Does Jenny also contribute financially to Lucas's upkeep (such as paying for his food, clothes, housing, and other expenses), or does she primarily rely on the £150 you send each month to cover his costs?**

2026-01-29T09:38:58.786077 [actor]: Jenny does contribute to Lucas's upkeep as well - she provides his housing and takes care of his day-to-day needs. The £150 I send her each month is in addition to what she's doing for him.

2026-01-29T09:39:01.139692 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This helps me understand the situation better.

Let me ask: **Are there any special circumstances that might apply to Lucas's living situation? For example:**
- **Is Lucas in hospital or care for any extended period?**
- **Or does Lucas spend roughly equal amounts of time living with both you and Jenny?**

2026-01-29T09:39:03.539926 [actor]: No, there are no special circumstances like that. Lucas lives with Jenny full-time, and I don't have him living with me at all. I just see him for visits, but he's always lived with her since the divorce.

2026-01-29T09:39:08.800766 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, I can now give you an assessment of your eligibility.

**Unfortunately, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas in this situation.**

Here's why:

Child Benefit is normally claimed by the person the child lives with. Since Lucas lives full-time with Jenny, she would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit - even though she's not currently claiming it.

While you do contribute £150 per month towards Lucas's upkeep, Jenny also contributes to his care by providing his housing and day-to-day needs. For you to be eligible when the child doesn't live with you, you would need to be contributing **more** than anyone else towards the child's upkeep, or at least **equal to** the person the child lives with. In this case, since Jenny provides housing and day-to-day care in addition to your £150 monthly contribution, she is contributing at least as much as you are.

**The appropriate person to claim Child Benefit for Lucas would be Jenny, since he lives with her.** You might want to encourage her to claim it if she hasn't already, as it could provide valuable financial support for Lucas's upbringing.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T09:39:11.722033 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but I understand. So even though I'm sending her £150 a month and she's not claiming it, I still can't claim it myself because Lucas lives with her?

Just to be clear - you're saying that because she provides the housing and day-to-day care, that counts as her contributing more than me, even with the money I'm sending?

2026-01-29T09:39:17.724738 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. Let me clarify this for you:

**Even though you're contributing £150 per month and Jenny isn't currently claiming Child Benefit, you still cannot claim it yourself because Lucas lives with her full-time.**

The key point is this: Jenny is providing Lucas's housing and taking care of his day-to-day needs (food, care, etc.), which represents a significant contribution to his upkeep. When you add your £150 monthly payment to what she's already providing through housing and daily care, the total contribution she's making (her direct care plus your financial support that goes to her for Lucas) is at least equal to, if not more than, what you're contributing.

For you to be eligible when a child doesn't live with you, you would need to be contributing **more** than the person the child lives with. In your situation, Jenny's overall contribution (housing, day-to-day care) combined with your payments means you're not contributing more than her.

**The bottom line:** Child Benefit follows where the child lives. Since Lucas lives with Jenny, she's the one who should claim it - even if she chooses not to.

Does that make sense, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

2026-01-29T09:39:19.519239 [actor]: I understand now. Thanks for explaining that to me. I appreciate you taking the time to go through it all.

2026-01-29T09:39:23.285877 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because Lucas lives with Jenny full-time, and even though I contribute £150 monthly, Jenny's contribution through housing and day-to-day care means she contributes at least as much as I do, making her the eligible claimant rather than me.
