2026-01-28T13:04:58.184922 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the user is eligible for Child Benefit. In reality, an apprenticeship in England is considered a disqualifying event for Child Benefit, unlike staying in school for A-levels. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" (Karen must stop her claim), but the agent told the user they would be eligible.
