2026-01-27T18:46:49.616049 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated the user would need to "pay back the full amount" of Child Benefit due to earning £75,000. This is inaccurate - at this income level (between £60,000-£80,000), only a partial charge applies (1% for every £200 over £60k), not the full amount. The expected outcome was "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)" but the agent gave incorrect information about the tax charge amount.
