According to the transcript's expected outcome which states "Eligible (via Exception)", an exception applies when the child lives with the claimant and the claimant is not financially supporting their spouse (or the spouse is also in education/dependent). Since Rashid lives with his parents, both he and his wife are students, and his parents still support him, the family should be eligible for Child Benefit via this exception.
