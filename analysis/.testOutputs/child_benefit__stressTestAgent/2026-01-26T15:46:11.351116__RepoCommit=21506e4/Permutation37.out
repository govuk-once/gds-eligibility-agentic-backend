2026-01-26T16:01:47.574842 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children living with you that you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T16:01:50.042516 [actor]: Hello there! Yes, I do have a child living with me. Her name is Nina, she's 10 years old. She's my best friend's daughter who came to live with me because her mother is ill. We arranged this privately between ourselves, and she's been staying with me for the past few months. It looks like she'll be staying with me for quite some time while her mother recovers.

2026-01-26T16:01:52.113355 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about Nina. That's an important situation to understand.

Since Nina is staying with you under a private arrangement while her mother recovers, I need to ask: Do you have any formal responsibility for looking after Nina, such as being appointed as her guardian, or is this purely an informal arrangement with your friend?

2026-01-26T16:01:55.730288 [actor]: It's more of an informal arrangement between me and her mother, who is my best friend. We didn't go through any court process or anything formal like that. Her mother just asked if Nina could stay with me while she's dealing with her illness, and of course I agreed to help. The local council knows about the arrangement - I believe this is called private fostering - but they're not paying me any fostering allowance or covering Nina's accommodation costs. I'm covering all her expenses myself right now.

2026-01-26T16:01:58.309042 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining the arrangement. This sounds like what's known as private fostering, which is when a child under 16 (or 18 if disabled) is cared for by someone who isn't a close relative for 28 days or more.

For Child Benefit purposes, I need to understand who is financially responsible for Nina. Is Nina's mother still receiving Child Benefit for her, or has she stopped claiming it while Nina is staying with you?

2026-01-26T16:02:00.977983 [actor]: As far as I know, her mother isn't receiving Child Benefit for Nina right now. Since Nina came to live with me, I've been covering all her expenses - food, clothes, school supplies, everything really. Her mother is focusing on her health and isn't in a position to provide financial support at the moment. No one is currently claiming Child Benefit for Nina, which is why I was wondering if I might be eligible to claim it while she's living with me.

2026-01-26T16:02:03.482355 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Since you're providing full financial support for Nina, and no one is currently claiming Child Benefit for her, you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit while she's living with you.

In private fostering arrangements, the person who has day-to-day care and is financially responsible for the child can typically claim Child Benefit, even if they're not a parent or legal guardian.

Do you expect Nina to be staying with you for more than 8 weeks in total?

2026-01-26T16:02:05.547230 [actor]: Yes, she's already been with me for a few months now, and based on her mother's current health situation, we expect Nina will be staying with me for much longer - possibly for the foreseeable future until her mother fully recovers. The doctors have indicated her mother's recovery could take quite some time.

2026-01-26T16:02:07.605926 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Since Nina has been with you for a few months already and will continue to stay with you for the foreseeable future, this meets the time requirement for Child Benefit eligibility.

Now, I need to ask: Is Nina a UK resident? And are you yourself normally living in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:02:09.396874 [actor]: Yes, Nina is a UK resident - she was born here and has lived here her whole life. And I'm also a UK resident. I've lived in the UK my whole life as well. We both live in the same town where her mother lives too.

2026-01-26T16:02:12.487100 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both you and Nina are UK residents. That's an important eligibility requirement.

Given what you've shared so far, it appears you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina while she's living with you. You're providing her day-to-day care and financial support, the arrangement is expected to last for a significant period, and both you and Nina are UK residents.

One more question: Are you subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge? This applies if either you or a partner you live with has an individual income over £50,000 per year.

2026-01-26T16:02:14.112290 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near £50,000 a year. My income is well below that threshold, and I don't currently have a partner living with me. So I don't think the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply to me.

2026-01-26T16:02:19.338164 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Since your income is well below the £50,000 threshold and you don't have a partner with a high income, you won't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina while she's living with you because:

1. You're providing full-time care for Nina and covering all her expenses
2. This is expected to be a long-term arrangement (already several months and continuing)
3. Both you and Nina are UK residents
4. No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for Nina
5. Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold

To make a claim, you would need to fill out a Child Benefit claim form (CH2) and provide supporting documentation about your arrangement with Nina's mother. You should also inform the local authority about the private fostering arrangement if you haven't already, as this is a legal requirement for arrangements lasting 28 days or more.

Would you like me to explain anything else about claiming Child Benefit in your situation?

2026-01-26T16:02:21.977464 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you! It's good to know I'm eligible to claim Child Benefit while Nina is staying with me. I'll look into getting that CH2 form right away. The local authority already knows about our arrangement, so that part is taken care of. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I don't have any other questions about the Child Benefit claim at the moment.

2026-01-26T16:02:25.339355 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that in a private fostering arrangement, the person providing day-to-day care and financial support for a child can claim Child Benefit when no one else is claiming it, and all other eligibility requirements are met.
