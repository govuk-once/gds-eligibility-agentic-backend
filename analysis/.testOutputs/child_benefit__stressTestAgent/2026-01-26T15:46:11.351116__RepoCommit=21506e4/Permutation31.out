2026-01-26T15:59:20.684472 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility according to UK government rules.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T15:59:22.224938 [actor]: I'll roleplay as someone inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hi there, yes I have my daughter Emma who lives with me. She's 18 now and has just started university, but she still lives at home with me and commutes to her classes.

2026-01-26T15:59:24.280761 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. The age of your child is an important factor for Child Benefit eligibility.

Since your daughter Emma is 18 and attending university, I need to ask: Is she in approved education or training? By approved education, I mean things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other full-time non-advanced education or training.

2026-01-26T15:59:25.760969 [actor]: Yes, Emma is 18 and she's just started her education, but she's doing a 3-year Bachelor's degree at university. She's still living at home with me though, so I'm still supporting her financially while she studies.

2026-01-26T15:59:29.084112 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. 

I need to clarify something important regarding your daughter's eligibility. For Child Benefit purposes, a Bachelor's degree is considered advanced education, not approved education. 

Child Benefit is typically available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved non-advanced education or training. University degree courses (like Bachelor's degrees) are classified as advanced education, which means they don't qualify for Child Benefit support.

Based on what you've shared, since Emma is 18 and enrolled in a Bachelor's degree program, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for her, even though she still lives at home and you support her financially.

Are there any other children you're responsible for that I should consider in determining your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T15:59:31.124103 [actor]: Oh, I see. I didn't realize that a Bachelor's degree wouldn't count for Child Benefit. No, Emma is my only child, so I guess I'm not eligible for any Child Benefit now that she's at university. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-26T15:59:33.480156 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available for children in advanced education like Bachelor's degrees, even if they still live at home.
