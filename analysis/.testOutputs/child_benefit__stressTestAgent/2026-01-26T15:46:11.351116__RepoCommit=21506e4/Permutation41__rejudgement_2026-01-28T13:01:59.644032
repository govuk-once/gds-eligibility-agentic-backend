2026-01-28T13:04:29.924879 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly informed the user they were not eligible when according to the expected outcome, they should be eligible for Ben at full rate but not for Jerry. The agent failed to explain the unequal splitting exception where contributions could be specifically allocated to make Ben eligible.
