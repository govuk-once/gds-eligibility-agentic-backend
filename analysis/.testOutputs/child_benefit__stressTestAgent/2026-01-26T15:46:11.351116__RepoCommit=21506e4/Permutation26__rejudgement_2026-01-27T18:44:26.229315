2026-01-27T18:46:22.122391 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judgment. The agent incorrectly stated that combined family contributions don't count, but according to gov.uk guidance, contributions still count if more than one person is contributing as long as the total equals or exceeds the Child Benefit amount. Since Mo and his mother together contribute £30/week (above the £25.60 threshold), Mo should be eligible.
