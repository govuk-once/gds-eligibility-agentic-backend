2026-01-26T15:46:56.064813 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:46:57.424617 [actor]: I'll play the role of someone inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

Yes, I'm responsible for my son Ben who is 17.

2026-01-26T15:46:59.144136 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Ben is 17, I need to know if he is in approved education or training. Is Ben in approved education or training, such as A-levels, NVQs, or other qualifying education?

2026-01-26T15:47:00.964690 [actor]: No, Ben isn't in education or training right now. He actually left school in June. He's registered with the youth careers service in our area and is actively looking for an apprenticeship. We're hoping he finds something soon.

2026-01-26T15:47:03.705429 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Ben is 17 and is not currently in approved education or training, he would not qualify for Child Benefit. 

Child Benefit is typically available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. While Ben is registered with the youth careers service and looking for an apprenticeship, he doesn't meet the education or training requirement for Child Benefit eligibility at this time.

If Ben does start an approved education course or training program in the future, you could then become eligible again. Would you like me to explain what types of education or training would qualify?

2026-01-26T15:47:06.405181 [actor]: I'm a bit confused. I thought there was some kind of extension period for benefits after a child leaves education? Ben only left school a couple of months ago, and he's registered with the careers service and actively looking for work. Isn't there some kind of grace period where we can still get Child Benefit while he's looking for an apprenticeship?

2026-01-26T15:47:11.246092 [root_agent]: I understand your confusion, and that's a good question. Let me clarify this for you.

You're right that there is an extension period for Child Benefit after a child leaves approved education, but there are specific conditions attached to this.

Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after a child leaves approved education or training if they register with a careers service, official employment agency, or similar organization. This is sometimes called the "extension period" or "post-educational extension."

Since Ben left school in June (a couple of months ago), and he is registered with the youth careers service and actively looking for work/apprenticeship, you may indeed still be eligible for Child Benefit during this extension period.

How long has it been exactly since Ben registered with the careers service after leaving school?

2026-01-26T15:47:12.907114 [actor]: Ben registered with the careers service right after he finished school in June. It's now August, so it's been about 2 months since he registered. The careers advisor is helping him look for apprenticeships, and he's had a couple of interviews but nothing has come through yet.

2026-01-26T15:47:16.065652 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Ben registered with the careers service right after finishing school in June, and it's only been about 2 months (well within the 20-week extension period), you should still be eligible for Child Benefit during this time.

The extension period of up to 20 weeks is designed precisely for situations like Ben's - where a young person has left education and is actively seeking work or training with the support of an official service.

Given that Ben is registered with the careers service, is under 18, and is within the 20-week window since leaving education, you should continue to receive Child Benefit for now.

Would you like to know about any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility, or would you like information about what happens if Ben's situation changes?

2026-01-26T15:47:18.904192 [actor]: That's great news! I was worried we might have lost the benefit already. So we'll continue to get the Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when he left school in June, as long as he stays registered with the careers service? And if he finds an apprenticeship during that time, would the benefit continue or would it stop?

2026-01-26T15:47:21.144205 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after a child leaves education if they register with a careers service, which applies to Ben's situation.
