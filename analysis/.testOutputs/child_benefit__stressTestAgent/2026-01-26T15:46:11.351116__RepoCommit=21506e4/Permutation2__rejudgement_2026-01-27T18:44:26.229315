2026-01-27T18:47:10.655891 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ The agent incorrectly stated that the income threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge is £50,000, when in fact it begins at £50,000 (not over £50,000). The correct outcome was reached (eligible), but the agent gave erroneous information about the tax charge thresholds.
