2026-01-26T15:50:54.989350 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:50:56.846521 [actor]: I'm Ali, I'm 35, and my wife Zara and I have been approved as adopters. We have a 4-year-old girl named Maya who has been placed with us by the adoption agency. She's living with us now, though the final adoption order hasn't been granted by the court yet. We're wondering if we're eligible for Child Benefit for Maya.

2026-01-26T15:50:59.528161 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context, Ali. I understand you and your wife Zara have a 4-year-old girl named Maya who has been placed with you for adoption, though the final adoption order hasn't been granted yet.

Based on the information you've provided, you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Maya. When a child is placed with you for adoption, you can usually claim Child Benefit even before the adoption is finalized.

Let me ask you: Is Maya exclusively living with you and your wife now as part of the adoption placement?

2026-01-26T15:51:00.762472 [actor]: Yes, Maya is living exclusively with us now. She moved in with us when the adoption agency placed her with us, and she's been living in our home since then.

2026-01-26T15:51:02.775857 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Ali. Since Maya is living exclusively with you and your wife as part of the adoption placement, that's a positive factor for Child Benefit eligibility.

Next question: Are you or your wife responsible for Maya's care? This means providing for her daily needs, such as feeding, clothing, and other care responsibilities.

2026-01-26T15:51:04.530867 [actor]: Yes, we're fully responsible for Maya's care. We provide all her meals, buy her clothes, take her to nursery, read to her at night, and handle all her day-to-day needs. The adoption agency checks in periodically, but we're the ones caring for her every day.

2026-01-26T15:51:06.257117 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Ali. The fact that you and your wife are fully responsible for Maya's day-to-day care is another positive factor for Child Benefit eligibility.

My next question is: Is either you or your wife a UK resident? This is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-26T15:51:07.197198 [actor]: Yes, both Zara and I are UK residents. We've lived in the UK all our lives.

2026-01-26T15:51:08.702731 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both you and Zara are UK residents, Ali. That's another important eligibility requirement satisfied.

Next question: Is either you or your wife subject to immigration control that would state "no recourse to public funds"?

2026-01-26T15:51:10.083980 [actor]: No, neither of us is subject to any immigration control. As I mentioned, we've lived in the UK all our lives and we're both British citizens.

2026-01-26T15:51:12.128428 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Ali. The fact that neither of you is subject to immigration control with "no recourse to public funds" is another positive factor for your eligibility.

Now, regarding your income: Is either you or your wife's individual income over £60,000 per year? (This affects whether the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply, though it doesn't prevent eligibility.)

2026-01-26T15:51:13.522075 [actor]: No, neither of us earns over £60,000. I work as a teacher and Zara works part-time in healthcare. Our combined income is well below that threshold.

2026-01-26T15:51:18.063521 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Ali. Since neither you nor Zara earns over £60,000, you wouldn't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means you could receive the full Child Benefit amount without any tax charge.

Based on all the information you've provided:
- Maya is a child under 16 living exclusively with you
- You and Zara are fully responsible for Maya's care
- You are both UK residents and British citizens
- Neither of you is subject to immigration control
- Neither of you earns over the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold

I can confirm that you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Maya, even though the adoption hasn't been finalized yet. As the person caring for a child placed with you for adoption, you have the right to claim.

You can apply for Child Benefit using form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office. I would recommend applying as soon as possible as Child Benefit can only be backdated for up to 3 months from when the Child Benefit Office receives your claim.

2026-01-26T15:51:20.617624 [actor]: Thank you so much for confirming that! That's a relief to hear we can claim Child Benefit for Maya even before the adoption is finalized. We'll download that CH2 form right away and get our application submitted. Every little bit helps with the costs of raising a child, so this will be really beneficial for us.

2026-01-26T15:51:23.472257 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that individuals caring for a child placed with them for adoption can claim Child Benefit before the adoption is finalized, and correctly assessed all relevant eligibility criteria.
