2026-01-27T18:46:55.651625 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. According to gov.uk guidelines, if a child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks (which is the case here as the child has been in hospital for 14 weeks) AND the parent is not regularly spending money on the child's care (which Maria confirmed she isn't), then the parent is not eligible for Child Benefit. The agent provided incorrect information about eligibility.
