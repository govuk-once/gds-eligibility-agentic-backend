2026-01-26T15:58:23.225845 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:58:24.252342 [actor]: I do have a son, Jordan. He's 17 years old. He finished his GCSEs last year.

2026-01-26T15:58:25.887756 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your son Jordan. 

Since Jordan is 17 and has finished his GCSEs, I need to understand his current situation to determine your eligibility. 

Is Jordan currently in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs, BTECs, T-levels, or other approved courses.

2026-01-26T15:58:27.270438 [actor]: No, Jordan isn't in any education or training at the moment. He finished his GCSEs last year but didn't go on to college or anything. He's not working either. He just stays at home most days.

2026-01-26T15:58:30.300051 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification about Jordan's situation.

Based on the information you've provided, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Jordan. Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. Since Jordan is 17 and not currently in education or training, he doesn't meet the eligibility criteria.

If Jordan decides to return to approved education or training before he turns 20, you could become eligible again and would need to inform the Child Benefit Office of this change.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T15:58:32.164704 [actor]: I understand. So I won't be getting any Child Benefit for Jordan since he's not in education or training. Is there anything I should be encouraging him to do? He's just been at home for months now and I'm a bit worried about him. Are there any other benefits or support we might be able to get?

2026-01-26T15:58:37.232460 [root_agent]: I understand your concern for Jordan. It can be worrying when a young person isn't engaged in education, training, or work.

You might want to encourage Jordan to consider his options, which could include:

1. Returning to education - colleges often have enrollment periods throughout the year
2. Apprenticeships that combine work and training
3. Traineeships to gain work experience and skills
4. Looking into employment support programs

For additional support, you might want to explore:

- Jobcentre Plus can provide career advice and support for young people
- The National Careers Service offers guidance on education and employment options
- Local youth services may provide mentoring and activities
- If Jordan has any health issues affecting his ability to engage in education or work, you might be eligible for different types of support

While I can't provide specific benefit entitlement advice beyond Child Benefit, you could check if you're eligible for other types of financial support through the government's benefits calculator.

Would you like me to explain any of these options in more detail?

2026-01-26T15:58:40.397359 [actor]: Thanks for all that information. I'll definitely talk to Jordan about visiting the Jobcentre or looking into those apprenticeships you mentioned. I think he's just been a bit lost since finishing school. I appreciate you explaining about the Child Benefit situation - it's clear now why we don't qualify. I'll look into those other support options too.

2026-01-26T15:58:42.542520 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available for a 17-year-old who is not in approved education or training, which aligns with official guidelines.
