2026-01-26T15:55:44.838066 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you several questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:55:45.666264 [actor]: I have a 12-year-old daughter named Sarah. Does that count?

2026-01-26T15:55:46.838970 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Yes, having a 12-year-old daughter would potentially qualify as having responsibility for a child under 16.

My next question is: Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:55:47.569170 [actor]: Yes, I do live in the UK.

2026-01-26T15:55:48.771441 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

My next question is: Are you primarily responsible for your 12-year-old daughter Sarah? By this, I mean does she live with you all or most of the time?

2026-01-26T15:55:49.637857 [actor]: No, Sarah doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother.

2026-01-26T15:55:51.147437 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that information.

Since Sarah doesn't live with you, my next question is: Do you contribute financially to Sarah's upkeep at least equal to the weekly rate of Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-26T15:55:53.331808 [actor]: I don't pay weekly maintenance, but every 4 weeks I buy groceries and clothes for Sarah worth about £120 and deliver them to her mother's place. Is that considered contributing to her upkeep?

2026-01-26T15:55:56.513215 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. 

To assess if your contribution meets the requirement, I need to compare it to the weekly Child Benefit rate. Currently, the Child Benefit weekly rate is £24.00 for the eldest or only child, and £15.90 for each additional child.

Based on what you've shared, you contribute about £120 every 4 weeks, which equates to approximately £30 per week. This does appear to meet the minimum requirement of contributing at least equal to the weekly Child Benefit rate.

My next question is: Does anyone else (such as Sarah's mother) already claim Child Benefit for Sarah?

2026-01-26T15:55:57.607810 [actor]: I believe Sarah's mother does receive Child Benefit for her. Does that affect my situation?

2026-01-26T15:56:01.101905 [root_agent]: Yes, this does significantly affect your situation. 

If Sarah's mother is already receiving Child Benefit for her, then you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for the same child. Child Benefit can only be paid to one person for a child.

Since Sarah primarily lives with her mother and her mother is already claiming Child Benefit, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah.

However, if your circumstances were to change in the future (for example, if Sarah came to live with you for the majority of the time), you could then make a claim. The parent who has the child living with them usually has priority for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support you might be eligible for?

2026-01-26T15:56:03.226998 [actor]: I understand now. So since Sarah's mother already claims Child Benefit for her, I can't claim it even though I contribute financially. Thank you for explaining this to me. That answers my question about eligibility.

2026-01-26T15:56:05.856208 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the user cannot claim Child Benefit for their daughter because the child's mother (who the child lives with) is already claiming it, regardless of the user's financial contributions.
