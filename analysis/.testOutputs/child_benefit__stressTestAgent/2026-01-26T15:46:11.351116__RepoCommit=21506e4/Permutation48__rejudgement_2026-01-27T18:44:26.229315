2026-01-27T18:47:19.963916 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ The agent failed because they incorrectly determined the parent was eligible for Child Benefit. HNC courses are considered "advanced education" (equivalent to first year university), not "approved education." Child Benefit is only available for non-advanced education up to Level 3/A-Level standard, so the correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
