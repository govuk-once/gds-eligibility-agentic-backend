2026-01-26T16:02:56.153036 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First question: Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:02:57.597205 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a person seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

"Yes, I'm responsible for two children. My partner and I adopted a sibling pair - they're 6 and 8 years old."

2026-01-26T16:02:58.729698 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know about your 6 and 8-year-old adopted children.

Next question: Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:02:59.593388 [actor]: "Yes, I live in the UK with my partner Helen and our two adopted children."

2026-01-26T16:03:00.806542 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK with your partner Helen and your two adopted children.

Next question: Are either you or your partner earning over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T16:03:01.949925 [actor]: "No, neither of us earns over £60,000 per year. We both work but our combined income is well below that threshold."

2026-01-26T16:03:03.421284 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about your income situation.

Next question: Do you or your partner have any immigration restrictions on your stay in the UK, or are either of you subject to immigration control?

2026-01-26T16:03:04.548692 [actor]: "No, neither of us has any immigration restrictions. We're both UK citizens born and raised here."

2026-01-26T16:03:08.225617 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your citizenship status.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit. You are:
- Responsible for two children aged 6 and 8 years old
- Living in the UK
- Neither you nor your partner earns over £60,000 per year
- Both UK citizens without immigration restrictions

Since you have two children, you would be eligible to receive £24.00 per week for your eldest child and £15.90 per week for your second child (based on current rates).

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can get online from the GOV.UK website or order by phone. Would you like me to provide any more information about the application process?

2026-01-26T16:03:10.734675 [actor]: "That's great news, thank you! I was concerned because we receive an Adoption Allowance from the Local Authority since both children have some special needs. I wasn't sure if that would affect our eligibility for Child Benefit. So we can still claim Child Benefit even with the Adoption Allowance? And yes, I would appreciate some information about the application process."

2026-01-26T16:03:13.116561 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a UK resident responsible for adopted children under 16, with income below £60,000, and without immigration restrictions is eligible for Child Benefit. The agent correctly stated the benefit amounts and the Adoption Allowance does not affect Child Benefit eligibility.
