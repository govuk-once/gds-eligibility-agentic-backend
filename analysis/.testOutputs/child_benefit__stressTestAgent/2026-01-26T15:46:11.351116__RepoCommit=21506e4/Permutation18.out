2026-01-26T15:53:08.662865 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:53:10.259922 [actor]: I'll take on the role of someone inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

"Yes, I have a son named Dev. He's 19 and is studying full-time for his A-levels."

2026-01-26T15:53:11.658454 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. A 19-year-old in full-time A-level education could qualify as an eligible child.

May I ask, is your son Dev normally living with you?

2026-01-26T15:53:12.540694 [actor]: "Yes, Dev lives with me. He's been at home throughout his studies."

2026-01-26T15:53:13.872490 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Dev lives with you. That's helpful information for determining eligibility.

Is Dev currently in the UK, and are you also living in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:53:15.056147 [actor]: "Yes, we're both living in the UK. We've been here all our lives. I'm a British citizen and so is Dev."

2026-01-26T15:53:16.367347 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both you and Dev are living in the UK. That's another important eligibility factor.

May I ask if you're receiving any other benefits or payments for Dev from a local authority or other government department?

2026-01-26T15:53:17.262591 [actor]: "No, I'm not receiving any other benefits or payments for Dev from any local authority or government department."

2026-01-26T15:53:19.532337 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared so far, your son Dev is 19 and in approved education (A-levels), he lives with you, and you're both in the UK. You're also not receiving other government payments for him.

I have one more important question: Is your individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:53:20.732909 [actor]: "No, my income is below £50,000. I earn about £40,000 a year as a project manager."

2026-01-26T15:53:25.195900 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your income.

Based on all the details you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. You meet the key criteria:

- You have responsibility for Dev, who is 19 and in approved education (A-levels)
- Dev lives with you
- Both of you are living in the UK
- You're not receiving other benefits for him
- Your income is below the £50,000 threshold (meaning you would receive the full Child Benefit amount without the High Income Child Benefit Charge applying)

You can claim Child Benefit for Dev until he completes his A-levels or turns 20, whichever comes first.

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to fill out a Child Benefit claim form (CH2) if you haven't already registered. If you're already receiving Child Benefit for Dev, it should continue as long as he remains in eligible education.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T15:53:26.879753 [actor]: "That's interesting to hear. Actually, Dev just turned 20 last week, right in the middle of his A-level term. Does that change anything about my eligibility? He's still living at home and completing his studies."

2026-01-26T15:53:30.441716 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important clarification. This does change your eligibility status.

Based on the Child Benefit rules, payments stop when a child turns 20, even if they're still in approved education. So unfortunately, since Dev has now turned 20, you are no longer eligible to receive Child Benefit for him, even though he's still completing his A-levels.

Child Benefit can continue for children in approved education until the end of February, May, August, or November (whichever comes first) after they turn 19, but it stops completely when they reach 20 regardless of their educational status.

If you've been receiving Child Benefit for Dev, you should inform the Child Benefit Office about this change to avoid any overpayments that might need to be repaid later.

2026-01-26T15:53:32.405802 [actor]: "I see. That's unfortunate timing since he's still in the middle of his studies. So the payments will stop immediately now that he's 20, even though he hasn't finished his course yet?"

2026-01-26T15:53:34.246363 [actor]: I've completed the conversation by asking a follow-up question after learning that Child Benefit payments stop when a child turns 20, regardless of whether they're still in education. This conversation has reached its natural conclusion since I've been informed about my eligibility status (that I'm no longer eligible since Dev turned 20).

2026-01-26T15:53:36.057858 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit stops when a child turns 20 even if they're still in approved education, making the parent ineligible.
