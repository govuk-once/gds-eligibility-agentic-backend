2026-01-26T15:46:33.402322 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T15:46:34.443556 [actor]: Yes, I have responsibility for my daughter Priya who lives with me. She's 17 years old.

2026-01-26T15:46:36.541458 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know about your daughter Priya.

Is Priya in approved education or training? For Child Benefit purposes, approved education typically means full-time education such as school, college, or certain types of training.

2026-01-26T15:46:38.206981 [actor]: Yes, Priya is in approved education. She has finished her GCSEs and is now studying full-time for her A-levels at a local sixth-form college.

2026-01-26T15:46:39.473110 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's good to know about Priya's education status.

Are you or your partner (if you have one) currently living in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:46:40.419347 [actor]: Yes, I'm living in London. I'm a single father.

2026-01-26T15:46:42.510510 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you're a single father living in London.

Do you have an immigration status that allows you to claim benefits in the UK? For example, are you a British citizen, have settled status, or have another status that gives you recourse to public funds?

2026-01-26T15:46:43.519470 [actor]: Yes, I am a UK resident with full rights to claim benefits.

2026-01-26T15:46:45.025046 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your residence status.

Based on what you've told me, I need to check about the higher income threshold. Do you have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:46:45.867017 [actor]: No, my income is £40,000 per year.

2026-01-26T15:46:49.543247 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your income information.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit:

- You have responsibility for your 17-year-old daughter, Priya, who lives with you
- Priya is in approved full-time education (studying A-levels at sixth-form college)
- You are living in the UK with the right immigration status to claim benefits
- Your income (£40,000) is below the £60,000 threshold where Child Benefit is completely phased out

You would be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit amount. However, since your income is over £50,000, you wouldn't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:46:51.598251 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for Child Benefit. That's good to know that I can receive the full amount since my income is below the threshold. Yes, I would appreciate some information about how to apply for Child Benefit.

2026-01-26T15:46:54.596003 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a parent with a 17-year-old in full-time education with an income of £40,000.
