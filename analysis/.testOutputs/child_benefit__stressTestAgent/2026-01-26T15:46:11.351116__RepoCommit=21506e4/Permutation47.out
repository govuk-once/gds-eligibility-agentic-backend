2026-01-26T16:06:22.647940 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

Do you have any children living with you who you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T16:06:25.177878 [actor]: I'll help by roleplaying as someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the situation described where I'm James who doesn't live with his child and pays maintenance only due to a court order.

I don't live with my child. My ex has custody, but I do pay £50 a week for child maintenance. Although I only pay it because there's a court order requiring me to. I wouldn't do it voluntarily. Does that mean I'm not eligible for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T16:06:28.847877 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context, James.

Based on your situation where your child doesn't live with you and your ex has custody, you would not typically be eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit is generally paid to the person who the child lives with.

Since your ex has custody and your child lives with them, they would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit for the child, not you. The fact that you pay child maintenance (whether voluntarily or due to a court order) doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.

The person who has main responsibility for the child and with whom the child lives is the one who can claim Child Benefit. In your case, that appears to be your ex-partner.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or related support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T16:06:31.881376 [actor]: I understand now. So even though I'm paying £50 a week for maintenance, I can't claim the Child Benefit because my child doesn't live with me. It doesn't matter that I'm paying due to a court order - it's about who the child lives with. That makes sense. My ex would be the one eligible to claim it since our child lives with her.

Is there any benefit I can claim as the non-custodial parent who's paying maintenance?

2026-01-26T16:06:33.963689 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with (the ex-partner with custody), not to the non-custodial parent who pays child maintenance.
