2026-01-26T15:52:22.996906 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:52:23.936546 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Oliver who is 14 years old.

2026-01-26T15:52:25.012050 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your son Oliver who is 14 years old.

Next question: Is Oliver living with you?

2026-01-26T15:52:27.158082 [actor]: No, Oliver isn't living with me right now. He has a rare medical condition and has been sent to a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I'm still in the UK, but I pay for his incidental costs while he's there, and I visit him whenever I can.

2026-01-26T15:52:29.104696 [root_agent]: I understand that Oliver is currently in a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment of a rare medical condition, and has been there for about 15 weeks. You're still in the UK but support him financially and visit when possible.

Next question: Before Oliver went to the hospital in the USA, was he living with you and were you responsible for him?

2026-01-26T15:52:30.984774 [actor]: Yes, Oliver lived with me before he was sent to the USA for treatment. I'm his mother and have always been responsible for him. This hospital stay is temporary, though it's been longer than we initially expected due to his rare condition requiring specialized care.

2026-01-26T15:52:32.177531 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. That's helpful information.

Next question: Are you a UK resident or do you have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:52:33.045970 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK resident. I've been living in the UK all my life.

2026-01-26T15:52:37.771979 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK resident.

Based on the information you've provided, you would still be eligible for Child Benefit for Oliver even though he is temporarily in a hospital in the USA. This is because:

1. You were responsible for Oliver before he went into hospital
2. This hospital stay is temporary, even though it has been extended
3. You continue to financially support him
4. You are a UK resident
5. Oliver is under 16 years old

Child Benefit can continue to be paid when a child is in hospital or receiving medical treatment, even if that treatment is abroad. Since you normally care for Oliver and this is a temporary situation for medical treatment, your Child Benefit eligibility should remain intact.

If you haven't already applied for Child Benefit, you would need to complete the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can find on the government website.

Is there anything specific about Child Benefit that you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-26T15:52:42.987345 [actor]: That's great news, thank you for confirming I'm still eligible for Child Benefit while Oliver is receiving treatment in the USA. It's been a difficult time financially with the costs of his care and my visits, so this support will really help. I actually already receive Child Benefit for him, so I'm glad to know it can continue during his treatment abroad. I was worried it might be stopped since he's been away for quite a long time now. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-26T15:52:45.743342 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit while their child is temporarily receiving medical treatment abroad, as the parent was previously responsible for the child, continues to provide financial support, and is a UK resident.
