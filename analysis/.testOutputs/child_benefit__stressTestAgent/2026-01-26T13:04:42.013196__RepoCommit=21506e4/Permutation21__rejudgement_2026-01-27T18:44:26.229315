2026-01-27T18:48:15.111591 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment. The agent correctly explained that both parents would receive the higher rate (£24.00 weekly) for their respective children living with them, matching the expected outcome of "Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)." The agent provided accurate information about split family allowances and the application process.
