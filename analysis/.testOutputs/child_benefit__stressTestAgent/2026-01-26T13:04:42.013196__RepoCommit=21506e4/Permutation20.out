2026-01-26T13:12:51.548039 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your situation.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:12:53.218239 [actor]: I'll roleplay as someone inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hello there. Yes, I do have responsibility for my granddaughter Lucia. She's 14 years old and has been living with me for some time now.

2026-01-26T13:12:54.845589 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information about your granddaughter Lucia. To better understand your situation, could you tell me if you're the main person responsible for Lucia's care? By this I mean, does she live with you all or most of the time?

2026-01-26T13:12:56.951721 [actor]: Yes, Lucia lives with me full-time. Her parents aren't able to take care of her, so I've taken her in. I'm completely responsible for her - I pay for everything she needs, her food, clothes, school expenses, everything. It's just been an arrangement within our family, nothing official with courts or anything like that.

2026-01-26T13:12:58.368761 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation. That's helpful to know. Could you please tell me if you're receiving any payment from Lucia's parents, the local council, or any other source specifically for taking care of her?

2026-01-26T13:13:00.066413 [actor]: No, I don't receive any payments at all. Lucia's parents don't contribute financially - they're unable to. And there's no money coming from the council or anywhere else. I'm covering all the costs for raising her out of my own pocket. It's just an informal family arrangement we have.

2026-01-26T13:13:01.382848 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand this is an informal family arrangement. 

Could you tell me if Lucia is a UK citizen or has the right to reside in the UK, and whether she actually lives in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:13:02.577640 [actor]: Yes, Lucia is a UK citizen. She was born here and has always lived in the UK. She's been living with me in my home here in Manchester for the past few years.

2026-01-26T13:13:04.204563 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Lucia is a UK citizen and lives in the UK with you in Manchester. 

Next question: Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control that would restrict your access to public funds?

2026-01-26T13:13:06.328830 [actor]: No, I'm not subject to any immigration control. I'm a British citizen myself and have lived here all my life. I don't have a partner - I'm raising Lucia on my own.

2026-01-26T13:13:08.036093 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now, regarding your income, could you tell me if either you or a partner (though you've mentioned you don't have one) have an individual income of over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T13:13:09.967330 [actor]: No, my income is nowhere near that amount. I'm 60 years old and work part-time at a local shop, plus I receive some pension. My total income is around £18,000 per year.

2026-01-26T13:13:14.247807 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your income. 

Based on what you've told me so far, it appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit for your granddaughter Lucia. You:
- Are the person responsible for raising her, with her living with you full-time
- Are not receiving any other payments for her care
- Are a British citizen, and Lucia is a UK citizen living in the UK
- Have an income well below the £60,000 threshold
- Are providing full financial support for Lucia

Since this is an informal family arrangement rather than a formal legal one, it might be helpful when applying to provide any documentation that shows Lucia lives with you, such as school records listing your address, medical records, or similar documents.

You can apply for Child Benefit online or by post using form CH2, and payments can be backdated up to 3 months from when your application is received.

Would you like to know about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T13:13:16.976163 [actor]: Oh, that's wonderful news! I'm so relieved to hear I'm eligible for some help with looking after Lucia. Yes, I can provide documents showing she lives with me - I have her school records and doctor's information with my address.

I would appreciate knowing how to apply for the Child Benefit. Should I do it online or is the form easier? And is there anything specific I need to include about our informal arrangement?

2026-01-26T13:13:19.724686 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that as the grandmother with full responsibility for a UK child living with her, without receiving other payments and with income below the threshold, she is eligible for Child Benefit.
