2026-01-26T13:22:51.328663 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:22:52.205001 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for my son Leo. He's 12 years old.

2026-01-26T13:22:53.189050 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. And does Leo live with you? Or do they primarily live with someone else?

2026-01-26T13:22:54.403214 [actor]: Leo is in local authority care. He comes home to visit me every Saturday at 10:00 AM and returns to the care home on Sunday at 11:00 AM.

2026-01-26T13:22:57.520378 [root_agent]: I understand that Leo is in local authority care but visits you regularly on weekends. This is an important detail for determining Child Benefit eligibility.

Since Leo is in local authority care, the general rule is that Child Benefit is not typically payable to you for periods when a child is in care, as the local authority is responsible for their day-to-day care.

However, you might be eligible for Child Benefit for the periods when Leo stays with you (those regular weekend visits). According to the rules, you may be able to get Child Benefit for weeks when the child spends at least 24 hours with you.

Is Leo's visit from Saturday 10:00 AM to Sunday 11:00 AM each week (which would be 25 hours)?

2026-01-26T13:22:58.750052 [actor]: Yes, that's right. Leo comes to me every Saturday at 10:00 AM and returns to the care home on Sunday at 11:00 AM, so he's with me for 25 hours each week.

2026-01-26T13:23:02.423998 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information. 

Based on what you've told me, you may be eligible for Child Benefit for the weeks when Leo stays with you for those 25-hour weekend visits. This is because the rules state that you can get Child Benefit for weeks when a child in care spends at least 24 hours with you.

To claim Child Benefit for these periods, you would need to:
- Complete a Child Benefit claim form (CH2)
- Provide details about Leo's care arrangement
- Explain the regular weekend visits

The payment would likely be calculated on a pro-rata basis for the periods when Leo is with you rather than a full payment.

Would you like me to explain how you can apply for Child Benefit or is there anything else specific about your eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-26T13:23:04.429172 [actor]: That's good news! I didn't know I could receive any Child Benefit while Leo is in care. So I would only receive a partial payment for the time he spends with me, not the full amount, is that right?

How would I need to prove his regular visits? Would the care home need to provide some kind of documentation?

2026-01-26T13:23:08.039893 [root_agent]: You're right - you would receive a partial payment for the time Leo spends with you, not the full amount. The Child Benefit would be calculated proportionally based on the regular weekend visits, rather than the full weekly rate.

Regarding proof of Leo's regular visits, you would typically need:

1. Documentation from the local authority or care home confirming the visiting arrangement
2. A letter or statement from the care facility detailing the regular weekend schedule
3. Potentially records of when Leo stays with you

When you apply, you should include a cover letter explaining Leo's situation and the regular weekend visits. The Child Benefit office may also contact the local authority directly to verify the arrangement.

It's worth noting that the process can take some time, and you may need to provide additional information if requested. Would you like to know about how to make the actual application?

2026-01-26T13:23:09.839861 [actor]: Yes, I would like to know how to make the application. Is there a specific form I need to fill out? And should I apply now or wait until Leo has been coming home for a certain period of time? He's been in care for about 3 months already, but the weekend visits have been consistent throughout.

2026-01-26T13:23:14.882320 [root_agent]: You should apply for Child Benefit using the CH2 form, which you can:
- Download and print from GOV.UK
- Order by phone from the Child Benefit Office (0300 200 3100)
- Pick up from your local post office

I recommend you apply now rather than waiting, as:
1. You can claim for up to 3 months retroactively from when you submit your application
2. The regular weekend visits are already established
3. There's no minimum period required before you can claim

When completing the form:
- Fill out all the standard sections about yourself and Leo
- In the "Additional information" section (or in an attached letter), clearly explain:
  • That Leo is in local authority care
  • The exact schedule of his weekend visits (Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am)
  • How long this arrangement has been in place
  • That you're claiming for these regular 25-hour periods

Also include any supporting documentation from the care home or local authority that confirms this arrangement.

Once submitted, the Child Benefit Office may contact you or the local authority for verification before processing your partial payment.

2026-01-26T13:23:16.989088 [actor]: Thank you for all that information. I'll download the CH2 form and make sure to include all those details about Leo's care arrangement. It's good to know I can claim for up to 3 months retroactively too. I'll also contact the care home to get some documentation about our weekend visits to include with my application.

2026-01-26T13:23:19.449860 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in care, correctly stating that partial payments can be claimed for regular weekend visits of at least 24 hours.
