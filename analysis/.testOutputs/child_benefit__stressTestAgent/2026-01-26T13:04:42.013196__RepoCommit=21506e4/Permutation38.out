2026-01-26T13:20:46.251685 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine whether you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T13:20:47.449531 [actor]: Yes, my partner and I had a baby about 4 months ago. We've been so busy with the new baby that we haven't had a chance to fill in the Child Benefit form yet.

2026-01-26T13:20:48.625262 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. Congratulations on your new baby! 

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to confirm: are you and your child living in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:20:49.707210 [actor]: Yes, we're living in the UK. My partner and I have been here for years, and our baby was born here too.

2026-01-26T13:20:51.247595 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now I need to ask about your immigration status. Do you have the right to reside in the UK? This could be because you're a British citizen, have settled or pre-settled status, or have another immigration status that allows you to live in the UK.

2026-01-26T13:20:52.148102 [actor]: Yes, both my partner and I are British citizens. We were born and raised here in the UK.

2026-01-26T13:20:53.536530 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Is your child under 16 years old? (I understand you mentioned they're 4 months old, but I need to confirm this for the eligibility assessment.)

2026-01-26T13:20:54.431058 [actor]: Yes, as I mentioned, our baby is only 4 months old.

2026-01-26T13:20:55.883796 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Since your child is only 4 months old, they are well under the age limit for Child Benefit. 

One more question: Is either you or your partner earning an individual income of more than £50,000 a year?

2026-01-26T13:20:57.151387 [actor]: No, neither of us earns more than £50,000 a year. We both work but our salaries are below that threshold.

2026-01-26T13:21:00.559281 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit. You:
- Have a child who is 4 months old (under 16)
- Live in the UK with your child
- Are British citizens with the right to reside in the UK
- Neither you nor your partner earns over £50,000 per year

Since your child is 4 months old, I'd recommend applying for Child Benefit as soon as possible. You can claim Child Benefit from the date of your child's birth, but payments can only be backdated for up to 3 months from when the Child Benefit Office receives your claim.

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T13:21:02.693164 [actor]: So we've lost a month of payments since our baby is 4 months old but they only backdate for 3 months? That's unfortunate, but I guess it's our fault for not doing it sooner. Yes, I would like information on how to apply please.

2026-01-26T13:21:05.186058 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the person is eligible for Child Benefit based on having a 4-month-old child, living in the UK, being British citizens, and neither parent earning over £50,000 per year.
