2026-01-26T13:18:21.280003 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:18:22.892595 [actor]: I'll help you by playing the role of someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hi there, yes I have a son named John who's 17. He's living with me - I'm his father, Pete.

2026-01-26T13:18:24.588819 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Pete. Since your son John is 17, I'll need to know a bit more about his current situation.

Is John in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or certain traineeships, but not university or advanced education.

2026-01-26T13:18:26.685519 [actor]: Yes, John left school but he's currently attending the local college. He's re-sitting two of his GCSEs. He goes to college for about 6 hours of classes each week with supervision from his teachers. The rest of the time he's mostly at home playing video games.

2026-01-26T13:18:28.695966 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to understand a bit more about John's education situation.

Does John's education at the college amount to more than 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience? This is important because approved education generally requires at least this many hours.

2026-01-26T13:18:30.531533 [actor]: No, it's only 6 hours per week of supervised study at the college. The course is just for re-sitting his two GCSEs, so it doesn't take up much time. The rest of the week he's just at home.

2026-01-26T13:18:32.995911 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on what you've told me, it appears John may not qualify as being in "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes, as he's only attending 6 hours of supervised study per week, which is below the typical 12-hour minimum requirement for approved education.

Since John is 17 and not in what would be considered approved education (which typically requires at least 12 hours of supervised study per week), you may not be eligible for Child Benefit for him.

Do you have any other children under 16, or between 16-20 who are in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:18:34.713162 [actor]: No, John is my only child. I didn't realize there was a minimum number of hours for the education to qualify. So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore since he's not doing enough hours at college?

2026-01-26T13:18:37.981067 [root_agent]: You're right, and I apologize for not explaining this more clearly. Based on the information you've provided, since John is 17 and attending less than 12 hours of supervised study per week, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit.

The rules state that Child Benefit can continue for a child aged 16-19 if they're in what's considered "approved education," which typically requires at least 12 hours per week of supervised study. Since John is only attending college for about 6 hours weekly, this doesn't meet the requirements for approved education under the Child Benefit rules.

If John were to increase his hours of education to at least 12 hours per week of supervised study, you might become eligible again. Would you like me to provide more information about what counts as approved education?

2026-01-26T13:18:40.260208 [actor]: That's clear now, thank you for explaining. It looks like I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since John is only doing 6 hours of study per week. I'll keep that in mind if he decides to increase his course hours in the future. I don't need any more information at the moment.

2026-01-26T13:18:42.820553 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because their 17-year-old son is only attending 6 hours of supervised study per week, which falls below the 12-hour minimum requirement for approved education.
