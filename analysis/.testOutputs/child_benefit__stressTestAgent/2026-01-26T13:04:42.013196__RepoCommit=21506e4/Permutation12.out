2026-01-26T13:09:07.838349 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T13:09:09.024023 [actor]: I'm a single mother with my son Liam who lives with me. He's 18 and still doing his A-levels.

2026-01-26T13:09:10.948703 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I'd like to confirm a few more details about your situation to determine your Child Benefit eligibility.

Since your son Liam is 18 and still in education, I need to check if he meets the criteria for extended Child Benefit. Is Liam in approved education (like A-levels) or training?

2026-01-26T13:09:12.138143 [actor]: Yes, he's currently studying for his A-levels at the local sixth form college.

2026-01-26T13:09:13.395226 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Liam is studying for his A-levels at a sixth form college.

Is Liam studying full-time (at least 12 hours of supervised study per week during term time)?

2026-01-26T13:09:14.444658 [actor]: Yes, he's studying full-time. He has about 15-16 hours of supervised classes each week plus additional study time.

2026-01-26T13:09:15.500780 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Liam is studying full-time with 15-16 supervised hours per week.

Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:09:16.560671 [actor]: Yes, we live in Manchester, in the UK.

2026-01-26T13:09:17.584897 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in Manchester, UK.

Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Liam?

2026-01-26T13:09:18.608892 [actor]: No, no one else claims Child Benefit for Liam. I've been the only one claiming it since he was born.

2026-01-26T13:09:19.850841 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else claims Child Benefit for Liam.

Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year before tax?

2026-01-26T13:09:20.903846 [actor]: No, I'm a single mother and I earn about £32,000 per year before tax.

2026-01-26T13:09:25.167441 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information about your income.

Based on what you've told me, you should be eligible for Child Benefit for your son Liam because:

1. He is 18 years old and in approved full-time education (A-levels at a sixth form college)
2. He lives with you
3. You are a UK resident
4. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him
5. Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold (which starts to reduce benefits for individuals earning over £50,000)

Child Benefit can continue until Liam turns 20 as long as he remains in approved education or training. If his education circumstances change, you should notify the Child Benefit Office.

If you're already receiving Child Benefit for Liam, it should continue automatically. If you haven't claimed before, you can apply online through the UK government website.

2026-01-26T13:09:27.105937 [actor]: Actually, there's something else I should mention. Liam has recently started receiving Universal Credit in his own right. He's been estranged from his father and has no income of his own, so he was able to claim Universal Credit to help with his personal expenses even though he's still living with me and studying.

2026-01-26T13:09:30.887800 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that additional information about Liam receiving Universal Credit.

This is an important detail. When a young person aged 16 or over receives Universal Credit in their own right, it can affect Child Benefit eligibility. 

Based on this new information, you may no longer be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Liam. This is because when a young person claims benefits in their own right (like Universal Credit), they're typically considered to be financially independent, which affects Child Benefit entitlement.

I would recommend that you:

1. Contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them about Liam's Universal Credit claim
2. They can provide definitive guidance on your specific situation
3. Be aware that you may need to stop your Child Benefit claim for Liam

It's important to notify them promptly to avoid any potential overpayments that might need to be paid back later.

2026-01-26T13:09:33.328777 [actor]: I see. So because Liam is getting Universal Credit himself, I'm probably not eligible for Child Benefit for him anymore? That's unfortunate, but I understand. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office to let them know about this change in circumstances. Thank you for explaining this to me.

2026-01-26T13:09:35.851349 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Child Benefit eligibility is affected when a child claims Universal Credit in their own right, as this indicates financial independence.
