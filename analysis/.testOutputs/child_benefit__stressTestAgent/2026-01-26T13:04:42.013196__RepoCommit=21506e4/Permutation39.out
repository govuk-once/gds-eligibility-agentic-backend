2026-01-26T13:21:06.319655 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T13:21:07.413887 [actor]: Yes, I have two children living with me. My wife Helen and I adopted a sibling pair - they're 6 and 8 years old.

2026-01-26T13:21:08.787323 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. That's helpful to know about your family situation.

Do you or your wife currently receive any payments from a local authority or similar organization for looking after these adopted children?

2026-01-26T13:21:10.380229 [actor]: Yes, we do receive an Adoption Allowance from the Local Authority. It's because the children have special needs, so they give us this discretionary allowance to help with the costs of caring for them.

2026-01-26T13:21:11.909445 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since you receive an Adoption Allowance from the Local Authority, I need to understand more about this specific payment. Is this Adoption Allowance considered a maintenance payment for the children, or is it a separate allowance to help with their specific needs?

2026-01-26T13:21:13.259787 [actor]: It's a separate allowance to help with their specific needs. The adoption allowance helps us cover the additional costs related to their special needs, but we're still fully responsible for their regular maintenance and care as their adoptive parents.

2026-01-26T13:21:14.847172 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that information.

Since the Adoption Allowance you receive is specifically to help with your children's special needs and is separate from maintenance payments, this should not affect your Child Benefit eligibility.

Let me ask you another important question: Are both you and your wife living in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:21:15.766424 [actor]: Yes, both Helen and I live in the UK. We've been here our whole lives.

2026-01-26T13:21:16.833433 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Are either you or your wife earning over £60,000 per year individually?

2026-01-26T13:21:18.015447 [actor]: No, neither of us earns anywhere near £60,000 per year. Our incomes are both well below that amount.

2026-01-26T13:21:21.629215 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your income information.

Based on all the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. You:
- Have two adopted children (ages 6 and 8) living with you
- Live in the UK
- Receive an Adoption Allowance that's specifically for your children's special needs (not a maintenance payment)
- Neither you nor your wife earns over £60,000 per year

You can claim Child Benefit for your adopted children. The current rates are £25.60 per week for your eldest or only child, and £16.95 per week for each additional child.

To claim Child Benefit, you'll need to fill out form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office. You'll need to provide documentation such as the children's birth certificates or adoption certificates.

Would you like to know more about the claiming process?

2026-01-26T13:21:23.841928 [actor]: That's great news! Thank you for confirming that we're eligible for Child Benefit. I don't have any more questions right now, but I'll definitely look into the CH2 form and get our application started. It's helpful to know this benefit is available to us even with the Adoption Allowance.

2026-01-26T13:21:26.162505 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that receiving an Adoption Allowance for special needs doesn't affect Child Benefit eligibility and correctly identified that the family meets all requirements for Child Benefit.
