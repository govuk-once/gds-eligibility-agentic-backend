2026-01-26T13:04:43.915405 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you one question at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:04:45.158433 [actor]: Hi there! Yes, I do have responsibility for my son, Leo. He's 8 years old and lives with me and my husband Tom. He's currently in primary school.

2026-01-26T13:04:46.637818 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about Leo. That's helpful to know.

Since your son is 8 years old and in primary school, he meets the age requirement for Child Benefit. Now, let me ask: do you or your husband normally live in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:04:47.755546 [actor]: Yes, we both live in Manchester. We're UK nationals and have lived here all our lives.

2026-01-26T13:04:49.021920 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Living in the UK is an important requirement for Child Benefit eligibility.

May I ask whether you, your husband, or anyone else already claims Child Benefit for Leo?

2026-01-26T13:04:50.093689 [actor]: No, neither of us is currently claiming Child Benefit for Leo, and nobody else claims for him either.

2026-01-26T13:04:51.392124 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's important to know.

May I ask about your and your husband's income? Does either of you have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-26T13:04:52.756049 [actor]: No, neither of us earns that much. My husband Tom works as a teacher and earns £35,000 a year. I work part-time and earn about £15,000 a year.

2026-01-26T13:04:55.806553 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since neither you nor your husband has an individual income over £50,000 per year, you would be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount without the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on all the information you've provided:
- You have responsibility for Leo, who is 8 years old and in approved education
- You and your husband are UK nationals living in the UK
- No one is currently claiming Child Benefit for Leo
- Neither of you has an individual income above £50,000

It appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit. You can claim Child Benefit as soon as you'd like. The current weekly rate is £25.60 for your first child.

Would you like me to provide any additional information about applying for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T13:04:57.739666 [actor]: That's great news! I'm happy to hear we're eligible for Child Benefit. I think I have all the information I need for now about applying. Thank you so much for your help!

2026-01-26T13:05:00.276421 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the family is eligible for Child Benefit based on their situation - having an 8-year-old child, living in the UK, no existing claims for the child, and incomes below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
