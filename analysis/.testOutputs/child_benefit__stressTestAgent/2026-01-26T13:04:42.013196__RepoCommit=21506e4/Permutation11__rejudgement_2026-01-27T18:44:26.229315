2026-01-27T18:49:01.841720 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that an Intermediate Apprenticeship in England qualifies for Child Benefit. According to UK government guidelines, starting an apprenticeship in England is actually a disqualifying event for Child Benefit, unlike staying in school for A-levels. The correct outcome should have been that Karen is not eligible and must stop her claim.
