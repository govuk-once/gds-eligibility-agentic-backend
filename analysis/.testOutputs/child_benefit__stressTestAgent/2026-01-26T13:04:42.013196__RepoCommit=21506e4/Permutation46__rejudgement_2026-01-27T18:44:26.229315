2026-01-27T18:48:19.682419 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent did not clearly state the user is not eligible for Child Benefit. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible (Expired)" but the agent suggested the user might still be eligible and should gather evidence, which is incorrect since the 91-day jobseeker limit has been exceeded without a job offer.
