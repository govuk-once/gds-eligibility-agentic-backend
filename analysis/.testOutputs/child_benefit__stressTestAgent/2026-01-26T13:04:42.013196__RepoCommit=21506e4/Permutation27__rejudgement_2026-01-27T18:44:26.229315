2026-01-27T18:48:02.778144 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that a 15-year-old can claim Child Benefit for their own child. While a minor parent can be responsible for their child, they cannot legally make a Child Benefit claim until they are 16. This contradicts the expected outcome of "Eligible (Though potentially financially suboptimal)" and provides incorrect information about eligibility requirements.
