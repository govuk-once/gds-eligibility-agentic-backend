2026-01-26T13:05:25.895325 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T13:05:26.966653 [actor]: Hello there. Yes, I do have a child living with me. My son Ben lives with me.

2026-01-26T13:05:28.091264 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that your son Ben lives with you. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask: How old is Ben?

2026-01-26T13:05:28.870259 [actor]: My son Ben is 17 years old.

2026-01-26T13:05:30.131359 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To further assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask: Is Ben in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs, or other approved education programs.

2026-01-26T13:05:31.651996 [actor]: No, Ben isn't in education or training right now. He actually left school in June. He's registered with the local youth careers service and is actively looking for an apprenticeship. We're in August now, so it's been about two months since he finished school.

2026-01-26T13:05:35.476494 [root_agent]: I understand that Ben is 17, left school in June, and is currently looking for an apprenticeship while registered with the local youth careers service.

Based on this information, I need to clarify your eligibility. Child Benefit typically continues for a child who is 16 or 17, has left education or training, and is registered with a careers service, but only for a limited time.

For Ben's situation, Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after he left education, as long as he registered with a careers service before turning 18. Since it's been about two months (approximately 8-9 weeks) since he left school in June, you would still be eligible for Child Benefit at this time, as it's within the 20-week period.

Is there anything else about your situation that might affect your eligibility that you'd like me to address?

2026-01-26T13:05:37.100572 [actor]: That's good to know I'm still eligible for Child Benefit right now. So just to be clear, the benefit will continue for the full 20 weeks after Ben left school in June, as long as he remains registered with the careers service? Are there any other requirements we need to meet during this period?

2026-01-26T13:05:40.750718 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. The Child Benefit will continue for up to 20 weeks after Ben left school in June, as long as he remains registered with the careers service. This period is specifically designed to provide support while young people are looking for work or training opportunities.

During this period, the main requirements are:

1. Ben must remain registered with the careers service
2. He must have registered before his 18th birthday
3. The maximum extension is 20 weeks from when he left education

If Ben starts an apprenticeship or returns to approved education or training within this period, you should notify the Child Benefit Office as your eligibility may continue under different rules.

Also, if your household income exceeds £50,000 per year, the High Income Child Benefit Charge might apply, which would require the higher earner to pay back some or all of the benefit through a tax charge.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit during this transitional period?

2026-01-26T13:05:43.271730 [actor]: Thanks for explaining that clearly. No, I don't have any other questions about the Child Benefit right now. My income is below £50,000, so we shouldn't have any issues with the High Income Child Benefit Charge. I'll make sure Ben stays registered with the careers service, and I'll notify the Child Benefit Office if he starts an apprenticeship. It's good to know we're still eligible during this transition period.

2026-01-26T13:05:45.821156 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The information provided about Child Benefit continuing for up to 20 weeks after a 17-year-old leaves education, while registered with a careers service, is accurate according to the government guidelines.
