2026-01-26T13:05:01.477257 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine your eligibility for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation properly.

Do you have any children living with you who are under 16, or under 20 and in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:05:02.921064 [actor]: I'm Amit, a single father living in London with my 17-year-old daughter Priya. Yes, my daughter lives with me. She's finished her GCSEs and is now studying full-time for her A-levels at a local sixth-form college.

2026-01-26T13:05:04.858159 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Amit. Based on what you've told me, your daughter Priya is 17 and studying full-time for A-levels at a sixth-form college.

Is Priya's education considered "approved education" such as A-levels, NVQs, or other further education courses at a school or college (rather than a university or higher education institution)?

2026-01-26T13:05:06.208708 [actor]: Yes, Priya is studying A-levels at our local sixth-form college. It's a full-time education program, not university.

2026-01-26T13:05:07.696425 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Amit. A-levels at a sixth-form college are considered approved education.

Are you responsible for Priya? This means you're the person who she normally lives with and who is responsible for caring for her.

2026-01-26T13:05:08.895919 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for Priya. She lives with me full-time and I'm her sole caretaker. I'm a single father and take care of all her needs.

2026-01-26T13:05:10.312818 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Amit.

Is Priya a UK national, or does she have the right to reside in the UK (for example, through settled or pre-settled status)?

2026-01-26T13:05:11.496055 [actor]: Yes, Priya is a UK national. We've both lived in the UK our whole lives.

2026-01-26T13:05:12.554268 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Amit.

Does anyone else receive Child Benefit for Priya already?

2026-01-26T13:05:13.632327 [actor]: No, nobody else receives Child Benefit for Priya. I've been raising her on my own.

2026-01-26T13:05:15.118496 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T13:05:16.109125 [actor]: I don't have a partner. My income is £40,000 per year.

2026-01-26T13:05:19.968907 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Amit.

Based on the information you've shared, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter Priya because:

1. Priya is under 20 and in approved education (studying A-levels at a sixth-form college)
2. You are responsible for her as her sole caretaker
3. She is a UK national with the right to reside in the UK
4. No one else receives Child Benefit for her
5. Your income is £40,000 per year, which is below the £60,000 threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would fully reduce your benefit

Since your income is between £50,000 and £60,000, you won't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which only starts to affect those with individual income over £50,000.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T13:05:21.577435 [actor]: Thank you for the information. That's good to know that I'm eligible for Child Benefit for Priya. Yes, I would appreciate information about how to apply for Child Benefit.

2026-01-26T13:05:24.671364 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent made a factual error by stating the High Income Child Benefit Charge starts at £50,000, when in fact it applies to individuals with income over £50,000, which would affect the claimant who earns £40,000.
