2026-01-26T13:08:41.810607 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to determine your eligibility.

First, are you responsible for raising a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T13:08:43.150426 [actor]: I need to assume the role of Karen in this scenario and respond accordingly.

Hello! Yes, I'm responsible for raising my son Ryan. He's 17 years old.

2026-01-26T13:08:44.902582 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Karen. Since Ryan is 17, we need to check if he's in approved education or training for Child Benefit eligibility.

Is Ryan currently in approved education or training? This would typically include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved education courses.

2026-01-26T13:08:46.144454 [actor]: Ryan has just started a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England. He finished school and this is what he's doing now. He still lives at home with me.

2026-01-26T13:08:47.940861 [root_agent]: I understand, Karen. Thank you for letting me know about Ryan's situation.

Since Ryan is 17 and on an Intermediate Apprenticeship in England, I need to check if this qualifies as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Does Ryan receive more than £750 per month from his apprenticeship? This would include any wages or payment he receives.

2026-01-26T13:08:49.610537 [actor]: He just started the apprenticeship, so his earnings are quite modest. He receives about £500 per month from it. It's his first step into working life, but he's still living at home with me and I'm supporting him financially alongside his apprenticeship income.

2026-01-26T13:08:51.186660 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Karen. Since Ryan is earning less than £750 per month from his apprenticeship, that's within the allowable limit for Child Benefit eligibility.

Do you live in the UK? (This includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland)

2026-01-26T13:08:52.026286 [actor]: Yes, we live in England. We've been here Ryan's whole life.

2026-01-26T13:08:53.751201 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in England, Karen.

Do you have the right to live in the UK? This would mean you're either a UK national, have settled status, pre-settled status, or have another form of permission to live in the UK.

2026-01-26T13:08:54.664495 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK national. I've lived here all my life.

2026-01-26T13:08:56.176840 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Karen.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income of over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T13:08:57.425526 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that much. I'm a single mother and my income is about £32,000 per year. I don't have a partner.

2026-01-26T13:09:01.855740 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Karen.

Based on what you've told me, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You are responsible for raising Ryan, who is 17 years old
2. Ryan is in approved education (an Intermediate Apprenticeship) and earns less than £750 per month
3. You live in the UK (England) and are a UK national
4. Your individual income is £32,000 per year, which is below the £60,000 threshold where the benefit starts to be taxed (known as the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge)

Since you're a single parent with an income under £60,000, you should be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit payment without any tax charge.

You can apply for Child Benefit online through the UK government website or by filling in a CH2 form. The current weekly rates are £25.60 for your eldest or only child (Ryan in this case).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T13:09:03.912402 [actor]: Thank you for checking my eligibility. That's good news that I can continue receiving Child Benefit for Ryan. I just wanted to make sure since he started his apprenticeship recently. I'll keep receiving it then. I appreciate your help!

2026-01-26T13:09:06.539566 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Karen is eligible for Child Benefit because her 17-year-old son is on an approved apprenticeship, earning less than £750 monthly, she lives in the UK as a UK national, and her income is below the £60,000 threshold.
