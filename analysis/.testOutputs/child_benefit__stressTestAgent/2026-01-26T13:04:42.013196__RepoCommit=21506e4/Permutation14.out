2026-01-26T13:09:58.756607 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, are you responsible for raising a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:09:59.726714 [actor]: I have a 6-year-old son named Noah that I'm raising on my own.

2026-01-26T13:10:01.039934 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since you're raising a 6-year-old son on your own, that's a good start for Child Benefit eligibility.

Do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:10:01.907118 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I'm a UK resident.

2026-01-26T13:10:03.481751 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. That's another important eligibility criterion.

Is your child (Noah) living with you? Or is he living with someone else?

2026-01-26T13:10:04.708266 [actor]: Well, actually, Noah is currently staying with his grandmother. I'm recovering from surgery due to a family emergency, so he's been living with her for about 6 weeks now.

2026-01-26T13:10:06.194803 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is important for determining eligibility.

Is this arrangement with Noah staying with his grandmother considered temporary? And do you still consider yourself as having main responsibility for Noah even while he's staying with his grandmother?

2026-01-26T13:10:08.000202 [actor]: Yes, it's definitely temporary. I'm just recovering from surgery and needed some help while I get back on my feet. I'm still Noah's main caregiver and responsible for him - his grandmother is just helping out during my recovery. He'll be coming back to live with me once I'm well enough.

2026-01-26T13:10:10.172927 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on what you've shared, this sounds like a temporary arrangement while you recover, and you still maintain main responsibility for Noah.

May I ask if you receive any income over £60,000 per year? This affects whether you'll need to pay back some or all of your Child Benefit through tax.

2026-01-26T13:10:11.329131 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that amount. My income is well below £60,000 per year.

2026-01-26T13:10:14.596212 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your income.

Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You are responsible for raising Noah, who is 6 years old
2. You are a UK resident
3. While Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother due to your surgery, this is a temporary arrangement and you maintain main responsibility for him
4. Your income is below £60,000 per year, so you would receive the full amount without needing to pay any back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge

You can claim Child Benefit even while Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother, as you remain the person mainly responsible for him.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T13:10:17.552580 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you! Yes, I would appreciate information on how to apply for Child Benefit. It's a relief to know I'm still eligible even though Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother while I recover. I want to make sure everything is in order for when he comes back home.

2026-01-26T13:10:19.222265 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that the user is eligible for Child Benefit as they maintain main responsibility for their 6-year-old son despite the temporary arrangement with the grandmother while recovering from surgery.
