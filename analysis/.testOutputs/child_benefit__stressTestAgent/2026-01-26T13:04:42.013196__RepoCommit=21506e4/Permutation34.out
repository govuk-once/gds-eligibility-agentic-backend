2026-01-26T13:19:02.399766 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First question: Are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:19:04.759933 [actor]: I'm Lisa, and I've been claiming Child Benefit for my son Mark who's 15. He's currently in a youth custody center though - he got sentenced to 6 months and has been there for about 10 weeks now. I'm wondering if I can still get Child Benefit for him or if it stops while he's in custody.

2026-01-26T13:19:07.924475 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context, Lisa. I understand your concern about Child Benefit for your son Mark who is currently in a youth custody center.

Based on the UK government rules, when a child enters custody, Child Benefit typically stops after 8 weeks of them being in custody. Since Mark has been in the youth custody center for about 10 weeks now, your Child Benefit payments would likely have stopped.

However, you should contact the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible to inform them about Mark's situation if you haven't already done so. They can provide specific guidance for your case and information about when payments might resume when Mark is released.

Would you like to know what will happen regarding Child Benefit when Mark is released from custody?

2026-01-26T13:19:09.765793 [actor]: Yes please, I would like to know what happens with the Child Benefit when Mark is released. Will it automatically start again, or will I need to make a new claim? And is there anything I should be doing now while he's still in custody?

2026-01-26T13:19:13.859057 [root_agent]: Thank you for your questions, Lisa. Let me address each of them:

When Mark is released from custody:
Child Benefit does not automatically restart. You'll need to contact the Child Benefit Office when Mark returns home to let them know he's been released. They will then arrange to restart your payments.

You won't need to make a completely new claim, but you will need to notify them of the change in circumstances.

What you should do now while Mark is still in custody:
1. If you haven't already informed the Child Benefit Office about Mark being in custody, you should do so as soon as possible.
2. Keep track of when Mark is due to be released.
3. Make a note to contact the Child Benefit Office immediately after Mark returns home.

The Child Benefit Office will need to know the exact date Mark returns to live with you in order to restart your payments correctly.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?

2026-01-26T13:19:16.480985 [actor]: I understand now. I'll make sure to contact the Child Benefit Office right away to update them about Mark's situation, and then I'll contact them again when he's released in about 4 months. I hadn't realized the payments would stop after 8 weeks, so thanks for explaining that. I think that answers all my questions about the Child Benefit situation.

2026-01-26T13:19:18.766607 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks when a child enters custody, which aligns with official guidance that payments continue for 8 weeks then stop if a child is sentenced to custody.
