2026-01-27T18:48:34.860628 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ The judgement is incorrect because the agent failed to identify that Martin could request an unequal splitting of his £40 contribution to meet the threshold for Ben, making him eligible for Child Benefit for Ben but not Jerry. The expected outcome was "Eligible for Ben (Full Rate), Not Eligible for Jerry," but the agent incorrectly stated Martin wasn't eligible at all.
