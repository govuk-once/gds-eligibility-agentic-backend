2026-01-26T13:11:38.935548 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T13:11:40.309163 [actor]: I'll help you by role-playing as a person inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

Yes, I have my son Dev living with me. He's studying for his A-levels at the moment.

2026-01-26T13:11:41.250490 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask how old Dev is?

2026-01-26T13:11:42.199792 [actor]: He's 19 years old. Just turned 19 a few months ago. He's in his final year of A-levels.

2026-01-26T13:11:43.642006 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing Dev's age. 

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, is Dev in approved education, such as A-levels, or an approved training course?

2026-01-26T13:11:44.678183 [actor]: Yes, he's studying for his A-levels full-time. He's been doing well in his studies so far.

2026-01-26T13:11:45.965147 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Dev is 19 and in approved education (A-levels full-time), that's helpful to know.

Is Dev living with you while he's studying, or does he live somewhere else during term time?

2026-01-26T13:11:46.975457 [actor]: Yes, Dev lives with me while he's studying. He travels to college each day from our home.

2026-01-26T13:11:48.355628 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Dev lives with you while studying.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income of over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T13:11:49.577378 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that much. My income is well below £60,000 per year. I'm a single parent.

2026-01-26T13:11:50.725559 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. 

Do you or Dev receive any other benefits or payments from other countries for Dev?

2026-01-26T13:11:51.554687 [actor]: No, we don't receive any other benefits or payments from other countries for Dev.

2026-01-26T13:11:55.862607 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit for Dev because:

1. He is 19 years old and in approved education (A-levels full-time)
2. He lives with you
3. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would start to apply
4. You don't receive benefits for him from another country

Child Benefit can be paid for children in approved education up until they turn 20. Since Dev is 19 and studying A-levels full-time, you should be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit until he either completes his course or turns 20, whichever comes first.

If you haven't already applied for Child Benefit, you may want to do so. If you were already receiving it for Dev, you should be able to continue receiving it until he finishes his education or turns 20.

Is there anything specific about Child Benefit that you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-26T13:11:57.411501 [actor]: Actually, I should mention that Dev will be turning 20 in the middle of this term. Will that affect the Child Benefit payments? Will they stop completely on his birthday?

2026-01-26T13:12:01.283100 [root_agent]: Thank you for mentioning that important detail about Dev's upcoming birthday.

Yes, this will affect your Child Benefit payments. Once Dev turns 20, you will no longer be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him, even if he continues with his A-level studies. The payments will stop from the date of his 20th birthday.

Child Benefit can only be paid for children in approved education up to their 20th birthday - this is a strict cut-off point. The payments won't continue until the end of the term or academic year.

You don't need to notify the Child Benefit Office about this in advance as they should automatically stop the payments when Dev turns 20. However, if you continue receiving payments after his birthday, you should report this as they would be considered overpayments that may need to be repaid.

2026-01-26T13:12:03.726879 [actor]: I understand now. So even though Dev will still be studying for his A-levels, the Child Benefit will stop on his 20th birthday. That's unfortunate timing as he's still dependent on me while finishing his education. Is there any other financial support I might be eligible for after his Child Benefit stops?

2026-01-26T13:12:06.162410 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that Child Benefit stops when a child turns 20, even if they're still in approved education, which aligns with the official guidelines.
