First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T13:05:49.101233 [actor]: I'm Elena, and I have a daughter named Sofia who's 18 years old. She lives with me, but she's not in education anymore. She left school two years ago and now works as a receptionist for about 30 hours a week.

2026-01-26T13:05:52.071549 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Elena. 

Based on what you've shared, it appears that Sofia would not qualify for Child Benefit because she is over 16 and not in approved education or training. Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training (such as A-levels, NVQs, or certain other educational programs).

Since Sofia is 18 and working as a receptionist rather than being in education or training, she would not meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or any other support you might be eligible for?

2026-01-26T13:05:54.473818 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that. I wasn't sure about the rules since she's still living at home with me, but I understand now that since Sofia is 18 and working rather than studying, I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore. That makes sense. No other questions at the moment, but I appreciate your help.

2026-01-26T13:05:56.340684 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available for children who are over 16 and not in approved education or training, which applies to the 18-year-old daughter who is working as a receptionist.
