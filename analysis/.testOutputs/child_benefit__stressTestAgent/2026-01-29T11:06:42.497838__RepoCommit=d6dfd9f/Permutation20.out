2026-01-29T11:17:01.209252 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:17:03.284549 [actor]: Yes, I do. I look after my granddaughter Lucia - she's 14 years old. She lives with me and I pay for everything she needs. Her parents aren't able to care for her, so she's been staying with me.

2026-01-29T11:17:05.458005 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that you're caring for your 14-year-old granddaughter Lucia.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you the person who is mainly responsible for Lucia? In other words, are you the one who is primarily looking after her day-to-day and making decisions about her care?**

2026-01-29T11:17:08.184978 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm the one who looks after her day-to-day. I make all the decisions about her care, take her to school, feed her, clothe her - everything really. Her parents don't contribute financially at all, and I'm the one responsible for all her needs. She lives with me full-time.

2026-01-29T11:17:11.120671 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's clear you have the main responsibility for Lucia's care.

Now I need to ask you:

**Do you normally live in the UK? Or if you don't live in the UK, are you working abroad as a Crown servant (such as in the civil service or armed forces), or living abroad with a partner who is a Crown servant?**

2026-01-29T11:17:12.810703 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I've been here for years - this is where Lucia and I live together.

2026-01-29T11:17:14.616815 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

One more important question:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucia?** (For example, her parents or anyone else?)

2026-01-29T11:17:16.518810 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for her. Her parents aren't claiming it - they're not involved in her care at all and don't contribute anything financially.

2026-01-29T11:17:20.407107 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your granddaughter Lucia. Here's why:

✓ Lucia is 14 years old (under 16)
✓ You are the person mainly responsible for her - you look after her day-to-day and pay for everything she needs
✓ She lives with you
✓ You live in the UK
✓ Nobody else is currently claiming Child Benefit for her

You don't have to be the child's parent to claim Child Benefit - the key is that you're responsible for the child, which you clearly are.

**You can apply for Child Benefit for Lucia.** The application process involves filling out a claim form, and you'll need Lucia's birth certificate as part of the application.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-29T11:17:23.818826 [actor]: Oh that's wonderful news, thank you so much! That will really help with Lucia's costs. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything to me.

2026-01-29T11:17:26.068878 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a grandparent caring for their grandchild full-time, with main responsibility, and meeting all other eligibility criteria (child under 16, UK residence, no one else claiming) is eligible for Child Benefit.
