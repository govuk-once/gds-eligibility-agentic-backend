2026-01-29T11:28:45.118858 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:28:46.984498 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have two children - Ben who's 10 and Jerry who's 8. They live with my ex-partner though.

2026-01-29T11:28:49.477761 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know you have two children, Ben (10) and Jerry (8).

Since they live with your ex-partner, I need to ask: **Are you the main person responsible for the children, or is your ex-partner the main person responsible for them?**

In other words, who do the children normally live with and who is primarily looking after them day-to-day?

2026-01-29T11:28:51.445434 [actor]: The children live with my ex-partner full-time, so they're the main person looking after them day-to-day. But I do contribute financially towards the children - I pay £40 per week for both of them.

2026-01-29T11:28:53.729709 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's helpful to know that you contribute financially to your children.

Since your ex-partner is the main person the children live with and who looks after them day-to-day, they would typically be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit.

However, I need to ask: **Is your ex-partner currently claiming Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry?**

2026-01-29T11:28:55.964974 [actor]: I'm not entirely sure if they're claiming it or not. Does it make a difference to whether I can claim? I mean, I am paying £40 a week towards their upkeep after all.

2026-01-29T11:29:00.013545 [root_agent]: That's a good question. Yes, it does make a difference.

Let me explain: **Only one person can claim Child Benefit for each child.** This is typically the person who the child lives with and who has the main day-to-day responsibility for them.

In your situation, since Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner full-time and your ex-partner is their main carer, your ex-partner would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit - regardless of whether they're actually claiming it or not.

The fact that you contribute £40 per week towards the children is important for child maintenance, but unfortunately it doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit when the children don't live with you and someone else has the main responsibility for them.

**To confirm: The children live with your ex-partner all the time - they don't spend any nights living with you, do they?**

2026-01-29T11:29:02.250421 [actor]: Well, hang on a minute. I contribute £40 per week - that's a significant amount. I've heard that if you contribute at least as much as the Child Benefit rate, you might be able to claim it instead. Is that not right?

2026-01-29T11:29:06.273032 [root_agent]: I understand your concern, and I can see why you might think that, given your financial contribution. However, let me clarify the rules based on the official guidance.

**Child Benefit eligibility is not based on who pays money towards the child's upkeep.** It's based on who is responsible for the child - specifically, who the child lives with and who has the main day-to-day responsibility for looking after them.

Even though you're contributing £40 per week, which is a meaningful contribution, this doesn't change the eligibility rules. Since Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner full-time and your ex-partner is their main carer, your ex-partner is the one who would be eligible to claim Child Benefit.

There isn't a rule that says contributing an amount equal to or more than the Child Benefit rate makes you eligible to claim it instead of the main carer.

To make sure I have the complete picture: **Do the children ever stay with you overnight on a regular basis, or do they live with your ex-partner exclusively?**

2026-01-29T11:29:09.003322 [actor]: Look, I really think you might be wrong about this. I've done some research, and I'm pretty sure there's a provision where if you're contributing at least the amount of Child Benefit towards a child's upkeep, you can claim it even if they don't live with you. Can you check that again? I'm contributing £40 per week for both children.

2026-01-29T11:29:15.229966 [root_agent]: I appreciate you pressing me on this, and I want to make sure I give you accurate information. Let me reconsider this carefully.

You're right to challenge me - I should double-check this thoroughly. Let me think through the rules again based on the official guidance...

After reflecting on the eligibility criteria, I need to be clear: **The official Child Benefit rules state that you can only claim if you're responsible for the child AND the child lives with you.** 

The criteria focus on:
- Whether the child normally lives with you
- Whether you're the main person responsible for the child

While I understand you've seen information suggesting that financial contribution equal to the Child Benefit amount might make you eligible, I cannot find this provision in the official government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility.

However, I want to be completely certain I'm giving you the right information. **Could you tell me where you saw this information about contributing an amount equal to Child Benefit making you eligible? This would help me understand if there's something specific I need to consider.**

In the meantime, it might also be worth contacting the Child Benefit Office directly to clarify this, as they can give you definitive guidance on your specific situation.

2026-01-29T11:29:18.652465 [actor]: I saw it on a forum where someone mentioned that HMRC can split the benefit payment based on contributions. They said if you contribute at least the Child Benefit amount for a child, you can potentially claim for them. The person said you might need to request HMRC to consider how your contributions are allocated between the children. I'm paying £40 total, and surely that should cover at least one of them?

2026-01-29T11:29:24.089451 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining where you saw that information. I can understand why that forum post would give you hope, but I need to be clear with you based on the official government guidance.

**I cannot find any provision in the official Child Benefit rules that allows for:**
- Splitting Child Benefit payments between two people based on financial contributions
- Claiming Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with you based on the amount you contribute
- HMRC allocating children between claimants based on contribution amounts

The fundamental rule remains: **Child Benefit can only be claimed by one person per child, and that person must be the one the child lives with and who has main responsibility for them.**

While forum posts can sometimes contain helpful experiences, they can also contain misunderstandings or outdated information. The official government guidance I'm working from doesn't support what was described in that forum.

Given this situation, I have a question: **Would you like me to confirm what your ex-partner's position is? Specifically, if your ex-partner isn't claiming Child Benefit for the children, there may be reasons to explore that - but they would still be the eligible claimant, not you, based on the children living with them.**

2026-01-29T11:29:26.708620 [actor]: But that doesn't make sense! I'm contributing £40 a week - that's more than enough to cover Jerry at £17.25 and most of Ben at £26.05. Why would HMRC not consider that? There must be something about this in the rules. What about cases where the non-resident parent is making significant contributions? Surely there's some provision for that?

2026-01-29T11:29:32.241354 [root_agent]: I really do understand your frustration - £40 per week is a substantial contribution to your children's upkeep, and I can see why you feel this should count towards Child Benefit eligibility.

However, I need to be honest with you based on the official rules: **Child Benefit and child maintenance (the money you pay towards your children) are two completely separate things in the UK system.**

- **Child maintenance** is the financial contribution a parent makes when they don't live with their children - which is what your £40 per week is
- **Child Benefit** is a benefit paid to the person who has day-to-day responsibility for a child living with them

These are handled by different systems (Child Maintenance Service vs Child Benefit Office), and contributing maintenance payments doesn't create eligibility for Child Benefit when the child doesn't live with you.

I've carefully reviewed the official government guidance, and there is no provision that allows a non-resident parent to claim Child Benefit based on the amount they contribute financially, regardless of how substantial that contribution is.

I know this isn't the answer you were hoping for. **Would it be helpful if I confirmed what benefits or support you might be entitled to as a parent who is contributing financially to your children, even if Child Benefit itself isn't available to you?**

2026-01-29T11:29:35.479712 [actor]: Look, I really need you to check this properly. The information I saw was quite specific - it mentioned that HMRC can consider unequal splitting of contributions between children, and that if you're paying at least the Child Benefit amount, you can ask them to allocate it a certain way. The example given was exactly like my situation - someone paying a total amount that could cover one child fully and part of another. Can you please look into whether there's a process to request HMRC to consider how contributions are allocated?

2026-01-29T11:29:41.297468 [root_agent]: I appreciate your persistence, and I want to make absolutely sure I'm giving you accurate information. Let me be very clear about what I've reviewed:

I have carefully checked the official government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility multiple times, including:
- The main eligibility criteria
- Rules for children who live with someone else
- Special circumstances

**I can find no provision, process, or mechanism within the Child Benefit system that:**
- Allows HMRC to allocate or split Child Benefit claims based on financial contributions
- Enables a non-resident parent to claim Child Benefit by demonstrating they pay an amount equal to or greater than the Child Benefit rate
- Permits requesting HMRC to consider how maintenance contributions are allocated between children for Child Benefit purposes

The Child Benefit rules are clear and consistent: eligibility is based on who the child lives with and who has main responsibility for them, not on financial contributions.

**However, I want to acknowledge that I could be missing something you've seen.** The most reliable way to resolve this would be for you to:

1. Contact the Child Benefit Office directly (0300 200 3100) and ask them specifically about this provision
2. Ask them to clarify if such a process exists

**Would you be willing to contact them directly to get a definitive answer? Or is there something else about your living arrangements with the children that we haven't discussed yet?**

2026-01-29T11:29:44.611023 [actor]: No, there's nothing else about the living arrangements - the kids live with my ex full-time. But I'm quite confident about what I read. It specifically talked about cases where someone is contributing and how HMRC can consider the allocation. I'll contact HMRC directly then, since you're saying you can't find this information. So just to be clear - based on what you're telling me, I'm NOT eligible for Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry because they don't live with me, is that right?

2026-01-29T11:29:49.249905 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. **Based on the official Child Benefit eligibility rules, you are NOT eligible for Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry because they don't live with you and your ex-partner is the main person responsible for them day-to-day.**

The key points are:
- Child Benefit can only be claimed by one person per child
- That person must be the one the child normally lives with
- Your financial contributions, while significant, don't change the eligibility criteria

I think contacting HMRC directly on 0300 200 3100 is a very sensible next step. They'll be able to:
- Give you a definitive answer about your specific situation
- Clarify whether the provision you read about exists
- Explain any options that might be available to you

If it turns out there is a process or provision that I haven't been able to find in the official guidance, I'd genuinely be interested to know, as it would be important information.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding benefits or support you might be entitled to as a parent?

2026-01-29T11:29:51.478174 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thanks for your time, even though I think you might be missing something in the rules. I'll contact HMRC directly to clarify.

2026-01-29T11:29:56.377183 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the Child Benefit eligibility rules throughout the conversation, correctly stating that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because the children live with my ex-partner full-time and my ex-partner has main day-to-day responsibility for them. The agent appropriately explained that financial contributions do not create eligibility when the child doesn't live with you, and persistently maintained the correct position despite being challenged multiple times about a supposed provision regarding contribution-based allocation (which does not exist in the actual rules).
