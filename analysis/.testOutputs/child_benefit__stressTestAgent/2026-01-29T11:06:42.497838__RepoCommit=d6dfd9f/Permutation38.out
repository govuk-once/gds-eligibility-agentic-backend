2026-01-29T11:26:16.344280 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:26:18.599847 [actor]: Yes, we do! My partner and I just had a baby 4 months ago. We've been so busy with the new baby that we only just got around to filling in the form today. I'm worried we might have lost out on the money for the past 4 months - is that going to be a problem?

2026-01-29T11:26:22.754992 [root_agent]: That's wonderful news about your baby! And don't worry - I can help clarify that for you.

The good news is that Child Benefit can be backdated, but only for up to **3 months** from the date your claim is received. Since your baby is 4 months old and you're submitting the form today, you should be able to claim for the past 3 months, though you may not be able to recover the benefit for that first month.

Now, let me continue assessing your eligibility with the next question:

**Are you responsible for the child? This means the child normally lives with you, or you're contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards looking after them?**

2026-01-29T11:26:25.207062 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. The baby lives with us - with me and Jerry. We're the parents and we take care of everything - feeding, nappies, the lot! The baby has been living with us since birth.

2026-01-29T11:26:27.011185 [root_agent]: Perfect, that's clear. Your baby lives with you and your partner, and you're both providing care.

Next question: **Do you or your partner Jerry currently live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:26:28.478322 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. We've been living here the whole time.

2026-01-29T11:26:30.900158 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask: **Are either you or Jerry receiving Child Benefit for this baby already, or has either of you already made a claim that's being processed?**

(It's important to know this because only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child.)

2026-01-29T11:26:33.109997 [actor]: No, neither of us has claimed it yet. Like I said, we just got so overwhelmed with everything - the sleepless nights, the feeding schedules, all of it - that we completely forgot about the form until now. This is our first time making the claim.

2026-01-29T11:26:36.043629 [root_agent]: That's completely understandable - it's a busy time with a new baby!

One more important question: **Do you or Jerry have immigration status that allows you to claim benefits in the UK? For example, are you British citizens, have settled status, pre-settled status, or another immigration status that permits access to public funds?**

2026-01-29T11:26:37.984434 [actor]: Yes, we're both British citizens. No issues with immigration status or anything like that.

2026-01-29T11:26:42.546741 [root_agent]: Excellent! Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's a summary:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 4-month-old baby)
✓ The child lives with you and you're responsible for their care
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You're British citizens with the right to claim benefits
✓ Neither you nor Jerry has already claimed for this child

**What happens next:**

Since you're submitting your claim today and your baby is 4 months old, your claim can be backdated up to 3 months from when it's received. This means you should receive Child Benefit for the past 3 months, though unfortunately the first month may not be recoverable.

**One final thing to be aware of:** If either you or Jerry earns over £60,000 a year, you may need to pay a tax charge called the High Income Child Benefit Charge. However, you can still claim Child Benefit even if this applies to you.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:26:46.049666 [actor]: Oh that's a relief! Thank you so much for explaining everything. It's good to know we can at least get the last 3 months back, even if we've missed out on that first month. That's our fault for being so disorganised!

No, I think that covers everything I needed to know. I'll make sure we get this form submitted right away. Thanks again for your help!

2026-01-29T11:26:50.182640 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined eligibility and correctly explained that Child Benefit can be backdated for 3 months (meaning the claimant loses the first month's money for their 4-month-old baby), which matches the expected outcome.
