2026-01-29T11:11:13.069363 [root_agent]: I'll be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:11:14.720967 [actor]: Yes, I do. I'm fostering a 12-year-old boy named Liam. He lives with me and I look after him.

2026-01-29T11:11:17.021724 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Fostering a child can make you eligible for Child Benefit in certain circumstances.

**Is Liam placed with you through a formal foster care arrangement by a local authority, or is this an informal or private fostering arrangement?**

2026-01-29T11:11:18.780692 [actor]: He's been placed with me by the local authority. It's a formal foster care arrangement through the council.

2026-01-29T11:11:22.040149 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is helpful information.

When a child is formally fostered through a local authority arrangement, the fostering service usually pays a fostering allowance. In these cases, foster carers are generally **not eligible** for Child Benefit, as the child is considered to be looked after by the local authority.

However, let me ask one more question to be completely sure:

**Are you receiving fostering allowance payments from the local authority for looking after Liam?**

2026-01-29T11:11:23.620540 [actor]: Yes, that's right. The council pays me a fostering allowance that covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance.

2026-01-29T11:11:44.983674 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** for Liam.

Here's why:

When a child is formally fostered through a local authority and you receive fostering allowance payments, the child is considered to be "looked after" by the local authority. In these circumstances, foster carers cannot claim Child Benefit because:

- The local authority has parental responsibility for the child
- You're receiving fostering allowance to cover the child's care and maintenance

Child Benefit is generally only available for children who are not being looked after by a local authority or who are not in formal foster care arrangements where allowances are paid.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this, or do you have any other questions about your situation with Liam?

2026-01-29T11:11:46.754618 [actor]: No, that's clear. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T11:11:50.455739 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that foster carers receiving fostering allowance from a local authority for a child in formal foster care are not eligible for Child Benefit, as the child is considered "looked after" by the local authority, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
