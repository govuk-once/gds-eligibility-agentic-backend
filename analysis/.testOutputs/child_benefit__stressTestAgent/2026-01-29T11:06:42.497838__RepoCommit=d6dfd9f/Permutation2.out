2026-01-29T11:07:12.079567 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess this.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:07:14.184052 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have a daughter who's 17, and she's studying full-time for her A-levels at a local sixth-form college.

2026-01-29T11:07:16.703310 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your daughter's situation sounds promising as she's in full-time education.

Next question: **Does your daughter live with you?**

2026-01-29T11:07:18.557284 [actor]: Yes, she does. She lives with me here in London.

2026-01-29T11:07:21.060243 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know. 

Next question: **Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do either of you have a residence requirement that prevents you from claiming benefits?**

(In other words, do you have the right to reside in the UK and are you not subject to immigration restrictions that would prevent you from claiming public funds?)

2026-01-29T11:07:22.574438 [actor]: No, I'm not subject to immigration control. I'm a UK resident with no restrictions on claiming benefits.

2026-01-29T11:07:25.397654 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for clarifying that.

Next question: **Do you have an individual income over £50,000 per year, or if you have a partner, does either of you have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

(This is important because while it doesn't affect your eligibility to claim Child Benefit, it may affect whether you need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means some or all of the benefit would need to be repaid through tax.)

2026-01-29T11:07:27.128428 [actor]: No, I don't. I earn £40,000 a year, and I'm a single father, so there's no partner to consider.

2026-01-29T11:07:30.489450 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You're responsible for a child under 20 who is in approved full-time education (A-levels at sixth-form college qualify)
✓ Your daughter lives with you
✓ You're not subject to immigration control
✓ Your income is below £50,000, so you won't need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge

You should be able to claim Child Benefit for your 17-year-old daughter as long as she continues her full-time approved education or training. This can continue until she turns 20, or until she leaves approved education or training, whichever comes first.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the claiming process?**

2026-01-29T11:07:32.157941 [actor]: No, that's everything I needed to know. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T11:07:35.770498 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all relevant criteria (child under 20 in approved education, child lives with claimant, no immigration restrictions, income below £50,000) and correctly concluded eligibility for Child Benefit without making any errors throughout the conversation.
