2026-01-29T11:25:43.463612 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:25:46.097810 [actor]: Yes, I do. Nina is 10 years old and she's living with me now. She's my best friend's daughter - her mum has been quite ill, so Nina has come to stay with me for the time being. It's a private arrangement we've made as a family.

2026-01-29T11:25:48.511921 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand Nina is living with you due to her mother's illness.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for Nina? By this I mean, do you provide for her day-to-day needs such as food, clothing, and shelter while she's living with you?**

2026-01-29T11:25:51.135959 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm taking care of all her day-to-day needs - her food, clothes, everything she needs really. I'm covering all the costs of looking after her while she's with me. The local council knows about the arrangement, but they're not paying me anything - no fostering allowance or anything like that. It's just me supporting her financially.

2026-01-29T11:25:53.493825 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's helpful to know you're responsible for Nina's day-to-day care and costs.

I have another important question:

**Is Nina's mother currently claiming Child Benefit for her, or has anyone else (such as another family member) been claiming Child Benefit for Nina?**

2026-01-29T11:25:55.579010 [actor]: No, her mother isn't claiming it at the moment - with everything going on with her illness, she's not really in a position to handle things like that. And no one else is claiming it either as far as I know.

2026-01-29T11:25:57.354130 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you normally living in the UK? And is Nina also normally living in the UK with you?**

2026-01-29T11:25:59.728765 [actor]: Yes, we're both living here in the UK. Nina has always lived here, and so have I. We're both UK residents.

2026-01-29T11:26:01.877323 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

I have one more important question:

**Do you have an immigration status that allows you to claim benefits in the UK? For example, are you a British citizen, or do you have settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another immigration status that gives you access to public funds?**

2026-01-29T11:26:03.822144 [actor]: Yes, I'm a British citizen. No issues there with immigration status or anything like that.

2026-01-29T11:26:07.882994 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Nina.**

Here's why:

✓ Nina is under 16 years old (she's 10)
✓ You are responsible for her - you're providing for all her day-to-day needs and covering the costs of looking after her
✓ Nina is living with you in the UK
✓ You are a British citizen with the right to claim benefits
✓ No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for Nina
✓ You're not receiving a fostering allowance from the local council

The fact that Nina is your friend's daughter rather than your own child doesn't prevent you from claiming - Child Benefit can be claimed by anyone who is responsible for a child, not just parents.

**Would you like to know how to make a claim for Child Benefit?**

2026-01-29T11:26:10.156783 [actor]: Oh that's wonderful news, thank you so much! Yes, I would like to know how to make a claim - that would be really helpful. This will make such a difference in helping me care for Nina.

2026-01-29T11:26:14.181850 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on all the correct criteria: the child is under 16, the user is responsible for day-to-day care, both are UK residents, the user is a British citizen, no one else is claiming, and no fostering allowance is being received. The agent correctly understood that non-parents can claim Child Benefit when responsible for a child's care.
