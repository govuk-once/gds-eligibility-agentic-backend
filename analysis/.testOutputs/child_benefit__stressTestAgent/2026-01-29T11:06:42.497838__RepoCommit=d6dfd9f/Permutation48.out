2026-01-29T11:33:08.351632 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T11:33:09.825104 [actor]: Yes, I do. My daughter Emily is 18 and she's in education.

2026-01-29T11:33:12.277324 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's a good start - since Emily is 18 and in education, she could potentially qualify.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for Emily? By this I mean, does she live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards her upbringing?

2026-01-29T11:33:13.748025 [actor]: Yes, she lives with me and I'm responsible for her.

2026-01-29T11:33:15.412499 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Next question: Are you or Emily currently living in the UK?

2026-01-29T11:33:17.073537 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:33:19.497272 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask: Do you have immigration status in the UK that allows you to claim benefits? For example, are you a UK citizen, have settled status, or have another immigration status that permits you to access public funds?

2026-01-29T11:33:20.824561 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK citizen.

2026-01-29T11:33:23.427928 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question: Is there anyone else who also has a child living with them who you're responsible for, or is Emily the only child in your care? And importantly, does anyone else (such as another parent or guardian) also have Emily living with them or contribute equally to her care?

2026-01-29T11:33:25.220595 [actor]: No, it's just Emily and me. She lives with me full-time and no one else is claiming for her or contributing equally.

2026-01-29T11:33:29.663341 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Emily, age 18) who is under 20 and in approved education or training
✓ You are responsible for Emily - she lives with you
✓ You both live in the UK
✓ You're a UK citizen with the right to claim benefits
✓ No one else is claiming for Emily or shares equal responsibility

You should be able to claim Child Benefit for Emily. However, please note that if Emily stops her approved education or training, or turns 20, your Child Benefit entitlement for her would end.

Also, be aware that if you (or your partner, if you have one) earn over £60,000 a year, you may need to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge via your tax return.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:33:31.731500 [actor]: Actually, I should mention - Emily has just started a Higher National Certificate course at the local college. Does that make a difference?

2026-01-29T11:33:33.665879 [root_agent]: That's an important detail, thank you for mentioning it.

Let me ask you: Is Emily studying the Higher National Certificate (HNC) full-time or part-time?

2026-01-29T11:33:35.092868 [actor]: She's studying it full-time.

2026-01-29T11:33:38.651242 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

A full-time Higher National Certificate (HNC) course at college should qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes, as long as it's non-advanced education.

However, I need to check one more thing: Do you know if the HNC course Emily is taking is classified as non-advanced education, or is it considered higher education (advanced)? This is important because Child Benefit only continues for approved non-advanced education or training for 16-19 year olds (or under 20 in some cases).

HNC courses can sometimes be classified as higher education, which would mean Child Benefit would stop. Do you know how her college classifies this particular course?

2026-01-29T11:33:40.511968 [actor]: The college said it's an advanced course - it's a level 4 qualification, similar to the first year of a degree.

2026-01-29T11:33:45.495887 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important clarification.

I'm afraid this does change your eligibility. Since Emily's HNC is classified as an advanced course (level 4, equivalent to higher education), **Child Benefit would stop** for her.

Child Benefit only continues for young people aged 16-19 (or under 20 in limited cases) who are in **approved non-advanced education or training**. Higher education courses like HNCs, HNDs, and university degrees don't qualify as approved education for Child Benefit purposes.

This means that once Emily started her advanced HNC course, your entitlement to Child Benefit for her would have ended - even though she's only 18 and studying full-time.

You'll need to inform the Child Benefit Office about this change in Emily's education status, as continuing to receive Child Benefit when you're no longer eligible could result in overpayments that you'd need to repay.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-29T11:33:51.088444 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent initially assessed eligibility as "eligible" based on the information provided, but when the crucial detail about the HNC being an advanced level 4 course was revealed, the agent correctly changed the determination to "not eligible" and properly explained that Child Benefit does not continue for advanced/higher education courses.
