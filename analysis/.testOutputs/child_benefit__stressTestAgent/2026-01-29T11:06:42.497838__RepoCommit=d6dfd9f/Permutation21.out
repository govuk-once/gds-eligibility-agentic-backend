2026-01-29T11:17:27.917976 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:17:29.753341 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Sam, who's 10 years old. He lives with me.

2026-01-29T11:17:31.936793 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Are you responsible for Sam? That means do you look after him and pay towards the costs of raising him, such as food, clothes, and housing?**

2026-01-29T11:17:33.745545 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Sam lives with me full-time and I'm completely responsible for him. I pay for everything - his food, clothes, housing, school things, all of it.

2026-01-29T11:17:35.578710 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know. Let me ask you another important question:

**Do you normally live in the UK?** (This includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland)

2026-01-29T11:17:36.936492 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:17:38.708789 [root_agent]: Excellent. Now I need to ask about Sam's circumstances:

**Is Sam currently in hospital or in care (such as being looked after by the local council)?**

2026-01-29T11:17:40.288570 [actor]: No, he's not. Sam lives at home with me - he's not in hospital or in care.

2026-01-29T11:17:43.077305 [root_agent]: Thank you. Let me ask about Sam's age and education:

**Is Sam under 16 years old, OR is he under 20 and in approved education or training?**

(You mentioned Sam is 10, so I believe the answer is yes, but I want to confirm he's not in any exceptional circumstances that might affect eligibility.)

2026-01-29T11:17:44.869282 [actor]: Yes, that's right - Sam is 10 years old, so he's under 16. He's just in normal primary school.

2026-01-29T11:17:47.623633 [root_agent]: Perfect. Now I need to ask an important question about anyone else who might also be claiming:

**Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Sam, or does anyone else have an equal or greater entitlement to claim for him?** 

For example, does Sam's other parent or anyone else also care for him, or might they be claiming Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-29T11:17:49.949646 [actor]: Well, I'm divorced from Sam's mum, Tina. Sam lives with me full-time, not with her. She has our daughter Ella who lives with her. So no, no one else is claiming for Sam - he's with me.

2026-01-29T11:17:52.407407 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Just one more question to confirm:

**Do you or Sam have any immigration status restrictions that say you have "no recourse to public funds"?**

In other words, are there any visa or immigration conditions that prevent you from accessing UK benefits?

2026-01-29T11:17:54.080035 [actor]: No, there's nothing like that. We don't have any immigration restrictions.

2026-01-29T11:18:03.580156 [root_agent]: Excellent! Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Sam.

Let me summarize why:
- ✓ You have a child (Sam, age 10) who is under 16
- ✓ Sam lives with you and you're responsible for him
- ✓ You pay towards the costs of raising him
- ✓ You live in the UK
- ✓ Sam is not in hospital or care
- ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Sam
- ✓ You don't have any immigration restrictions preventing access to public funds

You meet the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, such as how to apply or how it might be affected by your income?**

2026-01-29T11:18:05.460989 [actor]: No, that's great - thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T11:18:09.405181 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for their 10-year-old son Sam, who lives with them full-time, and correctly verified all the necessary eligibility criteria including UK residency, responsibility for the child, no one else claiming, and no immigration restrictions.
