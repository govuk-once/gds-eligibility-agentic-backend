2026-01-29T11:13:12.462260 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:13:14.500900 [actor]: Yes, I do. We have a little girl named Maya who's 4 years old. She's been placed with us by the adoption agency and is living in our home now. We're in the process of adopting her, but the final adoption order hasn't been granted by the court yet.

2026-01-29T11:13:17.265446 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's wonderful that you're providing a home for Maya.

To assess your eligibility properly, I need to ask:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Maya, or has anyone else (such as her birth parents or previous carers) been claiming Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-29T11:13:19.573950 [actor]: No, we're not currently receiving Child Benefit for her. I'm not sure if anyone else has been claiming it - she was placed with us by the adoption agency, so I suppose it's possible someone was claiming before, but we haven't received anything since she moved in with us.

2026-01-29T11:13:21.904503 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now, let me ask an important question about Maya's living arrangements:

**Is Maya living with you full-time in your home, or does she spend time living elsewhere (for example, does she still have visits or stays with her birth family or in any other care arrangement)?**

2026-01-29T11:13:23.976154 [actor]: She's living with us full-time now. Since the adoption agency placed her with us, she's been in our home with me and my partner Zara. She's not staying anywhere else or going back to her birth family.

2026-01-29T11:13:26.312841 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question:

**Are you and/or your partner Zara currently responsible for Maya? By this I mean, are you providing for her care, making decisions about her upbringing, and supporting her day-to-day needs?**

2026-01-29T11:13:28.982671 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Both Zara and I are responsible for Maya. We're taking care of her every day - feeding her, looking after her, making decisions about her care and upbringing. We're doing everything parents would do. The adoption agency placed her with us, so we're her carers now while we're going through the adoption process.

2026-01-29T11:13:32.883856 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, let me reflect on your situation:

You and Zara have Maya living with you full-time, you're responsible for her care and upbringing, she's under 16 years old, and she's been placed with you by an adoption agency while you're in the process of adopting her. No one is currently claiming Child Benefit for her.

**Good news: You should be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Maya.** 

The rules allow people who are responsible for a child to claim Child Benefit, and this includes prospective adopters like yourselves. You don't need to wait until the adoption order is finalized - you can claim now since Maya is living with you and you're responsible for her.

One final question to complete the assessment:

**Are you or your partner Zara currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:13:34.527775 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. We're both here with Maya.

2026-01-29T11:13:38.560163 [root_agent]: Excellent! Based on all the information you've provided, **you are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Maya.**

Here's a summary of why you qualify:

✓ Maya is under 16 years old (she's 4)
✓ She lives with you full-time in the UK
✓ You and Zara are responsible for her care and upbringing
✓ You're her prospective adopters with an adoption placement
✓ No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ You both live in the UK

As prospective adopters with Maya placed in your home by the adoption agency, you can claim Child Benefit now - you don't need to wait for the final adoption order.

**You can now proceed to make your claim for Child Benefit.** Only one of you (either you or Zara) will need to claim, as only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T11:13:42.610995 [actor]: That's great news, thank you so much! That's really helpful to know we can claim now rather than waiting for the final order. We'll get the claim sorted out. Thanks for your help!

2026-01-29T11:13:45.122612 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately established that prospective adopters are eligible for Child Benefit when a child is placed with them by an adoption agency, correctly identified all relevant eligibility criteria (child under 16, living with claimant full-time, claimant responsible for care, UK residence), and properly concluded that the user qualifies without needing to wait for the final adoption order.
