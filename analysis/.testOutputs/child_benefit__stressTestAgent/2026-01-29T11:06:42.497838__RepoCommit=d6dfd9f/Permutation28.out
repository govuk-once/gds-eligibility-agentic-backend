2026-01-29T11:21:40.264055 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Are you responsible for raising a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T11:21:42.294208 [actor]: Yes, I have a 5-year-old son who lives with me. I'm responsible for raising him.

2026-01-29T11:21:44.084194 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Do you normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:21:46.030558 [actor]: Well, I'm from the United States actually. I'm here in the UK on a tourist visa - a 6-month visitor visa. My son is with me and we've been staying here for a little while now.

2026-01-29T11:21:48.083738 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

This is an important detail. Let me ask you:

**Do you have any other immigration status or permission to live in the UK beyond your 6-month tourist visa? For example, do you have the right to reside in the UK, settled status, or are you subject to immigration control?**

2026-01-29T11:21:50.044922 [actor]: No, I just have the standard 6-month tourist visa. I'm not working here or anything like that - just visiting. I don't have any settled status or other special permission to stay beyond the tourist visa.

2026-01-29T11:21:54.119021 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to let you know that **you are not eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:

To be eligible for Child Benefit, you must normally live in the UK. As a visitor on a 6-month tourist visa with no right to reside or settled status, you are subject to immigration control and do not meet the residency requirement for Child Benefit. The UK government requires that claimants have a more permanent immigration status that allows them to access public funds.

Child Benefit is generally only available to people who:
- Live in the UK on a settled basis, or
- Have the right to reside in the UK (such as through citizenship, indefinite leave to remain, or certain other immigration statuses that permit access to public funds)

Your tourist visa status means you're temporarily visiting rather than normally living in the UK, which unfortunately makes you ineligible for this benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this decision?

2026-01-29T11:21:57.870137 [actor]: I understand. Thank you for explaining that to me. It makes sense that the benefit is only for people who live here permanently, not visitors like me.

2026-01-29T11:22:00.204438 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that a person on a 6-month tourist visa from the United States does not meet the residency requirements for Child Benefit, as they are subject to immigration control and do not have the right to reside in the UK or settled status, which are necessary to claim this benefit.
