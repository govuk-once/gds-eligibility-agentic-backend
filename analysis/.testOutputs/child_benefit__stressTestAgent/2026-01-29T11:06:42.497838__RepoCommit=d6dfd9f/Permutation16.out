2026-01-29T11:14:56.383596 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child (or children) who is either:
- Under 16 years old, or
- Under 20 years old and in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T11:14:58.374474 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T11:15:00.625724 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next, I need to ask: Are you responsible for your son? This means do you live with him and are you the person who looks after him day-to-day (for example, providing food, clothing, and a home)?

2026-01-29T11:15:02.745540 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated actually. My son Oliver has a rare condition and he's been sent to a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I'm still here in the UK, but I pay for his incidental costs and visit him when I can.

2026-01-29T11:15:05.102736 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that situation - I understand this must be a difficult time for you and Oliver.

This is an important detail for Child Benefit eligibility. Let me ask: 

Before Oliver went to the hospital in the USA, were you living with him and responsible for him here in the UK?

2026-01-29T11:15:07.396211 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. He lived with me here in the UK and I was looking after him. He only went to the USA specifically for this hospital treatment because of his rare condition - they have specialists there that we don't have here.

2026-01-29T11:15:10.087216 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now, regarding Oliver's stay in the USA for treatment - do you know approximately how long he is expected to remain in the hospital there? Is it expected to be a temporary stay for treatment, or is it likely to be longer term?

2026-01-29T11:15:12.455969 [actor]: We're not entirely sure how long he'll need to be there - it depends on how he responds to the treatment. It could be several more months. But yes, it's definitely temporary - he's only there for the hospital treatment and will come home once he's well enough.

2026-01-29T11:15:14.555019 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me ask another important question: While Oliver is in the USA receiving treatment, is anyone else also claiming Child Benefit for him, either here in the UK or elsewhere?

2026-01-29T11:15:16.393034 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for him. It's just me - I'm his mum and I'm the one supporting him and paying for his costs while he's there.

2026-01-29T11:15:18.333019 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more question: Are you currently living in the UK yourself, and do you usually live in the UK? (This is important for Child Benefit eligibility as there are residency requirements.)

2026-01-29T11:15:19.947453 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I've stayed here while Oliver is in the USA for treatment. I'm a UK resident.

2026-01-29T11:15:30.117315 [root_agent]: <thought>
Let me reflect on the information gathered:

1. The person has a 14-year-old son (under 16) - ✓ meets age criteria
2. She was responsible for him and living with him in the UK before he went to hospital - ✓
3. Her son is in a hospital in the USA (abroad) for specialist treatment for a rare condition
4. He has been there for 15 weeks, with potentially several more months to go
5. It's temporary - specifically for hospital treatment, and he will return home
6. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him
7. She is a UK resident and remains in the UK
8. She continues to support him financially (paying incidental costs) and visits when possible

According to the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, I need to check the rules about children in hospital abroad.

The key rules are:
- You can continue to get Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks if your child goes into hospital
- After 12 weeks, you can continue to claim if you're still responsible for the child and regularly spending money on them
- For hospital stays abroad, similar principles apply - if the stay is temporary for medical treatment and you remain responsible

Since Oliver has been in hospital for 15 weeks (over 12 weeks), but the mother is still responsible for him, paying for his costs, and this is a temporary hospital stay for specialist treatment with intention to return, she should still be eligible to continue claiming.

Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you should be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit** for Oliver while he's in the USA for hospital treatment.

Here's why:

- You have a child under 16 ✓
- You were responsible for him before he went into hospital ✓
- You're a UK resident ✓
- Although Oliver has been in hospital abroad for more than 12 weeks, you're still responsible for him and regularly spending money on his costs ✓
- His stay is temporary and specifically for medical treatment ✓
- No one else is claiming for him ✓

The key factor is that you continue to be responsible for Oliver and are paying towards his costs while he receives this specialist treatment. The fact that the hospital is abroad rather than in the UK doesn't prevent you from claiming, as long as it's a temporary stay for treatment.

If you haven't already claimed Child Benefit, or if you need to update your existing claim, you should contact the Child Benefit Office to ensure your claim reflects Oliver's current situation.

2026-01-29T11:15:32.524721 [actor]: Thank you so much, that's really helpful to know. It's been such a worrying time with Oliver being so far away, so it's a relief to hear I can continue to receive the Child Benefit. I appreciate you taking the time to go through everything with me.

2026-01-29T11:15:36.098983 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I remain eligible for Child Benefit despite my son being in hospital abroad for over 12 weeks, correctly applying the rule that eligibility continues when the parent remains responsible for the child and regularly spends money on them during a temporary hospital stay for medical treatment.
