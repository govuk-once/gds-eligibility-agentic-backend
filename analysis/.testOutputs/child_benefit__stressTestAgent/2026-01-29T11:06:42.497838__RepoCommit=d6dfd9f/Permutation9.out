2026-01-29T11:10:42.368378 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T11:10:44.039652 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, he's 5 years old.

2026-01-29T11:10:45.901681 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Does your son live with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T11:10:47.535427 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me.

2026-01-29T11:10:49.549878 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Next, I need to ask: Are you responsible for your son? By this I mean, do you provide for his day-to-day care and needs?

2026-01-29T11:10:51.160925 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm responsible for him and take care of all his day-to-day needs.

2026-01-29T11:10:52.809683 [root_agent]: Excellent. Now I need to ask about your residency status.

Are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-29T11:10:54.466917 [actor]: Yes, I'm living in the UK. I moved here recently from Germany.

2026-01-29T11:10:56.823031 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you moved from Germany, I need to understand your immigration status a bit better.

Do you have the right to reside in the UK? For example, do you have settled status, pre-settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another type of visa or permission that allows you to live here?

2026-01-29T11:10:58.478175 [actor]: Yes, I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme.

2026-01-29T11:11:00.833193 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. One more important question about your son:

Is your son currently in hospital or in any form of local authority care (such as foster care or a children's home)?

2026-01-29T11:11:02.293170 [actor]: No, he's not in hospital or in any form of care. He lives with me at home.

2026-01-29T11:11:05.603927 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

Based on the information you've provided:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 5-year-old son)
✓ He lives with you
✓ You are responsible for him and his day-to-day care
✓ You're living in the UK
✓ You have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme (which gives you the right to reside in the UK)
✓ Your son is not in hospital or local authority care

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

You should be able to claim Child Benefit for your son. You can make a claim through the UK government's Child Benefit system. 

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-29T11:11:11.152387 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, including verifying that the claimant has a child under 16, the child lives with them, they are responsible for the child, they live in the UK with Pre-Settled Status (which provides the right to reside), and the child is not in hospital or care. The determination of eligibility is correct based on the information provided.
