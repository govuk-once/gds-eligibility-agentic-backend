2026-01-29T11:15:38.550599 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:15:40.623974 [actor]: Yes, I have two children - they're 8 and 10 years old.

2026-01-29T11:15:43.619915 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for the child or children? This means - do they live with you, or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent in kind) towards looking after them?**

2026-01-29T11:15:45.276258 [actor]: Yes, they live with me. Both my children live with me and my wife.

2026-01-29T11:15:46.926688 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question:

**Do you or your wife normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:15:49.405835 [actor]: No, we don't live in the UK. I'm currently posted to Germany with the British Armed Forces - I'm a Major in the army. My wife and both children live with me here on the base in Germany.

2026-01-29T11:15:52.267943 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that - this is important information.

Since you're serving in the British Armed Forces and posted abroad, there are special provisions that may apply to you.

Let me ask:

**Are you subject to UK legislation for social security purposes? In other words, are you paying UK National Insurance contributions while you're serving in Germany?**

2026-01-29T11:15:54.305760 [actor]: Yes, I am. As a member of the British Armed Forces, I continue to pay UK National Insurance contributions even though I'm posted here in Germany.

2026-01-29T11:15:58.322250 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

✓ You have two children aged 8 and 10 (both under 16)
✓ The children live with you, so you are responsible for them
✓ You are paying UK National Insurance contributions while serving abroad with the British Armed Forces

**Good news! You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Even though you don't normally live in the UK, members of the British Armed Forces who are subject to UK legislation for social security purposes (which includes paying UK National Insurance) can claim Child Benefit for their children, even when posted abroad.

Since both children live with you, you would typically be the one to claim (though your wife could also claim as she lives with the children too - only one of you can claim for each child).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-29T11:16:02.168989 [actor]: That's brilliant, thank you! That's very helpful to know. I appreciate you taking the time to explain how it works for us in the Armed Forces serving overseas.

2026-01-29T11:16:04.697254 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a UK Armed Forces member posted abroad who pays UK National Insurance contributions is eligible for Child Benefit for their children living with them, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible" and corresponds to the special provisions for Armed Forces personnel under UK Child Benefit rules.
