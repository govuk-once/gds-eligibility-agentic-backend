2026-01-29T11:16:06.902116 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Are you responsible for bringing up a child who is under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:16:09.736455 [actor]: I'm claiming for my son Dev. He's been studying full-time for his A-levels, but he just turned 20 last week. I've been receiving Child Benefit for him while he's been in education, but I'm not sure if I can still claim now that he's 20?

2026-01-29T11:16:12.105608 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is an important question about the age limit for Child Benefit when a child is in education.

Let me ask you a clarifying question: **Is Dev still enrolled in and attending his approved full-time education or training course (his A-levels)?**

This is important because the eligibility rules change once a young person turns 20.

2026-01-29T11:16:14.397028 [actor]: Yes, he's still enrolled and attending his A-level course. He's right in the middle of his studies - he won't finish until June. He's been doing really well and is on track to complete everything, but I'm worried about whether I can still get Child Benefit for him now that he's turned 20.

2026-01-29T11:16:17.556837 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I need to give you some important news about this situation.

**Unfortunately, Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 20, even if they are still in approved education or training.**

This means that your Child Benefit for Dev would have ended when he turned 20 last week, despite the fact that he is still enrolled in and attending his A-level course and won't finish until June.

The age limit of 20 is a firm cut-off point for Child Benefit eligibility, regardless of whether the education or training course is ongoing.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to help clarify?

2026-01-29T11:16:20.208366 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but thank you for clarifying that for me. So even though he's still studying and will finish his A-levels in a few months, the benefit stops as soon as he turned 20. I understand now. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T11:16:24.307498 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately informed me that Child Benefit eligibility ceases when the young person turns 20, even though my son Dev is still enrolled in full-time A-level education, which aligns with the expected outcome that eligibility ends on the 20th birthday.
