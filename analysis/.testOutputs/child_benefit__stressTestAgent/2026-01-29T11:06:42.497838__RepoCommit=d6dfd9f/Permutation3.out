2026-01-29T11:07:37.601098 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:07:39.418479 [actor]: Yes, I am. My son Ben is 17. He left school back in June, but he's registered with the local youth careers service and is actively looking for an apprenticeship right now.

2026-01-29T11:07:41.319383 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about Ben. That's helpful context.

Let me ask you the next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:07:42.673667 [actor]: Yes, I do live in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:07:44.618035 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Is Ben living with you, or if not, are you contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards his upkeep?**

2026-01-29T11:07:45.993602 [actor]: Yes, Ben lives with me.

2026-01-29T11:07:47.665278 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: **Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Ben?**

2026-01-29T11:07:49.370889 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Ben.

2026-01-29T11:07:51.949804 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: **Are you or your partner's individual income over £60,000 per year?**

(This is important because if either you or your partner earns over £60,000, you may have to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge, though you can still claim it.)

2026-01-29T11:07:53.705317 [actor]: No, my income is under £60,000.

2026-01-29T11:07:58.481690 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Ben. Here's why:

✓ You're responsible for a child (Ben, age 17)
✓ Ben has left education but is registered with a careers service and actively looking for an apprenticeship, which counts as approved education or training
✓ You live in the UK
✓ Ben lives with you
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him
✓ Your income is under £60,000, so you won't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge

**Important note about Ben's situation:** Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training. Being registered with a careers service and actively seeking an apprenticeship should qualify, but this eligibility will typically need to be reviewed, and Ben would need to remain in approved education or training to continue qualifying past age 16.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for Ben. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your eligibility?

2026-01-29T11:08:04.331519 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit since their 17-year-old son Ben is registered with a careers service and actively seeking an apprenticeship, which qualifies as approved education or training for young people aged 16-19, and all other eligibility criteria were met.
