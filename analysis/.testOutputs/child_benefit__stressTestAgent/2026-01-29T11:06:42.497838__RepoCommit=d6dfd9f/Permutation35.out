2026-01-29T11:24:40.910599 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:24:42.789573 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. I have a son, Rashid, he's 17 years old and he's currently doing his A-Levels, so he's in full-time education.

2026-01-29T11:24:44.638618 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that Rashid is 17 and doing his A-Levels.

My next question is:

**Is Rashid living with you, or does he live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T11:24:46.711444 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me and his mother - we're his parents. He's living in our house.

2026-01-29T11:24:51.475095 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

My next question is:

**Are you responsible for Rashid? By this I mean, do you look after him and are you paying for things that he needs, such as food, clothes, or other essentials?**

2026-01-29T11:24:53.682470 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. We support him - we provide his food, clothes, and everything he needs. He's still dependent on us.

2026-01-29T11:24:56.017577 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now, an important question:

**Do you or your partner normally live in the UK? This includes England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.**

2026-01-29T11:24:57.358514 [actor]: Yes, we live in the UK. We're residents here.

2026-01-29T11:24:59.376659 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you.

One more question to complete my assessment:

**Is Rashid currently in hospital or in local authority care for more than 12 weeks (or expected to be)?**

2026-01-29T11:25:00.972913 [actor]: No, he's not in hospital or in care. He lives at home with us.

2026-01-29T11:25:04.517966 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You have a child (Rashid) who is 17 years old and in approved full-time education (A-Levels), which means he qualifies as he's under 20 and in approved education or training

2. ✓ Rashid lives with you

3. ✓ You are responsible for him - you look after him and pay for his needs

4. ✓ You normally live in the UK

5. ✓ Rashid is not in hospital or care for an extended period

You meet the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. You should be able to apply for this benefit if you haven't already done so.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T11:25:07.004597 [actor]: Oh that's great to hear, thank you! Just to make sure though - does it make any difference that Rashid recently got married? His wife is 17 too and she's moved in with us. Does that affect anything?

2026-01-29T11:25:11.201794 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, you cannot get Child Benefit for a child who is married or in a civil partnership, even if they are under 20 and in approved education. The agent failed to ask about this critical eligibility criterion and gave an incorrect determination of eligibility when the user revealed Rashid was married.
