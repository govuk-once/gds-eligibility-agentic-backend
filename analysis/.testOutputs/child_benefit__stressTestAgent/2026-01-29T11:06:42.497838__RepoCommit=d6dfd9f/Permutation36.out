2026-01-29T11:25:12.906345 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T11:25:15.365996 [actor]: Hello! Yes, I do. My daughter Kelly is 16. She just finished her GCSEs in June and she's been accepted into college to start her A-levels in September. But I'm a bit worried because she's not actually in school right now - it's August, so she's on her summer break. Does that affect my Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:25:18.608285 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that Kelly is 16, has finished her GCSEs, and will be starting A-levels in September.

The summer break between finishing GCSEs and starting college shouldn't affect your Child Benefit, as she's continuing in approved education.

Now, let me ask you: Are you responsible for Kelly? By this, I mean do you live with her and are you responsible for her day-to-day care and upbringing?

2026-01-29T11:25:21.790798 [actor]: Yes, I am. Kelly lives with me and I'm responsible for all her day-to-day care - I provide for her, look after her, and support her with everything she needs. That's why I wanted to make sure about the Child Benefit during this summer gap. It's a relief to hear that the break between her GCSEs and A-levels shouldn't be a problem!

2026-01-29T11:25:24.820563 [root_agent]: That's great to hear that Kelly lives with you and you're responsible for her care.

Now, let me ask you an important question about your residency status: Are you living in the UK, and do you have the right to claim benefits in the UK? This includes being a UK citizen, having settled status, or having another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits.

2026-01-29T11:25:26.518764 [actor]: Yes, I'm living in the UK and I'm a UK citizen, so I have the right to claim benefits here. We've lived here all our lives.

2026-01-29T11:25:28.412983 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Now, one final important question: Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Kelly? For example, another parent, guardian, or anyone else who might also be responsible for her?

2026-01-29T11:25:30.354387 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Kelly. It's just me - I'm her mother and she lives with me full-time. No one else is claiming for her.

2026-01-29T11:25:34.765897 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions so clearly.

Based on the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit** for Kelly. Here's why:

✓ **Age requirement**: Kelly is 16 and continuing in approved education (A-levels), which means Child Benefit can continue until she turns 20, as long as she remains in approved education or training.

✓ **Responsibility**: You live with Kelly and are responsible for her day-to-day care and upbringing.

✓ **Residency**: You're a UK citizen living in the UK with the right to claim benefits.

✓ **No duplicate claims**: No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Kelly.

✓ **Education continuity**: The summer break between finishing GCSEs and starting A-levels doesn't affect your eligibility - this is considered a normal gap in education.

You meet all the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. If you're not already claiming it, you can apply, or if you're already receiving it, it should continue as long as Kelly remains in approved education or training until she turns 20.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:25:37.591168 [actor]: Oh that's wonderful news, thank you so much! I was really worried about that summer gap, so I'm relieved to hear it's all fine. No, I think you've answered all my questions - you've been very helpful!

2026-01-29T11:25:41.011160 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria including the continuation of Child Benefit during the summer break between GCSEs and A-levels for a 16-year-old in approved education, and provided correct information throughout the conversation.
