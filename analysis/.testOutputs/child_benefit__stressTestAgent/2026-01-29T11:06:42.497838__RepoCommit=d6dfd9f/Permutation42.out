2026-01-29T11:29:58.394648 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:30:00.081140 [actor]: Yes, I'm asking about my daughter Sian. She's 17 and lives with me here in Cardiff.

2026-01-29T11:30:02.475461 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Sian is 17 and lives with you, I need to ask:

**Is Sian currently in approved education or training?**

(This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or home education that started before she turned 16)

2026-01-29T11:30:04.103610 [actor]: Yes, she's doing a Foundation Apprenticeship. She just started it after leaving school - it's funded by the Welsh Government.

2026-01-29T11:30:06.893642 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to clarify something important about Sian's Foundation Apprenticeship.

**Is Sian receiving a government training allowance or salary as part of her Foundation Apprenticeship?**

This is important because approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes typically includes courses where the young person is not paid, such as A-levels or unpaid training courses, but generally does not include apprenticeships where they receive a wage or training allowance.

2026-01-29T11:30:08.493547 [actor]: Yes, she does get a training allowance as part of the apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T11:30:12.561357 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Unfortunately, I need to inform you that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sian** under these circumstances.

Here's why: Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training. However, approved education or training does **not** include situations where the young person is:
- Paid through an apprenticeship
- Receiving a training allowance
- In paid work for 24 hours or more per week

Since Sian is receiving a training allowance as part of her Foundation Apprenticeship, this would not qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes, even though it's a valuable educational program.

Your Child Benefit for Sian would typically have ended when she left full-time non-advanced education (usually school or college where she wasn't being paid).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T11:30:17.923479 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are specifically listed as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes, regardless of whether a training allowance is paid. The agent incorrectly excluded paid apprenticeships from eligibility when Foundation Apprenticeships are explicitly approved.
