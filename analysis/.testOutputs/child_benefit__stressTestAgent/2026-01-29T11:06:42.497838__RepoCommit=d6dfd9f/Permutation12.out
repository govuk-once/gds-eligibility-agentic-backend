2026-01-29T11:12:21.533038 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T11:12:23.715043 [actor]: I'm 18 and I live with my mum. I'm doing my A-levels at the moment. I was wondering if she can still claim Child Benefit for me, or if I can claim it myself?

2026-01-29T11:12:26.022404 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me help clarify the situation.

To better assess this, I need to ask: Are you responsible for any children yourself, or are you asking specifically about whether your mum can continue to claim Child Benefit for you while you're doing your A-levels?

2026-01-29T11:12:28.283536 [actor]: No, I don't have any children myself. I'm asking about whether my mum can still get Child Benefit for me. I'm 18, doing my A-levels, and I live with her. But I should mention - I'm claiming Universal Credit in my own right to help with my living costs.

2026-01-29T11:12:30.583239 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me ask an important question about your A-levels:

Are your A-levels considered "approved education or training"? Specifically, are you studying full-time (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience)?

2026-01-29T11:12:32.840403 [actor]: Yes, I'm doing full-time A-levels. It's definitely more than 12 hours a week - I'm at college most weekdays with classes and coursework.

2026-01-29T11:12:35.228314 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now I need to ask: Does your mum currently live with you and is she the person primarily responsible for you (meaning she provides for your day-to-day care and financial support)?

2026-01-29T11:12:37.603072 [actor]: Yes, I live with my mum and she's the one who looks after me. I'm estranged from my dad, so it's just me and mum at home.

2026-01-29T11:12:39.688778 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me ask one more important question:

When you say you're claiming Universal Credit in your own right - are you claiming this as a single person for yourself, or are you part of your mum's Universal Credit claim (if she has one)?

2026-01-29T11:12:41.966059 [actor]: I'm claiming Universal Credit as a single person, in my own right. It's my own claim, not part of my mum's - I needed it to help with my personal living costs while I'm studying.

2026-01-29T11:12:47.078370 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Based on the information you've provided, here's the situation:

**Your mum should still be eligible to claim Child Benefit for you** because:

- You are 18 and in full-time approved education (A-levels, more than 12 hours per week)
- You live with your mum
- She is responsible for you

Child Benefit can continue until you turn 20, as long as you remain in approved education or training.

**However**, there is an important consideration: The fact that you are claiming Universal Credit in your own right as a single person may affect the situation. When a young person claims benefits in their own right, this can sometimes impact whether they're still considered a "qualifying young person" for Child Benefit purposes, as it may indicate they're responsible for themselves rather than being someone else's dependent.

Your mum should contact the Child Benefit Office directly to confirm her ongoing eligibility given your specific circumstances with Universal Credit. They can provide definitive guidance on whether your UC claim affects her Child Benefit entitlement.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?

2026-01-29T11:12:49.527705 [actor]: Oh, I see. So it might affect it then? That's a bit worrying. Do you know if there's a specific rule about Universal Credit affecting Child Benefit, or is it just something that needs checking? I want to make sure my mum doesn't lose out on money she's entitled to.

2026-01-29T11:12:55.882568 [root_agent]: That's a very good question, and I appreciate your concern for making sure your mum gets what she's entitled to.

I need to be honest with you - based on the eligibility criteria I have access to, I cannot find a specific rule that directly addresses whether claiming Universal Credit in your own right automatically disqualifies you as a "qualifying young person" for Child Benefit purposes. The eligibility rules focus on age, education status, and living arrangements, which you meet.

However, claiming benefits in your own right could potentially be interpreted as you being financially independent or responsible for yourself, which might conflict with the principle that your mum is responsible for you. This is why it's a grey area that needs clarification.

**My strong recommendation is that your mum should:**
- Contact the Child Benefit Office directly (0300 200 3100) to explain the specific situation
- Make it clear that you're 18, in full-time education, living with her, and she supports you, BUT you also claim UC in your own right
- Ask them explicitly whether your UC claim affects her Child Benefit entitlement

They will be able to give definitive guidance based on the most current rules and your exact circumstances. It's better to check now rather than risk any issues later.

Does that help clarify things?

2026-01-29T11:12:58.634495 [actor]: Yes, that makes sense. Thanks for being honest about it. I'll let my mum know she needs to call them to check. Just to be clear though - based on what you know, if I wasn't claiming Universal Credit, she would definitely still be eligible for Child Benefit for me since I'm 18 and doing A-levels full-time?

2026-01-29T11:13:03.518219 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. Based on the eligibility criteria, **if you weren't claiming Universal Credit**, your mum would be eligible for Child Benefit for you because:

1. **Age requirement**: You're 18, which is under 20
2. **Education requirement**: You're in full-time approved education (A-levels, more than 12 hours per week)
3. **Responsibility**: Your mum is responsible for you and you live with her

Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 (up until they turn 20) as long as they remain in approved education or training. Your A-levels qualify as approved education.

So without the Universal Credit complication, this would be straightforward - she would be eligible.

The Universal Credit claim is the only factor that introduces uncertainty, which is why getting confirmation from the Child Benefit Office is important.

Is there anything else you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T11:13:05.658467 [actor]: No, that's really helpful. I understand now - I'll definitely get my mum to call the Child Benefit Office to check about the Universal Credit situation. Thanks for your help!

2026-01-29T11:13:10.055031 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent appropriately identified that the mother would normally be eligible for Child Benefit given the child is 18, in full-time approved education (A-levels), and living with her, but correctly flagged uncertainty about how the child's independent Universal Credit claim might affect this, and recommended contacting the Child Benefit Office for clarification - which is the prudent approach given this edge case scenario.
