2026-01-29T11:21:13.641796 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:21:15.106593 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a baby girl named Mia.

2026-01-29T11:21:16.840332 [root_agent]: That's lovely! Congratulations on your baby girl Mia.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:21:18.261320 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK with my parents.

2026-01-29T11:21:20.794292 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question:

**Are you the person responsible for Mia? This means - are you the main person looking after her and meeting the costs of raising her (such as buying food, clothes, and other necessities)?**

2026-01-29T11:21:22.270405 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for Mia. I'm her mum and I look after her.

2026-01-29T11:21:23.731737 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question:

**Does Mia live with you?**

2026-01-29T11:21:25.141819 [actor]: Yes, she lives with me at my parents' house.

2026-01-29T11:21:26.668978 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question:

**Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for Mia?**

2026-01-29T11:21:28.181807 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Mia.

2026-01-29T11:21:32.294874 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Mia because:

✓ You have a child under 16 (Mia)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are responsible for Mia
✓ Mia lives with you
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for Mia. 

**One additional point to be aware of:** If you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 a year, you may need to pay some or all of the Child Benefit back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge. However, you can still claim it and choose not to receive the payments if you prefer.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:21:38.251594 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user meets all the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit (has a child under 16, lives in the UK, is responsible for the child, child lives with them, and no one else is claiming) and appropriately mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge consideration for households with income over £60,000.
