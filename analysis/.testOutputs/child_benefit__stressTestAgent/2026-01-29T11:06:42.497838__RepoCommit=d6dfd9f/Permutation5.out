2026-01-29T11:08:23.367033 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:08:24.965723 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. I have a son, Lucas, he's 10 years old.

2026-01-29T11:08:26.691787 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know you have a 10-year-old son, Lucas.

My next question is:

**Does Lucas normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T11:08:28.334564 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me. He lives with his ex-wife, Jenny. But I do contribute financially towards his upkeep - I transfer £150 a month to Jenny specifically for Lucas's food and clothes.

2026-01-29T11:08:31.092863 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. This is an important detail for eligibility.

Let me ask you this:

**Do you contribute an amount equal to or more than the Child Benefit rate towards Lucas's upkeep?**

For context, the current Child Benefit rate is £25.60 per week (£102.40 per month) for the eldest or only child, and £16.95 per week for any additional children.

2026-01-29T11:08:33.022205 [actor]: Yes, I contribute £150 per month, which is more than the Child Benefit rate of about £102 per month.

2026-01-29T11:08:35.197484 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now, an important question:

**Is Jenny (Lucas's mother who he lives with) claiming Child Benefit for Lucas, or do you know if anyone else is claiming it for him?**

2026-01-29T11:08:36.926522 [actor]: No, Jenny is not claiming Child Benefit for Lucas. As far as I know, nobody else is claiming it for him either.

2026-01-29T11:08:39.567777 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

I have one more important question:

**Are you and Lucas both living in the UK (or do you meet the residency requirements such as being subject to UK immigration control with the right to reside, or being a Crown servant or member of HM Forces posted overseas)?**

2026-01-29T11:08:41.027633 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. I meet the residency requirements.

2026-01-29T11:08:44.609971 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

**Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Lucas.**

Here's why:

✓ Lucas is under 16 (he's 10 years old)
✓ You contribute at least the Child Benefit rate towards his upkeep (£150 per month, which exceeds the £102.40 monthly rate)
✓ No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucas
✓ You both live in the UK and meet residency requirements

Even though Lucas doesn't live with you, you can still claim Child Benefit because you're contributing an amount equal to or more than the Child Benefit rate towards his care.

**Important note:** Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. Since you contribute more than the Child Benefit rate and no one else is claiming it, you have the right to claim.

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or the claiming process?

2026-01-29T11:08:50.245443 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit because they contribute more than the Child Benefit rate (£150 vs £102.40 per month) towards their child's upkeep, no one else is claiming it, the child is under 16, and both meet UK residency requirements - which aligns with the rules for non-resident parents claiming Child Benefit.
