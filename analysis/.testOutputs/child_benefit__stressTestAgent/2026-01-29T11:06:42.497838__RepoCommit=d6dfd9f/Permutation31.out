2026-01-29T11:22:52.740475 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:22:54.988031 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter who's 18. She's just started university actually - a 3-year Bachelor's degree. She still lives at home with me and commutes to uni every day.

2026-01-29T11:22:57.889687 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

**Is your daughter's university course an approved full-time education course, and is she enrolled in further education (not higher education)?**

I ask this because Child Benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds typically applies to those in approved education or training that counts as further education, rather than higher education courses like university degrees.

2026-01-29T11:23:00.229495 [actor]: Well, it's a full-time course, yes - a Bachelor's degree at university. She's doing a 3-year undergraduate degree. I'm not sure what the difference is between further and higher education though? She just finished college and went straight to university this year.

2026-01-29T11:23:05.502938 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me explain the distinction, as it's important for Child Benefit eligibility.

**Further education** typically refers to courses like A-levels, T-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs, and similar qualifications that are studied at school sixth forms or colleges.

**Higher education** refers to university-level courses like Bachelor's degrees, which is what your daughter is studying.

Unfortunately, Child Benefit generally only continues for young people aged 16-19 who are in **approved further education or training**, not higher education (university degrees). Since your daughter is 18 and studying for a Bachelor's degree at university, this would typically count as higher education.

However, let me ask one more question to be thorough:

**Did your daughter turn 20 years old before 31 August of this year, or is she still 18 or 19?**

This matters because Child Benefit can continue until the 31st of August following a young person's 19th birthday if they were in approved education, but the type of education matters too.

2026-01-29T11:23:08.630468 [actor]: She's still 18 - she won't turn 19 until next year. So she's definitely under 20. 

But are you saying that even though she's under 20 and in full-time education, I can't get Child Benefit just because it's university rather than college? That seems a bit odd - she's still my dependent, still living at home, and I'm still supporting her financially.

2026-01-29T11:23:13.896143 [root_agent]: I understand your concern, and I can see why this distinction might seem frustrating when you're still supporting your daughter financially while she lives at home.

However, based on the eligibility rules, Child Benefit for young people aged 16-19 (up until the 31st of August after their 19th birthday) does specifically apply to those in **approved education or training** - which refers to further education courses, not higher education/university degrees.

The government makes this distinction, and university Bachelor's degrees fall under higher education, which means they don't qualify for the extension of Child Benefit beyond age 16-19 in the same way that further education courses do.

**So to confirm: Based on the information you've provided, you would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for your 18-year-old daughter while she's studying her university degree, as university-level courses are classified as higher education rather than approved further education or training.**

However, if there are any other children in your household who are under 16, or aged 16-19 and in approved further education or training (not university), you may still be eligible for Child Benefit for them.

**Do you have any other children under 16, or aged 16-19 in further education (like A-levels or similar)?**

2026-01-29T11:23:16.367738 [actor]: No, Emma is my only child. 

So just to be clear - I'm not eligible for Child Benefit for her anymore, even though she's only 18 and still living at home with me? That's quite disappointing, but I understand what you're saying about the rules.

Thank you for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T11:23:20.018697 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit does not continue for children aged 16-19 who are in higher education (university degrees), as it only applies to those in approved further education or training, and correctly concluded that I am not eligible.
