2026-01-29T11:24:14.880629 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T11:24:16.361176 [actor]: Yes, I have a son. He's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T11:24:18.099081 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Does your son normally live with you, or is he living with someone else?

2026-01-29T11:24:20.030371 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me at the moment. He's been in a youth custody center for the past 10 weeks. He got a 6 month sentence.

2026-01-29T11:24:22.067329 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this must be a difficult situation.

Let me ask you: Before your son went into the youth custody center, was he living with you?

2026-01-29T11:24:23.684925 [actor]: Yes, he was living with me before he went into custody, and I was claiming Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-29T11:24:25.782721 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now, an important question: Has your son been in the youth custody center for more than 12 weeks continuously, or will he be there for more than 12 weeks in total?

2026-01-29T11:24:27.909337 [actor]: He's been there for 10 weeks so far, so not 12 weeks yet. But his sentence is for 6 months total, so yes, he will be there for more than 12 weeks.

2026-01-29T11:24:32.378126 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's very helpful to understand your situation.

Based on the rules around Child Benefit, I need to inform you that:

**You can continue to claim Child Benefit while your son is in youth custody, but only for the first 12 weeks.** After 12 weeks of continuous detention in a custodial institution, you will no longer be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him.

Since your son has been there for 10 weeks so far, you should still be receiving Child Benefit now. However, once he reaches 12 weeks in custody (which will be in about 2 weeks' time), your Child Benefit will stop.

If your son is released before completing the full 6-month sentence, you would be able to reclaim Child Benefit for him again once he returns to live with you.

Do you have any questions about this, or is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-29T11:24:35.284368 [actor]: Oh, I see. So I can still get it for another 2 weeks until he hits the 12 week mark, but then it stops. That makes sense, thank you for explaining that to me. I didn't realize there was that 12 week rule for custody. At least now I know what to expect.

2026-01-29T11:24:38.905237 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can continue for the first 12 weeks of youth custody but stops after 12 weeks of continuous detention, which aligns with the UK government rules on Child Benefit for children in custody.
