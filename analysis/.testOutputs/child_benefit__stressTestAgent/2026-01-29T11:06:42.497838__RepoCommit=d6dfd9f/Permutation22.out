2026-01-29T11:18:11.532174 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:18:13.264802 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Arthur, who's 7 years old.

2026-01-29T11:18:15.262636 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does your son Arthur normally live with you, or do you have primary responsibility for him?**

2026-01-29T11:18:17.404868 [actor]: Well, normally yes, he lives with me. But he's been in hospital for quite some time now. He was in for 10 weeks, then came home for 2 weeks, but then he had to go back in. He's been back in hospital for 3 weeks now.

2026-01-29T11:18:19.438469 [root_agent]: I'm sorry to hear that Arthur has been unwell. Thank you for sharing that information.

Let me ask you this: **During the time Arthur has been in hospital, has the NHS been paying for the full cost of his accommodation and treatment?**

2026-01-29T11:18:21.071896 [actor]: Yes, the NHS has been covering everything - his accommodation and all his treatment while he's been in hospital.

2026-01-29T11:18:22.797478 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **When Arthur was in hospital for those first 10 weeks, did you continue to receive Child Benefit payments during that time?**

2026-01-29T11:18:24.564087 [actor]: Yes, I did continue receiving Child Benefit during that first hospital stay.

2026-01-29T11:18:26.415171 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful to know.

Now, an important question: **Have you received any notification from the Child Benefit Office about your payments stopping, or are you concerned because you haven't received a recent payment?**

2026-01-29T11:18:28.454614 [actor]: I haven't received any notification, but I'm just concerned about whether I should still be eligible now, given how long Arthur has been in hospital overall.

2026-01-29T11:18:30.709045 [root_agent]: I understand your concern. Let me ask you one more important question to assess your situation:

**When Arthur came home for those 2 weeks between his hospital stays, was that considered his normal home, and was he living with you during that time?**

2026-01-29T11:18:33.103846 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. He came back home to live with me during those 2 weeks. It was his normal home - where he always lives when he's not in hospital.

2026-01-29T11:18:38.039199 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me give you some guidance based on your circumstances.

**You should still be eligible for Child Benefit for Arthur.**

Here's why:

According to the rules, when a child is in hospital and the NHS is paying for their accommodation and treatment, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **12 weeks** from when the child goes into hospital.

However - and this is important for your situation - **if your child comes home for at least one night, the 12-week period starts again from the date they go back into hospital.**

In your case:
- Arthur was in hospital for 10 weeks
- He then came home and lived with you for 2 weeks
- He's now been back in hospital for 3 weeks

Because Arthur came home for 2 weeks, when he went back into hospital, the 12-week period started again. So you're currently only 3 weeks into this new 12-week period, which means you remain eligible for Child Benefit.

**Do you have any questions about this, or is there anything else you'd like me to clarify?**

2026-01-29T11:18:40.288537 [actor]: Oh, that's a relief! Thank you so much for explaining that. So just to make sure I understand correctly - because he came home for those 2 weeks, the clock sort of reset when he went back in?

2026-01-29T11:18:44.841229 [root_agent]: **Yes, exactly right!** You've understood it perfectly.

Because Arthur came home and lived with you for those 2 weeks (even just one night would have been enough), the 12-week period "reset" or started fresh when he went back into hospital for this second stay.

So even though he's had quite a long time in hospital overall, what matters is that this current hospital stay has only been 3 weeks, which is well within the 12-week limit.

You should continue to receive Child Benefit as long as this current hospital stay doesn't exceed 12 weeks. And if Arthur comes home again, even briefly, and then needs to return to hospital, the clock would reset again.

I hope Arthur recovers soon. **Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit or any other questions?**

2026-01-29T11:18:46.863369 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you so much for your help - you've really put my mind at ease!

2026-01-29T11:18:50.900248 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rule that when a child comes home for at least one night between hospital stays, the 12-week eligibility period resets, meaning the user remains eligible as the current stay is only 3 weeks into a new 12-week period.
