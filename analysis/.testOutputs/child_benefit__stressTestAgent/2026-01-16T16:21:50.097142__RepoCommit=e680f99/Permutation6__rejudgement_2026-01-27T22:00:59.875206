The agent correctly determined that the parent would be eligible for Child Benefit despite the child being in hospital for 14 weeks, as the parent demonstrates continued responsibility by visiting daily and spending money regularly on the child's upkeep, which qualifies for the exception to the 12-week hospital stay rule.
