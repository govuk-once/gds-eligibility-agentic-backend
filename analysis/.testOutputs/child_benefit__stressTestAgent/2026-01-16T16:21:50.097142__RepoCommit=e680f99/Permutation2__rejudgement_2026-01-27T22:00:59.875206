The agent correctly determined the user's eligibility for Child Benefit, providing accurate information about the eligibility criteria and correctly concluding that Amit is eligible as he has a 17-year-old daughter studying A-levels who lives with him, his income is below the £60,000 threshold, and they are UK residents.
