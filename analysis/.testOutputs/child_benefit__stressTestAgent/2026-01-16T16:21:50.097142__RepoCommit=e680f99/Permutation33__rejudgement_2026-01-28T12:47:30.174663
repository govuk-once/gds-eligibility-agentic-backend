2026-01-28T12:55:20.050088 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly concluded the user was eligible for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome was "Not Eligible." According to eligibility criteria, education or training that is paid for by an employer does not qualify as "approved" education/training for Child Benefit purposes, making Bella ineligible.
