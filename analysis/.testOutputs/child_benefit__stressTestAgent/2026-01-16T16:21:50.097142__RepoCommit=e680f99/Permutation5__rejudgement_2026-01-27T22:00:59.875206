2026-01-27T22:09:40.584253 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly determined the outcome as ineligible when the expected outcome should have been "Eligible." According to UK Child Benefit rules, a non-resident parent who contributes more than the Child Benefit amount (£150 vs £113/month) can qualify under the "contributing to upkeep" exception, even when not living with the child.
