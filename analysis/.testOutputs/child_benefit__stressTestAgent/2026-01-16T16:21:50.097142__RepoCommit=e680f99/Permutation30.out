2026-01-16T16:33:52.156122 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK rules. Let me ask you questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:33:53.204194 [actor]: looking for child benefit have 2 kids

2026-01-16T16:33:54.679611 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I'll help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit for your two children.

To continue with my assessment, may I ask: Are both of your children either under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:33:55.515443 [actor]: yes both under 16 live with me and wife

2026-01-16T16:33:57.106266 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand both your children are under 16 and live with you and your wife.

Are you or your wife responsible for the children's care? By this I mean providing a home for them and arranging and paying for their food, clothes, and other essentials.

2026-01-16T16:33:57.781566 [actor]: yes take care of them

2026-01-16T16:33:58.859887 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you take care of your children. 

Do both you and your children live in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:33:59.598371 [actor]: uk yes we live here

2026-01-16T16:34:00.958513 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you and your children live in the UK.

Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control or have any immigration restrictions on your stay in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:34:01.642653 [actor]: british citizens

2026-01-16T16:34:03.049499 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are British citizens.

Now I need to ask about your household income. Does either you or your wife have an individual income over £50,000 per year before tax?

2026-01-16T16:34:03.896328 [actor]: wife earns 65000 I earn 18000

2026-01-16T16:34:07.717724 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your wife earns £65,000 per year, which is over the £50,000 threshold, this affects your Child Benefit situation.

Based on the information you've provided:

You are eligible to claim Child Benefit, but because your wife's individual income exceeds £60,000 per year, you would need to pay back 100% of the Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge if she claims it.

You have two options:
1. You can claim Child Benefit and pay back the full amount through the tax system (via Self Assessment)
2. You can opt out of receiving payments but still register for Child Benefit to protect your National Insurance credits and your child's National Insurance number

Would you like me to explain more about these options?

2026-01-16T16:34:08.478644 [actor]: who fills out the forms

2026-01-16T16:34:12.418524 [root_agent]: The person who is primarily responsible for the child should fill out the Child Benefit claim forms. This can be either you or your wife - it doesn't have to be the higher earner.

However, since your wife earns over £60,000, whoever claims the benefit will need to consider the High Income Child Benefit Charge. If your wife claims it, she would need to register for Self Assessment (if not already registered) and pay back the full amount through tax. If you claim it and your wife isn't involved in the claim, you would receive the full benefit without needing to pay it back (as your income is under £50,000).

The claim form is called CH2 "Child Benefit claim form" and can be obtained from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

2026-01-16T16:34:13.082124 [actor]: I handle money

2026-01-16T16:34:17.038342 [root_agent]: Since you handle the household finances, you would likely want to be the one to fill out the Child Benefit claim form (CH2). 

As your income is £18,000 (below the £50,000 threshold), if you apply for Child Benefit as the claimant, you would receive the full amount without having to pay any of it back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Your wife, who earns above the threshold, would not need to register for Self Assessment or pay back the benefit if she is not the claimant. This would be simpler from a financial administration perspective.

To claim, you'll need to complete the CH2 form with details about yourself, your children (including their birth certificates), and your bank account information where the payments would be made.

2026-01-16T16:34:18.012656 [actor]: so I get the money but who pays tax

2026-01-16T16:34:22.937362 [root_agent]: Based on how the Child Benefit system works in the UK:

If you claim the Child Benefit (as the person with the lower income), you would receive the payments. 

Regarding the tax implications:
- The High Income Child Benefit Charge applies to the individual with income over £50,000 who either:
  - Claims Child Benefit themselves, or
  - Has a partner who claims Child Benefit

Since your wife's income is £65,000, she would be liable for the High Income Child Benefit Charge even though you would be the one claiming and receiving the benefit. She would need to register for Self Assessment (if not already registered) and declare the Child Benefit that your household receives. She would then need to pay back 100% of the benefit through her tax return.

So to answer directly: you would get the money, but your wife would pay the tax (effectively paying it all back).

2026-01-16T16:34:26.557722 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that while the user is eligible for Child Benefit, since the wife earns over £60,000, 100% of the benefit would need to be paid back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
