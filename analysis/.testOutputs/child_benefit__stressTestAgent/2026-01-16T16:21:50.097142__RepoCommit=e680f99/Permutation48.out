2026-01-16T16:41:20.647003 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-16T16:41:22.849730 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit regarding your daughter who is in college.

How old is your daughter who is attending college?

2026-01-16T16:41:24.179601 [actor]: 18 years old college student

2026-01-16T16:41:25.914244 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is your daughter in approved education, such as A levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other qualifying education? By "approved education," I mean full-time (more than 12 hours a week) non-advanced education or training.

2026-01-16T16:41:26.770999 [actor]: HNC course college not university

2026-01-16T16:41:28.694190 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

An HNC (Higher National Certificate) course is typically considered approved education for Child Benefit purposes if it's non-advanced education.

Is your daughter's HNC course considered non-advanced education (below degree level) and does she attend for more than 12 hours per week of supervised study?

2026-01-16T16:41:29.447573 [actor]: higher national certificate level 4 btec

2026-01-16T16:41:32.627498 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details.

A Higher National Certificate (HNC) at Level 4 BTEC is typically considered advanced education, similar to the first year of a degree. 

For Child Benefit purposes, eligibility typically ends when a child turns 16, but can continue until they're 20 if they remain in "approved education." However, advanced education like HNCs is generally not considered "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes.

Based on this information, you likely wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit for your 18-year-old daughter on a Level 4 HNC course, as this is considered advanced education rather than the non-advanced education that would qualify.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-16T16:41:35.939379 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent was correct in stating that Child Benefit is not available for a child on a Level 4 HNC course as this is considered advanced education, which doesn't qualify for Child Benefit.
