The agent incorrectly stated that being registered with a youth careers service while looking for an apprenticeship counts as "approved education or training." In reality, this scenario qualifies for the Job Seeker Extension which allows Child Benefit to continue for up to 20 weeks after leaving education at age 16-17, but this is different from being in approved education.
