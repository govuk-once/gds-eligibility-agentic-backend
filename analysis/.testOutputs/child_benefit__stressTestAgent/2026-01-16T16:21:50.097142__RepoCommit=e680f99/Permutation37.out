2026-01-16T16:36:53.609852 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:36:54.770949 [actor]: Nina staying with me now. Mother sick.

2026-01-16T16:36:56.017740 [root_agent]: I'll help assess your situation regarding Child Benefit for Nina, who is staying with you due to her mother's illness.

To determine your eligibility, I need to ask: How old is Nina?

2026-01-16T16:36:56.958085 [actor]: She's 10 years old. Living in my house since last month.

2026-01-16T16:36:58.333258 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Nina is 10 years old and living with you, I need to understand a few more details about your situation.

What is your relationship to Nina (are you a relative, family friend, or other)?

2026-01-16T16:36:59.366099 [actor]: Friend of her mother. Known them for years. Not related.

2026-01-16T16:37:01.099844 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your relationship to Nina. You mentioned you're a friend of her mother and not related.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand: Is Nina's stay with you temporary or long-term? And do you have any formal arrangement in place for her care?

2026-01-16T16:37:02.257349 [actor]: Long-term staying. Mother very ill. Council knows about arrangement.

2026-01-16T16:37:03.655863 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Since Nina is staying with you long-term due to her mother's illness, and the local council is aware of this arrangement, I need to understand a bit more about the current Child Benefit situation.

Is Nina's mother currently receiving Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-16T16:37:04.666455 [actor]: Don't know about mother's benefits. She can't care for Nina now.

2026-01-16T16:37:08.018899 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're caring for Nina long-term with the council's knowledge, and her mother is too ill to care for her, you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit.

In situations where a child comes to live with someone else, the person who has the child living with them can claim Child Benefit if:
- They're responsible for the child
- The child lives with them
- They're providing for the child's care

Based on what you've shared, it appears you meet these criteria. However, if Nina's mother is currently receiving Child Benefit for her, only one person can receive the benefit for a child.

Would you like me to explain what steps you would need to take to apply for Child Benefit for Nina?

2026-01-16T16:37:08.931222 [actor]: Payment for taking care of her? Council not giving me money.

2026-01-16T16:37:14.022000 [root_agent]: I understand your concern about financial support for caring for Nina.

Child Benefit is a government payment to help with the costs of raising a child. It's separate from any council support. As you're taking care of Nina long-term while her mother is ill, you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for her.

Child Benefit currently pays:
- £25.60 per week for the first or only child
- £16.95 per week for any additional children

This money would be paid to you regularly (usually every 4 weeks) to help with Nina's care costs.

To claim, you would need to fill out a Child Benefit claim form CH2. You would also need to provide Nina's birth certificate and explain your arrangement as her caregiver.

Would you like to know more about the application process or what documents you might need to support your claim?

2026-01-16T16:37:14.824424 [actor]: Need money for Nina care. How apply?

2026-01-16T16:37:19.490164 [root_agent]: I understand you need financial support for Nina's care. Here's how you can apply for Child Benefit:

1. Get a Child Benefit claim form (CH2):
   - Download and print it from GOV.UK
   - Call the Child Benefit Office to request one by post
   - Pick one up from your local Jobcentre Plus

2. Complete the form with:
   - Your personal details
   - Nina's details
   - Information about your care arrangement
   - Explain that you're caring for her long-term due to her mother's illness
   - Mention that the council is aware of this arrangement

3. You'll need to include Nina's birth certificate with your application (or another official document showing her date of birth)

4. Send the completed form to:
   Child Benefit Office
   Washington
   Newcastle upon Tyne
   NE88 1ZD

The Child Benefit payments would then be made directly to your bank account, typically every 4 weeks.

If you need help filling out the form or have questions during the process, you can contact the Child Benefit helpline on 0300 200 3100.

Would you like me to explain anything else about the application process?

2026-01-16T16:37:20.706452 [actor]: Good. Can get money for Nina care. Will apply.

2026-01-16T16:37:23.407614 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that as a non-relative caring for a child long-term with the council's knowledge, the user is eligible to claim Child Benefit, which aligns with the government guidelines for a person who has responsibility for a child living with them.
