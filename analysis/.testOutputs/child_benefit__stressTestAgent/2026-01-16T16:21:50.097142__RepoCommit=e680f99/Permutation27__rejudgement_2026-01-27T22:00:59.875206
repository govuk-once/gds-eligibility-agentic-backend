The agent initially provided incorrect information by stating Child Benefit claims must be made by someone at least 16 years old, but later corrected this error and confirmed eligibility. The final outcome matched the expected "Eligible (Though potentially financially suboptimal)" assessment, despite the initial misinformation.
