2026-01-16T16:26:04.702827 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:26:06.432392 [actor]: I need to roleplay as a person seeking information about child benefit eligibility. I'll follow the instructions to be obtuse, speak like I'm entering search terms, and not directly answer questions.

child benefit my son lives with me

2026-01-16T16:26:07.538864 [root_agent]: I notice you mentioned your son lives with you. That's helpful information.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask how old your son is?

2026-01-16T16:26:08.317082 [actor]: son 18 years old A-level student

2026-01-16T16:26:10.623127 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that your son is 18 years old and studying A-levels.

Since your son is over 16 but under 20 and in approved education (A-levels qualify as approved education), that meets one of the key criteria for Child Benefit eligibility.

Next, I'd like to ask: are you responsible for your son? By this I mean, do you provide for his care and have main responsibility for him?

2026-01-16T16:26:11.465228 [actor]: live together mother son no father

2026-01-16T16:26:13.479950 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that you live together with your son, and you're his mother, with no father present in the household.

Since you live with your son and appear to have responsibility for him as his mother, that's important for Child Benefit eligibility.

My next question is: do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:26:14.548998 [actor]: uk address london 10 years

2026-01-16T16:26:16.376724 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK - specifically in London for the past 10 years. That meets the UK residency requirement for Child Benefit.

Next, I need to ask about your immigration status. Do you have the right to reside in the UK? This might include being a British citizen, having settled or pre-settled status, or having another immigration status that gives you the right to live in the UK.

2026-01-16T16:26:17.170967 [actor]: british passport born here

2026-01-16T16:26:18.815212 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you were born in the UK and have a British passport. That clearly establishes your right to reside in the UK.

I need to ask about your income situation now. Is your individual income (or your partner's if you have one) over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-16T16:26:19.648486 [actor]: teacher salary normal not rich

2026-01-16T16:26:21.783135 [root_agent]: I understand you're working as a teacher with a normal salary and don't consider yourself rich. 

Based on typical teacher salaries in the UK, it's likely your income is below the £60,000 threshold where Child Benefit starts to be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

One more question: is your son doing full-time A-levels? And is this at a school, college or with an approved education provider?

2026-01-16T16:26:22.492412 [actor]: sixth form college full time student

2026-01-16T16:26:25.748092 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son is a full-time student at a sixth form college.

Based on all the information you've provided, I can now assess your eligibility for Child Benefit:

You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit because:
- Your son is 18 and in approved full-time education (A-levels at a sixth form college)
- You are responsible for him as his mother and live together
- You are a UK resident with the right to reside (British citizen)
- Your income as a teacher is likely below the £60,000 threshold where the benefit begins to be reduced

You can claim Child Benefit until your son finishes his approved education, which in this case would be until he completes his A-levels. If he goes on to higher education like university, Child Benefit would typically stop.

Would you like information on how to claim Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:26:26.563377 [actor]: son gets universal credit own money

2026-01-16T16:26:30.559432 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important information about your son receiving Universal Credit.

This changes the situation regarding Child Benefit. If your son is receiving Universal Credit in his own right, this may affect your eligibility for Child Benefit for him.

Generally, if your son is claiming benefits independently (like Universal Credit), then he would be considered to be supporting himself financially. Child Benefit is typically paid to someone responsible for a child who is dependent on them.

Since your son is 18, in education, but receiving Universal Credit in his own name, you would likely not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for him. When a young person starts claiming benefits in their own right, they're usually considered financially independent for Child Benefit purposes.

Would you like me to provide more information about this situation or discuss any other aspects of benefits you might be eligible for?

2026-01-16T16:26:34.088856 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that if the son is receiving Universal Credit in his own right, the mother would likely not be eligible for Child Benefit as he would be considered financially independent.
