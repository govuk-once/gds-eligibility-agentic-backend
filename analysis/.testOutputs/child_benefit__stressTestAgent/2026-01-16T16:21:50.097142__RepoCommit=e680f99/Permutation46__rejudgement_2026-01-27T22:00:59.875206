2026-01-27T22:09:05.026327 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent did not clearly state the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Expired)." Instead, they described the eligibility as "conditional" and suggested applying anyway, which contradicts the fact that the right to reside as a jobseeker has expired after 91 days without a genuine prospect of work.
