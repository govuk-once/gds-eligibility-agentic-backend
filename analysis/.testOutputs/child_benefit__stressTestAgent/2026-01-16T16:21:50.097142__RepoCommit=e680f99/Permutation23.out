2026-01-16T16:30:39.811810 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:30:41.281737 [actor]: I need to act as a UK resident seeking information about child benefit eligibility. I'll be intentionally obtuse and speak in a search-engine style format without providing clear answers directly.

my child Sarah 12 years old

2026-01-16T16:30:42.634852 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you have a child named Sarah who is 12 years old.

To determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask: Are you responsible for Sarah's upbringing and do you live in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:30:43.614710 [actor]: uk resident daughter not living with me

2026-01-16T16:30:45.570983 [root_agent]: I understand you're a UK resident, but your daughter Sarah doesn't live with you.

This is important for determining your eligibility. Could you tell me who Sarah normally lives with? For example, does she live with another parent, guardian, or in care?

2026-01-16T16:30:46.457675 [actor]: ex wife has her buy groceries clothes every month

2026-01-16T16:30:48.370561 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand Sarah lives with your ex-wife, but you contribute by buying groceries and clothes for her every month.

For Child Benefit purposes, the key question is about main responsibility. Who would you say has the main day-to-day responsibility for caring for Sarah?

2026-01-16T16:30:49.264136 [actor]: ex wife daily care i pay for things

2026-01-16T16:30:52.576501 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that your ex-wife provides the daily care for Sarah, while you contribute financially by paying for things.

Based on UK Child Benefit rules, typically the person who has the main day-to-day responsibility for the child is eligible to claim Child Benefit. Since your ex-wife has this responsibility, she would generally be the eligible person to claim.

However, if you and your ex-wife agree that you should receive the Child Benefit instead (and if she isn't already claiming it), there is a possibility to arrange this. 

May I ask if you and your ex-wife have any formal arrangement regarding Child Benefit for Sarah?

2026-01-16T16:30:53.468379 [actor]: no arrangement just buy her things 120 pounds every 4 weeks

2026-01-16T16:30:56.957467 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you don't have any formal arrangement regarding Child Benefit, but you contribute £120 every 4 weeks to buy things for Sarah.

Based on the UK Child Benefit rules, since your ex-wife has the main day-to-day caring responsibility for Sarah and there's no formal agreement about Child Benefit between you, your ex-wife would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah.

If you wanted to receive the Child Benefit instead, both you and your ex-wife would need to agree to this arrangement, and your ex-wife would need to stop her claim if she's currently claiming.

Would you like to know more about how you might establish a formal arrangement regarding Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your situation?

2026-01-16T16:30:57.721397 [actor]: so am i eligible for child benefit or not

2026-01-16T16:31:01.194888 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, you are not currently eligible to receive Child Benefit for Sarah.

Under UK government rules, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who has main responsibility for the child's day-to-day care. Since Sarah lives with your ex-wife who provides her daily care, your ex-wife would be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit.

Your financial contributions of £120 every 4 weeks, while important for Sarah's wellbeing, do not by themselves establish eligibility for Child Benefit when the child lives with and is primarily cared for by someone else.

If circumstances were to change regarding Sarah's care arrangements, or if you and your ex-wife formally agreed (and notified HMRC) that you should receive the Child Benefit instead, then your eligibility could be reassessed.

2026-01-16T16:31:04.544494 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that since the child lives with the ex-wife who provides daily care, the ex-wife is eligible for Child Benefit, not the inquirer who only provides financial support.
