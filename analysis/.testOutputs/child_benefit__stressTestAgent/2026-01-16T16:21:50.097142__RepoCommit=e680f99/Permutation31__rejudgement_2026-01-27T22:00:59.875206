2026-01-27T22:08:30.570121 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated the user would be eligible for Child Benefit because Emma is in university. According to the expected outcome, Child Benefit stops when a child starts "advanced" education such as a university degree, which is Emma's situation.
