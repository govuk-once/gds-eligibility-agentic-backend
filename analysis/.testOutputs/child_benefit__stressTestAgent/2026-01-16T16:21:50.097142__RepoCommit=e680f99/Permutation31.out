2026-01-16T16:34:27.827406 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To make a proper assessment, I'll need to ask you some questions.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:34:29.122000 [actor]: I need to play the role of a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll engage in conversation with the agent while following the guidelines.

My daughter university living at home need money

2026-01-16T16:34:30.152480 [root_agent]: I'll help assess your Child Benefit eligibility situation regarding your daughter who's at university and living at home.

How old is your daughter currently?

2026-01-16T16:34:31.049170 [actor]: Emma 18 started uni this year

2026-01-16T16:34:33.253825 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your daughter Emma is 18 and has started university this year, I need to understand a bit more about her education situation to determine Child Benefit eligibility.

Is Emma in approved education, such as A-levels, NVQs, or a university degree course? And is this full-time education (more than 12 hours of supervised study per week)?

2026-01-16T16:34:34.191186 [actor]: degree course three years living home

2026-01-16T16:34:37.120341 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on what you've shared, here's my assessment of your Child Benefit eligibility:

You may be eligible for Child Benefit for Emma because:
- She is 18 years old
- She is in full-time approved education (a three-year degree course)
- She is living at home with you

Child Benefit can continue until your child reaches age 20 if they remain in approved full-time education. Since Emma meets these criteria, you should be eligible.

However, I should also ask: Does either parent in the household have an individual income of over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-16T16:34:38.210829 [actor]: I'm not eligible

2026-01-16T16:34:40.184502 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about eligibility for Child Benefit continuing for a child aged 18 who is in approved full-time higher education (university degree) while living at home.
