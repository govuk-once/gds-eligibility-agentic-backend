2026-01-16T16:22:35.053709 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to determine this.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:22:35.873040 [actor]: child under 20

2026-01-16T16:22:37.078343 [root_agent]: Thank you. Is your child in approved education or training? This would typically include things like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or home education arranged through your local council.

2026-01-16T16:22:37.950003 [actor]: son Ben left school looking for apprenticeship

2026-01-16T16:22:38.935695 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify about your son Ben who has left school and is looking for an apprenticeship, may I ask his age?

2026-01-16T16:22:39.668474 [actor]: 17

2026-01-16T16:22:42.201112 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since your son Ben is 17 and has left school but is looking for an apprenticeship, I need to understand a bit more about his current situation.

Is Ben currently registered with a careers service, Connexions (in England), Skills Development Scotland, or Careers Wales? Or is he with an education institution or a local authority while looking for work or an apprenticeship?

2026-01-16T16:22:42.826976 [actor]: registered with youth careers service

2026-01-16T16:22:44.586853 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Since your son Ben is 17, has left school, and is registered with a youth careers service while looking for an apprenticeship, he would still qualify as being in approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Now, I need to ask: do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:22:45.301075 [actor]: UK yes

2026-01-16T16:22:46.904087 [root_agent]: Thank you. Since you live in the UK, I need to ask about your immigration and residency status. Do you have the right to reside in the UK, and if you're from outside the EEA, do you have immigration permission to remain in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:22:47.630150 [actor]: British citizen

2026-01-16T16:22:48.923890 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you're a British citizen.

Now, I need to ask about your household income. Is either you or your partner (if you have one) earning more than £50,000 per year before tax?

2026-01-16T16:22:49.663623 [actor]: no that high

2026-01-16T16:22:50.874642 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your income situation.

Is Ben living with you? Or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-16T16:22:51.713861 [actor]: lives with me

2026-01-16T16:22:56.051160 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Ben lives with you.

Based on all the information you've provided:
- Your son Ben is 17
- He has left school but is registered with a youth careers service while looking for an apprenticeship
- You're a British citizen living in the UK
- Your income (and your partner's if applicable) is below £50,000 per year
- Ben lives with you

I can confirm that you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Since Ben is under 20, has left school but is registered with a careers service while looking for work/apprenticeship, he counts as being in approved education or training. 

You can claim Child Benefit by filling out the CH2 form which you can get online from GOV.UK or by phoning the Child Benefit Office. The current weekly rate is £24.00 for your first child and £15.90 for any additional children.

Would you like me to explain anything else about Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:22:57.221587 [actor]: ok thanks eligible

2026-01-16T16:22:59.797815 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent made a mistake by stating that a 17-year-old who has left school and is registered with a youth careers service while looking for an apprenticeship counts as being in approved education or training. According to gov.uk guidelines, simply being registered with a careers service while looking for work does not qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.
