2026-01-16T16:26:35.609043 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:26:36.763494 [actor]: I'm looking to see about child benefit, have a 4 year old Maya living with me, adoption not finalised

2026-01-16T16:26:38.134180 [root_agent]: I understand that you have a 4-year-old named Maya living with you, but the adoption hasn't been finalized yet. Thank you for sharing this information.

Is Maya living with you on a permanent basis, or are you responsible for her day-to-day care?

2026-01-16T16:26:39.247357 [actor]: Yes she's with us now, moved in recently, adoption agency placed her

2026-01-16T16:26:40.504830 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Maya has been placed with you by an adoption agency and is now living with you.

Are you receiving any payments from the local authority or adoption agency for looking after Maya?

2026-01-16T16:26:41.312750 [actor]: Just normal adoption support no special payments

2026-01-16T16:26:42.576131 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're receiving normal adoption support but no special payments.

Do you normally live in the UK? (This includes England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland)

2026-01-16T16:26:43.275420 [actor]: Yes live in Birmingham UK

2026-01-16T16:26:44.514238 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in Birmingham, UK.

Is anyone else (such as Maya's birth parents) currently claiming Child Benefit for Maya?

2026-01-16T16:26:45.327963 [actor]: No they're not claiming for her anymore

2026-01-16T16:26:50.099460 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information.

Based on what you've shared with me, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Maya. Since:
- You have a 4-year-old child (Maya) living with you
- She was placed with you by an adoption agency
- You live in the UK
- You're responsible for her care
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

Even though the adoption isn't finalized, as the person who has Maya living with you and is responsible for her care, you can typically claim Child Benefit.

To apply, you would need to fill out a Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

Once your adoption is finalized, you should notify the Child Benefit Office of this change.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit that you might need to know about?

2026-01-16T16:26:51.596972 [actor]: Thank you for confirming my eligibility for Child Benefit for Maya. I'm glad to know I can apply now even though the adoption isn't finalized yet.

2026-01-16T16:26:53.561697 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for a child placed with them by an adoption agency, even before the adoption is finalized.
