2026-01-28T20:24:55.154365 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess this.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:24:56.718379 [actor]: child benfit 18 year old college hnc course

2026-01-28T20:25:00.047312 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have an 18-year-old in college doing an HNC course.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Is your 18-year-old studying the HNC course on a full-time basis (not part-time), and is it an approved course?**

(Just to clarify - approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes typically includes full-time non-advanced education, which can include courses up to A-level equivalent, or approved training programs.)

2026-01-28T20:25:01.730467 [actor]: yes full time local college started after a levels

2026-01-28T20:25:05.294574 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. An HNC (Higher National Certificate) is generally considered an advanced course of education (above A-level standard), which typically means it wouldn't qualify for Child Benefit once someone turns 16.

However, let me ask you another important question to be thorough: **Did your child turn 20 years old before the start of the current academic year (before early September)?**

This is important because Child Benefit can continue until a young person turns 20, but only if they remain in approved education or training that started before they turned 19, and only for certain types of non-advanced education.

2026-01-28T20:25:07.042403 [actor]: no shes 18 turned 18 in september started hnc after finishing school

2026-01-28T20:25:09.293109 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me make sure I understand the timeline correctly:

**Did your daughter start the HNC course before or after she turned 18 in September?**

This timing is important because it affects whether Child Benefit can continue, as the rules about approved education apply differently depending on when the course started in relation to turning 18/19.

2026-01-28T20:25:10.970624 [actor]: started hnc september after birthday she is 18 now

2026-01-28T20:25:15.498018 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details. Let me think through this carefully.

Based on the information you've given me:
- Your daughter is 18 years old
- She turned 18 in September
- She started an HNC course in September (after her 18th birthday)
- She's studying full-time at a local college

**Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter in this situation.**

Here's why: Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 who are in **approved education or training**. However, HNC (Higher National Certificate) courses are classified as **advanced education** - they are above A-level standard. Advanced education courses do not qualify as "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes.

Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds only continues for:
- Non-advanced education (up to and including A-level standard)
- Certain approved training programs

Since your daughter is now doing an HNC, which is a higher-level qualification, Child Benefit would have stopped when she finished her A-levels and started this advanced course.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-28T20:25:20.039224 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that HNC courses are advanced education above A-level standard and therefore do not qualify for Child Benefit, which only covers non-advanced education for 16-19 year olds.
