2026-01-28T20:19:32.028679 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:19:33.586459 [actor]: adoppted 2 kids special needs get money from council

2026-01-28T20:19:35.837602 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know you have 2 adopted children with special needs and that you receive money from the council for them.

To assess your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to understand your living arrangements better.

**Do your adopted children live with you, and are you responsible for them?**

2026-01-28T20:19:37.613849 [actor]: yeah they live here 6 and 8 years old council pays adopton allowance

2026-01-28T20:19:40.030422 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you have two adopted children aged 6 and 8 living with you, and you're responsible for them. The fact that you receive an adoption allowance from the council is noted.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Are you (or your partner, if you have one) currently receiving Child Benefit for these children, or has anyone else claimed Child Benefit for them?**

2026-01-28T20:19:41.761522 [actor]: no one claims it dont know if we can cuz of the allowance

2026-01-28T20:19:44.258302 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that no one is currently claiming Child Benefit for your children.

Just to clarify an important point: **receiving an adoption allowance from the council does not automatically prevent you from claiming Child Benefit** - these are separate benefits and you may be entitled to both.

Now, to continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Do you normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:19:45.839773 [actor]: yes live in uk both of us

2026-01-28T20:19:49.288146 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you. So you both live in the UK.

Now I need to ask about your income situation, as this affects Child Benefit:

**Do either you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

(This is important because if either of you earns over this amount, it affects how Child Benefit works - you can still claim it, but there may be a tax charge involved.)

2026-01-28T20:19:50.888588 [actor]: why does income matter just tell me if I can get it or not

2026-01-28T20:19:55.156541 [root_agent]: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for not explaining clearly.

Let me clarify: **Yes, based on what you've told me, you ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit** for your two adopted children. The adoption allowance you receive from the council does not prevent you from claiming it.

However, I asked about income because while you're eligible to *claim* Child Benefit, if either you or your partner earns over £50,000 per year, you would need to pay some or all of it back through a tax charge (called the High Income Child Benefit Charge). This doesn't stop you claiming - it just affects whether you get to keep the full amount.

So to give you complete information: **Do either you or your partner earn over £50,000 per year?** 

This will help me tell you whether you'll receive the full benefit or if there would be a tax charge to consider.

2026-01-28T20:19:56.668455 [actor]: no we dont earn that much can we get it then

2026-01-28T20:19:59.847300 [root_agent]: **Yes, you can get Child Benefit!**

Based on what you've told me:
- You have two adopted children aged 6 and 8
- They live with you and you're responsible for them
- You live in the UK
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for them
- Neither you nor your partner earns over £50,000

**You are eligible to claim Child Benefit for both of your children.** The adoption allowance you receive from the council does not affect your right to claim Child Benefit - these are completely separate payments.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit and receive the full amount for both children without any tax charges.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T20:20:03.105406 [actor]: ok thats all i needed thanks

2026-01-28T20:20:05.607745 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on having two adopted children under 16 living with them in the UK, with no one else claiming the benefit, and correctly clarified that adoption allowance does not prevent Child Benefit eligibility.
