**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user remains **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of temporary absence rules**: The agent properly identified that a 6-week temporary absence while the claimant recovers from surgery does not affect Child Benefit eligibility. This aligns with HMRC guidance that you can continue to receive Child Benefit during temporary separations.

2. **Within the 8-week rule**: The scenario explicitly states the child will be away for 6 weeks, which is within the 8-week threshold mentioned in the permutation details. The agent correctly recognized this falls within acceptable temporary absence parameters.

3. **Appropriate reassurance**: The agent properly reassured the user they would continue receiving Child Benefit and that no notification to HMRC was necessary for this short-term arrangement.

4. **Household continuity confirmed**: The agent verified the child remains part of the user's household and will return, which is crucial for maintaining eligibility during temporary absences.

The agent's conclusion that the user "should remain eligible for Child Benefit" directly matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**, and the reasoning provided is sound and consistent with UK Child Benefit regulations regarding temporary absences.
