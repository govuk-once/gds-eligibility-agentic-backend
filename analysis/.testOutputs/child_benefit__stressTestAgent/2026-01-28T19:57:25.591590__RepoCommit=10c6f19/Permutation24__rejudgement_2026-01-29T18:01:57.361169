**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **fully eligible for Child Benefit** without any time limitations, stating "you should be eligible for Child Benefit" and "you should continue to be eligible."

However, the expected outcome is: **Eligible (until week 12)**.

This is a critical distinction. The scenario specifically addresses the **12-week rule for Residential Accommodation** (as opposed to the 8-week rule for "Care"). The child has been in residential school for 10 weeks, meaning:

- The user **was** eligible for the first 10 weeks
- The user **remains** eligible until week 12
- The user will **lose eligibility** after week 12

The agent failed to communicate this crucial time limitation. They should have explained:
1. The user is currently eligible (because 10 weeks < 12 weeks)
2. This eligibility will end at the 12-week mark
3. The user should be aware of this upcoming cutoff

By providing an open-ended "you should be eligible" statement without mentioning the 12-week limit, the agent communicated an incorrect outcome. The user will be misled into thinking their eligibility continues indefinitely, when in fact it expires in approximately 2 weeks.

The agent's eligibility outcome does **not** agree with the expected outcome of "Eligible (until week 12)."
