2026-01-29T18:11:09.222389 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent properly identified and applied the relevant rule from https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, which states that you can continue to claim Child Benefit if your child is in care AND you contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit you'd receive towards looking after them.

Key facts correctly assessed:
1. The child has been in local authority care for 10 weeks (exceeds the 8-week threshold where special rules apply)
2. The user cannot personally afford to contribute
3. The user's husband pays £30/week to the carer

The agent correctly recognized that the **husband's contribution counts** toward satisfying the contribution requirement. This aligns with HMRC guidance that payments from a spouse/civil partner living with the claimant count as the claimant's contribution for Child Benefit purposes.

The £30/week payment exceeds the current Child Benefit rate for a first/only child (approximately £25/week), satisfying the minimum contribution requirement.

The agent's conclusion that the user "can continue to claim Child Benefit" is accurate and matches the expected eligible outcome for this scenario.
