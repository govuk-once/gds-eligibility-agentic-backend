2026-01-28T20:16:21.354365 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:16:22.802930 [actor]: child benefit bella 16 travle agent training

2026-01-28T20:16:25.052805 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child named Bella who is 16 years old and is in travel agent training.

Let me ask: Does Bella live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards her upbringing?

2026-01-28T20:16:26.443269 [actor]: yes she lives with me

2026-01-28T20:16:28.897404 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know that Bella lives with you.

Now, can you tell me - are you responsible for Bella? By this I mean, are you her parent or the main person looking after her day-to-day needs?

2026-01-28T20:16:30.187894 [actor]: yes im her mother

2026-01-28T20:16:32.514684 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now, regarding Bella's travel agent training - is this an approved course? Specifically, is it:
- Full-time education (at least 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience), or
- An approved training course?

2026-01-28T20:16:34.214222 [actor]: employer pays for it local travle agency

2026-01-28T20:16:36.494406 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Bella is doing training that her employer (a local travel agency) is paying for.

Let me ask: Is Bella working for this travel agency and earning a wage, or is she on an unpaid training scheme?

2026-01-28T20:16:38.022202 [actor]: they employd her and pay for cours

2026-01-28T20:16:40.628372 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Bella is employed by the travel agency and they pay for her course as part of her employment.

Let me ask you this: Is Bella enrolled in full-time non-advanced education at a school or college (studying for qualifications like A-levels, Scottish Highers, or similar), in addition to this work training? 

In other words, does she attend school or college for at least 12 hours a week of supervised study?

2026-01-28T20:16:42.446464 [actor]: no just the travle agent training paid by employer

2026-01-28T20:16:47.076217 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you've told me, I need to let you know that **Bella would not qualify you for Child Benefit** in this situation.

Here's why: Child Benefit can be claimed for young people aged 16-19 if they are in **full-time non-advanced education** (like A-levels or equivalent at school or college) or on **approved training courses**. However, if a young person is in paid employment - even if their employer pays for training - they don't meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

Since Bella is employed by the travel agency and earning a wage, she is considered to be in paid work rather than in qualifying education or training.

Child Benefit typically stops when a young person:
- Leaves full-time education, or
- Starts paid work of 24 hours or more per week, or
- Turns 20 (whichever comes first)

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or Bella's situation that you'd like to discuss?

2026-01-28T20:16:51.856655 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a 16-year-old in paid employment with employer-funded training does not qualify for Child Benefit, as the eligibility requires full-time non-advanced education or approved training courses, not paid employment.
