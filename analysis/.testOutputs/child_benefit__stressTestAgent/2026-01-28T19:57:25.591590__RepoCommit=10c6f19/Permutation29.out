2026-01-28T20:14:23.666034 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:14:25.461199 [actor]: 17 year old son not in school or work

2026-01-28T20:14:28.398346 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old son who is not currently in school or work.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is your son registered or enrolled with an approved education or training provider, even if he hasn't started yet, or is he perhaps between courses?**

2026-01-28T20:14:29.918860 [actor]: no he just at home finished gcse last year

2026-01-28T20:14:33.435520 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son finished his GCSEs last year and is currently at home, not enrolled in any education or training.

Based on the eligibility rules, Child Benefit is generally paid for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. Since your son is 17 and not in approved education or training, this affects eligibility.

However, let me ask one more important question to complete the assessment:

**When exactly did your son finish his approved education (his GCSEs)? Was it in the summer of last year, and if so, have you been receiving Child Benefit payments since then?**

This is important because there are specific rules about when Child Benefit stops after a young person leaves education.

2026-01-28T20:14:35.273614 [actor]: summer 2024 he finished need money for bills

2026-01-28T20:14:39.523702 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son finished his GCSEs in summer 2024.

Based on the Child Benefit eligibility rules, I need to inform you that **Child Benefit stops when a young person reaches 16 years old, or when they leave approved education or training after turning 16**. 

Since your son finished his GCSEs in summer 2024 and is not currently in approved education or training, your Child Benefit entitlement would have ended at the end of August 2024 (the end of the school term after he finished his GCSEs).

**Unfortunately, you are not currently eligible for Child Benefit for your 17-year-old son** as he is over 16 and not in approved education or training.

However, if your son decides to return to education or approved training in the future, you may become eligible again, as Child Benefit can continue until age 20 for young people in approved education or training.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T20:14:44.276041 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my 17-year-old son finished his GCSEs in summer 2024 and is not currently in approved education or training, correctly explaining that Child Benefit stops when a young person leaves approved education after turning 16.
