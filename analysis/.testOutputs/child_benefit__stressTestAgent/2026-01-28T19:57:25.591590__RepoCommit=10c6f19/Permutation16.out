2026-01-28T20:05:47.098461 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child (or children) under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:05:48.690393 [actor]: child 14 hospital amerika expensive treatment money spent visitng

2026-01-28T20:05:51.655702 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a 14-year-old child who is in hospital in America receiving expensive treatment, and you've been spending money visiting them.

Let me ask you this important question:

**Is your child normally living with you in the UK, or are you responsible for their care even though they're currently in hospital in America?**

(I need to understand your usual living arrangements and responsibility for the child to assess your eligibility)

2026-01-28T20:05:53.484738 [actor]: yes uk resident me child went amerika for treatmnet specalist hospital rare condtion

2026-01-28T20:05:55.827550 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you and your child are UK residents, and your child has gone to America for specialist treatment for a rare condition.

Let me ask the next important question:

**Are you the person responsible for your child - meaning, do you live with them when they're in the UK and are you the main person looking after them?**

2026-01-28T20:05:57.316942 [actor]: yes i pay for costs when hes there visit when can

2026-01-28T20:06:00.161168 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're responsible for your child's costs and visit when you can while they're receiving treatment in America.

Now I need to ask:

**How long has your child been in the hospital in America, or how long are they expected to be there for their treatment?**

(This is important because there are rules about how long a child can be away from the UK while you still receive Child Benefit)

2026-01-28T20:06:01.600942 [actor]: 15 weeks now specalist treatmnet rare condtion

2026-01-28T20:06:03.491335 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Your child has been in hospital in America for 15 weeks receiving specialist treatment for a rare condition.

Let me ask you:

**Before your child went to America for treatment, were you already receiving Child Benefit for them?**

2026-01-28T20:06:05.117196 [actor]: need to know if eligble or not child beneffit

2026-01-28T20:06:07.113197 [root_agent]: I understand you need to know about your eligibility. Let me ask this clearly:

**Are you currently claiming Child Benefit for your child, or are you asking if you can make a new claim while your child is receiving treatment in America?**

2026-01-28T20:06:08.564330 [actor]: am i eligble thats what im asking

2026-01-28T20:06:10.830641 [root_agent]: I understand - let me help clarify your eligibility based on what you've told me.

To give you a complete answer, I need to know one more thing:

**Do you normally live with your child in the UK when they're not in hospital?**

(This helps me confirm you meet the basic requirement of being responsible for the child)

2026-01-28T20:06:12.630609 [actor]: yes already said that child went amerika for hospital treatmnet 15 weeks ago

2026-01-28T20:06:14.723640 [root_agent]: Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me, let me ask one final important question:

**Is your child expected to return to the UK after their treatment, or are they planning to stay in America permanently?**

2026-01-28T20:06:16.036880 [actor]: of course comming back after treatmnet

2026-01-28T20:06:21.249331 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Based on all the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

**You should be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. You have a child under 16 (aged 14)
2. You are responsible for your child - you live with them in the UK normally
3. Your child is temporarily away in hospital receiving specialist treatment for a rare condition
4. They will be returning to the UK after treatment
5. You continue to contribute to their costs

**Important point about the hospital stay:** Children can be in hospital or care and you can still claim Child Benefit, but there are time limits. For children in hospital, you can usually continue to claim for up to 12 weeks (84 days). Since your child has been in hospital for 15 weeks, this exceeds the standard 12-week period.

**However**, there may be exceptions for longer hospital stays, particularly for specialist treatment abroad.

**My recommendation:** You should contact the Child Benefit Office directly to discuss your specific situation, as the 15-week hospital stay abroad for specialist treatment may require special consideration.

Does this help clarify your eligibility? Do you have any other questions?

2026-01-28T20:06:22.552903 [actor]: so am i eligble or not confused

2026-01-28T20:06:25.926951 [root_agent]: I apologize for the confusion. Let me be clear:

**Based on the standard rules, you may NOT be eligible right now** because your child has been in hospital for 15 weeks, which is longer than the usual 12-week limit for children in hospital.

**However**, I need to ask you one more specific question to give you a definitive answer:

**Did you receive permission or approval from the Child Benefit Office before your child went to America for this specialist treatment, or have you been in contact with them about this situation?**

(There can be exceptions to the 12-week rule in certain circumstances, especially for specialist medical treatment abroad)

2026-01-28T20:06:27.487592 [actor]: just need know if eligible paying lots money for child in hospital amerika

2026-01-28T20:06:31.965856 [root_agent]: I understand this is stressful and you need a clear answer.

**Based on the standard rules: NO, you are likely NOT eligible** because your child has been away in hospital for 15 weeks, which exceeds the usual 12-week (84-day) limit for children in hospital or care.

**HOWEVER**, there may be exceptions for your situation because:
- Your child is receiving specialist treatment for a rare condition
- The treatment is not available in the UK
- Your child will return to the UK

**You MUST contact the Child Benefit Office directly** to discuss your specific case, as they can consider exceptional circumstances for specialist medical treatment abroad.

Child Benefit Office: 0300 200 3100

They will be able to tell you definitively if an exception applies to your situation.

I'm sorry I cannot give you a simple "yes" - the rules have a time limit that your situation has exceeded, but exceptions may exist for cases like yours.

Is there anything else I can help clarify?

2026-01-28T20:06:33.394149 [actor]: so not eligble then thanks

2026-01-28T20:06:36.928475 [root_agent]: Wait - I want to make sure you understand correctly before you go.

**It's not a definite "no"** - your situation may qualify for an exception because:

- Your child needs specialist treatment not available in the UK
- It's for a rare condition
- Your child will return home

**You should still contact the Child Benefit Office** (0300 200 3100) because they can make exceptions for cases like yours involving essential medical treatment abroad.

**Please don't assume you're not eligible without speaking to them first** - they are the only ones who can give you a definitive answer for your specific medical situation.

Does that make sense? Your case is unusual and may be treated differently than the standard 12-week rule.

2026-01-28T20:06:38.420202 [actor]: ok so based on standard rules not eligible got it

2026-01-28T20:06:42.050832 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct - **based on the standard rules, you would not be eligible** because the hospital stay has exceeded 12 weeks.

However, I want to emphasize one more time: **your situation is NOT standard** because it involves specialist medical treatment abroad for a rare condition. The Child Benefit Office may apply different rules or make exceptions for medical cases like yours.

**I strongly recommend you contact them** (0300 200 3100) to explain your situation, as they have the authority to consider exceptions that I cannot assess.

I hope your child's treatment goes well and they recover soon. Is there anything else I can help you with?

2026-01-28T20:06:43.500834 [actor]: no thats all thanks for telling me not eligible

2026-01-28T20:06:47.698055 [root_agent]: I'm concerned you may be misunderstanding. Please let me be very clear:

**I have NOT told you that you are definitely not eligible.**

What I've said is:
- Based on standard rules for the 12-week limit, you would not qualify
- BUT your situation involves exceptional medical circumstances
- The Child Benefit Office can and does make exceptions for cases like yours
- **Only they can tell you if you're eligible or not**

**You may still be eligible** - I cannot make that final determination for exceptional medical cases.

**Please call the Child Benefit Office on 0300 200 3100** before giving up. They need to hear about your child's specialist treatment abroad.

Don't lose out on potential support your family may be entitled to. Will you contact them?

2026-01-28T20:06:49.254583 [actor]: you said based on standard rules not eligible thats what i needed to know

2026-01-28T20:06:53.430933 [root_agent]: I understand you feel you have your answer, but I'm worried you might miss out on support you could get.

Let me be absolutely clear one final time:

**"Not eligible under standard rules" does NOT mean "not eligible at all"**

Your child is receiving essential specialist medical treatment abroad that isn't available in the UK. This is NOT a standard situation - it's exceptional.

The government can and does make exceptions for exceptional medical circumstances like yours.

**You could potentially still get Child Benefit** - but only the Child Benefit Office can confirm this by reviewing your specific medical case.

I really encourage you to call them: **0300 200 3100**

They are there to help families in difficult situations like yours. Please don't give up without speaking to them.

Is there anything else I can help you understand about this?

2026-01-28T20:07:00.258072 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent concluded I was not eligible under standard rules, but according to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit can continue for children in hospital outside the UK for up to 12 weeks initially, with extensions available in exceptional circumstances including specialist treatment abroad - the agent should have determined eligibility as "yes" given the child is temporarily abroad for essential medical treatment and will return to the UK.
