2026-01-28T20:09:19.983619 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:09:21.689070 [actor]: chld benfit need check eligble divorced kids split up

2026-01-28T20:09:24.344850 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand you're divorced and the children are split between you and your ex-partner.

Let me ask you this important question:

**Which child or children currently live with you for the majority of the time?** 

(Child Benefit is typically claimed by the person the child lives with most of the time, so understanding your living arrangements will help determine your eligibility)

2026-01-28T20:09:26.973873 [actor]: got sam hes 10 lives with me ella 8 with ex wife

2026-01-28T20:09:29.487685 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Sam (age 10) lives with you, and Ella (age 8) lives with your ex-wife.

Here's my next question:

**Are you responsible for Sam? By this I mean, do you provide for his day-to-day care and financial support?**

2026-01-28T20:09:30.902200 [actor]: yes sam stays here i look after him

2026-01-28T20:09:33.156212 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that. Since Sam lives with you and you're responsible for his day-to-day care, you may be eligible for Child Benefit for him.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Is Sam currently in hospital or in any form of care (such as local authority care or residential care)?**

2026-01-28T20:09:34.510758 [actor]: no sam home with me goes to scool

2026-01-28T20:09:36.601541 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you. Since Sam is living at home with you and attending school, that's good for your eligibility.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:09:37.868428 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T20:09:39.809018 [root_agent]: Excellent. Now I need to ask about your immigration status:

**Do you have the right to live in the UK? For example, are you a UK citizen, or do you have settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or any other immigration status that allows you to live here?**

2026-01-28T20:09:41.038153 [actor]: uk citizen born here

2026-01-28T20:09:42.924055 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Now I have one more important question about Sam:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Sam?** (For example, is your ex-wife claiming it for him, or anyone else?)

2026-01-28T20:09:44.434378 [actor]: no just me claiming for sam ex wife claims for ella

2026-01-28T20:09:48.243215 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Sam**. Here's why:

✓ Sam is under 16 years old (he's 10)
✓ He lives with you 
✓ You're responsible for him
✓ He's not in hospital or care
✓ You're a UK citizen living in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

Since your ex-wife is claiming Child Benefit for Ella (who lives with her), and you're claiming for Sam (who lives with you), this arrangement is correct. Each parent claims for the child they're primarily responsible for.

**Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?**

2026-01-28T20:09:53.066518 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for Sam (the child living with them) while the ex-wife correctly claims for Ella (the child living with her), which aligns with the split custody arrangement and UK Child Benefit rules.
