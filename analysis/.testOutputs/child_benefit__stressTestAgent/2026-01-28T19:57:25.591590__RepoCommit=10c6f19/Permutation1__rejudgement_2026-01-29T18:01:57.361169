**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Assessment of the agent's determination:**

1. **Responsibility (Criteria 1):** ✓ The agent confirmed the applicant is Leo's parent and responsible for him.

2. **Child's Age (Criteria 2):** ✓ The agent verified Leo is 8 years old, which is under 16.

3. **Residency/Immigration (Criteria 3):** ✓ The agent confirmed both parents are UK nationals with no immigration restrictions.

4. **Living Arrangements (Criteria 4):** ✓ The agent established that Leo lives with the applicant.

5. **State Support (Criteria 5):** ✓ The agent confirmed Leo is not in hospital or care for extended periods.

6. **High Income Charge (Criteria 6):** ✓ The agent correctly identified that Tom earns £35,000 and Sarah earns £15,000. Since neither parent's individual income exceeds £50,000 (Tom's £35,000 is the highest), there is no High Income Child Benefit Charge. The agent correctly stated the family can receive full Child Benefit without tax implications.

**Conclusion:** The agent's eligibility determination of "eligible" matches the expected outcome of "Eligible." The agent conducted a thorough assessment of all relevant criteria and reached the correct conclusion.
