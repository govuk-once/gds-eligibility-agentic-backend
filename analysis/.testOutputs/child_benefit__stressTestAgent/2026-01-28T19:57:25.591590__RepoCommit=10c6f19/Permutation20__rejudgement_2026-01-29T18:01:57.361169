**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Maria is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Responsibility criterion met**: The agent correctly identified that Maria is responsible for Lucia's day-to-day care and pays for everything she needs.

2. **Relationship criterion met**: The agent properly recognized that you don't need to be a parent to claim Child Benefit. The agent stated: "As the person responsible for your granddaughter, you can claim Child Benefit even though you're her grandparent rather than her parent."

3. **All eligibility criteria satisfied**:
   - Child under 16 ✓
   - Lives with applicant ✓
   - UK resident ✓
   - No one else claiming ✓
   - Not in care/hospital/detention ✓

4. **Informal arrangement correctly handled**: According to gov.uk guidance, you can get Child Benefit if you have an informal arrangement to look after a relative's child, provided the local council isn't paying for accommodation. Maria's situation is an informal family arrangement where she bears all costs, which qualifies.

The agent's conclusion that Maria is eligible is correct and matches the expected outcome.
