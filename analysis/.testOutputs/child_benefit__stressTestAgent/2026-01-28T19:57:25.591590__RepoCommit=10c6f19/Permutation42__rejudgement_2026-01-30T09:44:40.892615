**Justification:**

The agent's determination **does not agree with the expected outcome**.

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible

**Agent's Communication:** Conditionally eligible ("should be eligible for Child Benefit, **provided your daughter's working hours are confirmed to be under 24 hours per week**")

**Key Issues:**

1. **Missed Welsh-specific exception**: The scenario explicitly states that Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are listed as "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes, with a regional exception that distinguishes them from English apprenticeships. The agent failed to identify or apply this Wales-specific rule.

2. **Incorrect application of the 24-hour rule**: The agent treated this as a standard apprenticeship case where the 24-hour working threshold is the determining factor. However, according to the scenario criteria, Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales qualify as approved training regardless of working hours.

3. **Uncertain outcome communicated**: The agent communicated conditional eligibility dependent on hours verification ("provided your daughter's working hours are confirmed to be under 24 hours per week"), when the user should have been told they are eligible based on the Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales being approved training.

4. **User reported hours as "around 22 hours maybe bit more some weeks"**: This uncertainty around the 24-hour threshold made the agent's conditional response particularly problematic, when the Welsh exception would have provided a clear eligible determination.

The agent should have recognized the Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales as approved training and communicated **definite eligibility** rather than conditional eligibility.
