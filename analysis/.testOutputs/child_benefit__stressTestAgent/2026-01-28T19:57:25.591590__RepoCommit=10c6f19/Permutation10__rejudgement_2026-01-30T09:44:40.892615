**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of the situation**: The agent recognized that Liam is in a formal fostering arrangement with council-paid allowances for accommodation and maintenance.

2. **Accurate application of eligibility rules**: The agent correctly explained that when a local council pays fostering allowances for a child's accommodation and maintenance, the foster carer cannot claim Child Benefit because the council is considered responsible for the child's care.

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam" and provided a clear rationale based on the specific circumstances.

4. **Consistency with government guidance**: This aligns with the rule stated at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, which indicates that Child Benefit cannot be claimed for fostered children when the local authority is paying for their upkeep.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome (Not Eligible) and demonstrates proper understanding of the eligibility criteria for foster care situations.
