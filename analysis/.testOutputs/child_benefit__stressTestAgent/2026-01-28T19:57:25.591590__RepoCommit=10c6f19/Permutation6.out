2026-01-28T20:00:06.247532 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:00:08.086711 [actor]: child in hospitl for 14 weks daughter 6 yrs old

2026-01-28T20:00:10.738848 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your daughter is 6 years old and has been in hospital for 14 weeks.

To assess your eligibility for Child Benefit in this situation, I need to ask: Are you still responsible for your daughter's upkeep during her time in hospital? For example, are you still paying for her needs or contributing to her care costs?

2026-01-28T20:00:12.161406 [actor]: yes spend 30 pounds every week books pyjamas food for her

2026-01-28T20:00:14.481491 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It's clear you're still contributing to your daughter's care while she's in hospital.

Now I need to ask: Do you normally live in the UK, or are you considered ordinarily resident in the UK?

2026-01-28T20:00:15.714821 [actor]: live in uk yes

2026-01-28T20:00:17.814472 [root_agent]: Thank you. And one more question to complete the assessment:

Are you the only person claiming Child Benefit for your daughter, or is anyone else (such as another parent or guardian) already claiming it for her?

2026-01-28T20:00:19.127044 [actor]: only me claiming nobody else

2026-01-28T20:00:24.041133 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 6-year-old daughter)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are responsible for your daughter - you're still contributing to her upkeep while she's in hospital (spending £30 per week on books, pyjamas, and food)
✓ You're the only person claiming for her

**Important information about children in hospital:**

You can continue to claim Child Benefit for your daughter while she's in hospital for up to **12 weeks** as long as you're still responsible for her. However, since your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks, you need to be aware that:

- After 12 weeks in hospital, Child Benefit normally stops
- However, if you're still contributing to her costs (which you are), you may be able to continue claiming beyond 12 weeks

**I recommend you contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them of your daughter's situation and confirm your ongoing eligibility beyond the 12-week period, given that you're still paying for her needs.**

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:00:29.781463 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated I am eligible but then contradicted itself by saying "After 12 weeks in hospital, Child Benefit normally stops" when my daughter has been hospitalized for 14 weeks. According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks in hospital unless there's an exception where the claimant is still paying toward the child's care - which applies here since I'm spending £30/week. The agent should have clearly stated I qualify via this exception rather than giving contradictory information about eligibility stopping after 12 weeks.
