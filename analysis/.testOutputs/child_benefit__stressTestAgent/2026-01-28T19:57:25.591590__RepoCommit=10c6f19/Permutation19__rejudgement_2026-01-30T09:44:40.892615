**Justification:**

The agent correctly explained that HMRC will make the final decision when both parents claim and cannot agree. The agent also correctly identified that the child spends more nights (4) with the mother than with Pete (3 nights).

However, the agent's communication about the eligibility outcome is problematic. The agent stated that "her mother would **likely** be awarded the Child Benefit" but never clearly communicated to Pete that **he is not eligible** for Child Benefit in this scenario.

According to the expected outcome:
- **Sue is Eligible**
- **Pete is Not Eligible**

The agent should have explicitly told Pete that he would not be eligible for Child Benefit since:
1. Only one person can claim for the same child
2. The child lives with the mother more of the time (4 nights vs 3 nights)
3. HMRC's priority rule would award it to Sue

While the agent implied Pete wouldn't receive it by saying the mother would "likely" get it, this falls short of clearly communicating Pete's ineligibility status. The agent left the outcome somewhat ambiguous by focusing on what HMRC "will decide" rather than clearly stating Pete's ineligibility based on the established criteria.
