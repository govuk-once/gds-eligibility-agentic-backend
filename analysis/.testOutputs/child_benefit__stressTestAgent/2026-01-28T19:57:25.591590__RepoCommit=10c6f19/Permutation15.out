2026-01-28T20:05:22.375696 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or children under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:05:24.375672 [actor]: child benefit eligibilty daughter 12 years old send money evry week

2026-01-28T20:05:26.268667 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 12-year-old daughter, which meets the age requirement.

Now I need to ask: **Does your daughter normally live with you?**

2026-01-28T20:05:27.922100 [actor]: no she lives with her mum i send £10 week for food

2026-01-28T20:05:29.629036 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is an important detail.

Since your daughter lives with her mum, let me ask: **Does the child's mother currently claim Child Benefit for your daughter?**

2026-01-28T20:05:31.181606 [actor]: no she dosnt claim it thats why i want too

2026-01-28T20:05:33.894089 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you an important question:

**Do you contribute at least the same amount (or more) towards your daughter's upkeep as someone would get in Child Benefit each week?**

For context, Child Benefit is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child.

2026-01-28T20:05:35.554107 [actor]: i send £10 evry week for food plus birthday present once a year

2026-01-28T20:05:39.731817 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to let you know that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.

Here's why:

1. Your daughter lives with her mother, not with you
2. To claim Child Benefit when a child lives with someone else, you must be contributing at least as much as the Child Benefit amount towards the child's care
3. Child Benefit is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child
4. You're contributing £10 per week, which is less than the Child Benefit amount

**The person who is eligible to claim Child Benefit is your daughter's mother**, as she is the one your daughter normally lives with.

Even though the mother isn't currently claiming it, she would be the eligible person to do so. If she's not claiming, she may want to consider applying, as it's financial support designed to help with the costs of raising a child.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:05:44.970148 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter lives with her mother and my contribution of £10 per week is less than the Child Benefit amount of £25.60 per week, which is the minimum required to claim when the child lives elsewhere.
