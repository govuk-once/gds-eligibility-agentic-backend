2026-01-28T20:14:03.558087 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:14:05.369939 [actor]: chld benefit us citizen visiting uk son age 5

2026-01-28T20:14:07.313347 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you a clarifying question:

**Are you currently living in the UK, and is your 5-year-old son living with you in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:14:08.961427 [actor]: yes hes with me in uk now tourist visa 6 months

2026-01-28T20:14:11.855877 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me ask you an important question about your immigration status:

**Do you have the right to reside in the UK beyond your tourist visa, or do you have what's called "right to reside" status? For example, do you have settled status, pre-settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or are you working in the UK with the proper authorization?**

(Tourist visas typically don't grant the right to reside that's needed for Child Benefit eligibility, but I want to confirm your specific situation.)

2026-01-28T20:14:13.247172 [actor]: no just visiting not working standard tourist visa

2026-01-28T20:14:16.697833 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you of the following:

**Unfortunately, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit in your current situation.**

The reason is that to claim Child Benefit in the UK, you must have what's called "right to reside" in the UK. A standard tourist visa (visitor visa) does not provide this right to reside. Child Benefit is available to people who are:

- Living in the UK, AND
- Have the right to reside in the UK (such as British citizens, settled status holders, people with indefinite leave to remain, or certain other immigration statuses)

Since you're visiting the UK on a tourist visa for 6 months, you don't meet the residency requirements for Child Benefit, even though your 5-year-old son is with you.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T20:14:21.543563 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that a US citizen visiting the UK on a standard tourist visa does not have the "right to reside" required for Child Benefit eligibility, and provided correct information about the residency requirements.
