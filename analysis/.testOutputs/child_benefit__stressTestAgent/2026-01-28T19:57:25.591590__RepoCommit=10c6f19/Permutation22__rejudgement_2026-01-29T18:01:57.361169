**Justification:**

The agent made a critical error in applying the hospital "linking rule" for Child Benefit eligibility.

**What the agent said:**
- The agent stated that because Arthur came home for 2 weeks between hospital stays, "the clock reset" and "his current hospital stay of 3 weeks is well within the 12-week allowance."
- The agent concluded Jenny is **eligible** for Child Benefit.

**What the rules actually say:**
According to the linking rule on gov.uk, if a child returns to hospital within **28 days** of leaving, the separate hospital stays are treated as one continuous period for the purpose of the 12-week limit.

**What actually happened:**
- First hospital stay: 10 weeks
- Time at home: 2 weeks (14 days)
- Arthur returned to hospital after **15 days** (within the 28-day linking period)
- Current hospital stay: 3 weeks
- **Cumulative total: 10 + 3 = 13 weeks**

Since Arthur returned within 28 days, the stays are linked and count cumulatively. The total exceeds 12 weeks, meaning Jenny would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit after the cumulative 12th week.

**Expected outcome:** Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)

**Agent's communicated outcome:** Eligible

The agent's outcome directly contradicts the expected outcome, making this a failed assessment.
