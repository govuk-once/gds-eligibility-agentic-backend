**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user remains **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Temporary absence within 8-week rule**: The child (Noah, 6 years old) has been living with the grandmother for only 6 weeks, which is under the 8-week threshold mentioned in the scenario guidelines. According to gov.uk guidance, "You usually continue to get Child Benefit for 8 weeks after your child goes to live with someone else" (provided no one else claims).

2. **No competing claim**: The scenario explicitly states the grandmother does NOT make a claim for Child Benefit, which is a critical condition for the 8-week rule to apply.

3. **Temporary arrangement with clear return**: The user confirmed the child is returning after recovery, indicating this is genuinely temporary care rather than a permanent change in living arrangements.

4. **Existing claimant**: The user was already receiving Child Benefit before the temporary absence, which means they have an established claim.

The agent appropriately:
- Identified this as a temporary absence
- Confirmed the child would return
- Advised the user they remain eligible
- Reassured them they should continue receiving payments

This outcome correctly matches the expected result of **Eligible** for this permutation testing the 8-week temporary absence rule.
