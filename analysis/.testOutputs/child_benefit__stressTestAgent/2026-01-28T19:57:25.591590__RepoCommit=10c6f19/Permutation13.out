2026-01-28T20:04:23.060233 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:04:24.896133 [actor]: child living with us now 4 yrs old adoptoin agency placed her with us

2026-01-28T20:04:27.158174 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 4-year-old child who was placed with you by an adoption agency and is living with you.

Next question: **Are you responsible for this child? That is, do you live with the child and are you responsible for paying for things like their food, clothes, and housing?**

2026-01-28T20:04:28.868368 [actor]: yes we pay for evrything food cloths toys she lives in our home

2026-01-28T20:04:31.157164 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you. You're caring for and financially supporting the child who lives with you.

Next question: **Do you normally live in the UK?** (This means the UK is your main home where you usually live)

2026-01-28T20:04:32.495748 [actor]: uk residents born here

2026-01-28T20:04:34.768209 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for this child?** (For example, the child's birth parents, or anyone else?)

2026-01-28T20:04:36.161469 [actor]: no one else claiming adoption agency placed her with us last month

2026-01-28T20:04:38.585183 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Just to make sure I understand correctly - you mentioned earlier the child has been living with you for 4 years, but you've also said the adoption agency placed her with you last month. 

**Could you clarify: how long has the child actually been living with you?** Is it 4 years or 1 month?

2026-01-28T20:04:40.329550 [actor]: sory child is 4 years old placed with us last month for adoption

2026-01-28T20:04:42.727637 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying - that makes sense now. So the child is 4 years old and was placed with you last month by the adoption agency for adoption.

One more important question: **Has the adoption been legally finalized yet, or are you still in the process of adopting (sometimes called the "pre-adoption" period)?**

2026-01-28T20:04:44.209346 [actor]: no court order yet still waiting for final adoption order

2026-01-28T20:04:47.910414 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's very helpful.

Based on what you've told me, let me assess your situation:

**Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit!**

Here's why:
- You have a 4-year-old child living with you (under 16, so age requirement met ✓)
- You are responsible for the child - paying for their food, clothes, and housing ✓
- You normally live in the UK ✓
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child ✓
- The child has been placed with you by an adoption agency, and you're waiting for the final adoption order ✓

**Important point:** You don't need to wait for the final adoption order to claim Child Benefit. When a child is placed with you for adoption by an adoption agency (even before the adoption is legally finalized), you can claim Child Benefit as long as you're responsible for the child.

**Would you like guidance on how to apply for Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-28T20:04:53.085403 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user qualifies for Child Benefit during the pre-adoption period when a child is placed with them by an adoption agency, correctly noting that they don't need to wait for the final adoption order to claim.
