2026-01-28T20:02:59.441204 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:03:00.919867 [actor]: foster child benefit council money

2026-01-28T20:03:03.042392 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you a specific question to understand your situation better:

**Are you fostering a child through your local council or an approved fostering agency?**

2026-01-28T20:03:04.627057 [actor]: yes liam 12 years old council pays me

2026-01-28T20:03:08.266052 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about Liam.

Since you mentioned that the council pays you for fostering Liam, I need to clarify an important point:

**If you're receiving fostering allowances from the local council for Liam, you generally cannot claim Child Benefit for him, as the council is considered responsible for his care.**

However, let me ask you this to be completely certain of your situation:

**Is Liam placed with you under a formal fostering arrangement, or do you have any other legal arrangement for his care (such as a Special Guardianship Order or kinship care arrangement)?**

2026-01-28T20:03:09.859543 [actor]: council fostering allowance accomodation maintenance paid by them

2026-01-28T20:03:13.420704 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Based on what you've told me - that Liam is in a formal fostering arrangement and you receive fostering allowances from the council for his accommodation and maintenance - **you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam**.

This is because when a child is being looked after by the local council (even though they're living with you as their foster carer), the council is considered responsible for the child, not you as an individual claimant. Child Benefit cannot be paid when the local authority is already supporting the child's care.

**Do you have any other children in your household who are not in foster care arrangements, or would you like to ask anything else about this decision?**

2026-01-28T20:03:18.048730 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that foster carers receiving council fostering allowances cannot claim Child Benefit because the local authority is considered responsible for the child's care, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
