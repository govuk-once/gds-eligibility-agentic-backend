**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct identification of the arrangement**: The agent properly understood that this was an employer-sponsored coding bootcamp with an agreement to join the company afterwards, with the employer paying the course fees.

2. **Correct application of rules**: The agent correctly identified that while the bootcamp is full-time, the key issue is whether it qualifies as "approved education or training." The agent noted that a coding bootcamp with employer sponsorship and a job agreement afterwards "may be considered work-based training or pre-employment training, rather than approved education."

3. **Alignment with guidance**: According to the provided scenario, courses done "with an employer's agreement - for example, to get a job" are explicitly excluded from approved education. The agent's assessment correctly reflects this exclusion.

4. **Appropriate advice**: The agent appropriately recommended contacting the Child Benefit Office for definitive confirmation, which is prudent given the complexity of the situation.

5. **Clear communication**: The agent clearly stated "you may NOT be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation" and explained the reasoning, making the outcome unambiguous.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**, making this a correct assessment.
