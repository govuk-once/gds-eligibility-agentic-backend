**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points correctly addressed:**

1. **Eligibility confirmed**: The agent clearly stated multiple times that the user is eligible to claim Child Benefit and meets all the criteria.

2. **High Income Child Benefit Charge properly explained**: The agent correctly identified that because the wife (Emily) earns £65,000, she will need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge equal to 100% of the benefit received.

3. **Liability correctly assigned**: The agent properly explained that the wife (the higher earner) would be responsible for paying the tax charge, even though Lucas would be the claimant receiving the payments.

4. **Options presented**: The agent appropriately outlined both options - claiming with payments (triggering the tax charge) or claiming without payments (preserving NI credits without the tax burden).

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome: **Eligible (Lucas receives money; Emily pays the tax)**. The agent confirmed Lucas can claim and receive the benefit, while clearly explaining that Emily would bear the tax liability due to her higher income exceeding £60,000.
