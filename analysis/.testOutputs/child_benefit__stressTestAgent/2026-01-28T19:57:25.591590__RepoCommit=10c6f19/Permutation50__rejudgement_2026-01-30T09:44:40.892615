2026-01-30T09:56:26.639982 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

The agent's assessment was thorough and accurate:

1. **Child's age and status**: The agent confirmed the child is 16 years old and has left school but is enrolled in the "No One Left Behind" programme as a full-time trainee.

2. **Approved training**: The agent correctly recognized that the "No One Left Behind" programme in Scotland qualifies as approved training for Child Benefit purposes, and verified it meets the full-time requirement (at least 12 hours per week).

3. **Responsibility and residence**: The agent confirmed the child lives with the claimant, who is solely responsible for them.

4. **UK residence**: The agent verified the claimant lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.

5. **Age extension rule**: The agent correctly applied the rule that Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 (up to 20) when they are in approved education or training.

The agent's conclusion that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" directly aligns with the expected outcome. The evaluation judge also marked this as a pass (✓), confirming the agent's correct assessment.
