2026-01-28T20:09:55.104475 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:09:56.612713 [actor]: child in hosptal arthir 7 years old

2026-01-28T20:09:59.773969 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a child named Arthur who is 7 years old and is in hospital.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Are you responsible for Arthur - meaning you're living with him or contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit to his upkeep?**

(Please note that children in hospital can still qualify for Child Benefit under certain conditions, so don't worry about the hospital stay affecting eligibility at this stage.)

2026-01-28T20:10:01.334358 [actor]: yes responsibl for him hes my son

2026-01-28T20:10:03.116145 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Arthur is your son and you're responsible for him.

Next question: **Do you normally live in the UK (England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland)?**

2026-01-28T20:10:04.361212 [actor]: live in uk yes

2026-01-28T20:10:06.609591 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming you live in the UK.

Next question: **How long has Arthur been in hospital, and do you know if he's expected to stay there for more than 12 weeks in total?**

(This is important because there are specific rules about Child Benefit when a child is in hospital for extended periods.)

2026-01-28T20:10:08.185584 [actor]: he was in 10 weeks then came home then went back in

2026-01-28T20:10:10.117802 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to understand this a bit better to assess the situation correctly.

**When Arthur came home between hospital stays, how long was he at home before he went back into hospital?**

2026-01-28T20:10:11.637365 [actor]: 2 weeks at home then went back 15 days later

2026-01-28T20:10:13.616321 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So Arthur was home for 2 weeks between hospital stays.

Now I need to ask: **Is Arthur currently still in hospital, and if so, how long has this current hospital stay been (or how long is it expected to be)?**

2026-01-28T20:10:15.576213 [actor]: hes been back in hosptal 3 weeks now

2026-01-28T20:10:17.936561 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me make sure I understand the timeline correctly:
- First hospital stay: 10 weeks
- Home: 2 weeks  
- Current hospital stay: 3 weeks (and ongoing)

Now I have an important question: **Is Arthur in hospital receiving free NHS treatment, or is he in hospital for a different reason (such as a private arrangement)?**

2026-01-28T20:10:19.274220 [actor]: nhs treatment free

2026-01-28T20:10:21.866401 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

One more important question about Arthur's hospital care: **Is Arthur expected to be in hospital (in this current stay or overall) for more than 12 weeks continuously, or is he expected to come home soon?**

2026-01-28T20:10:23.530211 [actor]: dont know how long he be there

2026-01-28T20:10:25.920101 [root_agent]: I understand - it must be a difficult and uncertain time for you.

Let me ask another question to complete the assessment: **Apart from Arthur, do you have any other children you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:10:27.347413 [actor]: no just arthur

2026-01-28T20:10:32.079574 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Let me now assess your eligibility for Child Benefit.

**Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ You're responsible for Arthur, who is 7 years old (under 16)
✓ You're his parent and live in the UK
✓ He normally lives with you

**Regarding Arthur's hospital stays:**

The good news is that **you can continue to claim Child Benefit while Arthur is in hospital**. The rules state that:

- Child Benefit continues for the first **12 weeks** of any hospital stay
- If your child comes home for at least one night between hospital stays, the 12-week count starts again from the beginning

In your case, Arthur came home for 2 weeks between his hospital stays, so the clock reset. His current hospital stay of 3 weeks is well within the 12-week allowance.

**You are eligible for Child Benefit** and should continue to receive it (or apply if you haven't already).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T20:10:37.518834 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. While the agent correctly explained that Child Benefit continues for the first 12 weeks of hospital stay and that the clock resets if the child comes home for at least one night, the agent failed to recognize that the cumulative time (10 weeks + 3 weeks = 13 weeks total) exceeds 12 weeks, meaning eligibility would end after the 12th cumulative week of the current hospital stay.
