2026-01-30T09:55:38.906974 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:** The agent correctly determined that Maria is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."

The agent's assessment was thorough and accurate:
- Correctly identified that the applicant doesn't need to be the parent - grandparents can claim if they are responsible for the child
- Verified that Maria has responsibility for Lucia (paying for everything, providing day-to-day care)
- Confirmed Lucia (14) meets the age requirement (under 16)
- Established that Maria is a UK citizen living in the UK
- Verified no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Lucia
- Confirmed Lucia lives with Maria full-time
- Ruled out disqualifying factors (hospital stay, local authority care, detention)

The agent explicitly stated "Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit!" and provided clear reasoning. This aligns with the eligibility criteria at gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, which confirms that informal arrangements where a grandparent cares for a child are eligible, provided the local council isn't paying for accommodation (which was not mentioned in this case).
