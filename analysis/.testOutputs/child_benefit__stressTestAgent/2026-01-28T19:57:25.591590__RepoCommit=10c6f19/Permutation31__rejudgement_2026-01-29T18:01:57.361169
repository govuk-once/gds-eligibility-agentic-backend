**Justification:**

The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that **agrees with the expected outcome** of "Not Eligible."

The agent clearly and correctly explained that:
1. Child Benefit **stops** when the daughter started her university degree in September
2. Higher education courses (university degrees) are **not** counted as approved education for Child Benefit purposes
3. The user is "**not eligible** for Child Benefit from September onwards"

While the agent also helpfully explained that there was a period of eligibility from March to August (when the daughter was completing A-levels), the agent's final determination correctly identifies that the current status is **not eligible** because the daughter is now in advanced/higher education (university degree).

This aligns perfectly with the expected outcome: "Not Eligible (Child Benefit stops when a child starts 'advanced' education, such as a university degree)."
