**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** without any time limitation or caveat, stating "you should be eligible for Child Benefit" and "you should continue to be eligible."

However, the expected outcome clearly states: **Eligible (until week 12)**.

The key issue is that the agent failed to communicate the critical 12-week time limit that applies to children in Residential Accommodation. While the agent correctly identified that the user was eligible (the child has been there for 10 weeks, which is under the 12-week threshold), they did not inform the user that:

1. There is a 12-week limit for Residential Accommodation placements
2. Since the child has already been there for 10 weeks, eligibility will end at week 12
3. The user only has approximately 2 more weeks of eligibility remaining

According to the scenario details, children in "Residential Accommodation" (as opposed to "Care") retain eligibility for **12 weeks**, not indefinitely. The agent's response suggests ongoing, unlimited eligibility, which materially misrepresents the actual situation.

The agent should have clearly communicated that while the user is currently eligible, this eligibility will cease after week 12 of the residential placement, giving the user important information about the limited duration of their entitlement.
