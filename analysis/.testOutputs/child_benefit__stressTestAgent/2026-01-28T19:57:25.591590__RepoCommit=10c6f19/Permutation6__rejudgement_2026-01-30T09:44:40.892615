**Justification:**

I disagree with the evaluation judge's assessment. While the agent's communication could have been clearer and more direct, they **did** communicate the correct eligibility outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **The agent clearly stated eligibility**: The opening line of the outcome section states unambiguously: "**you are eligible for Child Benefit**"

2. **The agent identified the exception**: The agent explicitly noted that while "After 12 weeks in hospital, Child Benefit normally stops," there is an exception: "However, if you're still contributing to her costs (which you are), you may be able to continue claiming beyond 12 weeks"

3. **Expected outcome match**: The expected outcome is "Eligible (via Exception)" - and the agent communicated exactly this: eligible status with the explanation that the exception applies due to ongoing financial contributions

4. **The contradiction concern**: While the judge criticizes the presentation as contradictory, the agent actually follows the logical structure of: (a) general rule, (b) exception to rule, (c) applicant qualifies under exception

**Areas for improvement in communication:**
- The agent could have been more definitive about the exception applying
- The recommendation to "contact the Child Benefit Office to confirm" may create unnecessary uncertainty
- A clearer statement like "You remain eligible because you qualify for the exception" would be better

However, the core eligibility determination communicated to the user was **correct**: they are eligible via the exception for ongoing financial contributions during hospitalization beyond 12 weeks.
