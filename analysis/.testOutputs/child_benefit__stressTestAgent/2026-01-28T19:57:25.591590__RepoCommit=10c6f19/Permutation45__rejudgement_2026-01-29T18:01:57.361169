**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of the 12-week hospital rule**: The agent accurately identified that Child Benefit typically stops after a child has been in hospital continuously for more than 12 weeks.

2. **Proper assessment of the expenditure exception**: The user explicitly stated they only visit their daughter but do not spend money on her upkeep (the scenario confirms the hospital provides everything). The agent correctly recognized that visits alone, without financial contribution, do not satisfy the spending requirement for the exception.

3. **Clear final determination**: The agent stated explicitly: "it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit" due to the 14-week hospital stay exceeding the 12-week limit.

4. **Appropriate handling of the visiting question**: When the user repeatedly asked if daily visits matter, the agent correctly explained that frequency of visits does not change the eligibility rules.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome (Not Eligible) based on the criteria: the child has been in hospital >12 weeks (14 weeks), and the parent does not regularly spend money on the child's upkeep (only visits without financial contribution).
