**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which is correct. However, the agent failed to accurately communicate the **extent** of the eligibility regarding backdating.

The agent stated: "Child Benefit can be backdated for up to 3 months from the date you make your claim. So if you apply now, you should be able to get some of the money you've missed."

This statement is misleading because:

1. The baby is 4 months old
2. The 3-month backdating limit means they can only claim for the **last 3 months**
3. Therefore, they will **lose the first month's money**

The expected outcome explicitly states: "Eligible (but only for the last 3 months; they lose the first month's money)."

The agent did not clearly communicate that the user would lose one month of benefit. While the agent mentioned "some of the money you've missed" and "up to that 3-month limit," they did not explicitly inform the user that they would **not** receive payment for the first month, which is a critical piece of information the user was specifically asking about ("can i get mony back").

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent does not fully agree with the expected outcome because it fails to make clear the loss of the first month's benefit payment.
