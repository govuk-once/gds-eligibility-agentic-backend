2026-01-28T19:59:30.612748 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:59:32.170793 [actor]: child benfit eligibilty son 10 years old lucas

2026-01-28T19:59:33.925955 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a son named Lucas who is 10 years old.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Does Lucas normally live with you, or are you the main person responsible for him?**

2026-01-28T19:59:35.525414 [actor]: send money every month 150 pounds ex wife jenny

2026-01-28T19:59:37.421928 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. So you send £150 per month to your ex-wife Jenny.

Let me ask you this important question:

**Does Lucas actually live with you, or does he live with your ex-wife Jenny?**

2026-01-28T19:59:38.717954 [actor]: lucas lives with jenny

2026-01-28T19:59:40.996351 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Lucas lives with Jenny, your ex-wife.

This is an important point. Let me ask you:

**Are you the person who is mainly responsible for Lucas's day-to-day care, or is Jenny the one who looks after him on a daily basis?**

2026-01-28T19:59:42.602082 [actor]: jenny looks after lucas i pay 150 pounds for food clothes

2026-01-28T19:59:44.416782 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Jenny looks after Lucas day-to-day, and you contribute £150 per month towards his food and clothes.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Does Jenny currently claim Child Benefit for Lucas?**

2026-01-28T19:59:45.812651 [actor]: jenny doesnt claim child benefit

2026-01-28T19:59:47.900216 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Jenny doesn't currently claim Child Benefit.

Let me ask you this:

**Why doesn't Jenny claim Child Benefit for Lucas? Is there a specific reason, such as her income being too high, or has she simply chosen not to claim it?**

2026-01-28T19:59:49.334338 [actor]: jenny not claiming dont know why

2026-01-28T19:59:51.440053 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now, let me ask you an important question about your own circumstances:

**Do you have Lucas living with you for any period of time - for example, does he stay with you on weekends, during school holidays, or for any regular periods?**

2026-01-28T19:59:52.838671 [actor]: no lucas doesnt stay with me

2026-01-28T19:59:57.707939 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Lucas doesn't stay with you.

Based on the information you've provided, let me explain your eligibility:

**You are not eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas.**

Here's why:

- Child Benefit is paid to the person who is responsible for the child and who the child normally lives with
- Lucas lives with Jenny (your ex-wife) full-time
- Jenny is the one who looks after Lucas day-to-day
- You don't have Lucas living with you for any period of time

Even though you contribute £150 per month towards Lucas's costs, this doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit because you're not the main carer and Lucas doesn't live with you.

**However**, Jenny would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas if she wanted to, since she is the one Lucas lives with and who provides his day-to-day care.

If Jenny is concerned about her income affecting her Child Benefit, she might want to check whether the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply to her (this affects households where someone earns over £60,000).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:00:04.147810 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated the user is not eligible for Child Benefit, but according to gov.uk guidance, a parent who doesn't live with the child can still claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay (currently around £25/week or ~£108/month for the eldest child). Since the user pays £150/month, which exceeds this threshold, and Jenny is not claiming it, the user would be eligible to claim.
