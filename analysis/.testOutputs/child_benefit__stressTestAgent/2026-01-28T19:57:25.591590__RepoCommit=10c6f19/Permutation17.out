2026-01-28T20:07:02.204669 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you are responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:07:05.740072 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you a specific question to understand your situation better:

**Are you currently living in Germany as part of the UK armed forces (or as a family member of someone serving in the UK armed forces)?**

2026-01-28T20:07:07.370201 [actor]: yes armmed forces base kids wife germany

2026-01-28T20:07:09.689533 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you're in the UK armed forces, based in Germany, with children and a wife.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you or your wife responsible for the child or children - meaning do you live with them and are you paying for their upbringing (things like food, clothes, and other costs)?**

2026-01-28T20:07:11.127197 [actor]: kids 8 and 10 yrs live with base

2026-01-28T20:07:13.374360 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you have two children aged 8 and 10 who live with you on the base in Germany.

Let me ask you:

**Is either you or your wife receiving any similar family benefits or allowances from the German government for these children?**

2026-01-28T20:07:14.886803 [actor]: no german benifits just uk militery

2026-01-28T20:07:16.720982 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're not receiving German benefits, only UK military benefits.

Let me ask you one more important question:

**Do you or your wife have UK National Insurance contributions, or are either of you entitled to work in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:07:18.585946 [actor]: yes UK natinal insurence contributions work uk

2026-01-28T20:07:22.535450 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ You have children under 16 (aged 8 and 10)
✓ You are responsible for them - they live with you and you're paying for their upbringing
✓ You have UK National Insurance contributions
✓ You're not receiving similar benefits from Germany for these children
✓ As a member of the UK armed forces serving abroad, you can claim Child Benefit even though you're living in Germany

The UK allows armed forces personnel stationed overseas to claim Child Benefit for their children, as long as they meet the other eligibility criteria - which you do.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the claiming process?**

2026-01-28T20:07:27.688848 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a UK armed forces member stationed in Germany with two children aged 8 and 10, who has UK National Insurance contributions and is not receiving German benefits, is eligible for Child Benefit, which is correct according to UK government rules for armed forces personnel serving abroad.
