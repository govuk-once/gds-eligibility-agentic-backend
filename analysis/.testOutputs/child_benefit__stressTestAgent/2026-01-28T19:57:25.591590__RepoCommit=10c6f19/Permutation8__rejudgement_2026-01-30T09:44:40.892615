**Justification:** The agent correctly communicated that the user is eligible for Child Benefit but subject to a tax charge. 

The agent:
1. Confirmed eligibility to claim Child Benefit for Ruby (4 years old)
2. Identified that the user's income of £75,000 triggers the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC)
3. Explained that at £75,000 income, the user would pay back the full amount through the tax charge
4. Provided clear options: claim and pay back via tax, or claim but opt out of payments

This outcome aligns with the expected result: **Eligible (but subject to tax charge)**. The user earns £75,000, which is between the £60,000 threshold (note: the agent mentioned £50,000, which was the old threshold, but the conclusion remains correct) and £80,000 upper limit, making them eligible but subject to HICBC that claws back a portion (in this case, all) of the benefit.
