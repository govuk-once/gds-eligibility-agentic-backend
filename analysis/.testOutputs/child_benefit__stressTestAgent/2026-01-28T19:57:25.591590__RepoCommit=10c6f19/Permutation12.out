2026-01-28T20:03:49.423789 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T20:03:50.841301 [actor]: child in educaton a levels

2026-01-28T20:03:53.404995 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child doing A-levels.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for this child? This means do you live with them and are you the main person looking after them (paying for things like food, clothes, and their general care)?

2026-01-28T20:03:54.984963 [actor]: yes live with child

2026-01-28T20:04:07.511280 [root_agent]: Good, thank you. So you live with your child and are responsible for them.

Now I need to ask: Do you normally live in the UK? (This means the UK is your main home where you usually live)

2026-01-28T20:04:08.885636 [actor]: yes uk live here

2026-01-28T20:04:10.628942 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for this same child?

2026-01-28T20:04:11.941903 [actor]: no one else claiming

2026-01-28T20:04:16.622084 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for answering those questions.

Based on what you've told me:
- You have a child doing A-levels (so under 20 and in approved education)
- You live with the child and are responsible for them
- You normally live in the UK
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

You meet the main criteria:
- You're responsible for a child under 20 who is in approved education (A-levels qualify)
- You live in the UK
- You live with the child
- No one else is claiming for them

You can apply for Child Benefit. However, please be aware that if you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year, you may need to pay some or all of the Child Benefit back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge when you complete your tax return.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:04:21.079376 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" but the agent concluded "You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" based on the information provided in the dialogue.
