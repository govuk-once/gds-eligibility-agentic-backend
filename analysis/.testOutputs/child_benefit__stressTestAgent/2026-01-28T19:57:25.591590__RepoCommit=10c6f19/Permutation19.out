2026-01-28T20:08:14.593846 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:08:16.868293 [actor]: child benefit eligiblity daghter 9 yrs

2026-01-28T20:08:19.150268 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 9-year-old daughter, which means you meet the basic age requirement.

Next question: **Are you responsible for this child? This means do you live with your daughter and are you the person who is mainly looking after her?**

2026-01-28T20:08:20.587779 [actor]: she stays with me 3 days her mum 4 days we both buy stuff

2026-01-28T20:08:22.803852 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is an important detail as it affects eligibility.

When a child's time is split between parents, **only one person can claim Child Benefit for that child**. 

Let me ask: **Has your daughter's mother already claimed Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-28T20:08:24.397178 [actor]: we both submitted claims cant agree who shoudl get it

2026-01-28T20:08:27.830131 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand this is a difficult situation when both parents have submitted claims.

Since you both submitted claims and can't agree, the decision will be made based on specific rules. When parents can't agree and both have claimed, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will decide who gets Child Benefit based on who has **main responsibility** for the child.

To help determine main responsibility, let me ask: **Who does your daughter spend most nights with during the week?** 

(You mentioned she stays with you 3 days and her mum 4 days - so it sounds like she spends more nights with her mother, is that correct?)

2026-01-28T20:08:29.410910 [actor]: yes she sleeps at her mums 4 nights mine 3 nights

2026-01-28T20:08:33.961794 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. This is a key factor in determining eligibility.

Based on the information you've provided:

- Your daughter spends **4 nights with her mother and 3 nights with you**
- You both contribute to buying things for her
- Both of you have submitted claims

In situations where parents share care and can't agree, HMRC will typically award Child Benefit to the person the child lives with for the **greater number of nights**. Since your daughter spends more nights (4) with her mother compared to you (3), **her mother would likely be awarded the Child Benefit**.

However, HMRC will make the final decision and will contact both of you about this. They may ask for more information about the care arrangements.

**Is there anything else about your situation that you think might be relevant to your claim, such as who is registered for things like the child's school, GP, or who receives other benefits for her?**

2026-01-28T20:08:37.210603 [actor]: ok thanks understand now hmrc will decide

2026-01-28T20:08:40.339510 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that when parents share care and both have claimed, only one person can receive Child Benefit, and HMRC awards it to the parent with whom the child spends the most nights. Since the daughter spends 4 nights with her mother versus 3 nights with the user, the agent correctly concluded that the mother would likely be awarded the benefit, with HMRC making the final decision.
