**Justification:**

The agent's determination **does not agree** with the expected outcome. Here's why:

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)

**Agent's Determination:** Not eligible

**The Critical Error:**

The agent failed to recognize and apply the **Extension Period** provision for 16-17 year olds who have left education and registered with an approved careers service. According to the scenario details and Gov.UK guidance, there is a special extension that allows Child Benefit to continue for up to 20 weeks after a young person leaves education if they:

1. Are 16 or 17 years old
2. Have left approved education or training
3. Are registered with an approved careers service (like Connexions)

**What the agent got wrong:**

The agent stated: "Being registered with the careers service while looking for work or an apprenticeship unfortunately does not qualify as 'approved education or training' for Child Benefit purposes."

This is **incorrect**. While registration with a careers service isn't the same as being in education, it does qualify the claimant for the **20-week extension period** specifically designed for this situation.

**The correct assessment should have been:**

Gary is eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when Ben left education in June, because Ben is 17, registered with the careers service, and it's currently August (within the 20-week window).

The original judge's assessment appears to have been based on different criteria than what the scenario specified.
