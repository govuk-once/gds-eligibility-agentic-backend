**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct eligibility determination:** The agent properly identified that all criteria were met:
   - Child under 16 (4 years old) ✓
   - Applicant is responsible for the child ✓
   - UK residency ✓
   - No one else claiming ✓
   - Adoption placement status addressed correctly ✓

2. **Crucially correct adoption guidance:** The agent explicitly and correctly stated: *"You don't need to wait for the final adoption order to claim Child Benefit. When a child is placed with you for adoption by an adoption agency (even before the adoption is legally finalized), you can claim Child Benefit as long as you're responsible for the child."*

   This directly aligns with the scenario's Criteria 2, which confirms: "You can claim Child Benefit **as soon as any child you're adopting comes to live with you**. You do not have to wait for the final order."

3. **Clear communication:** The agent communicated the eligible outcome clearly with "Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit!"

The agent's assessment matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** and demonstrates accurate understanding of Child Benefit rules for prospective adopters.
