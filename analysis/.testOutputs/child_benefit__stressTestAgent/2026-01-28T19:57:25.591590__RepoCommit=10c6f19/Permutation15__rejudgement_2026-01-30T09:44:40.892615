**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct application of the responsibility test**: The agent properly identified that when a child does not live with the claimant, the claimant must contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate to be considered "responsible" for the child.

2. **Accurate assessment of contributions**: The agent correctly noted that:
   - The user contributes £10/week for food
   - The Child Benefit rate is £25.60/week (the agent used this figure; the scenario states £26.05/week, but both are reasonable current rates)
   - £10/week is insufficient to meet the threshold

3. **Correct conclusion**: The agent clearly stated "you would not be eligible for Child Benefit" and explained that the mother (with whom the child lives) would be the eligible person to claim.

4. **Clear communication**: The agent provided a well-structured explanation with numbered reasons, making the outcome unambiguous.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that Mike is **Not Eligible** due to insufficient contribution (£10/week vs. the required £26.05/week minimum).
