2026-01-28T20:08:42.630900 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 living with you (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:08:44.079140 [actor]: granddaughter living with me 14 years old

2026-01-28T20:08:46.692079 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

So you have your 14-year-old granddaughter living with you. Let me ask the next question:

**Are you responsible for your granddaughter? This means you're the main person looking after her day-to-day care and making decisions about her upbringing.**

2026-01-28T20:08:48.299534 [actor]: yes i pay for evrything she needs

2026-01-28T20:08:49.785506 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know. Let me continue with the next important question:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:08:51.182893 [actor]: uk resident yes

2026-01-28T20:08:53.127498 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Now I need to ask:

**Is your granddaughter's parent (your child or their partner) also living in the same household with you and your granddaughter?**

2026-01-28T20:08:54.792951 [actor]: no parents cant look after her

2026-01-28T20:08:56.501703 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Let me ask another important question:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your granddaughter?**

2026-01-28T20:08:57.800779 [actor]: no one else claiming

2026-01-28T20:08:59.737302 [root_agent]: Thank you. I have a few more questions to determine your eligibility. 

**What is your immigration status? Are you a UK citizen, or do you have settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or any other immigration status in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:09:01.191843 [actor]: uk citizen born here

2026-01-28T20:09:02.928345 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you. Just a couple more questions:

**Does your granddaughter spend any time living with anyone else, or does she live with you full-time?**

2026-01-28T20:09:04.574644 [actor]: lives with me fulltime no one else

2026-01-28T20:09:06.499191 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for all that information. One final question:

**Is your granddaughter currently in hospital for more than 12 weeks, or in local authority care, or in any form of detention?**

2026-01-28T20:09:07.822792 [actor]: no shes at home with me goes to school

2026-01-28T20:09:12.798886 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

**Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit!**

Here's why:
- ✓ You have a 14-year-old child (your granddaughter) living with you
- ✓ You are responsible for her - you're the main person caring for her and paying for what she needs
- ✓ You live in the UK and are a UK citizen
- ✓ She lives with you full-time
- ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
- ✓ She is not in hospital long-term, care, or detention

As the person responsible for your granddaughter, you can claim Child Benefit even though you're her grandparent rather than her parent. The key factors are that you're the main person looking after her and she lives with you.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for your granddaughter. Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T20:09:17.464612 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a UK citizen grandparent who is the primary caregiver for their 14-year-old granddaughter living with them full-time, with no one else claiming, is eligible for Child Benefit.
