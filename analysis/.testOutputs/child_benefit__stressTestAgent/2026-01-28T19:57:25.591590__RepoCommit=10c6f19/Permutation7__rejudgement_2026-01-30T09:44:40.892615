**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user is **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is that the user is **Eligible (via Exception)**.

According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit for children in hospital or care (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), there is a specific exception to the 8-week rule: parents can continue to receive Child Benefit if the child spends **at least one night a week at home** or **at least 2 nights in a row**.

The user clearly stated multiple times that their son "comes home weekends Friday to Sunday" and specifically "stays 2 nights friday saturdai at home every week." This satisfies the exception criteria - the child spends 2 consecutive nights at home every week.

The agent failed to recognize or apply this exception, despite the user explicitly emphasizing the weekend stays. Instead, the agent focused on the concept of "main residence" and incorrectly concluded the user was not eligible. The agent should have identified that while the child has been in care for more than 8 weeks (3 months), the regular weekend stays of 2 consecutive nights trigger the exception that allows Child Benefit to continue.

The agent's final determination directly contradicts the expected outcome of "Eligible (via Exception)."
