**Justification:**

The agent **incorrectly communicated the eligibility outcome**. According to the scenario and official UK government guidance, Child Benefit eligibility **ceases on the child's 20th birthday**, even if the child is still in approved full-time education.

**Key errors in the agent's assessment:**

1. The agent stated multiple times that the claimant "appears to be eligible" and "you ARE eligible for Child Benefit" for the 20-year-old son
2. The agent incorrectly listed "✓ Your son is under 20 years old" as a criterion met, when the user explicitly stated their son is "20 yrs old"
3. The agent focused extensively on the High Income Child Benefit Charge (which is irrelevant if the claimant is not eligible in the first place)

**The correct outcome should have been:**

The claimant is **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit because their son has already turned 20. Once a child reaches their 20th birthday, Child Benefit stops automatically, regardless of whether they are still completing their A-levels or other approved education.

The agent's judgement contradicts the expected outcome: **Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)**.
