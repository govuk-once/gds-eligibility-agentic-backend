**Justification:**

The expected outcome is: **Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible.**

In the transcript, the user is Pete (the father who has the child 3 nights per week), and Sue is the mother who has the child 4 nights per week.

The agent correctly explained that:
- Only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child
- When parents cannot agree, HMRC decides based on who has main responsibility
- The child lives with the mother more nights (4 vs 3)
- The mother would likely be awarded the Child Benefit

However, the agent did **not clearly communicate Pete's ineligibility**. The agent said the mother "would likely be awarded" the benefit and that "HMRC will make the final decision," but never explicitly stated that Pete (the user) is **not eligible** or that his claim would be rejected.

The agent left the outcome somewhat ambiguous by using language like "would likely" and emphasizing that HMRC will decide, rather than clearly stating that Pete does not meet the eligibility criteria because Sue has main responsibility. While the agent implied the correct outcome, they did not communicate Pete's ineligibility definitively enough to match the expected outcome that "Pete is Not Eligible."
