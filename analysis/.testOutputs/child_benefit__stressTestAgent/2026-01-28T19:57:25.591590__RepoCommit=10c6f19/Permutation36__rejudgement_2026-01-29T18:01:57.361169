**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Age criterion met**: The daughter is 16 years old (under 20) ✓

2. **Education continuity**: The agent correctly identified that the daughter has been accepted into college for A-levels starting in September, which constitutes approved education ✓

3. **Summer gap handled correctly**: Most importantly, the agent explicitly stated: "The gap between finishing her GCSEs in June and starting college in September shouldn't affect your eligibility, as this is a normal transition period between stages of education." This directly addresses the core concern of the scenario ✓

4. **Other eligibility criteria confirmed**: The agent verified residency in the UK, responsibility for care, and that the user is the sole guardian ✓

According to [UK government guidance](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), Child Benefit continues for young people aged 16-19 in approved education or training, and the transition period between courses (such as the summer gap between GCSEs and A-levels) does not terminate eligibility.

The agent's conclusion that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" correctly matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
