**Justification:**

The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that **agrees with the expected outcome of "Eligible (via Exception)"**.

The agent correctly:

1. **Identified the exception rule** - While children who are married generally cannot be claimed for, the agent recognized the specific exception that applies when the child was already in approved education before marriage and continued without a break.

2. **Gathered the necessary facts** - The agent systematically asked whether:
   - Rashid was in approved education (A-levels) ✓
   - He was married ✓
   - He lived with the claimant ✓
   - The claimant was responsible for him ✓
   - Critically: Whether he started education BEFORE marriage and continued without a break ✓

3. **Applied the exception correctly** - The agent explicitly stated: "although Rashid is married, he was already in approved education (A-levels) **before** he got married and has continued without a break. According to the eligibility rules, you can still claim Child Benefit in these circumstances."

4. **Communicated clear eligibility** - The agent clearly concluded "You should be eligible for Child Benefit for Rashid" with proper justification.

This matches the expected outcome where the married child exception applies because Rashid lives with his parents, they support him, and he was in approved education before marriage and continued without interruption.
