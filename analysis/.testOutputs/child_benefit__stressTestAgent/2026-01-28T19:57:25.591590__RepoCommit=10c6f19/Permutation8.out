2026-01-28T20:01:45.814243 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:01:47.312492 [actor]: child benefit ruby 4 years old eligibel

2026-01-28T20:01:49.155331 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child named Ruby who is 4 years old, and you'd like to know if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Is Ruby living with you, or do you have main responsibility for her care?**

2026-01-28T20:01:50.728122 [actor]: yes ruby lives with me responsibile for her

2026-01-28T20:01:53.092809 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that Ruby lives with you and you're responsible for her.

Next question:

**Are you or your partner responsible for Ruby? In other words, are you the only person claiming Child Benefit for her, or is someone else (like another parent or guardian) already claiming Child Benefit for Ruby?**

2026-01-28T20:01:54.943216 [actor]: me and james both live with ruby no one else claiming

2026-01-28T20:01:56.882917 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you and James both live with Ruby, and no one else is claiming Child Benefit for her.

Let me ask you:

**Between you and James, who would be making the Child Benefit claim? (Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, even if you both live together and share responsibility.)**

2026-01-28T20:01:58.265810 [actor]: me i want to cliam child benefit

2026-01-28T20:02:00.783819 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for clarifying that you want to be the one to claim Child Benefit for Ruby.

Now, let me ask you an important question about your income:

**Do you or James have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

(This is important because it may affect whether you need to pay a tax charge, though it doesn't stop you from claiming Child Benefit itself.)

2026-01-28T20:02:02.128034 [actor]: james earns 20000 i earn more

2026-01-28T20:02:03.914388 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. James earns £20,000, and you earn more than that.

I need to know specifically about your income:

**Do you earn more than £50,000 per year?**

2026-01-28T20:02:05.290837 [actor]: yes i earn 75000 per year does that mater

2026-01-28T20:02:11.354393 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Yes, it does matter, and I'll explain why.

Based on what you've told me, **you are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ruby**. However, because you earn £75,000 per year (which is over £50,000), there's an important point you need to know:

- You will need to pay a tax charge called the "High Income Child Benefit Charge"
- Since your income is higher than James's income (£75,000 vs £20,000), and you're the one claiming, this charge will apply to you
- The charge works out to be 1% of the Child Benefit for every £100 earned over £50,000
- At £75,000, you'd pay back all of the Child Benefit through this tax charge

You have two options:
1. **Claim Child Benefit and pay the tax charge** - You'd receive the payments but pay it all back through your tax return
2. **Claim Child Benefit but opt not to receive the payments** - This way you're registered (which protects your National Insurance credits and your child's National Insurance record), but you don't receive payments and don't have to pay them back

**Do you have any questions about this, or is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?**

2026-01-28T20:02:12.847766 [actor]: so i can claim child benefit yes or no

2026-01-28T20:02:14.715293 [root_agent]: **Yes, you can claim Child Benefit for Ruby.**

However, because you earn £75,000 per year, you would have to pay back the full amount through the High Income Child Benefit Charge when you complete your tax return.

2026-01-28T20:02:20.252149 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately established that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for their 4-year-old child Ruby who lives with them, and correctly identified that a tax charge applies due to the user's income of £75,000 exceeding the £50,000 threshold, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)."
