2026-01-28T20:02:22.155656 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:02:23.682559 [actor]: child benefit son 5 yrs old lookng for wrk

2026-01-28T20:02:25.794487 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 5-year-old son, which means you do have a child under 16.

Now, let me ask you this: **Does your son normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards his upkeep?**

2026-01-28T20:02:27.371418 [actor]: son lives with me germn citizen pre settld status

2026-01-28T20:02:29.722456 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son lives with you, and you mentioned you have pre-settled status as a German citizen.

Next question: **Are you currently working in the UK, or have you worked in the UK at any point since arriving?**

(This will help me understand your right to reside status, which is important for Child Benefit eligibility for those with pre-settled status.)

2026-01-28T20:02:31.342205 [actor]: not wrking now registred jobseekr actve looking for job

2026-01-28T20:02:33.706812 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. You're registered as a jobseeker and actively looking for work.

Let me ask: **Have you worked in the UK at all in the past, or have you only recently arrived in the UK?**

This is important because people with pre-settled status who are jobseekers may have a right to reside for Child Benefit purposes if they have previously worked in the UK.

2026-01-28T20:02:35.215884 [actor]: recently moved to uk registred jobseekr genuien prospect of work

2026-01-28T20:02:37.068558 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You've recently moved to the UK and are registered as a jobseeker with genuine prospects of work.

One more important question: **Are you receiving any UK benefits or support currently, such as Universal Credit, Income Support, or any other benefits?**

This will help me determine your right to reside status for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-28T20:02:38.697696 [actor]: need to know if eligble for child beneffit pre settled status jobseeekr son 5

2026-01-28T20:02:40.848768 [root_agent]: I understand you need to know about your eligibility. Let me clarify one point before I can give you a proper assessment:

**Are you currently receiving any UK benefits at all (such as Universal Credit, Income Support, Housing Benefit, or any other benefits), or are you only registered as a jobseeker without receiving any benefits yet?**

This distinction is crucial for determining your right to reside status for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-28T20:02:42.319737 [actor]: only registred as jobseekr no benefts yet actve looking work

2026-01-28T20:02:46.942259 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your situation based on what you've told me.

**Based on your circumstances, I'm afraid you are likely NOT currently eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

You have pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme and are registered as a jobseeker actively looking for work. However, you:
- Have recently moved to the UK
- Have not worked in the UK yet
- Are not currently receiving any UK benefits

For Child Benefit eligibility, you need to have a "right to reside" in the UK. While you have pre-settled status, being a jobseeker alone (without having previously worked in the UK) typically does NOT give you the right to reside for the purposes of claiming Child Benefit.

**However, your situation may change if:**
- You find employment in the UK - once you start working, you would likely gain the right to reside and become eligible for Child Benefit
- You gain settled status (after 5 years of continuous residence)

My recommendation would be to apply for Child Benefit once you secure employment, as this would establish your right to reside for benefit purposes.

Does this help clarify your situation?

2026-01-28T20:02:48.644615 [actor]: ok so not eligble now but can apply when get job understnd thanks

2026-01-28T20:02:51.907991 [root_agent]: Yes, that's exactly right! You've understood it correctly.

Once you get a job, you should be able to apply for Child Benefit as your employment will establish your right to reside for benefit purposes.

When you do find work and want to apply, you can do so through the government's Child Benefit application process. The benefit is worth claiming - it's currently £25.60 per week for your first or only child.

Good luck with your job search, and I hope you find employment soon!

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like to know?

2026-01-28T20:02:53.656163 [actor]: no thats all i needed thank you

2026-01-28T20:02:57.120707 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, EEA citizens with pre-settled status who are registered jobseekers with genuine prospects of work DO have a right to reside for Child Benefit purposes, making them eligible even without prior UK employment.
