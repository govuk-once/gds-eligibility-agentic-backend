**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct handling of adoption allowance:** The agent properly distinguished between an adoption allowance and a fostering allowance, correctly stating that "receiving an adoption allowance from the council does not automatically prevent you from claiming Child Benefit - these are separate benefits and you may be entitled to both."

2. **Proper eligibility criteria verification:** The agent systematically verified:
   - Children under 16 (ages 6 and 8) ✓
   - User is responsible for the children ✓
   - Children live with the user ✓
   - User lives in the UK ✓
   - No one else is claiming Child Benefit ✓

3. **Clear final determination:** The agent explicitly stated "**You are eligible to claim Child Benefit for both of your children**" and reiterated that "The adoption allowance you receive from the council does not affect your right to claim Child Benefit."

4. **Income assessment:** While the agent asked about income (for High Income Child Benefit Charge purposes), this was appropriately explained as not affecting eligibility itself, only potential tax implications.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**, and the reasoning provided was accurate according to UK Child Benefit rules regarding adoption allowances.
