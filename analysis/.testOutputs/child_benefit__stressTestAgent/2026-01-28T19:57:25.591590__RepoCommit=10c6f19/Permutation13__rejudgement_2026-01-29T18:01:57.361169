**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct eligibility determination**: The agent properly identified that all criteria were met:
   - Child under 16 (4 years old) ✓
   - Responsible for the child (paying for food, clothes, housing) ✓
   - UK resident ✓
   - No one else claiming ✓
   - Child placed by adoption agency ✓

2. **Critically important**: The agent **correctly applied the adoption placement rule**, stating: *"You don't need to wait for the final adoption order to claim Child Benefit. When a child is placed with you for adoption by an adoption agency (even before the adoption is legally finalized), you can claim Child Benefit as long as you're responsible for the child."*

3. This aligns perfectly with the scenario's Criteria 2, which confirms: "You can claim Child Benefit **as soon as any child you're adopting comes to live with you**. You do not have to wait for the final order."

4. The agent's conclusion of eligibility matches the expected outcome: **Eligible**.

The evaluation judge also confirmed this with a ✓, and my independent assessment agrees that the agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome.
