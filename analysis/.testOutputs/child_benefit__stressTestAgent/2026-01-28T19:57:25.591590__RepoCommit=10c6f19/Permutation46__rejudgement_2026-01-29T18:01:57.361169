**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly assessed the user as eligible for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Not Eligible (Expired)**.

The critical error is in the agent's understanding of the time-limited nature of the "jobseeker" right to reside for those with pre-settled status. The specific facts are:

1. The user has pre-settled status (not settled/full status)
2. The user has been unemployed and looking for work for **95 days**
3. The user was previously working for 6 months before stopping

The key rule that the agent missed is that individuals with pre-settled status claiming as jobseekers can only maintain their right to reside for Child Benefit purposes for up to **91 days**. After this period expires, unless they have:
- A genuine prospect of work (such as a job offer), or
- Other qualifying resources/status

...their right to reside for benefit purposes ends.

Since the user has been unemployed for **95 days** (which exceeds the 91-day limit) and there is no indication of an imminent job offer or other qualifying circumstances, their jobseeker-based right to reside has expired. Therefore, they are **not eligible** for Child Benefit.

The agent should have identified this time limit issue and communicated that the user's eligibility had expired after exceeding 91 days as a jobseeker.
