**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit because the child lives with the aunt who provides day-to-day care. However, according to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, a person can still claim Child Benefit for a child not living with them if they **contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit** (£26.05 for the eldest/only child) toward the child's upkeep.

In this scenario:
- Mo contributes £15/week
- Mo's mother (the child's grandmother) contributes £15/week  
- **Total contributions = £30/week**, which exceeds the £26.05 threshold

The guidance explicitly states: "Your contributions still count if more than one person is contributing towards the cost of looking after the child." Therefore, **Mo is eligible** to claim Child Benefit because the combined contributions from him and his mother meet the financial threshold, and the aunt is not claiming.

The agent incorrectly stated that "the amount of money contributed doesn't determine who can claim Child Benefit" and focused solely on who provides day-to-day care. This contradicts the specific provision for parents who contribute financially when the child lives elsewhere.

**Expected outcome:** Eligible  
**Agent's communicated outcome:** Not eligible  
**These outcomes do not agree.**
