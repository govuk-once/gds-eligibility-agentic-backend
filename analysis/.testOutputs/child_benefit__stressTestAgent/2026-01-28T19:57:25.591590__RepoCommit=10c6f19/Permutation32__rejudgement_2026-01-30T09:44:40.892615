**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user **is eligible** for Child Benefit, stating that "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and that "your son is under 20 and in approved education or training (GCSEs count as approved education)."

However, the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

The critical error is in the agent's assessment of "approved education." According to the scenario details, John's course involves only **6 hours of supervised study a week**. To qualify as approved education for Child Benefit purposes when a child is 16-19 years old, the course must involve **more than 12 hours a week** of supervised study or course-related work experience. 

The agent failed to inquire about the number of hours of supervised study per week, which is essential information for determining eligibility. By assuming that any GCSE course qualifies as "approved education" without verifying the hours requirement, the agent provided an incorrect eligibility determination.

The agent's communicated outcome (Eligible) **does not agree** with the expected outcome (Not Eligible).
