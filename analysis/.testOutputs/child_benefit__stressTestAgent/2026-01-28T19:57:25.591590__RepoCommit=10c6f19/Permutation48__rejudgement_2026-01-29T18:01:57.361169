**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of course level**: The agent properly identified that an HNC (Higher National Certificate) is classified as "advanced education" - above A-level standard (Level 4 qualification).

2. **Accurate application of rules**: The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds only continues for:
   - Non-advanced education (up to and including A-level/Level 3 standard)
   - Certain approved training programs

3. **Clear outcome communication**: The agent explicitly stated: "Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter in this situation."

4. **Proper explanation**: The agent provided a clear rationale explaining why the HNC course does not qualify as "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes, noting it is advanced education beyond the eligibility threshold.

5. **Consistency with gov.uk guidance**: According to official guidance, Child Benefit stops when a young person starts advanced education (above A-level standard), which includes HNCs and university degrees.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**, and the reasoning provided is sound and accurate.
