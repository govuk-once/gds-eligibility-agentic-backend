**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit in their current circumstances as a pre-settled status holder who is a registered jobseeker without prior UK employment.

However, the expected outcome is that the user should be **Eligible**.

According to the Gov.UK guidance on Child Benefit eligibility and the EU Settlement Scheme, EEA citizens with pre-settled status who are registered jobseekers with a genuine prospect of work DO have a qualifying right to reside for Child Benefit purposes. The user explicitly stated they are "registred jobseekr genuien prospect of work," which should meet the criteria.

The agent's assessment was incorrect - they failed to recognize that being a registered jobseeker with genuine prospects of work is itself a qualifying right to reside test for pre-settled status holders, even without prior UK employment history.

**Wait - I need to reconsider my symbol choice based on the instructions:**

The instructions ask whether the agent communicated an eligibility outcome that **agrees** with the expected outcome (Eligible). 

The agent said the user is NOT eligible, but the expected outcome is Eligible. These do NOT agree.

Therefore: 👎
