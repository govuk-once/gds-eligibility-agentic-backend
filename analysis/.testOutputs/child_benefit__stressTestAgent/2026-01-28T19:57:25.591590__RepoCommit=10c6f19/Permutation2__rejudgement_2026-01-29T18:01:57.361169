**Justification:** The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

The agent properly assessed all relevant eligibility criteria:
1. **Responsibility**: Confirmed the applicant is responsible for the child
2. **Age and Education**: Correctly identified that the 17-year-old daughter is under 20 and in approved full-time education (A-levels), which qualifies under the extended age criteria
3. **Residency**: Confirmed UK residency in London with no immigration restrictions
4. **Living Arrangements**: Verified the daughter lives with the applicant
5. **Income consideration**: While not explicitly discussed, the scenario indicates income of £40,000, which is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold

The agent's conclusion that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" is accurate and matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**. The agent provided clear reasoning for the determination, listing all the criteria that were met.
