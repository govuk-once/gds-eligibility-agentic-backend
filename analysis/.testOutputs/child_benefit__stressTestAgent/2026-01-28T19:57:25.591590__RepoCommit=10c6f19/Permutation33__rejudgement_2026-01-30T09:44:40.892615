**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the applicant is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of the issue**: The agent identified that Bella is employed by the travel agency and that the employer pays for her training course.

2. **Accurate application of criteria**: The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds requires either:
   - Full-time non-advanced education (at school/college), OR
   - Approved training courses
   
   However, employer-funded training as part of paid employment does not qualify.

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "Bella would not qualify you for Child Benefit" and provided a clear explanation of why - that paid employment with employer-funded training doesn't meet the eligibility criteria.

4. **Alignment with expected outcome**: The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" based on Criteria 2 (Funding Source) - specifically that education counts as "approved" only if it is NOT paid for by an employer. The agent's determination matches this exactly.

The agent's judgement was accurate and well-communicated, correctly concluding that this family situation does not qualify for Child Benefit.
