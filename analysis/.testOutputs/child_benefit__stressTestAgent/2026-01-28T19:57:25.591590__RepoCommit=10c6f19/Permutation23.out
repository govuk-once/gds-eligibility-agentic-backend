2026-01-28T20:10:39.438020 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or children under 20 who are in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T20:10:40.775092 [actor]: child benefit groceries delivery daughter every month

2026-01-28T20:10:42.587000 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It sounds like you have a daughter, which is great.

To help assess your eligibility, could you tell me: **Is your daughter under 16 years old, or is she under 20 and in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:10:43.994228 [actor]: shes 12 dont live with her tho

2026-01-28T20:10:45.966983 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Your daughter is 12, so she's under 16. However, you mentioned she doesn't live with you.

Could you tell me: **Who does your daughter live with most of the time?** For example, does she live with her other parent, another family member, or someone else?

2026-01-28T20:10:47.305199 [actor]: lives with her mum i send stuff every 4 weeks

2026-01-28T20:10:49.828621 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your daughter lives with her mum, and you send things regularly.

Just to clarify: **Are you responsible for your daughter? By this I mean, do you contribute to the costs of raising her in some way, such as providing financial support or paying for things she needs?**

2026-01-28T20:10:51.743200 [actor]: yeah i buy grocerys and clothes 120 pounds every 4 weeks deliver to her mums place

2026-01-28T20:10:53.762731 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. It's clear you're contributing to your daughter's costs.

Now, an important question: **Does your daughter's mum currently claim Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-28T20:10:55.283893 [actor]: dunno maybe shes the one who lives with her

2026-01-28T20:10:59.719673 [root_agent]: I understand. That's an important point to clarify.

Here's what I need to explain: Generally, only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. Usually, this is the person the child lives with most of the time - which in your case would be your daughter's mum.

However, if your daughter's mum is **not** claiming Child Benefit, you might be able to claim it even though your daughter doesn't live with you, as long as you're contributing to her upbringing costs (which you are, with the £120 every 4 weeks).

**Could you find out whether your daughter's mum is currently claiming Child Benefit for her?** This is crucial because if she is already claiming it, you wouldn't be able to claim it as well. If she isn't claiming it, then you may be eligible to do so.

2026-01-28T20:11:01.261131 [actor]: can i claim it or not just tell me

2026-01-28T20:11:04.291348 [root_agent]: I understand you want a straightforward answer, but I need one crucial piece of information to give you an accurate response.

**The answer depends on whether your daughter's mum is already claiming Child Benefit for her.**

- **If her mum is already claiming it**: No, you cannot claim it - only one person can claim for the same child.

- **If her mum is NOT claiming it**: Yes, you could potentially claim it, since your daughter is under 16 and you contribute at least £120 every 4 weeks towards her costs.

You'll need to check with your daughter's mum whether she's claiming it. Without knowing this, I cannot give you a definitive yes or no answer.

2026-01-28T20:11:05.735378 [actor]: ok assume she doesnt claim it then am i eligble

2026-01-28T20:11:08.401258 [root_agent]: Based on the assumption that your daughter's mum is **not** claiming Child Benefit, I need to ask one more question before I can confirm your eligibility:

**Are you a UK resident, or do you live and work in the UK?**

This is important because to claim Child Benefit, you generally need to be responsible for a child (which you are) AND be living in the UK or have a specific connection to the UK through work or other circumstances.

2026-01-28T20:11:09.872628 [actor]: yeah i live here work here too

2026-01-28T20:11:13.439552 [root_agent]: Excellent. Based on everything you've told me, and **assuming your daughter's mum is not claiming Child Benefit for her**, then:

**Yes, you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit.**

Here's why:
- Your daughter is 12 (under 16) ✓
- You contribute to her costs (£120 every 4 weeks for groceries and clothes) ✓
- You live and work in the UK ✓
- Her mum is not claiming Child Benefit for her (based on your assumption) ✓

**Important reminder**: You must verify that her mum is definitely not claiming Child Benefit, as only one person can claim for the same child. If she is claiming it, you would not be eligible.

If she's not claiming it, you can apply for Child Benefit and should receive payments to help with the costs of raising your daughter.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:11:18.678066 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user would be eligible for Child Benefit under the stated assumption (that the mother is not claiming it), verified all necessary criteria (child under 16, UK residency, contributing to child's costs), and appropriately emphasized the critical caveat that only one person can claim per child.
