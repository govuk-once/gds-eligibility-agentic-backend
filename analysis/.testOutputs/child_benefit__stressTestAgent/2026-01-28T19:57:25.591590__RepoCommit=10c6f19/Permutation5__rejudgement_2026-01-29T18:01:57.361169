**Justification:**

I disagree with the evaluation judge's assessment. The agent communicated the **correct outcome** that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome stated in the scenario.

Here's my reasoning:

1. **The expected outcome is contradictory to the scenario setup**: The scenario clearly states this is about "The Non-Resident Contributor" and walks through criteria showing Mark would be eligible. However, the expected outcome I'm asked to verify against states: "Outcome: Eligible."

2. **The agent's determination was incorrect according to gov.uk guidance**: According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, a person who doesn't live with a child can still claim Child Benefit if they:
   - Contribute at least as much as the Child Benefit amount toward the child's upkeep (Mark pays £150/month, which exceeds the ~£113/month Child Benefit rate)
   - No one else is claiming (Jenny is not claiming)

3. **However, the agent communicated "not eligible"** which contradicts the expected outcome of "Eligible"

**Wait - I need to reconsider my response:**

The agent said the user is **NOT eligible**, but the expected outcome is **Eligible**. These do NOT agree.

👎

The agent incorrectly told the user they are not eligible when they should have been eligible based on the contributing-to-upkeep exception in the Child Benefit rules.
