2026-01-28T20:03:20.022667 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:03:21.578646 [actor]: son 17 appremtice training

2026-01-28T20:03:23.571632 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old son who is doing an apprentice training.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-28T20:03:24.870069 [actor]: yes live uk karen

2026-01-28T20:03:27.085537 [root_agent]: Thank you, Karen. So you live in the UK and have a 17-year-old son in apprentice training.

Next question: Does your son live with you, or if not, do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards his upkeep?

2026-01-28T20:03:28.516981 [actor]: son lives home ryan

2026-01-28T20:03:30.107588 [root_agent]: Thank you, Karen. Just to clarify - does your son Ryan live at home with you?

2026-01-28T20:03:31.421692 [actor]: yes ryan home with me

2026-01-28T20:03:33.906070 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that Ryan lives at home with you.

Now I need to ask: Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on accessing public funds as part of your immigration status?

2026-01-28T20:03:35.287880 [actor]: no immigration uk citizen born here

2026-01-28T20:03:37.084748 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

One more important question: Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Ryan?

2026-01-28T20:03:38.493115 [actor]: no just me only one claiming

2026-01-28T20:03:41.788285 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information, Karen.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You have a child (Ryan, age 17) who is under 20 and in approved training (apprenticeship)
2. ✓ Ryan lives with you
3. ✓ You live in the UK
4. ✓ You're a UK citizen with no immigration restrictions
5. ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Ryan

You meet the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. You should be able to make a claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:03:47.558257 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to UK government guidance, apprenticeships are paid employment and do not count as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes - only unpaid approved training qualifies. Since Ryan is 17 and doing an apprenticeship (which is paid work), he does not meet the criteria for extended Child Benefit beyond age 16.
