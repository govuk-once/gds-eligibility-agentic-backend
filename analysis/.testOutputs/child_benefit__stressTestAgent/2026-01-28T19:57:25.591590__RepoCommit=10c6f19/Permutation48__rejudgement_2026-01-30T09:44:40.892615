**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of HNC as advanced education:** The agent properly recognized that an HNC (Higher National Certificate) is classified as advanced education (Level 4), which is above A-level standard (Level 3).

2. **Accurate application of eligibility rules:** The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds only continues for non-advanced education (up to and including A-level standard) or certain approved training programs.

3. **Clear communication:** The agent explicitly stated "Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter in this situation" and provided a thorough explanation of why.

4. **Consistency with gov.uk guidance:** According to official guidance, Child Benefit stops when a young person starts advanced education (such as university or higher education courses). An HNC at Level 4 falls into this category.

The evaluation judge also confirmed this with a ✓, noting the agent "correctly determined my eligibility" and "accurately identified that HNC courses are advanced education."

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome: **Not Eligible.**
