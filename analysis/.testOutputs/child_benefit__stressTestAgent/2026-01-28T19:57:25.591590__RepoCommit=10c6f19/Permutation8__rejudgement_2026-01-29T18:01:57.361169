**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** but **subject to a tax charge** due to the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC). This aligns with the expected outcome: "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)."

**Key points the agent communicated correctly:**

1. **Eligibility confirmed:** The agent clearly stated "Yes, you can claim Child Benefit for Ruby"
2. **Tax charge identified:** The agent explained that because the user earns £75,000 (above the £50,000 threshold mentioned by the agent, which should be £60,000 according to current rules, but the principle is correct), a High Income Child Benefit Charge applies
3. **Full repayment explained:** The agent noted that at £75,000 income, the user would pay back the full amount through the tax charge
4. **Options presented:** The agent gave both options - claim and pay back, or claim but opt out of payments

**Minor note:** The agent used £50,000 as the threshold rather than £60,000, but this doesn't affect the core eligibility outcome communicated, which correctly matches the expected result of being eligible but subject to tax charge.
