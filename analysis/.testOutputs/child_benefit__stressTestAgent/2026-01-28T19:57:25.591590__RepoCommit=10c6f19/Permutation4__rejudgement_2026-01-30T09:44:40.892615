**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Child's Age and Education Status**: Sofia is 18 years old, left school 2 years ago, and is working 30 hours per week as a receptionist with no current educational courses.

2. **Eligibility Criteria**: According to [gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. Sofia does not meet these criteria as she is neither under 16 nor in approved education/training.

3. **Agent's Assessment**: The agent clearly stated: "Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit" and provided accurate reasoning about why Sofia doesn't qualify (she's 18, left education, and is working rather than studying).

4. **Additional Consideration**: The agent also appropriately noted that working 24+ hours per week typically disqualifies eligibility even if some education were involved, though this wasn't the primary barrier in this case.

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
