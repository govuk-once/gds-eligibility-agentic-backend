2026-01-29T10:20:08.775341 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you are responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:20:10.398918 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Dev, who's currently studying for his A-levels.

2026-01-29T10:20:12.679768 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know you have a son, Dev, who is studying for his A-levels.

Let me ask the next question:

**Does Dev normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit to the cost of supporting him?**

2026-01-29T10:20:14.432816 [actor]: Yes, Dev lives with me. I'm his father and he's been living at home while he completes his studies.

2026-01-29T10:20:16.153375 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Now, let me ask:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:20:17.632008 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:20:19.358989 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question:

**Is Dev under the age of 20?**

2026-01-29T10:20:21.621477 [actor]: Well, that's actually why I'm asking. He just turned 20 recently. He's still in the middle of his A-level course though - he hasn't finished yet.

2026-01-29T10:20:23.867568 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is an important detail.

Let me ask you:

**When exactly did Dev turn 20? I need to know the specific date, as the rules about Child Benefit when a young person turns 20 depend on the timing in relation to their education.**

2026-01-29T10:20:25.492400 [actor]: He turned 20 about two weeks ago, in the middle of the term.

2026-01-29T10:20:28.313751 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is important for determining your eligibility.

Let me ask you one more question:

**Is Dev enrolled in approved education or training that is not higher education? To clarify, A-levels would normally count as approved education, but I need to confirm: is he studying full-time (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience)?**

2026-01-29T10:20:30.024279 [actor]: Yes, he's studying full-time for his A-levels. It's definitely more than 12 hours a week - it's a full-time college course.

2026-01-29T10:20:35.299570 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on the rules, I need to inform you that your Child Benefit will stop.**

Here's why: When a young person turns 20, Child Benefit stops regardless of whether they are still in approved education or training. The extension of Child Benefit beyond age 16 only applies up until the young person's 20th birthday.

Since Dev turned 20 approximately two weeks ago, your entitlement to Child Benefit for him would have ended on the Monday following his 20th birthday (or on his birthday if it fell on a Monday).

**What this means for you:**
- Child Benefit payments for Dev will cease
- This applies even though he is still completing his A-level studies
- You should receive notification from HMRC about the cessation of your Child Benefit

I'm sorry this isn't the outcome you were hoping for, but the age limit of 20 is a firm rule for Child Benefit eligibility.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or this decision?

2026-01-29T10:20:38.231847 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but thank you for explaining it clearly. So even though he's still finishing his course, once he turned 20, that's it - no more Child Benefit. I understand now.

No, I don't have any other questions. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T10:20:42.100708 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 20, regardless of whether they are still in approved education or training, and correctly identified that the user's eligibility ceased when their son Dev turned 20 approximately two weeks ago.
