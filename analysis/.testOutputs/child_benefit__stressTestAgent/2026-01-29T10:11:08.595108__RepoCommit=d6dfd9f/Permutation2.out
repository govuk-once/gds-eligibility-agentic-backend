2026-01-29T10:11:40.352712 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:11:41.839109 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter who lives with me.

2026-01-29T10:11:43.443000 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: **How old is your daughter?**

2026-01-29T10:11:44.823383 [actor]: She's 17 years old.

2026-01-29T10:11:47.217257 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful information.

Next question: **Is your daughter currently in full-time non-advanced education or approved training?**

(By non-advanced education, I mean education up to and including A levels or equivalent qualifications, not university degree courses.)

2026-01-29T10:11:49.090555 [actor]: Yes, she is. She's studying full-time for her A-levels at a local sixth-form college.

2026-01-29T10:11:50.725195 [root_agent]: That's great, thank you.

Now I need to ask: **Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:11:52.135358 [actor]: Yes, I am. I live in London.

2026-01-29T10:11:54.641359 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next, I need to ask: **Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or are either of you from abroad and subject to any residence requirements?**

2026-01-29T10:11:57.072465 [actor]: No, I'm a UK resident and I'm not subject to immigration control. I'm a single father, so there's no partner.

2026-01-29T10:11:59.020163 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question: **Is your daughter currently living with you full-time, or does she spend time living with anyone else (such as another parent or guardian)?**

2026-01-29T10:12:00.431213 [actor]: She lives with me full-time.

2026-01-29T10:12:03.832690 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a daughter under 20 years old
✓ She's in full-time non-advanced education (studying for A-levels)
✓ She lives with you full-time
✓ You're responsible for her
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You're not subject to immigration control

You should be able to claim Child Benefit for your daughter until she turns 20, or until she finishes her A-levels (whichever comes first), as long as she continues in full-time non-advanced education or approved training.

**Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?**

2026-01-29T10:12:07.299124 [actor]: That's very helpful, thank you! I understand now that I'm eligible for Child Benefit. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything to me.

2026-01-29T10:12:09.670819 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a UK resident single father with a 17-year-old daughter living with him full-time and studying A-levels qualifies for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible."
