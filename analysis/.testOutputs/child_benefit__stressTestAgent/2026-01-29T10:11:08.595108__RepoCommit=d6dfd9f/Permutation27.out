2026-01-29T10:25:33.277232 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T10:25:35.143556 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a baby girl, she's called Mia. She's only a few months old.

2026-01-29T10:25:37.108909 [root_agent]: That's wonderful! Congratulations on your daughter Mia.

Now, let me ask you the next question: **Is Mia living with you, or do you have main responsibility for her care?**

2026-01-29T10:25:39.275328 [actor]: Well, I live with my parents, but yes, Mia lives with me. I'm her mum so I look after her.

2026-01-29T10:25:41.783236 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's good to know that Mia lives with you and you're caring for her.

Next question: **Are you or your partner currently responsible for Mia, meaning you're the one (or ones) looking after her day-to-day needs?**

2026-01-29T10:25:43.791728 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for her. I'm the one looking after her day-to-day needs. I don't have a partner though, it's just me.

2026-01-29T10:25:45.745426 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're caring for Mia on your own.

Next, I need to ask: **Do you normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:25:47.177394 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I've always lived here with my parents.

2026-01-29T10:25:49.048533 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now, an important question about your circumstances: **Are you or Mia subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on your right to remain in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:25:50.729277 [actor]: No, we're both British. There's no immigration restrictions or anything like that.

2026-01-29T10:25:52.440898 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: **Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for Mia?**

2026-01-29T10:25:54.137440 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Mia. I want to claim it myself.

2026-01-29T10:25:57.395795 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Mia. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Mia) who is under 16 years old
✓ Mia lives with you and you're responsible for her day-to-day care
✓ You normally live in the UK
✓ You and Mia are not subject to immigration control
✓ No one else is already claiming Child Benefit for her

Since you meet all the eligibility criteria, you should be able to claim Child Benefit for Mia.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the claiming process?

2026-01-29T10:25:59.243069 [actor]: Actually, I should mention - I'm only 15 myself. Does that matter? Can I still claim it?

2026-01-29T10:26:01.877696 [root_agent]: Thank you for telling me that - it's an important detail.

Let me ask you: **Even though you're 15, are you the person who is mainly responsible for Mia's care? In other words, are you the one who primarily looks after her, even if you're living with your parents?**

I need to understand who has the main responsibility for Mia to determine who should claim the Child Benefit.

2026-01-29T10:26:04.852492 [actor]: Yes, I'm the one who mainly looks after Mia. I feed her, change her, get up in the night with her - all of that. My parents help me sometimes, but she's my baby and I'm the one who takes care of her.

2026-01-29T10:26:08.609281 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's clear you're doing a wonderful job caring for Mia.

Let me ask one more important question: **Since you're living with your parents and they sometimes help, does anyone else in your household - like your mum or dad - consider themselves to have equal or greater responsibility for Mia's care than you do? Or would they say that you're definitely the main person responsible for her?**

This is important because only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, and it should be the person with main responsibility.

2026-01-29T10:26:10.383378 [actor]: No, my parents would say I'm the main person responsible. They help me out because I'm still young, but they know she's my daughter and I'm the one who's responsible for her.

2026-01-29T10:26:14.351794 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification.

Based on everything you've told me, **you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Mia**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Mia) under 16 years old
✓ Mia lives with you
✓ You have main responsibility for Mia's care
✓ You normally live in the UK
✓ Neither you nor Mia are subject to immigration control
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

**Importantly, there is no minimum age requirement to claim Child Benefit.** Even though you're 15, if you're the person with main responsibility for Mia - which you are - then you're the person who should claim it.

The fact that you're young and living with your parents who help you doesn't prevent you from claiming, as long as you remain the main person responsible for Mia's day-to-day care.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your eligibility or Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:26:18.362404 [actor]: Thank you so much, that's really helpful! So I can go ahead and claim it then. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T10:26:21.155336 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a 15-year-old parent with main responsibility for their child can claim Child Benefit, as there is no minimum age requirement for claimants, and all eligibility criteria were properly verified including residency, care responsibility, and that no one else was claiming for the child.
