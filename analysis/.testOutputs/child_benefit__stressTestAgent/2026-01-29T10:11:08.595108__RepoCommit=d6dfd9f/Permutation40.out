2026-01-29T10:33:24.591999 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T10:33:26.426466 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for my son Simon. He's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T10:33:29.041643 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now I need to ask:

**Does Simon normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T10:33:31.240065 [actor]: Well, he did live with me normally, but he's currently been detained under the Mental Health Act. He's in a secure psychiatric unit right now. He's been there for about 10 weeks.

2026-01-29T10:33:34.221042 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this must be a difficult time for you and Simon.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Are you still contributing to the costs of supporting Simon while he's in the secure psychiatric unit?** (For example, are you paying for items like clothing, personal expenses, or maintaining contact with him?)

2026-01-29T10:33:36.332682 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm still buying him clothes, toiletries, and personal items he needs. I also visit him regularly and cover the travel costs for that. I'm still very much involved in his care and supporting him financially.

2026-01-29T10:33:38.562923 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Now I need to ask:

**Before Simon was detained in the secure psychiatric unit, was he living with you, or was he already in some form of care or detention?**

2026-01-29T10:33:40.365735 [actor]: He was living with me before this happened. He lived with me right up until he was detained under the Mental Health Act and placed in the unit.

2026-01-29T10:33:42.429472 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

I have one more important question:

**Do you receive Child Benefit for Simon currently, or are you asking about whether you can start claiming it (or continue claiming it) while he's detained in the psychiatric unit?**

2026-01-29T10:33:44.453948 [actor]: I do receive Child Benefit for him currently, yes. I'm worried about whether I can continue to receive it while he's in the psychiatric unit, or if I need to inform someone about his situation.

2026-01-29T10:33:49.842728 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your situation based on the eligibility rules.

**Based on what you've told me, you should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit for Simon while he's in the secure psychiatric unit.**

Here's why:

- You were receiving Child Benefit before Simon was detained
- Simon normally lived with you before being detained
- You are still contributing to his support costs (buying clothes, toiletries, personal items, and covering travel costs to visit him)
- You remain actively involved in his care

**However, you do need to inform the Child Benefit Office about Simon's situation.** 

The rules state that if a child is detained in custody or under the Mental Health Act, you can continue to receive Child Benefit as long as:
1. The child lived with you immediately before being detained (which Simon did)
2. You continue to contribute to the child's maintenance (which you are doing)

You should contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them that Simon has been detained under the Mental Health Act and is in a secure psychiatric unit, and that you are still contributing to his costs. This way, your entitlement can be properly recorded.

**Do you have any other questions about your Child Benefit eligibility?**

2026-01-29T10:33:54.333066 [actor]: No, that answers my question. Thank you for explaining that. I'll make sure to contact the Child Benefit Office to let them know about Simon's situation. It's a relief to know I can continue receiving it while he's getting the help he needs.

2026-01-29T10:33:57.127956 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to the gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital or care, if a child is detained in custody or under the Mental Health Act, you can only continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks (84 days). Since Simon has been in the secure psychiatric unit for about 10 weeks, the agent should have informed the user that eligibility would end at week 12, but the agent failed to mention this critical 12-week time limit at all.
