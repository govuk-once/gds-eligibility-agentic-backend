2026-01-29T10:23:49.183327 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T10:23:50.870007 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Tom, who's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T10:23:52.696916 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Is Tom living with you, or does he live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T10:23:54.777804 [actor]: Well, he's not exactly at home right now. He's been staying at a residential school for the past 10 weeks. The local council is paying for it because he has severe behavioral needs.

2026-01-29T10:23:57.452506 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. This is an important detail for determining your eligibility.

**Is Tom expected to return home to live with you during school holidays, or is this a more permanent care arrangement where he won't be returning home?**

2026-01-29T10:24:00.174653 [actor]: Oh yes, he comes home during the school holidays. It's not permanent - it's just a residential school to help with his behavioral needs during term time. He's still my son and he comes back home when school's out.

2026-01-29T10:24:03.566949 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is helpful information.

Based on what you've told me, let me think through your situation:

- You have a 14-year-old son, Tom, who is under 16
- He normally lives with you and returns home during school holidays
- He's temporarily at a residential school funded by the local council due to his behavioral needs

**One more important question: Are you (or your partner if you have one) responsible for Tom - meaning you're paying towards his upkeep or making arrangements for his welfare?**

2026-01-29T10:24:05.953142 [actor]: Yes, of course I'm responsible for him. I'm his mum. Even though the council pays for the school, I still look after him when he's home, buy his clothes, make sure he's got everything he needs. He's my son.

2026-01-29T10:24:11.595834 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on your circumstances, you should be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

- You have a child (Tom) who is under 16 years old ✓
- You are responsible for him - you look after him and contribute to his upkeep ✓
- Even though Tom is staying at a residential school paid for by the local council, he still lives with you during school holidays and this is his main home ✓

When a child is in local authority care or at a residential school but still comes home for holidays and you remain responsible for them, you can still claim Child Benefit.

**However, there are a couple of final things I should check:**

1. **Do you or your partner earn over £50,000 a year?** (This doesn't stop you from being eligible, but it may mean you need to pay some of it back through tax)

2. **Are you currently the only person claiming Child Benefit for Tom?** (Only one person can claim for the same child)

2026-01-29T10:24:13.741700 [actor]: Well, I don't earn over £50,000 - nowhere near it to be honest. And no, no one else is claiming for Tom, just me. I'm his mother and I'm the one who looks after him.

So does that mean I can definitely claim then?

2026-01-29T10:24:17.997058 [root_agent]: **Yes, based on everything you've told me, you are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Tom.**

To summarize why you qualify:

✓ Tom is under 16 years old  
✓ You are responsible for him - you look after him and contribute to his upkeep  
✓ He lives with you during school holidays and you remain his primary caregiver  
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him  
✓ Neither you nor a partner earns over £50,000  

The fact that Tom is at a residential school paid for by the local council during term time doesn't affect your eligibility, as he still returns home to you during holidays and you remain responsible for him.

**You can go ahead and make a claim for Child Benefit.** If you haven't already claimed, you can do so online or by post. You can backdate your claim for up to 3 months, so it's worth claiming as soon as possible.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:24:20.361700 [actor]: No, that's brilliant, thank you so much for your help. That's really reassuring to know I can still claim for him even though he's at the residential school. I really appreciate you explaining it all to me.

2026-01-29T10:24:25.621911 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital or care, when a child goes into care paid for by a local authority, parents can only claim Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks (with potential 8-week extensions in some cases). Since Tom has been at the residential school for 10 weeks and it's paid for by the local council due to his behavioral needs, the agent should have informed the mother that she is currently eligible but will lose eligibility after week 12, rather than stating she is simply "eligible" without any time limitation.
