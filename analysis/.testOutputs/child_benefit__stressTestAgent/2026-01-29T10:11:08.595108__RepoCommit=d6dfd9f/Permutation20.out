2026-01-29T10:21:24.059791 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or children under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:21:26.036513 [actor]: Yes, I do. I'm looking after my granddaughter Lucia - she's 14 years old. Her parents can't take care of her, so she lives with me and I pay for everything she needs.

2026-01-29T10:21:27.988266 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. It's good to know you're caring for your 14-year-old granddaughter Lucia.

Let me ask you: **Are Lucia's parents still claiming Child Benefit for her, or have they stopped claiming it?**

2026-01-29T10:21:29.953014 [actor]: No, they're not claiming it. They're not involved at all - they don't contribute anything financially and I'm the one paying for everything for Lucia.

2026-01-29T10:21:31.706074 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like you're taking full responsibility for Lucia's care and her parents aren't claiming Child Benefit.

Let me ask you: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:21:33.338277 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:21:35.176854 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that.

Now, let me ask: **Is Lucia living with you full-time in your home?**

2026-01-29T10:21:36.914287 [actor]: Yes, she lives with me full-time. It's just the two of us - she's been living here with me because her parents can't care for her.

2026-01-29T10:21:39.047602 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Let me ask you one more important question: **Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on your right to live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:21:41.153266 [actor]: No, I don't have any immigration restrictions. I'm a UK resident with no restrictions on my right to live here.

2026-01-29T10:21:44.725167 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your granddaughter Lucia. Here's why:

✓ You're responsible for Lucia, who is 14 years old (under 16)
✓ She lives with you full-time
✓ You're paying for everything she needs
✓ Her parents are not claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ You live in the UK with no immigration restrictions

Since you're the main person looking after Lucia and paying for her upbringing, you should be able to claim Child Benefit as her primary caregiver, even though you're her grandparent rather than her parent.

**Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-29T10:21:49.067925 [actor]: Thank you so much, that's very helpful! I'm so relieved to hear that I can claim it. This will really help with all the expenses for Lucia. I think I have all the information I need for now.

2026-01-29T10:21:51.226310 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a grandparent who is the primary caregiver, has the child living with them full-time, is responsible for all expenses, and where the parents are not claiming Child Benefit, is eligible to claim Child Benefit for a child under 16.
