2026-01-29T10:30:58.152921 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:31:00.845190 [actor]: Yes, I have a daughter Kelly, she's 16. But I'm a bit worried because she finished her GCSEs back in June and isn't actually in school right now - she's on her summer holidays. She has been accepted to start A-levels at college in September though. Does that affect things?

2026-01-29T10:31:03.343335 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know about Kelly.

Let me ask you this: **Are you the person responsible for Kelly? In other words, do you live with her and are you responsible for her day-to-day care and upbringing?**

2026-01-29T10:31:05.679125 [actor]: Yes, I am. Kelly lives with me and I'm responsible for her care. I'm her mum, Joan. I look after all her day-to-day needs - food, clothing, everything really. It's just me and her at home.

2026-01-29T10:31:08.176127 [root_agent]: Thank you, Joan. That's clear.

Now, regarding Kelly's education situation - you mentioned she's finished her GCSEs and has been accepted to start A-levels in September. 

**Has Kelly enrolled in or started any approved education or training since finishing her GCSEs, or is she currently waiting to begin her A-levels in September?**

2026-01-29T10:31:11.262269 [actor]: No, she hasn't started anything yet. She finished her GCSEs in June and has just been on summer break since then. She's due to start her A-levels at college in September - so she's just waiting for that to begin. It's currently August, so she's been out of school for a couple of months now. That's what's worrying me - is there a gap where I'm not entitled to the benefit?

2026-01-29T10:31:13.491517 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Joan. That's a very reasonable question.

Let me ask you this: **When Kelly finishes her A-levels at college in September, will she be under 20 years old?**

(This will help me understand the full timeframe we're working with for her eligibility.)

2026-01-29T10:31:15.646118 [actor]: Well, she's only 16 now and she's just starting her A-levels in September. So yes, she'll definitely be under 20 when she finishes them - she'll probably be about 18 or 19 when she completes the two-year course.

2026-01-29T10:31:18.050711 [root_agent]: Thank you, Joan. That's helpful.

Now, let me ask about your circumstances: **Are you currently living in the UK, and are you or your partner (if you have one) responsible for paying UK National Insurance, or receiving certain UK benefits or tax credits?**

2026-01-29T10:31:19.952198 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK and I pay National Insurance through my job. It's just me - no partner - so it's just my circumstances that matter.

2026-01-29T10:31:22.058354 [root_agent]: Thank you, Joan. That's all very clear.

Let me ask one more important question: **Is Kelly currently living with you full-time, or does she spend time living with anyone else, such as another parent or family member?**

2026-01-29T10:31:23.906134 [actor]: Yes, Kelly lives with me full-time. It's just the two of us at home. She doesn't live with anyone else or split her time anywhere.

2026-01-29T10:31:30.336367 [root_agent]: Thank you, Joan. I have enough information now to assess your eligibility.

**Based on what you've told me, you ARE eligible for Child Benefit for Kelly.**

Here's why:

1. **Kelly qualifies as your child** - She's 16 and will be starting approved education (A-levels) in September, which means she'll be in approved education or training and under 20.

2. **You're responsible for her** - Kelly lives with you full-time and you're responsible for her day-to-day care.

3. **You meet the residency requirements** - You live in the UK and pay National Insurance.

**Regarding your concern about the summer gap:** The good news is that you can continue to claim Child Benefit during the summer holidays between leaving school and starting college. As long as Kelly has been accepted onto an approved course (which her A-levels are) and will be starting it, the benefit continues through this waiting period.

You should be able to claim or continue claiming Child Benefit without any gap. If you haven't already claimed, you can do so now, and if you're already claiming, it should continue without interruption through the summer and into her college course.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:31:33.101226 [actor]: Oh, that's such a relief! I was really worried there would be a gap in the payments over the summer. Thank you so much for explaining that - it makes sense now that the benefit continues as long as she's accepted onto the course and will be starting it. That's really helpful, thank you!

2026-01-29T10:31:37.387369 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Joan is eligible for Child Benefit for her 16-year-old daughter Kelly, correctly applying the rule that Child Benefit continues during the summer gap between GCSEs and approved further education (A-levels) as long as the child has been accepted onto the course.
