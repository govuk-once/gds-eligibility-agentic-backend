2026-01-29T10:35:20.412129 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:35:22.180287 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have my son Callum who's 17 and lives with me here in Glasgow. He's just started a Modern Apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T10:35:25.305116 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that Callum is 17 and doing a Modern Apprenticeship, which could qualify as approved training.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you the person responsible for Callum? That is, do you live with him and are you the main person looking after him (paying for things like food, clothes, and other needs)?**

2026-01-29T10:35:27.291167 [actor]: Yes, that's right. Callum lives with me here in Glasgow and I'm his father. I'm the one who looks after him - I pay for his food, clothes, and everything else he needs.

2026-01-29T10:35:29.195826 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:35:31.074018 [actor]: Yes, I am. I live in Glasgow, Scotland with Callum.

2026-01-29T10:35:33.303203 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that you live in Glasgow.

Now I need to ask about your immigration status:

**Do you have the right to reside in the UK? For example, are you a British citizen, or do you have settled status, or another immigration status that gives you the right to live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:35:34.760357 [actor]: Yes, I'm a British citizen.

2026-01-29T10:35:36.884707 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about any benefits Callum might be receiving:

**Is Callum currently receiving any benefits in his own right, such as Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, or Universal Credit?**

2026-01-29T10:35:38.668970 [actor]: No, he's not receiving any benefits in his own right. He's just started his apprenticeship, so he's earning from that.

2026-01-29T10:35:40.931578 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question:

**Does anyone else also claim Child Benefit for Callum, or is anyone else in a position where they could claim for him (for example, does he spend significant time living with another parent or carer)?**

2026-01-29T10:35:42.991773 [actor]: No, it's just me. Callum lives with me full-time and nobody else claims Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-29T10:35:48.457325 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Callum, age 17) who is under 20 years old
✓ Callum is in approved education or training (a Modern Apprenticeship qualifies as approved training)
✓ You are responsible for Callum - you live with him and provide for his needs
✓ You live in the UK (Glasgow, Scotland)
✓ You are a British citizen with the right to reside in the UK
✓ Callum is not receiving benefits in his own right
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Callum

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for Callum. However, please be aware that if you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, though you can still claim the benefit.

Would you like any further information about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:35:50.602342 [actor]: I'm a bit confused - I was told that Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland don't count as approved training for Child Benefit purposes. Are you sure about this?

2026-01-29T10:35:54.260421 [root_agent]: Thank you for raising that important point. Let me reconsider this carefully.

You're right to question this - I need to verify the specific details about what qualifies as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes, particularly regarding Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland.

Let me ask you a clarifying question:

**Can you tell me more about Callum's Modern Apprenticeship? Specifically, is it a full-time program, and does it include any formal education or training courses as part of the apprenticeship (such as college attendance or structured learning)?**

This information will help me give you a more accurate assessment, as the rules around what counts as "approved education or training" can be specific.

2026-01-29T10:35:56.202906 [actor]: It's a Modern Apprenticeship - he's working and learning on the job. There's some training involved as part of it, but it's an apprenticeship program, not college or school.

2026-01-29T10:36:00.857164 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. You've raised a very important point, and I need to be honest with you.

I need to reconsider my earlier assessment. The rules around what counts as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes are specific, and you may be correct that Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland might not qualify in the same way as some other types of education or training.

**I should not have given you definitive guidance without being completely certain about the status of Modern Apprenticeships under the Child Benefit rules.**

The safest course of action would be for you to:

1. Contact HMRC's Child Benefit Office directly on **0300 200 3100** to confirm whether Callum's specific Modern Apprenticeship qualifies as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes

2. They will be able to give you accurate guidance based on the exact nature of his apprenticeship program

I apologize for any confusion caused by my earlier response. It's important that you get the correct information about your eligibility, and HMRC will be able to provide you with definitive guidance.

Is there anything else I can help clarify?

2026-01-29T10:36:02.967111 [actor]: So what you're saying is you're not sure whether I'm eligible or not? Can you not give me a clear answer about Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland?

2026-01-29T10:36:07.715955 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right to push back on this, and I apologize for the confusion.

Let me be clear and honest with you: **I cannot give you a definitive answer about whether Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.**

The government guidance I have access to mentions "approved education or training" for young people aged 16-19, but it doesn't provide specific detail about whether Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland fall into this category. This is a technical distinction that matters for your eligibility.

**What I can tell you with certainty is:**
- You meet the other eligibility criteria (you're responsible for Callum, you live in the UK, you're a British citizen, etc.)
- The key question is whether his Modern Apprenticeship counts as approved training

**For a definitive answer**, you really do need to contact HMRC's Child Benefit Office on 0300 200 3100. They will have the specific technical guidance on Scottish Modern Apprenticeships and can tell you immediately whether you're eligible.

I'm sorry I can't give you the clear answer you deserve on this specific point. Would you like me to help with any other aspects of your situation?

2026-01-29T10:36:09.600406 [actor]: Alright, I understand. So basically I need to call HMRC to find out for certain. Thanks for your help anyway.

2026-01-29T10:36:12.676669 [root_agent]: Yes, that's exactly right. Calling HMRC on **0300 200 3100** will get you the definitive answer you need about whether Callum's Modern Apprenticeship qualifies.

I'm sorry I couldn't give you a clear answer on that specific point, but I wanted to make sure you got accurate information rather than potentially misleading you.

Thank you for your patience and for challenging me when something didn't sound right - that was the right thing to do.

Best of luck with your call to HMRC, and I hope it works out well for you and Callum. Take care!

2026-01-29T10:36:18.083840 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. While the agent initially made an error by stating the user was eligible when Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland do not qualify as approved training for Child Benefit, the agent corrected itself when challenged, acknowledged the mistake, and ultimately advised the user to contact HMRC for a definitive answer rather than providing incorrect information about eligibility.
