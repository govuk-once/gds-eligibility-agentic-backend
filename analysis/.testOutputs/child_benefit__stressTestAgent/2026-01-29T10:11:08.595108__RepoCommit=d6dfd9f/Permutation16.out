2026-01-29T10:19:06.935740 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T10:19:08.677152 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have a son, Oliver, who's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T10:19:10.307631 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does Oliver live with you?**

2026-01-29T10:19:12.931579 [actor]: Well, not at the moment. He's been in hospital in the USA for treatment. He has a rare condition and needed to see specialists there, so he's been at a specialist hospital for about 15 weeks now. I'm still here in the UK, but I pay for his incidental costs and visit him when I can.

2026-01-29T10:19:15.287194 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. I understand that must be a difficult situation for you and Oliver.

Next question: **Is Oliver expected to be in hospital for more than 12 weeks in total, or has the period already exceeded 12 weeks?**

2026-01-29T10:19:17.233491 [actor]: Yes, he's already been there for 15 weeks, so it's definitely exceeded 12 weeks.

2026-01-29T10:19:19.740070 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Next question: **Are you contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards Oliver's upkeep during his time in hospital?** 

(For context, Child Benefit is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, and £16.95 per week for additional children)

2026-01-29T10:19:21.872015 [actor]: Yes, I am. I'm paying for his incidental costs while he's there - things he needs beyond what the hospital provides. It's definitely more than what Child Benefit would pay.

2026-01-29T10:19:23.778068 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question: **Before Oliver went into hospital, did he normally live with you in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:19:25.563267 [actor]: Yes, he did. He's always lived with me here in the UK. He only went to the USA specifically for this hospital treatment.

2026-01-29T10:19:30.487015 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you should still be eligible for Child Benefit** even though Oliver is in hospital in the USA.

Here's why:

1. You are responsible for a child under 16 (Oliver, aged 14)
2. Oliver normally lives with you in the UK when not in hospital
3. Although he's been in hospital for more than 12 weeks (which would normally affect Child Benefit), you are contributing at least the equivalent amount of Child Benefit towards his upkeep while he's there

Under UK Child Benefit rules, you can continue to receive Child Benefit when a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks, **if** you're contributing at least the same amount as the Child Benefit payment towards the child's maintenance. Since you're paying for Oliver's incidental costs and this exceeds the Child Benefit amount, this condition is met.

The fact that the hospital is overseas (in the USA) rather than in the UK shouldn't affect your eligibility, as long as Oliver normally lives with you in the UK and you meet the contribution requirement.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?**

2026-01-29T10:19:32.879249 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you. I'm relieved to know I can still receive it while he's getting the treatment he needs. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T10:19:37.211257 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rules for Child Benefit when a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks, correctly identifying that eligibility continues when the parent contributes at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount towards the child's upkeep, which was satisfied in this case.
