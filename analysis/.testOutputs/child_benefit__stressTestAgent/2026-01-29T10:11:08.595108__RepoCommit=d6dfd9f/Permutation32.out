2026-01-29T10:28:43.470510 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this, I need to ask you a few questions.

Let me start with the first one:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:28:45.624543 [actor]: I'm asking about my son John. He's 17 and lives with me. He's left school and is now at college doing a course to re-sit two of his GCSEs.

2026-01-29T10:28:47.688251 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful context.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Are you responsible for John - meaning do you live with him and are you the main person looking after him (or sharing that responsibility equally with someone else)?**

2026-01-29T10:28:49.504544 [actor]: Yes, I'm his father Pete, and John lives with me. I'm the one looking after him - it's just the two of us at home.

2026-01-29T10:28:51.760873 [root_agent]: Thank you, Pete. That's very helpful.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Are you living in the UK, or are you a Crown servant (such as a diplomat or member of HM Forces) posted overseas?**

2026-01-29T10:28:53.157929 [actor]: Yes, I'm living in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:28:56.353228 [root_agent]: Thank you, Pete.

Now I need to ask about John's education:

**Is the course John is taking at college considered "approved education or training"? Specifically, is it:**
- **Full-time (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience), AND**
- **Non-advanced (meaning below degree level, such as GCSEs, A levels, NVQs up to level 3, etc.)?**

2026-01-29T10:28:58.449513 [actor]: Well, the course is for GCSEs so it's non-advanced, but it's only 6 hours a week of supervised study. So I don't think it would count as full-time based on what you've said.

2026-01-29T10:29:01.906644 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification, Pete. That's an important detail.

Since John is 17 and his course is only 6 hours a week of supervised study, it doesn't meet the "full-time" requirement of more than 12 hours per week that's needed for Child Benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds.

Let me ask one more question to be thorough:

**Has John left full-time approved education or training recently? If so, when did he finish his last full-time course?**

This is important because there can be a short extension period after a young person leaves education.

2026-01-29T10:29:03.824785 [actor]: He left school at the end of last term and started this part-time college course shortly after. So it's been a few months now since he finished school.

2026-01-29T10:29:08.914495 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information, Pete.

Based on what you've told me, I need to give you an assessment of your eligibility:

**You are unlikely to be eligible for Child Benefit for John** because:

1. John is 17 years old (over 16), so Child Benefit only continues if he's in approved education or training
2. His college course is only 6 hours per week of supervised study, which doesn't meet the **full-time requirement of more than 12 hours per week**
3. He's been out of full-time education for a few months now

Child Benefit typically stops when a young person turns 16, **unless** they continue in approved full-time education or training (which must be non-advanced and more than 12 hours per week of supervised study).

Since John's current course doesn't meet the full-time criteria, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for him at this time.

If John were to enroll in a full-time course (more than 12 hours per week) in the future, you could potentially claim Child Benefit again at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-29T10:29:13.996264 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Pete is not eligible for Child Benefit because John's college course (6 hours per week) does not meet the full-time education requirement of more than 12 hours per week of supervised study, which is necessary for Child Benefit eligibility for children aged 16-19.
