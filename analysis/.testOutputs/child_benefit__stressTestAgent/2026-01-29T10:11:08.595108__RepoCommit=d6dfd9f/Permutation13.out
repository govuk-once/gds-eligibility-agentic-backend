2026-01-29T10:17:35.980048 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:17:38.333127 [actor]: Yes, we do. We have a little girl named Maya who is 4 years old. She's been placed with us by the adoption agency and is living in our home now. My partner and I are approved adopters, though the final adoption order hasn't been granted yet.

2026-01-29T10:17:40.615983 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's wonderful that you're providing a home for Maya.

Let me ask the next question:

**Are you and your partner currently receiving any financial support from the local authority specifically for Maya's care, such as fostering allowances or adoption support payments?**

2026-01-29T10:17:42.519581 [actor]: No, we're not receiving any fostering allowances. Maya is placed with us as prospective adopters, not as foster carers. The adoption agency placed her with us directly for adoption.

2026-01-29T10:17:44.328932 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Next question:

**Is Maya living with you in your household, and are you responsible for her day-to-day care and upbringing?**

2026-01-29T10:17:46.672686 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Maya lives with us full-time in our home. My partner Zara and I are responsible for all of her day-to-day care - everything from getting her ready in the morning, feeding her, taking her to nursery, and putting her to bed at night. She's been living with us since the placement.

2026-01-29T10:17:48.429101 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me ask you this:

**Do you or your partner currently live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:17:49.963324 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. This is our home.

2026-01-29T10:17:52.535982 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more question:

**Are you or your partner the person with the main responsibility for Maya, or does anyone else share equal responsibility for her care?**

(In other words, between you and your partner, would one of you be considered the main carer, or do you share responsibility equally?)

2026-01-29T10:17:54.623524 [actor]: Between Zara and me, we share the responsibility pretty equally, but I suppose Zara is the main carer day-to-day. She's the one who handles most of Maya's daily routine and appointments.

2026-01-29T10:17:59.394401 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

✓ Maya is under 16 and living with you
✓ You and your partner are responsible for her care
✓ You live in the UK
✓ As prospective adopters with Maya placed in your home, you are considered responsible for her, even though the final adoption order hasn't been granted yet

**Important points:**

- Only one person can claim Child Benefit for Maya, so either you or Zara should make the claim (not both)
- Since Zara is the main day-to-day carer, she would typically be the one to claim, though you can decide between yourselves
- The person who claims will receive the National Insurance credits that come with Child Benefit, which can help protect their State Pension

**Next steps:**

You or Zara can apply for Child Benefit online or by post. You'll need Maya's birth certificate and your National Insurance number.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:18:01.927818 [actor]: Thank you so much for explaining all of that! That's really helpful to know we can claim even before the adoption is finalized. We'll make sure Zara applies for it then. I appreciate your help!

2026-01-29T10:18:05.998072 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that prospective adopters with a child placed in their home are eligible for Child Benefit even before the final adoption order is granted, provided all other eligibility criteria are met (child under 16, living in the UK, responsible for the child's care).
