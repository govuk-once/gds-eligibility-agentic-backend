2026-01-29T10:14:46.903312 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T10:14:48.649304 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have a daughter who's 4 years old, so she's definitely under 16. I'm responsible for her - she lives with me and my partner.

2026-01-29T10:14:50.435725 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's a good start!

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:14:52.009592 [actor]: Yes, I do live in the UK. We're all living here together - me, my partner James, and our daughter Ruby.

2026-01-29T10:14:54.693227 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you the main person responsible for your daughter Ruby? In other words, are you the person who is primarily looking after her day-to-day needs?**

(This is important because only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, even if there are two parents or guardians.)

2026-01-29T10:14:56.337994 [actor]: Yes, I am. I'm the main person responsible for Ruby's day-to-day care. I look after her daily needs.

2026-01-29T10:14:58.554299 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask an important question about your immigration status:

**Do you have the right to reside in the UK? For example, are you a British citizen, or do you have settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another immigration status that gives you the right to live here?**

2026-01-29T10:15:00.295411 [actor]: Yes, I'm a British citizen, so I have the right to reside in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:15:03.345644 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided:

✓ You are responsible for a child under 16 (Ruby, who is 4 years old)
✓ Ruby lives with you
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are the main person responsible for Ruby's day-to-day care
✓ You are a British citizen with the right to reside in the UK

**You are eligible for Child Benefit!**

You meet all the basic criteria for Child Benefit. You can apply for it if you haven't already done so.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-29T10:15:05.700739 [actor]: Oh, that's great to hear! But actually, I should mention - I earn £75,000 a year. Does that affect anything? I've heard something about higher earners and Child Benefit but I'm not sure how it works.

2026-01-29T10:15:09.747418 [root_agent]: That's a very important point to raise, thank you for mentioning it!

Your income doesn't affect your **eligibility** for Child Benefit - you are still eligible to claim it. However, it may affect whether you need to pay some or all of it back through the tax system.

To help clarify your situation, I need to ask:

**Does your partner James earn more than £50,000 a year, or do you earn the higher income in your household?**

(This matters because if either you or your partner earns over £50,000, the higher earner may need to pay a tax charge called the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means you pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through your tax return.)

2026-01-29T10:15:11.524048 [actor]: I earn the higher income - I earn £75,000 a year and James earns £20,000 a year. So I'm definitely the higher earner in our household.

2026-01-29T10:15:16.711867 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

So to summarize your situation:

✓ **You are eligible for Child Benefit** - you meet all the criteria to claim it.

However, because you earn £75,000 (which is over £50,000), you would be subject to the **High Income Child Benefit Charge**. This means:

- You can still claim Child Benefit and receive the payments
- But you would need to pay back **all** of the Child Benefit through your Self Assessment tax return (because your income is over £60,000, you pay back 100% of it)

**You do have options:**

1. Claim Child Benefit and receive the payments, but pay it all back through tax
2. Claim Child Benefit but opt not to receive the payments (you'd still get National Insurance credits which protect your State Pension)

Even if you don't want the payments, it's often recommended to still register for Child Benefit as it can protect your State Pension entitlement through National Insurance credits.

Is there anything else about your Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T10:15:22.375012 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user is eligible for Child Benefit but would be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge, needing to repay 100% of the benefit through their tax return due to earning £75,000 (above the £60,000 threshold), which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)".
