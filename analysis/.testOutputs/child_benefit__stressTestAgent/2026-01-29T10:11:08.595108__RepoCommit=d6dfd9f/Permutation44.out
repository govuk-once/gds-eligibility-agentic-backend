Let me start by asking you: **Do you have a child or children under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:36:21.830459 [actor]: Yes, I have a son, Leo. He's 12 years old, but he's in local authority care at the moment.

2026-01-29T10:36:24.099891 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about Leo.

Since Leo is in local authority care, I need to understand the specific arrangement. **Does Leo still live with you for part of the week, or does he live full-time in local authority care?**

2026-01-29T10:36:25.915793 [actor]: He doesn't live with me full-time. He comes home to visit me every Saturday at 10 in the morning and then goes back to the care home on Sunday at 11 in the morning.
