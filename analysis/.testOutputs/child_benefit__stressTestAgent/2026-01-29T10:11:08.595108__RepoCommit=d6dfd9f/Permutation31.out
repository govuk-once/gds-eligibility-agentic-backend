2026-01-29T10:28:05.777421 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T10:28:07.894294 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. My daughter Emma is 18 and she's just started at university. She's doing a Bachelor's degree - it's a 3-year course. She still lives at home with me and commutes to uni.

2026-01-29T10:28:10.800565 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know about Emma's situation.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you responsible for Emma? By this I mean, does she normally live with you and do you pay towards her upbringing (such as for food, clothes, or other living costs)?**

2026-01-29T10:28:13.431687 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Emma lives with me full-time - this is her home. I pay for everything - her food, clothes, toiletries, all her living costs really. She just commutes to university from here each day, so she's still very much living at home with me.

2026-01-29T10:28:16.292229 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask:

**Is Emma's university course an approved form of education or training? Specifically, is it full-time education (at least 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience), and is it non-advanced education such as A levels, Scottish Highers, or similar - or is it an advanced course like a university degree?**

2026-01-29T10:28:18.274659 [actor]: It's a university degree - a Bachelor's degree. So yes, it's definitely full-time, but it's advanced education, not the A-levels or college level type courses.

2026-01-29T10:28:20.308475 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is an important distinction.

Let me ask you another question:

**Did Emma start this university degree before she turned 19, or after her 19th birthday?**

2026-01-29T10:28:21.913205 [actor]: She just turned 18 recently and started the degree right after finishing college, so yes, she started before turning 19.

2026-01-29T10:28:23.719969 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now I need to ask:

**Have you already been claiming Child Benefit for Emma, or would this be a new claim?**

2026-01-29T10:28:25.795199 [actor]: I have been claiming Child Benefit for her already, yes. I've been claiming it since she was born. I'm just wondering if I can continue now that she's started university.

2026-01-29T10:28:27.934886 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Let me ask you one more important question:

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge? This applies if either you or your partner has an individual income over £50,000 per year.**

2026-01-29T10:28:29.678872 [actor]: No, my income is well below that threshold, so the High Income Child Benefit Charge doesn't apply to me.

2026-01-29T10:28:34.784163 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to give you some important guidance about your eligibility:

**Unfortunately, you are not eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit for Emma now that she has started university.**

Here's why:

Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 if they are in **approved education or training**. However, this only covers non-advanced education such as:
- A levels
- Scottish Highers
- NVQs up to level 3
- Similar qualifications

**University degrees (including Bachelor's degrees) are classed as advanced education and are not covered by Child Benefit**, even though Emma:
- Started before turning 19
- Lives at home with you
- You support her financially

Child Benefit typically stops when a young person:
- Turns 16 and leaves education, OR
- Completes non-advanced education (like A levels), OR
- Starts advanced education like a university degree

Since Emma has now started a university degree, your Child Benefit entitlement for her will have ended, even though she still lives at home and you continue to support her.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-29T10:28:37.310097 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but thank you for explaining it clearly. So it doesn't matter that she's still living at home and I'm still supporting her - it's just that university degrees don't count for Child Benefit purposes. I understand now. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T10:28:41.073571 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education such as a university degree, even though the child is under 20, lives at home, and is financially supported by the parent.
