2026-01-29T10:34:33.968544 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First, do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T10:34:35.788941 [actor]: Yes, I do. I'm 17 and I live with my mum in Cardiff. I've just left school and started a Foundation Apprenticeship that's funded by the Welsh Government.

2026-01-29T10:34:37.912609 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand your situation better.

Are you asking about whether **you** can claim Child Benefit for yourself (as a 17-year-old), or are you asking on behalf of your mother who may be claiming Child Benefit for you?

2026-01-29T10:34:40.014954 [actor]: Oh sorry, I meant my mum - she's been getting Child Benefit for me, and we're wondering if she can still get it now that I've started this Foundation Apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T10:34:43.192808 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying - so we're checking if your mum can continue to receive Child Benefit for you now that you're 17 and have started a Foundation Apprenticeship.

To assess this, I need to know: Is your Foundation Apprenticeship an approved training course, and are you in full-time non-advanced education or approved training?

In other words, how many hours per week does your Foundation Apprenticeship involve, and does it include any educational component?

2026-01-29T10:34:45.305375 [actor]: It's a full-time Foundation Apprenticeship through the Welsh Government. I'm there most of the week - it includes both work placement and some learning at college. I think it's about 30 hours a week in total.

2026-01-29T10:34:47.662041 [root_agent]: Thank you for that detail. That's helpful information about the hours and structure of your apprenticeship.

Now, an important question: Are you currently receiving any payment or salary for this Foundation Apprenticeship, or is it unpaid training?

2026-01-29T10:34:49.341145 [actor]: Yes, I get paid - it's not much, but I do receive a wage for the apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T10:34:51.782209 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. One more important question:

Have you turned 16 yet, and if so, when was your 16th birthday? (I know you're 17 now, but I need to understand the timeline of when you left full-time education and started this paid apprenticeship in relation to your age milestones.)

2026-01-29T10:34:53.731342 [actor]: I turned 16 last year - I was 16 when I left school, and I turned 17 a few months ago. I started the Foundation Apprenticeship just recently, after I turned 17.

2026-01-29T10:34:56.577121 [root_agent]: Thank you for that timeline. Let me ask one final clarifying question:

When you left school (at age 16), did you go straight into this Foundation Apprenticeship, or was there a gap? And just to confirm - you left full-time school education before the specific date that marked the end of that academic year?

In other words, did you leave school before or after the Easter holidays in your final year, or did you complete the full school year until the end of term?

2026-01-29T10:34:58.691828 [actor]: I completed the full school year - I left when term ended in the summer. Then I had the summer holidays, and I started the Foundation Apprenticeship in September, just after I turned 17.

2026-01-29T10:35:04.583400 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me explain your mother's Child Benefit eligibility based on your situation.

**The situation:**

Based on the eligibility rules, Child Benefit can continue after a young person turns 16 **only if** they are in full-time non-advanced education or approved unpaid training. Child Benefit normally stops when a young person turns 16, or can extend until they turn 20 if they remain in qualifying education or training.

**In your case:**

Since you are now 17 and in a **paid** Foundation Apprenticeship, your mother is **not eligible** to continue receiving Child Benefit for you. The key issue is that you are receiving a wage for your apprenticeship.

Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 who are in full-time non-advanced education or **approved training**, but paid apprenticeships do not qualify as "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes.

**What your mother should do:**

Your mother should inform HMRC that you've started a paid apprenticeship so they can stop her Child Benefit payments. It's important to do this to avoid any overpayments that would need to be repaid later.

Does this answer your question, or is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-29T10:35:07.138816 [actor]: Oh, that's disappointing but thank you for explaining it clearly. So even though it's a Foundation Apprenticeship through the Welsh Government, because I'm getting paid it doesn't count? I just want to make sure we understand it right so mum can let them know.

2026-01-29T10:35:11.515729 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct, and I appreciate you wanting to make sure you understand it properly.

**To confirm:**

Even though your Foundation Apprenticeship is through the Welsh Government and includes educational elements, the fact that you are **receiving a wage/salary** means it does not qualify as "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes.

Child Benefit can continue for young people in:
- Full-time non-advanced education (like school or college courses)
- **Unpaid** approved training

Once a young person starts receiving payment for their work or apprenticeship, they are considered to be in employment rather than qualifying education or training, and Child Benefit stops.

**Next steps for your mum:**

She should contact HMRC's Child Benefit Office to inform them that you started a paid apprenticeship and provide the start date (September). This will ensure the payments are stopped correctly and avoid any overpayments.

You've understood it correctly. Is there anything else you'd like clarified about this?

2026-01-29T10:35:13.831405 [actor]: No, that makes sense now. Thank you for your help - we'll make sure mum contacts HMRC to let them know.

2026-01-29T10:35:18.004157 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that paid Foundation Apprenticeships do not qualify for Child Benefit, but according to gov.uk guidance, approved training courses can include certain funded government training programs, and the agent failed to verify whether this specific Welsh Government Foundation Apprenticeship qualifies as approved training for Child Benefit purposes before making a definitive determination.
