2026-01-29T10:30:19.567915 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T10:30:21.418930 [actor]: Yes, I do. My son Rashid is 17 and he's studying his A-Levels at college, so he's in full-time education.

2026-01-29T10:30:23.283154 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that Rashid is 17 and in full-time education doing his A-Levels.

Now, do you live with Rashid, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T10:30:24.911512 [actor]: Yes, Rashid lives with us - with me and my wife in our house.

2026-01-29T10:30:27.274650 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Next question: Are you or your wife responsible for Rashid? By this I mean, do either of you have the main responsibility for him - such as providing for his day-to-day care, making decisions about his upbringing, and meeting his needs?

2026-01-29T10:30:29.693279 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. We provide for all of Rashid's needs - his food, accommodation, everything. We make all the decisions about his upbringing and care. He depends on us completely.

2026-01-29T10:30:31.231512 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

One more important question: Are you or your wife living in the UK?

2026-01-29T10:30:32.625906 [actor]: Yes, we all live in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:30:37.696489 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, it appears that you **are eligible** for Child Benefit. Here's why:

- You have a child (Rashid) who is 17 years old and in approved full-time education (A-Levels at college), which means he qualifies as a child for Child Benefit purposes (children under 20 in approved education or training are covered)
- Rashid lives with you
- You and your wife are responsible for him - providing for his day-to-day care and needs
- You live in the UK

These factors meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. You can claim Child Benefit for Rashid.

However, please note that there is a High Income Child Benefit Charge if either you or your wife have an individual income over £60,000 a year. If either of you earn between £60,000 and £80,000, you may have to pay back some of the benefit through your tax return. If either of you earn £80,000 or more, you'd pay back all of it.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:30:39.781771 [actor]: Oh, actually there's something I should mention - Rashid got married recently to his girlfriend. She's 17 as well and she's moved in with us now. Does that change anything? Can I still claim for him?

2026-01-29T10:30:42.432285 [root_agent]: Thank you for mentioning that - it's an important detail.

Let me ask you: Does Rashid's wife receive any benefits or tax credits for him, or is she responsible for him in any way? Or do you and your wife still have the main responsibility for Rashid even though he's married?

2026-01-29T10:30:44.455401 [actor]: We still have the main responsibility for Rashid. We're supporting both of them really - they live with us and we provide for them. His wife doesn't receive any benefits or tax credits for him. They're both still young and dependent on us.

2026-01-29T10:30:48.354299 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that situation.

I need to give you some important information: **the fact that Rashid is married does affect his eligibility** for Child Benefit.

Under UK Child Benefit rules, you cannot claim Child Benefit for a child who is married or in a civil partnership, even if:
- They are under 20
- They are still in approved education or training
- They live with you
- You are responsible for them and supporting them financially

So unfortunately, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Rashid** because he is married, even though he's only 17, still in education, and you're still supporting him.

I understand this may be disappointing given that you're still providing for him, but the marriage status is a specific rule that prevents Child Benefit claims.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-29T10:30:52.346988 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but thank you for explaining it clearly. I understand now that because Rashid is married, I can't claim Child Benefit for him anymore, even though we're still supporting him. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T10:30:55.756340 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to GOV.UK guidance, the statement that married children are categorically ineligible for Child Benefit is incorrect - the marriage exception only applies to children aged 16-19 who are married AND not in approved education or training. Since Rashid is 17, married, AND in approved full-time education (A-Levels), he falls under an exception to the marriage rule, making the claimant eligible for Child Benefit.
