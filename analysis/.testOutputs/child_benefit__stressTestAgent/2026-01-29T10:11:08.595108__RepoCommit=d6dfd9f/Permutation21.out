2026-01-29T10:21:53.473618 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:21:55.736075 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Sam, who's 10 years old. He lives with me full time. I recently got divorced from my ex-wife and our daughter lives with her.

2026-01-29T10:21:58.329415 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know about Sam who lives with you full time.

**Are you responsible for Sam? This means do you live with him and you're the main person looking after him - providing for his care, making decisions about his upbringing, and meeting his everyday needs?**

2026-01-29T10:22:00.410936 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Sam lives with me and I'm the one who looks after him day-to-day. I make all the decisions about his schooling, healthcare, feed him, clothe him - everything really. I'm his main carer.

2026-01-29T10:22:02.668449 [root_agent]: That's great, thank you for confirming that.

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:22:04.021753 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:22:05.929838 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

**Do you or your ex-wife currently receive Child Benefit for Sam, or has anyone else claimed Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-29T10:22:08.262103 [actor]: No, nobody has claimed Child Benefit for Sam yet. My ex-wife and I only recently divorced and sorted out the living arrangements. She's planning to claim for our daughter Ella who lives with her, and I wanted to find out if I can claim for Sam.

2026-01-29T10:22:12.007070 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. That's helpful to know.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Sam**. Here's why:

✓ Sam is under 16 years old (he's 10)
✓ You're responsible for him - you live with him and are his main carer
✓ You live in the UK
✓ Nobody else is currently claiming Child Benefit for Sam

Since Sam lives with you full-time and you're his main carer, you can claim Child Benefit for him. Your ex-wife can separately claim Child Benefit for your daughter Ella, as she lives with her.

**One final question to complete the assessment: Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, meaning you need permission to enter or stay in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:22:13.617343 [actor]: No, I'm not subject to immigration control. I'm a British citizen and I don't have a partner at the moment.

2026-01-29T10:22:17.037952 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Based on all the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit for Sam.**

Here's a summary of why you qualify:
- ✓ Sam is 10 years old (under 16)
- ✓ He lives with you full-time
- ✓ You're responsible for him as his main carer
- ✓ You live in the UK
- ✓ You're a British citizen with no immigration restrictions
- ✓ Nobody else is currently claiming Child Benefit for Sam

You can go ahead and make a claim for Child Benefit for Sam. Your ex-wife can separately claim for your daughter Ella who lives with her - you can both claim independently for the children living with each of you.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:22:20.412014 [actor]: That's brilliant, thank you so much for your help. That's all I needed to know!

2026-01-29T10:22:23.627311 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for their son Sam, correctly identifying all relevant eligibility criteria (child under 16, responsible for the child, living in the UK, no immigration control issues, and no existing claim for the child), and properly explained that both parents can claim independently for children living with them respectively.
