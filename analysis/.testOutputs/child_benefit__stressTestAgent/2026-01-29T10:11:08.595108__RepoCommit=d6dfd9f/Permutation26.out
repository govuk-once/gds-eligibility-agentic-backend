2026-01-29T10:25:04.754708 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:25:06.163477 [actor]: Yes, I have a son, Zahid. He's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T10:25:07.801579 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Is Zahid living with you, or does he live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T10:25:09.604897 [actor]: He lives with his aunt, not with me.

2026-01-29T10:25:12.236571 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Zahid lives with his aunt.

Let me ask you this:

**Do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay (currently at least £25.60 a week) towards Zahid's upkeep or maintenance?**

2026-01-29T10:25:14.357323 [actor]: Well, I send £15 a week to the aunt for Zahid. And his grandmother - that's my mother - also sends £15 a week to the aunt for him. So together that's £30 a week going towards his care.

2026-01-29T10:25:18.183356 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me clarify something important:

**The £15 that your mother (Zahid's grandmother) sends - is that money sent separately by her, or do you send it on her behalf, or does it go through you in any way?**

I need to understand whether you personally are contributing at least £25.60 per week, as the contributions need to come from you specifically to meet the eligibility criteria.

2026-01-29T10:25:20.772981 [actor]: No, she sends it separately herself. I send my £15 directly to the aunt, and my mother sends her £15 directly to the aunt as well. They're separate contributions from two different people.

2026-01-29T10:25:25.022189 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you've told me, I need to let you know that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.

Here's why:

Since Zahid lives with his aunt and not with you, you would need to contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit pays (currently at least £25.60 per week) towards his care to be eligible. 

You are personally contributing £15 per week. While your mother also contributes £15 per week (making £30 total going to the aunt), only **your individual contribution** counts towards meeting this requirement. Unfortunately, £15 per week is below the threshold of £25.60 per week needed.

However, **Zahid's aunt may be eligible** to claim Child Benefit if she's the person he lives with and she's responsible for him.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:25:31.017578 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, when a child doesn't live with you, you can count contributions made by members of your household towards the £25.60 weekly threshold - the agent incorrectly stated that only the individual's personal contribution counts, when household contributions should be considered together.
