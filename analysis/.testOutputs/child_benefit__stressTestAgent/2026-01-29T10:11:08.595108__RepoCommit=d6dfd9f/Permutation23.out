2026-01-29T10:23:09.090222 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T10:23:10.596225 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Sarah. She's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T10:23:12.279089 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Is your daughter, Sarah, currently living with you, or are you responsible for her care?**

2026-01-29T10:23:13.775386 [actor]: No, she doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother.

2026-01-29T10:23:16.945064 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Next question: **Do you contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate toward your daughter Sarah's upkeep, or contribute at a higher rate than anyone else who might be claiming Child Benefit for her?**

(This is important because if a child doesn't live with you, you may still be able to claim if you're contributing more to their care than anyone else.)

2026-01-29T10:23:19.163082 [actor]: Well, I don't pay weekly maintenance, but every 4 weeks I buy a large bulk order of groceries and clothes for Sarah that costs £120, and I deliver them to her mother. Does that count?

2026-01-29T10:23:21.214143 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask a follow-up question to understand your situation better.

**Is Sarah's mother (or anyone else) currently claiming Child Benefit for Sarah?**

2026-01-29T10:23:23.038247 [actor]: I'm not sure if her mother is claiming it or not. I haven't really discussed that with her.

2026-01-29T10:23:26.795765 [root_agent]: Thank you for being honest about that.

Let me explain what I've learned so far: Based on the rules, only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. Usually, this is the person the child lives with. 

Since Sarah lives with her mother, her mother would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit. However, you might be able to claim instead if you contribute more to Sarah's upkeep than anyone else.

Next question: **Would you be willing and able to find out if Sarah's mother is currently claiming Child Benefit for Sarah?** 

This is important because:
- If her mother is already claiming it, you cannot also claim it
- If her mother is not claiming it, you might be eligible if your contributions are higher than anyone else's

2026-01-29T10:23:29.389849 [actor]: I can ask her, but honestly I'm not sure she'll tell me - we don't really communicate that well. Can you just tell me based on what I'm doing - the £120 every 4 weeks for groceries and clothes - would that qualify me if she's not claiming it?

2026-01-29T10:23:34.004731 [root_agent]: That's a fair question. Let me think through this carefully based on the eligibility rules.

To determine if your £120 every 4 weeks would qualify you, I need to understand a bit more about the comparison.

Next question: **Do you know if anyone else (such as Sarah's mother or another family member) is contributing financially to Sarah's upkeep, and if so, roughly how much?**

This matters because to claim Child Benefit when the child doesn't live with you, you need to be contributing **at least as much as the Child Benefit rate** (which is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest/only child, or about £102.40 every 4 weeks) **OR** more than anyone else who might be eligible to claim.

Your £120 every 4 weeks exceeds the Child Benefit rate, but I need to understand if you're contributing more than Sarah's mother or anyone else to assess your eligibility properly.

2026-01-29T10:23:36.542718 [actor]: Well, Sarah's mother provides her with a home, feeds her daily, pays for her school things, takes her to activities - she does everything day-to-day. I just do the bulk grocery and clothes delivery every 4 weeks. So I suppose her mother is contributing more overall than I am, isn't she?

2026-01-29T10:23:41.594818 [root_agent]: Thank you for being so open and honest about the situation.

Based on what you've told me, let me give you my assessment:

**You would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sarah** in this situation. Here's why:

1. Sarah lives with her mother, not with you
2. Sarah's mother is providing the main day-to-day care - housing, daily meals, school needs, and activities
3. While your £120 every 4 weeks is a valuable contribution, it appears that Sarah's mother is contributing significantly more overall to Sarah's upkeep

Under the Child Benefit rules, when a child doesn't live with you, you can only claim if you're contributing **more** than anyone else (or at least the same as anyone else who might be claiming). In this case, Sarah's mother is clearly the primary contributor to Sarah's care and upkeep.

**Sarah's mother would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit** for Sarah, as she is the one Sarah lives with and who provides the main care.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T10:23:47.016567 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent concluded I was not eligible, but according to the scenario's expected outcome I should be eligible. The agent failed to properly assess that my £120 contribution every 4 weeks (which exceeds the Child Benefit rate of approximately £102.40 every 4 weeks) could make me eligible even though the mother provides day-to-day care.
