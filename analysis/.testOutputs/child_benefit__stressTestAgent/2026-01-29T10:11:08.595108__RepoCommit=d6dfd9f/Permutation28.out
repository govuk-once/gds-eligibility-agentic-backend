2026-01-29T10:26:23.276403 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child (or children) who is either:
- Under 16 years old, or
- Under 20 years old and in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T10:26:25.032041 [actor]: Yes, I have a 5-year-old son who's with me here in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:26:28.110598 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for your son? By this I mean, does your child live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards their upkeep (currently £25.60 per week or more)?

2026-01-29T10:26:30.500000 [actor]: Yes, my son lives with me. I'm taking care of him while we're here.

2026-01-29T10:26:33.211894 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Next question: What is your immigration status in the UK? Specifically, are you:
- A UK citizen, or
- An Irish citizen, or
- Do you have settled status, pre-settled status, or another type of immigration permission to live in the UK?

2026-01-29T10:26:34.858345 [actor]: I'm a US citizen. I'm here on a standard 6-month tourist visa - just visiting.

2026-01-29T10:26:37.888320 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

This is an important factor for eligibility. To claim Child Benefit, you generally need to be living in the UK and have what's called the "right to reside" in the UK. A standard tourist visa typically doesn't provide this right to reside for benefit purposes.

However, let me ask a clarifying question: Is your son a UK citizen, or does he have any connection to the UK such as being born here or having a UK parent?

2026-01-29T10:26:39.494063 [actor]: No, my son is a US citizen like me. We're both just visiting the UK together. He doesn't have any connection to the UK - no UK parent or anything like that.

2026-01-29T10:26:43.687120 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that information.

Based on what you've told me, I'm afraid you would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit in your current circumstances.

Here's why:

1. **Right to reside requirement**: To claim Child Benefit, you must be living in the UK and have the "right to reside" here. A standard 6-month tourist visa is for visiting purposes only and doesn't give you the right to reside in the UK for benefit purposes.

2. **Child Benefit is for people who are settled or have permission to live in the UK**: It's generally available to UK citizens, Irish citizens, and those with settled status or certain other types of immigration permission that allow them to access public funds.

Since you and your son are visiting on tourist visas, you wouldn't meet the residency and immigration status requirements for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T10:26:45.499760 [actor]: No, that makes sense. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T10:26:48.957109 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that as a US citizen on a 6-month tourist visa without right to reside in the UK, I am not eligible for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
