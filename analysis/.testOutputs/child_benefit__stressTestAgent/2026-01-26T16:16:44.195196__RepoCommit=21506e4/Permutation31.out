2026-01-26T16:29:32.232939 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:29:34.080406 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hi there! Yes, I have a daughter named Emma who is 18 years old. She's just started university this year - she's in her first year of a 3-year Bachelor's degree. She still lives at home with me and commutes to the university each day.

2026-01-26T16:29:36.447623 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Emma is 18 and in university education, I need to check if her education qualifies under the Child Benefit rules.

Is Emma's university course considered "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes? Approved education typically includes A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, Scottish Highers, or similar full-time (more than 12 hours a week) non-advanced education.

2026-01-26T16:29:38.552147 [actor]: I'm not really sure about the technical distinctions. Emma is doing a Bachelor's degree at university. She's in her first year of a 3-year program. Is that considered "approved education"? I thought I could keep getting Child Benefit while she's at university, but I'm not certain about how it's classified.

2026-01-26T16:29:42.112784 [root_agent]: I appreciate your question. Bachelor's degrees at university are classified as "advanced education" rather than "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes.

Unfortunately, Child Benefit can only be claimed for children in approved non-advanced education or training, which includes things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, and similar qualifications.

Since Emma is now pursuing a Bachelor's degree (which is advanced education), she would not qualify for Child Benefit, even though she's under 20 and still living at home.

Child Benefit typically stops after the child reaches 16, unless they're in approved non-advanced education or training, in which case it can continue until they turn 20.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T16:29:44.208213 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing to hear. I didn't realize that university education doesn't qualify for Child Benefit. So since Emma has started her Bachelor's degree, I can't claim Child Benefit for her anymore, even though she's only 18 and still living at home with me?

When exactly would the payments stop? Would it be from when she started university or is there a grace period?

2026-01-26T16:29:47.775482 [root_agent]: I understand your disappointment. You're correct - since Emma has started her Bachelor's degree, you cannot claim Child Benefit for her anymore, even though she's only 18 and still living at home with you. University education (such as Bachelor's degrees) is classified as advanced education, which doesn't qualify for Child Benefit purposes.

Regarding when payments stop, Child Benefit typically ends immediately after your child starts advanced education like a university degree. There isn't a grace period. If Emma started university recently and you've been receiving payments since then, you should notify the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible to avoid having to repay any overpayments.

The Child Benefit Office needs to be informed of any change in circumstances that affects eligibility, such as a child starting university. You can report this change online through the government website or by contacting the Child Benefit Office directly.

Would you like information about any other aspects of Child Benefit or about reporting this change?

2026-01-26T16:29:50.177808 [actor]: I see, thank you for clarifying that. So I need to notify the Child Benefit Office right away since Emma started university last month. I wasn't aware that I needed to do this or that university education isn't covered.

Is there any other financial support available for university students that I should know about? I'm still supporting Emma financially while she's at university.

2026-01-26T16:29:52.020796 [actor]: Thank you for providing that information. I've completed my role in this conversation since the agent has clearly communicated that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter Emma is in advanced education (university Bachelor's degree), which doesn't qualify for Child Benefit purposes even though she's under 20 and still living at home.

2026-01-26T16:29:53.562900 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available when a child is pursuing advanced education like a university Bachelor's degree, even though Emma is only 18 and living at home.
