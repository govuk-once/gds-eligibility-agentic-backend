2026-01-26T16:38:44.327200 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this, I need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T16:38:46.102098 [actor]: I'll engage with the agent as a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll play the role of Fiona's parent/guardian in Edinburgh, Scotland.

2026-01-26T16:38:48.262102 [root_agent]: I understand you're in Edinburgh, Scotland. To determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask you some specific questions.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T16:38:49.291019 [actor]: Yes, I have my daughter Fiona who is 16 years old.

2026-01-26T16:38:50.959991 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since Fiona is 16, I need to know: Is she currently in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved education courses.

2026-01-26T16:38:51.914686 [actor]: She's left school and has joined the "No One Left Behind" programme in Scotland.

2026-01-26T16:38:54.790344 [root_agent]: I appreciate that information about Fiona's current situation.

For me to assess eligibility correctly, could you please tell me more about the "No One Left Behind" programme she's joined? Specifically, I need to understand if this qualifies as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-26T16:38:56.793046 [actor]: The "No One Left Behind" programme is a Scottish government initiative that provides training and skills development for young people who have left school. It helps them prepare for employment by offering various vocational training opportunities. Fiona joined it after leaving school because she wanted to learn practical skills rather than continuing with academic education.

2026-01-26T16:38:59.052067 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining about the "No One Left Behind" programme.

To determine if this programme qualifies for Child Benefit purposes, I need to know whether it's considered an "approved" training course by the UK government. 

Is the training unpaid? And do you know if it falls under any of these categories: training provided by a local authority, training part of an approved government training scheme, or training that involves working towards a qualification recognized by the Secretary of State?

2026-01-26T16:39:01.395483 [actor]: Yes, the training is unpaid. It's definitely provided by the local authority in Edinburgh as part of the Scottish government's initiative for youth employment. Fiona is working toward vocational qualifications that are recognized in Scotland, though I'm not sure about the specific recognition by the Secretary of State. The programme is designed to help young people like her develop skills for future employment.

2026-01-26T16:39:03.585442 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared, since the training is unpaid and provided by the local authority in Edinburgh, it sounds like Fiona's "No One Left Behind" programme would likely qualify as approved training for Child Benefit purposes.

Now, I need to ask: Are you responsible for Fiona? By this I mean, do you normally live with her and are you responsible for her care?

2026-01-26T16:39:05.063771 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for Fiona. She lives with me at our home in Edinburgh, and I take care of all her needs and expenses.

2026-01-26T16:39:06.011587 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask: Are you a UK resident? This is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-26T16:39:06.999100 [actor]: Yes, I am a UK resident. I've been living in Edinburgh for many years now.

2026-01-26T16:39:08.442175 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK resident.

Are there any other adults who might have a claim to Child Benefit for Fiona? For example, another parent or guardian who shares responsibility for her care?

2026-01-26T16:39:09.634127 [actor]: No, it's just me raising Fiona. I'm a single parent and have been her sole guardian for many years.

2026-01-26T16:39:11.095617 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

I need to ask about your income: Do you or a partner you live with have an individual income over £60,000 per year? (This relates to the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-26T16:39:12.076943 [actor]: No, my income is well below £60,000 per year. I work part-time and manage on a modest income.

2026-01-26T16:39:15.015727 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on everything you've told me, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit for Fiona because:

1. You are responsible for Fiona who is 16 and in what appears to be approved training (the "No One Left Behind" programme provided by the local authority)
2. You are a UK resident
3. You are Fiona's sole guardian
4. Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold of £60,000

You should be able to claim Child Benefit while Fiona remains under 20 and continues in this approved training programme. 

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T16:39:16.604277 [actor]: Yes, that's great news! I would appreciate information on how to apply for Child Benefit.

2026-01-26T16:39:18.825141 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that a 16-year-old in a local authority training program with a UK resident guardian meets the criteria for Child Benefit.
