2026-01-26T16:28:07.310948 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:28:08.618762 [actor]: I'm here to help you check if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK.

Yes, I have my 5-year-old son with me here in the UK. We're staying together.

2026-01-26T16:28:09.801564 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's a good start for your eligibility assessment.

Are you a UK national or do you have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:28:11.179049 [actor]: I'm actually a US citizen. I'm currently visiting the UK on a tourist visa for 6 months with my son. We're just staying temporarily.

2026-01-26T16:28:14.176176 [root_agent]: I understand that you're a US citizen visiting the UK temporarily on a tourist visa with your son.

Based on the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, you would not be eligible in this situation. Child Benefit is typically available to people who are living in the UK, not those who are temporarily visiting on a tourist visa.

To qualify for Child Benefit, you would need to have the right to reside in the UK (such as having settled status, pre-settled status, or indefinite leave to remain) and consider the UK your main home.

Since you're on a tourist visa for a temporary 6-month stay, you wouldn't meet the residency requirements for claiming Child Benefit.

2026-01-26T16:28:16.289289 [actor]: I see. Thank you for explaining that. I wasn't sure about how these benefits worked in the UK since I'm just visiting. That makes sense that my tourist visa wouldn't qualify me for Child Benefit since we're only here temporarily. I appreciate you clarifying the eligibility requirements.

2026-01-26T16:28:18.536224 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that as a US citizen visiting the UK on a tourist visa temporarily, the person would not be eligible for Child Benefit which requires permanent UK residency.
