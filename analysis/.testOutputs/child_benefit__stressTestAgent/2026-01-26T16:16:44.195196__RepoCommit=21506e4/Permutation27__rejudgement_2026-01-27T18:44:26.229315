2026-01-27T18:44:47.820302 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. According to gov.uk guidance, a person under 16 CAN claim Child Benefit for their own child. The agent incorrectly stated that the user must be at least 16 to claim, which contradicts the expected outcome that she is eligible, though it may be financially suboptimal compared to having her parents claim.
