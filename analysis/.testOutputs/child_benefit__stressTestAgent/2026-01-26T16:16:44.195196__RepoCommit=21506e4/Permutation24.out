2026-01-26T16:26:13.242300 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To make a proper assessment, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:26:14.295736 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Tom. He's 14 years old.

2026-01-26T16:26:15.825969 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit for your 14-year-old son Tom, I need to ask:

Does Tom normally live with you, or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards his upkeep?

2026-01-26T16:26:17.179713 [actor]: Well, Tom has severe behavioral needs and he's currently at a residential school. The local council is paying for it. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-26T16:26:19.537596 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about Tom's situation. This is an important detail.

When a child is in residential care or education that's arranged or funded by a local authority, special rules apply for Child Benefit eligibility.

Since Tom is in residential school funded by the local council, I need to ask: Does Tom come home to stay with you regularly? Specifically, does he come home for at least 8 weeks in a year?

2026-01-26T16:26:20.849699 [actor]: Yes, he comes home during school holidays. He's home for about 14 weeks throughout the year during term breaks.

2026-01-26T16:26:28.104948 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Tom comes home for approximately 14 weeks throughout the year during school holidays, which is more than the minimum 8 weeks required, you likely remain eligible for Child Benefit.

When a child is in residential accommodation arranged by the local authority but comes home regularly for at least 8 weeks in a year, you can typically continue to receive Child Benefit.

May I ask, are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year? This affects whether you would need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-26T16:26:29.439940 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that amount. I'm a single parent and I work part-time at a grocery store while caring for Tom when he's home.

2026-01-26T16:26:33.167242 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Based on what you've told me:

1. You have a 14-year-old son (Tom)
2. He's currently in residential school funded by the local council
3. He comes home for about 14 weeks throughout the year (which is more than the required 8 weeks)
4. You're a single parent working part-time with earnings well below £60,000

Given these circumstances, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Since your income is below £60,000, you would receive the full amount without being subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

If you haven't already applied for Child Benefit, you can do so using the CH2 claim form. If you're already receiving it, it sounds like you should continue to be eligible based on Tom's circumstances.

Would you like to know the current Child Benefit payment rates or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-26T16:26:35.309621 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for Child Benefit. That's helpful to know. Could you tell me the current payment rates? And also, if Tom ends up staying at the residential school for longer than 12 weeks continuously without coming home, would that affect my eligibility?

2026-01-26T16:26:37.840506 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit since their child comes home for 14 weeks per year, which exceeds the minimum 8-week requirement for children in residential care arranged by local authorities.
