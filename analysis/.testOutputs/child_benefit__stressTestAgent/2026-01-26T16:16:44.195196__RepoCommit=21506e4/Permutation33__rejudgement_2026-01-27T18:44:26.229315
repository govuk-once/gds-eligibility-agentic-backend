2026-01-27T18:44:45.492912 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ The agent made an error in their assessment. According to gov.uk guidelines, if training is paid for by an employer (as stated clearly in the case of Bella), it does not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit eligibility. The agent incorrectly told the user they were eligible when the correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
