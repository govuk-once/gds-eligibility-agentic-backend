2026-01-26T16:37:07.876294 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your situation, I need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T16:37:09.510646 [actor]: I should roleplay a specific UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll take on the role of James who does not live with his child but pays court-ordered maintenance.

I don't live with my child. They live with their mother, but I do pay £50 a week for child maintenance because of a court order.

2026-01-26T16:37:11.283661 [root_agent]: I understand your situation, James. Thank you for sharing that information.

Since your child doesn't live with you, I need to ask: Does anyone claim Child Benefit for this child already (such as the mother they live with)?

2026-01-26T16:37:12.822447 [actor]: Yes, I believe the mother already claims Child Benefit for our child. She has primary custody and they live with her full-time.

2026-01-26T16:37:15.846365 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, James.

Since the child lives with their mother full-time, she has primary custody, and she already claims Child Benefit for your child, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for the same child.

Child Benefit can generally only be claimed by one person, and it's typically the person the child lives with. The fact that you pay child maintenance is important for supporting your child, but it doesn't qualify you for Child Benefit in this situation where your child lives with their mother full-time and she already claims the benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T16:37:18.072946 [actor]: I understand that I'm not eligible since the child lives with their mother and she already claims the benefit. I thought my court-ordered maintenance payments might count for something, but I guess not when it comes to Child Benefit. 

Are there any other benefits I might be entitled to as a non-resident parent who's paying maintenance?

2026-01-26T16:37:20.260933 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can only be claimed by one person, typically the person the child lives with, and since the mother already claims the benefit, James is not eligible despite paying child maintenance.
