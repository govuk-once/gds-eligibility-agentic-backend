2026-01-27T18:44:41.214131 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ The agent incorrectly determined the outcome. According to the guidance, contributions from multiple people can be combined to meet the threshold, as long as the total is at least equal to the Child Benefit amount. Since Mo and his mother contribute £30 total (above the £25.60 threshold), Mo should be eligible.
