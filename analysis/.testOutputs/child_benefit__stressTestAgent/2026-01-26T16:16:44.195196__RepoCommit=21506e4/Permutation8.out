2026-01-26T16:19:34.211471 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T16:19:35.287411 [actor]: Yes, I have a 4-year-old daughter named Ruby who lives with me and my partner James.

2026-01-26T16:19:36.304019 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know about your daughter Ruby.

Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:19:37.128890 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK with my family.

2026-01-26T16:19:38.730598 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Is your daughter Ruby a UK citizen, or does she have the right to live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:19:39.686253 [actor]: Yes, Ruby is a UK citizen.

2026-01-26T16:19:40.787848 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Are you or your partner earning over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T16:19:41.960432 [actor]: Yes, I earn £75,000 per year. My partner James earns £20,000.

2026-01-26T16:19:46.968396 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your income information.

Based on what you've told me, you are eligible for Child Benefit because:
- You're responsible for a child under 16 (Ruby, who is 4)
- You live in the UK
- Ruby is a UK citizen

However, since you earn over £60,000 per year (£75,000), you will have to pay back all of the Child Benefit you receive through the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge when you complete a Self Assessment tax return.

You have two options:
1. You can claim Child Benefit and pay the tax charge through Self Assessment
2. You can opt not to receive the Child Benefit payments (to avoid having to pay it back through tax)

Even if you choose not to receive the payments, it can still be beneficial to fill out the claim form because:
- It helps you get National Insurance credits which count toward your State Pension
- It ensures your child is automatically issued a National Insurance number when they turn 16

Would you like more information about how to claim or about the tax charge?

2026-01-26T16:19:49.877215 [actor]: Thank you for explaining my situation clearly. I understand that I'm eligible for Child Benefit but would need to pay it all back through tax due to my £75,000 income. 

I didn't realize I could claim but opt out of receiving payments. That's helpful to know about the National Insurance credits and my daughter's future National Insurance number.

Could you tell me how I would go about claiming but opting out of receiving the payments? That seems like it might be the best option for me.

2026-01-26T16:19:52.589270 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the person is eligible for Child Benefit but would need to pay it all back through the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge due to earning over £60,000, and also explained the option to claim but opt out of payments.
