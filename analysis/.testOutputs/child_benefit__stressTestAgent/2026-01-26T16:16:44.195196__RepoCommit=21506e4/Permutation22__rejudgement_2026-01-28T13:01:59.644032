According to the rules, when a child returns to hospital within 28 days (Arthur returned after 15 days), the stays are linked and count as one continuous period. Since the combined stays exceed 12 weeks (13 weeks total), the expected outcome is that the parent is not eligible for Child Benefit after the cumulative 12th week.
