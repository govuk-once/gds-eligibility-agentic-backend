2026-01-26T16:23:26.360234 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To give you the most accurate information, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:23:27.874176 [actor]: I'll respond as if I'm a person in the situation described in the context.

Hello, yes I do have responsibility for my son. His name is Dev, and he's 19 years old. He's studying full-time for his A-levels at the moment.

2026-01-26T16:23:29.435187 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information about Dev. Since he's 19 and studying for his A-levels, which is approved education, that's helpful to know.

Is Dev living with you? Or is he living with someone else?

2026-01-26T16:23:30.562423 [actor]: Yes, Dev is living with me. He stays at our family home while he's studying for his A-levels.

2026-01-26T16:23:32.084475 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Dev lives with you while studying. 

Could you tell me if you're responsible for Dev's day-to-day care? This would include things like providing meals, buying clothes, and making decisions about his education and healthcare.

2026-01-26T16:23:33.193106 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for Dev's day-to-day care. I provide his meals, buy his clothes, and I'm the one making decisions about his education and healthcare matters.

2026-01-26T16:23:34.706917 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now I need to understand your residence situation. Do you and Dev live in the UK? And what is your immigration status - are you a UK national, have settled status, or some other status?

2026-01-26T16:23:35.964452 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. I'm a UK citizen and have lived here for many years. Dev was born and raised here as well.

2026-01-26T16:23:37.734072 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £50,000 a year in individual adjusted net income? This is relevant for the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-26T16:23:38.995629 [actor]: No, my individual income is below £50,000 per year. I earn about £38,000 annually from my job.

2026-01-26T16:23:40.572319 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your income.

Is Dev currently receiving any of the following benefits in his own right:
- Disability Living Allowance
- Personal Independence Payment
- Armed Forces Independence Payment
- Employment and Support Allowance
- Universal Credit
- Income Support

2026-01-26T16:23:41.581505 [actor]: No, Dev isn't receiving any of those benefits. He's just focusing on his A-level studies right now.

2026-01-26T16:23:44.341822 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Dev isn't receiving any of those benefits.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit. 

You are:
- Responsible for Dev who is 19 and in approved education (A-levels)
- Living with Dev and providing his day-to-day care
- A UK citizen living in the UK
- Earning below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold of £50,000

Since Dev is in approved education and under 20, you can continue to receive Child Benefit until he completes his course.

Would you like to know about how to claim Child Benefit or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-26T16:23:46.352323 [actor]: That's good to know, thank you. Actually, I should mention that Dev will be turning 20 next month, in the middle of his current term. Will I still be eligible for Child Benefit after his 20th birthday? He'll still be studying for his A-levels after his birthday.

2026-01-26T16:23:49.602411 [root_agent]: Thank you for mentioning that important detail about Dev's upcoming 20th birthday.

Unfortunately, once Dev turns 20, you will no longer be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him, even though he's still studying for his A-levels. The age limit for Child Benefit is under 20 years of age for children in approved education or training.

When Dev turns 20, your Child Benefit payments will automatically stop. You don't need to contact HMRC to report this as they should already have Dev's date of birth on record and will stop payments accordingly.

You will continue to receive Child Benefit up until Dev's 20th birthday, but not beyond that point.

2026-01-26T16:23:51.431790 [actor]: I see. So I'll only receive Child Benefit until Dev turns 20, and then it will stop automatically. Thank you for clarifying that for me. I appreciate the information about my eligibility.

2026-01-26T16:23:54.070688 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit would be payable while the 19-year-old is in approved education (A-levels), but would stop once the child turns 20, which aligns with official guidelines.
