2026-01-28T13:03:16.338593 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the user was not eligible for Child Benefit. According to the rules, since Mark contributes more than the Child Benefit amount (£150 vs £113/month) to Lucas's upkeep, and Jenny is not claiming the benefit, Mark should be eligible under the "contributing to upkeep" exception, even though Lucas doesn't live with him.
