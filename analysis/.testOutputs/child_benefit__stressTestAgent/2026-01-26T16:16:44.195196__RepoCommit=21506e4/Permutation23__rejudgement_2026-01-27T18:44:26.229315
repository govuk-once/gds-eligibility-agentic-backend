2026-01-27T18:44:50.091560 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated the outcome as ineligible, when the expected outcome was "Eligible." The agent failed to recognize that regular contributions of £120 every 4 weeks (which equals £30/week) exceeds the Child Benefit rate threshold, making the father eligible despite the child not living with him.
