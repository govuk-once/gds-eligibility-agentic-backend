The agent correctly determined that the parent is eligible for Child Benefit because Fiona is 16 and in the "No One Left Behind" programme (which qualifies as approved training as it's provided by the local authority), the parent is a UK resident, the sole guardian, and has income below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
