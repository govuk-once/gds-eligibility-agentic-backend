2026-01-26T16:29:55.438306 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:29:56.799810 [actor]: Hi there! Yes, I have a son named John who's 17. He's still living with me at home.

2026-01-26T16:29:58.687633 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since your son John is 17 and living with you, I'll need to know a bit more about his current situation to determine your eligibility.

Is John in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved education courses.

2026-01-26T16:30:00.533971 [actor]: Yes, John is currently attending a local college. He's re-sitting two of his GCSEs that he didn't do well in before. His course involves about 6 hours of supervised study each week. The rest of the time he's mostly at home playing video games.

2026-01-26T16:30:02.618040 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

For Child Benefit eligibility when a child is over 16, the education needs to be what's considered "approved education." 

I need to check if John's current education meets these requirements. Could you tell me if his course at the college is considered full-time (at least 12 hours per week of supervised study) or if it's part of a specific qualification?

2026-01-26T16:30:04.519526 [actor]: No, his course isn't full-time. As I mentioned, he only does about 6 hours of supervised study per week at the college. He's just re-sitting two GCSE exams that he didn't pass before. The rest of the time he's at home.

2026-01-26T16:30:07.749712 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that information.

Based on what you've shared, I need to inform you that you likely wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit for John in this situation. For Child Benefit to continue for a child aged 16-19, they must be in what's considered "approved education," which typically requires at least 12 hours per week of supervised study.

Since John is only attending about 6 hours per week of supervised study, this would not meet the requirement for "approved education" as defined in the Child Benefit eligibility criteria.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility or is there anything else about your situation that might be relevant?

2026-01-26T16:30:09.890699 [actor]: I understand. So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because John's education doesn't count as "approved education" since it's less than 12 hours per week. That's disappointing but makes sense. Thank you for explaining it to me.

2026-01-26T16:30:12.274399 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available when a 17-year-old is in education involving only 6 hours of supervised study per week, as approved education requires at least 12 hours.
