2026-01-26T16:38:21.790219 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children that you're responsible for who are under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:38:24.093204 [actor]: I'll now take on the role of someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility based on the situation provided.

I'll respond as if I'm the parent/guardian of Tom who is 17 years old and taking a computer coding course paid for by his future employer.

To the agent's question about having children under 16 or under 20 in approved education:

Yes, I have a son who's 17. He's currently taking a computer coding course.

2026-01-26T16:38:27.063645 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about your 17-year-old son who's taking a computer coding course. 

Is your son's computer coding course considered approved education or training according to UK standards? Approved education typically includes:
- A-levels or similar qualifications
- T levels
- International Baccalaureate
- NVQs and other vocational qualifications up to level 3
- Home education (if it started before your child turned 16)
- Traineeships in England

2026-01-26T16:38:29.528321 [actor]: The course is a computer coding program that my son is taking. It's not one of those standard qualifications like A-levels or NVQs. Actually, his future employer is paying for all the course fees as part of an agreement that he'll join their company after he completes it. He doesn't get paid while on the course though - it's just training before he starts the actual job.

2026-01-26T16:38:31.887399 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying about your son's computer coding program. 

Since the course is being paid for by a future employer and doesn't appear to fall under the approved education or training categories (A-levels, T levels, International Baccalaureate, NVQs up to level 3, home education started before age 16, or traineeships in England), it likely wouldn't qualify for Child Benefit purposes.

Do you normally live in the UK? (This is another eligibility factor I need to check)

2026-01-26T16:38:33.564064 [actor]: Yes, we do live in the UK. We've been here all our lives. So even though Tom's doing this course with his future employer, we don't qualify for Child Benefit anymore?

2026-01-26T16:38:37.203749 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears that your son Tom would not qualify for Child Benefit purposes because his computer coding course paid for by his future employer doesn't fall under the approved education or training categories required by the UK government.

Child Benefit typically continues for children between 16 and 19 years old only if they're in approved education or training. Since Tom's course doesn't seem to meet these specific criteria, you would likely not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for him.

However, if Tom were to enter an approved education or training program before age 20, you could potentially become eligible again. Would you like me to explain what types of education or training would qualify?

2026-01-26T16:38:39.743118 [actor]: I understand now. So because Tom's course is arranged with his employer rather than being one of those approved education types, we can't get Child Benefit for him anymore. That's disappointing, but I suppose those are the rules.

No need to explain the other types - he's pretty set on this career path with this employer. Thank you for explaining it to me clearly.

2026-01-26T16:38:42.353959 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the child benefit is not available because the 17-year-old's employer-funded coding course does not qualify as approved education under UK guidelines.
