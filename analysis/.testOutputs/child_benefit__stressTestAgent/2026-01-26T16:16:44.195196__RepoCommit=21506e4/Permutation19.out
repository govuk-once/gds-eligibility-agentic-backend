2026-01-26T16:23:55.815010 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First question: Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:23:57.186137 [actor]: I need to respond as if I were in the situation described in Permutation 19. I'll play the role of either Pete or Sue with their daughter Holly.

Yes, I'm responsible for my daughter Holly. She's 9 years old.

2026-01-26T16:23:59.281418 [root_agent]: I notice there might be some confusion. I'm simply trying to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit based on UK government criteria. Let me continue with my assessment questions.

Since you've mentioned you're responsible for Holly who is 9 years old, I'd like to ask: Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:24:00.105879 [actor]: Yes, I do live in the UK.

2026-01-26T16:24:01.094063 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK. 

My next question is: Is Holly living with you?

2026-01-26T16:24:02.805784 [actor]: Well, Holly stays with me part of the week. Her father/mother and I are separated. She stays with me 4 days a week and with her father/mother for 3 days a week. We both take care of her needs like buying clothes and food.

2026-01-26T16:24:05.034644 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your arrangement with Holly.

When parents are separated and a child divides their time between them, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with for the majority of the time. Since Holly stays with you for 4 days of the week (which is more than with her other parent), you may be eligible.

My next question is: Are you or your ex-partner currently receiving Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-26T16:24:06.996550 [actor]: Well, that's actually the issue. Neither of us is currently receiving Child Benefit for Holly. We both submitted claims to HMRC because we couldn't agree on who should be claiming. I think I should get it since Holly stays with me more days (4 days vs 3 days), and I also buy her clothes and food.

2026-01-26T16:24:09.889697 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining the situation. You're right that since Holly stays with you for more days of the week (4 days versus 3 days), you would generally have the stronger claim for Child Benefit.

When separated parents cannot agree who should receive Child Benefit, HMRC will typically make a decision based on who has the main responsibility for the child. The fact that Holly lives with you for the majority of the time (4 days versus 3 days) is an important factor that would work in your favor.

My next question: Has HMRC made any decision yet regarding the competing claims you and your ex-partner submitted?

2026-01-26T16:24:11.804796 [actor]: No, HMRC hasn't made a decision yet about our competing claims. We only submitted them recently. I'm just trying to understand if I'm likely to be eligible since Holly stays with me most of the time.

2026-01-26T16:24:15.572393 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, you are likely to be eligible for Child Benefit for Holly because:

1. You are responsible for a child under 16 (Holly is 9 years old)
2. You live in the UK
3. Holly lives with you for the majority of the week (4 days compared to 3 days with your ex-partner)

In cases where parents can't agree and both submit claims, HMRC will make a decision based on who has main responsibility. The fact that Holly stays with you for more days per week is likely to be considered evidence that you have main responsibility. Your contributions to Holly's needs (clothes, food) also support your claim.

While I can't guarantee HMRC's decision, the information you've provided suggests you have a strong case for eligibility.

Is there anything specific about the Child Benefit eligibility criteria you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-26T16:24:17.971809 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that. It's helpful to know that I likely have a strong case for eligibility since Holly lives with me for the majority of the week. I'm glad to hear that HMRC typically considers this factor when making their decision. I'll wait to hear from them about our competing claims.

2026-01-26T16:24:20.588964 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the person is likely eligible for Child Benefit because their child stays with them for the majority of the time (4 days vs 3 days), which is the correct determining factor when separated parents both make claims.
