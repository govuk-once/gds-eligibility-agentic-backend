2026-01-28T13:02:39.906091 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent failed to communicate that the user is not eligible. Instead, the agent suggested the user is still eligible if they can provide evidence of job seeking, rather than clearly stating that the benefit has expired after 91 days as a jobseeker with no job offer, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Expired)."
