2026-01-27T18:45:06.670419 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated there are no exceptions to the marriage rule for Child Benefit. According to the scenario, an exception applies if the married child lives with the claimant and the claimant isn't supporting their spouse (or if the spouse is also in education/dependent). Since Rashid lives with his parents and both he and his wife are students dependent on the parents, this exception should apply, making the father eligible via exception. The expected outcome was "Eligible (via Exception)" but the agent incorrectly stated they were ineligible.
