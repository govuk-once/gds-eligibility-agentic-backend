2026-01-26T16:22:38.421207 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:22:39.364099 [actor]: I have a son named Oliver who is 14 years old.

2026-01-26T16:22:40.794609 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Yes, having a 14-year-old son means you may be eligible for Child Benefit as he is under 16.

My next question is: Does your son Oliver normally live with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:22:42.543650 [actor]: Oliver normally lives with me in the UK, but he's currently in a hospital in the USA. He has a rare condition and was sent to a specialist hospital there for treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I'm still in the UK, but I pay for his incidental costs and visit him when I can.

2026-01-26T16:22:44.949404 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I understand that Oliver normally lives with you in the UK but is currently receiving specialized medical treatment in the USA.

When a child is temporarily away from home for medical treatment, this generally does not affect Child Benefit eligibility. The UK government considers this a temporary absence, especially since you're still responsible for his costs and maintain your connection with him through visits.

My next question is: Have you been receiving Child Benefit for Oliver before he went to the USA for treatment?

2026-01-26T16:22:45.856197 [actor]: Yes, I've been receiving Child Benefit for Oliver before he went to the USA for his treatment.

2026-01-26T16:22:48.385884 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Since you were already receiving Child Benefit for Oliver before his medical treatment in the USA, you can continue to receive it while he's temporarily abroad for medical treatment.

The UK government allows Child Benefit to continue during temporary absences, especially for medical treatment. As long as Oliver normally lives with you in the UK and his stay in the USA is temporary for medical reasons, your eligibility should not be affected.

My next question is: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T16:22:49.516398 [actor]: No, my income is around £40,000 per year, and I'm a single parent.

2026-01-26T16:22:53.461899 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared:

1. You have a 14-year-old son (under 16), who normally lives with you in the UK
2. Oliver is temporarily in the USA for medical treatment (approximately 15 weeks so far)
3. You were already receiving Child Benefit before his treatment abroad
4. Your income is around £40,000 per year as a single parent

Given these circumstances, you remain eligible for Child Benefit. Since your income is below £50,000, you'll receive the full Child Benefit amount without the High Income Child Benefit Charge being applied.

You should continue to receive your payments as normal during Oliver's temporary medical treatment abroad. If his stay extends significantly (generally beyond 52 weeks), or if your circumstances change in other ways, you should notify the Child Benefit Office.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement?

2026-01-26T16:22:55.339580 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm still eligible for Child Benefit while Oliver is receiving treatment in the USA. That's a relief to know I can continue receiving the support while he's getting the specialist care he needs. I don't have any other questions right now.

2026-01-26T16:22:58.241882 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit can continue during temporary absences for medical treatment, even when the child is receiving treatment abroad.
