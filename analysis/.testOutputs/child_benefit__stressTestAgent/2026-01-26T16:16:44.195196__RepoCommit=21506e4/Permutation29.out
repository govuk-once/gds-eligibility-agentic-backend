2026-01-26T16:28:20.085914 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:28:21.288489 [actor]: Hi there. Yes, I have a son named Jordan who is 17 years old. He's living with me at home.

2026-01-26T16:28:22.878374 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Jordan is 17 years old, I need to know a bit more about his situation.

Is Jordan in approved education or training? This would typically include things like A-levels, NVQs, or other approved courses.

2026-01-26T16:28:24.193705 [actor]: No, he's not in any education or training at the moment. He finished his GCSEs last year but didn't go on to college or anything like that. He's just been at home since then.

2026-01-26T16:28:26.635217 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Based on what you've shared, it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Jordan.

Child Benefit is typically available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. Since Jordan is 17 and not currently in education or training, he wouldn't meet the eligibility criteria.

If Jordan's situation changes and he decides to enter approved education or training before he turns 20, you could then apply for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else about Child Benefit you'd like to know?

2026-01-26T16:28:28.612342 [actor]: I see. That's disappointing to hear. Is there anything we could do to become eligible? I'm a single dad and any financial help would be useful. Does it matter that Jordan isn't working either? He's basically just at home all day.

2026-01-26T16:28:32.833531 [root_agent]: I understand your situation as a single dad, and I appreciate that additional financial support would be helpful.

Unfortunately, for Child Benefit eligibility, it doesn't matter that Jordan isn't working. The key criteria for a 17-year-old is that they must be in approved education or training.

To become eligible, Jordan would need to enroll in approved education or training. This could include:
- A-levels or Scottish Highers
- NVQs and other vocational qualifications up to level 3
- Home education (if it started before your child turned 16)
- Traineeships in England

If Jordan decides to return to education or start a training program, you could then apply for Child Benefit. This would provide you with some financial support until he turns 20, as long as he remains in the approved course.

Would you like me to provide any information about other types of support that might be available to you as a single parent?

2026-01-26T16:28:34.496911 [actor]: That's helpful to understand. What kind of training programs would qualify? Would he need to be in full-time education? And yes, I would appreciate information about other types of support that might be available to me as a single parent.

2026-01-26T16:28:41.551856 [root_agent]: I'm glad that's helpful. Let me address your questions about qualifying training programs first.

For Child Benefit eligibility, the training needs to be "approved" - this typically includes:

- Traineeships in England
- Foundation Apprenticeships or Traineeships in Wales
- Employability Fund programs in Scotland
- Training for Success or PEACE IV Children and Young People 2.1 in Northern Ireland

The education or training generally needs to be non-advanced (up to A level or equivalent) and can be either full-time or part-time. However, the course should involve more than 12 hours of supervised study per week during term time.

Regarding other support available to you as a single parent:

1. Universal Credit - This could help with living costs and may include additional amounts for caring for a child
2. Council Tax Reduction - You might get a discount on your council tax bill
3. Help with housing costs through Housing Benefit or Universal Credit
4. Free school meals (if Jordan returns to education)
5. Healthy Start vouchers (if you have younger children)
6. Support from your local council's welfare assistance scheme

There's also support specifically for helping Jordan move forward:
- Jobcentre Plus can provide career advice and potential training opportunities
- The National Careers Service can offer guidance on education and training options

Would you like more specific information about any of these support options?

2026-01-26T16:28:43.244703 [actor]: Thank you for all that information. It's been really helpful to understand our options. If Jordan does decide to enroll in one of those training programs, how would I go about applying for the Child Benefit? And how much support would I potentially receive?

2026-01-26T16:28:49.522376 [root_agent]: You're welcome! I'm happy to explain how to apply for Child Benefit if Jordan enrolls in a qualifying training program, and what support you might receive.

To apply for Child Benefit:

1. You can apply online through the GOV.UK website, or
2. Fill out and mail the Child Benefit claim form CH2 (available for download from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office)

You'll need:
- Your National Insurance number
- Your bank or building society account details
- Your child's birth certificate
- Details about Jordan's education or training provider

As for the amount you would receive:

For 2023/24, Child Benefit pays:
- £24.00 per week for your eldest or only child (£1,248 per year)
- £15.90 per week for any additional children (if you have any)

However, it's important to note that if you earn over £50,000 a year, you'll have to pay back some of your Child Benefit as Income Tax (known as the 'High Income Child Benefit Charge'). If you earn £60,000 or more, you'll have to pay back all of it.

Once Jordan starts his approved training or education, you can claim Child Benefit and it can be backdated for up to 3 months from when the Child Benefit Office receives your claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about the application process?

2026-01-26T16:28:52.165134 [actor]: That's all very clear, thank you. I earn well below £50,000 so that wouldn't be an issue for me. I think I understand everything now - basically Jordan needs to get into education or an approved training program, and then I can apply for the benefit which would be £24 per week. I appreciate all your help explaining this to me.

2026-01-26T16:28:54.960246 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that since Jordan is 17 and not in approved education or training, the user is not eligible for Child Benefit, and correctly outlined the requirements and application process.
