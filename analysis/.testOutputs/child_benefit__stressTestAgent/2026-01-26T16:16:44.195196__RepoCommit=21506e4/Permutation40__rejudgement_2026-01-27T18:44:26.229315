The agent correctly determined that the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit while their son is in the psychiatric unit for 10 weeks (as this falls within the 12-week limit for hospital/residential medical treatment), and appropriately advised notifying authorities if the stay extends beyond 12 weeks.
