For a child in care longer than 8 weeks, eligibility requires stays of at least 2 nights OR at least 24 hours per week. While the user's child does stay for 25 hours (satisfying the time requirement), the agent based eligibility only on the overnight stay rather than explaining the correct 24-hour requirement that actually makes the user eligible.
