2026-01-26T16:22:07.057577 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:22:07.923655 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Noah who is 6 years old.

2026-01-26T16:22:09.149373 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. So you have a 6-year-old son named Noah.

Does Noah live with you? (This helps determine who is responsible for the child's care)

2026-01-26T16:22:10.664464 [actor]: Well, not at the moment. I recently had surgery and I'm still recovering, so Noah has been staying with his grandmother for about 6 weeks now. It's a temporary arrangement until I'm well enough to care for him properly again.

2026-01-26T16:22:13.401025 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation. I understand that Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother while you recover from surgery.

For Child Benefit purposes, this kind of temporary arrangement where your child stays elsewhere due to your illness would not usually affect your eligibility. Since this is a temporary arrangement and you remain responsible for Noah, you would still be considered the person who Noah normally lives with.

May I ask if you're currently receiving Child Benefit for Noah, or is this a new application you're considering?

2026-01-26T16:22:14.968990 [actor]: Yes, I've been receiving Child Benefit for Noah since he was born. I was just worried that I might lose it while he's staying with his grandmother. I wasn't sure if I needed to notify anyone about this temporary change.

2026-01-26T16:22:17.739662 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. You don't need to worry about losing your Child Benefit in this situation. 

Since this is a temporary arrangement while you recover from surgery, and Noah will be returning to live with you, you can continue to receive Child Benefit as normal. You don't need to notify HMRC about this short-term temporary arrangement where your child is staying with a family member.

If the arrangement were to become more permanent or long-term, then you would need to inform HMRC. But for a temporary stay of a few weeks while you recover, your Child Benefit should continue without any changes needed.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement?

2026-01-26T16:22:19.788660 [actor]: That's a relief! Thank you for explaining. So I understand I don't need to notify anyone about this temporary arrangement since he'll be back home with me soon. I don't have any other questions about my Child Benefit at the moment.

2026-01-26T16:22:22.013293 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that temporary stays with family members due to the parent's illness don't affect Child Benefit eligibility and that notification to HMRC isn't required for short-term arrangements.
