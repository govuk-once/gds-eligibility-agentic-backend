The agent correctly informed the user that they are eligible for Child Benefit while Dev is 19 and in approved education, but clearly explained that eligibility will cease once Dev turns 20, even if he's still studying. This matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)."
