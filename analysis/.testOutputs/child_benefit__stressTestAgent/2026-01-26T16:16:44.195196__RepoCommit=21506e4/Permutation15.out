First, do you have any children living with you that you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T16:22:24.956082 [actor]: Hi there. My name is Mike, I'm 45 years old. I don't have any children living with me. My daughter Emma is 12 years old but she lives with her mother. I was wondering if I could claim Child Benefit for her.

2026-01-26T16:22:27.187820 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context, Mike. I understand that your 12-year-old daughter Emma lives with her mother rather than with you.

In cases where a child doesn't live with you, Child Benefit eligibility has specific rules. Let me ask you: Do you pay for Emma's maintenance at an equal or higher amount than the weekly rate of Child Benefit (currently £25.60 for the oldest or only child)?

2026-01-26T16:22:28.909690 [actor]: No, I don't pay that much. I send Emma a birthday present once a year, and I transfer £10 a week to her mother to help with food. I know it's not a lot, but it's what I can afford right now. Her mother doesn't claim Child Benefit for her, so I was wondering if I could claim it.

2026-01-26T16:22:32.097596 [root_agent]: I understand your situation, Mike. Thank you for explaining.

Based on what you've shared, it appears you wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit for Emma. To claim Child Benefit for a child who lives with someone else, you need to pay at least an amount equal to the weekly Child Benefit rate (currently £25.60 for the oldest or only child) toward their maintenance.

Since you currently contribute £10 per week, this falls below the required threshold. Additionally, Child Benefit can typically only be paid to the person the child actually lives with - in this case, Emma's mother.

If Emma's mother isn't claiming Child Benefit, she may want to consider doing so as she would likely be eligible since Emma lives with her.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T16:22:34.538305 [actor]: I see, that's disappointing but I understand. I didn't realize I needed to contribute that much to be eligible. Since I only send £10 a week, I guess I don't qualify. I'll let Emma's mother know that she should consider claiming it herself since Emma lives with her. Thank you for explaining this to me.

2026-01-26T16:22:36.915930 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Mike is not eligible for Child Benefit because he pays less than the weekly Child Benefit rate (£10 vs £25.60 required) for a child who doesn't live with him.
