2026-01-28T13:02:22.727889 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that the user was not eligible for Child Benefit. While the agent correctly explained that the child's mother would typically be the primary claimant since the child lives with her, they failed to recognize that the user's regular financial contributions (£120 every 4 weeks, exceeding the weekly threshold) actually make him eligible for Child Benefit under the rules for non-resident parents who contribute sufficiently.
