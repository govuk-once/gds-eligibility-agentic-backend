2026-01-26T16:21:41.485910 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:21:43.377640 [actor]: I'll role-play as a person checking their child benefit eligibility.

Yes, I have responsibility for a child. My partner and I are in the process of adopting a 4-year-old girl named Maya. She was placed with us by the adoption agency and is currently living with us, although the final adoption order hasn't been granted by the court yet.

2026-01-26T16:21:45.072324 [root_agent]: I understand your situation. Thank you for sharing that information about Maya.

May I ask, are you or your partner receiving any payments from the local authority or adoption agency for looking after Maya during this pre-adoption placement?

2026-01-26T16:21:46.696569 [actor]: No, we're not receiving any payments from the local authority or adoption agency for looking after Maya. We're just providing for her as her prospective adoptive parents. The agency helped with the placement process, but we're not getting ongoing financial support from them.

2026-01-26T16:21:48.099358 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Do you or your partner usually live in the UK? (This includes England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland)

2026-01-26T16:21:49.473943 [actor]: Yes, both my partner and I live in the UK. We have our home here where Maya is now living with us.

2026-01-26T16:21:51.158094 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Is either you or your partner a UK national, or do you have the right to reside in the UK (such as having settled or pre-settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits)?

2026-01-26T16:21:52.080263 [actor]: Yes, both my partner and I are UK nationals. We've lived here all our lives.

2026-01-26T16:21:53.382810 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Are either you or your partner subject to immigration control that would restrict access to public funds?

2026-01-26T16:21:54.452936 [actor]: No, neither of us is subject to immigration control. As I mentioned, we're both UK nationals who have lived here our whole lives.

2026-01-26T16:21:55.523133 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information.

Does either you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T16:21:56.373328 [actor]: No, neither of us has an individual income over £60,000 per year.

2026-01-26T16:22:01.132084 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Maya. As prospective adoptive parents with a child placed in your home, you can typically claim Child Benefit even before the adoption is legally finalized, as you have responsibility for caring for the child.

Since:
- You have responsibility for a child under 16 (Maya, age 4)
- You and your partner live in the UK
- You are both UK nationals
- Neither of you is subject to immigration control
- Neither of you earns over £60,000 individually
- You're not receiving payments from the local authority for Maya's care

You would likely qualify for Child Benefit. However, only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child, so you and your partner would need to decide who will make the claim.

You can apply for Child Benefit as soon as Maya comes to live with you or after the birth of a child. Claims can be backdated for up to 3 months.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T16:22:03.437132 [actor]: That's great news that we're eligible for Child Benefit for Maya! Yes, I'd appreciate some information about how to apply. My partner and I will discuss who should make the claim. It's helpful to know we can apply right away even though the adoption isn't finalized yet.

2026-01-26T16:22:05.719308 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that prospective adoptive parents are eligible for Child Benefit when the child is placed with them, even before the adoption is legally finalized.
