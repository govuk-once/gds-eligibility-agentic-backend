2026-01-26T16:30:48.602940 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T16:30:50.634371 [actor]: I'm Lisa, and I have a 15-year-old son named Mark. He's not currently living with me as he's been sentenced to a youth custody center. He's been there for about 10 weeks now, serving a 6-month sentence. I was claiming Child Benefit for him before this happened, and I'm wondering if I'm still eligible to receive it while he's in custody.

2026-01-26T16:30:54.593781 [root_agent]: I understand your situation, Lisa. Thank you for providing that context about Mark.

Based on the UK government rules for Child Benefit, when a child is in custody following a court sentence, Child Benefit usually stops. Since Mark has been sentenced to a youth custody center for 6 months, you would typically not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for him during this period.

However, you may still be eligible to receive Child Benefit for up to 8 weeks after he went into custody. Since you mentioned he's been there for about 10 weeks now, this initial period has already passed.

Once Mark is released and comes back to live with you, you can claim Child Benefit for him again, assuming he meets the other eligibility criteria (such as being under 16, or under 20 if in approved education or training).

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility in your situation?

2026-01-26T16:30:57.090352 [actor]: I see. So because Mark has been in custody for 10 weeks already, which is beyond the 8-week period, I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit for him. That's disappointing but I understand. Will I need to reapply for Child Benefit when he comes home after his sentence is finished? Or will my previous claim automatically restart?

2026-01-26T16:31:00.843593 [root_agent]: I understand your concern about what happens after Mark completes his sentence. 

When Mark returns home after his custody period ends, your Child Benefit won't automatically restart. You'll need to make a new claim to start receiving payments again. You should do this as soon as possible after he returns home to avoid missing out on any payments.

You can make a new claim by either:
- Calling the Child Benefit Office
- Filling out a new Child Benefit claim form (CH2)

When you make your new claim, you'll need to explain that Mark has returned to live with you after being in custody. If Mark will still be under 16 when he returns (or under 20 if he'll be in approved education or training), and he'll be living with you, you should be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him again.

Is there anything else about the process of reclaiming Child Benefit that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-26T16:31:03.498775 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that. I'll make sure to submit a new claim when Mark comes home after completing his sentence. I think I'll call the Child Benefit Office when the time comes. He'll still be 15 when he returns home, so it sounds like we should be eligible again at that point. This has been very helpful information. I appreciate your time.

2026-01-26T16:31:06.645655 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent incorrectly stated that Child Benefit stops when a child is in custody and that only 8 weeks of payments would continue. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit can actually continue for up to 24 weeks when a child is in custody if they haven't been convicted of an offense.
