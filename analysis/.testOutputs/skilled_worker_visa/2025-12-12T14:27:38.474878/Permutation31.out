[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Elena, an American tourist visiting London who wants to switch to a Skilled Worker visa after receiving a job offer.

Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Elena, it’s nice to meet you. I understand you’re interested in the Skilled Worker visa. To start, could you tell me, what type of visa are you currently in the UK on?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, yes I'm currently visiting London on a Standard Visitor visa. I came to visit some friends a couple of weeks ago, but while I've been here, I've had a job interview and received an amazing offer as a Graphic Designer with a company here. They're really keen for me to start soon, so I was hoping I could just apply for the Skilled Worker visa while I'm still here rather than having to fly back to the US.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Elena. That’s helpful.

Just to be clear, you mentioned you came to London on a Standard Visitor visa. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm here on a Standard Visitor visa. I initially came just for a three-week vacation to see my friends, but then this job opportunity came up unexpectedly.

[root_agent]: Okay, Elena. Thank you for confirming.

Could you tell me, do you currently reside in the United States?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm normally based in the United States. I live in Boston. I'm just staying in an Airbnb here in London for my vacation, but it's really convenient that I found this job opportunity while I'm here.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Elena. That’s very important information.

Let me ask this: Are you currently in the UK, or have you left the country since receiving this job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm still in the UK right now. I haven't left since I arrived for my vacation. I still have about a week left on my planned stay, and the company wants me to start as soon as possible, so I was hoping I could just apply for the Skilled Worker visa while I'm here rather than having to go back to the US first.

[root_agent]: Okay, Elena. Thank you for letting me know.

Based on what you’ve told me, it appears you are currently in the UK on a Standard Visitor visa. 

To help me assess your situation fully, could you tell me, what type of work are you being offered as a Graphic Designer?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a full-time position as a Graphic Designer at a design agency here in London. It's a permanent role with a competitive salary - they've offered me £34,000 per year. They were impressed with my portfolio and experience, and they're eager to have me join their team to work on various client projects. The role involves creating visual concepts for their clients' marketing campaigns, websites, and brand identities.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details, Elena.

Just to confirm, you are currently in the UK on a Standard Visitor visa, and you’ve been offered a full-time, permanent position as a Graphic Designer with a salary of £34,000 per year. 

Given this situation, it appears you might be attempting to switch to the Skilled Worker route while in the UK.

Based on the Immigration Rules, generally, you cannot switch from a Visitor visa while in the UK. Would you like me to explain why this is the case and what your options might be?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I'd really appreciate if you could explain why I can't switch from my Visitor visa while I'm here and what my options are. The company is really excited about having me start soon, so I want to understand what I need to do next.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Elena. Let me explain.

The Immigration Rules generally prohibit switching to a Skilled Worker visa while you are on a Standard Visitor visa and *still within the UK*. The rule is designed to prevent individuals from using the UK as a base to secure employment without the correct visa status.

Because you're currently in the UK on a Standard Visitor visa, you’ll typically need to leave the country to apply for a new visa, such as the Skilled Worker visa. This process is often referred to as "Entry Clearance."

Your options are:

1.  **Leave the UK:** You would need to depart the United Kingdom and then apply for the Skilled Worker visa from outside the UK.
2.  **Consider an Extension of Your Visitor Visa (Limited):** In very specific circumstances and subject to Home Office approval, you *might* be able to apply for an extension of your Visitor visa, but this is not guaranteed and is unlikely to be granted if you intend to work.

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the relevant section of the Skilled Worker visa requirements on the government website, so you can review the details further? [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing to hear. I was hoping to avoid having to fly back to the US before starting the job. So if I understand correctly, I need to go back to Boston and apply for the Skilled Worker visa from there? 

How long would that process typically take? I'm worried the company might not want to wait if it takes too long. Would you mind sharing that link to the government website so I can look at the specific requirements? Thank you for explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You are correct, Elena. Based on the current Immigration Rules, returning to the US to apply for the Skilled Worker visa is the most likely course of action.

Regarding the processing time, it can vary. Currently, the UKVI (UK Visas and Immigration) estimates that Skilled Worker visa applications take approximately **2-3 months** to process, but this can fluctuate due to demand. However, it’s always a good idea to apply as early as possible.

Here’s the link to the official government website with detailed information about the Skilled Worker visa: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)

It outlines the specific requirements, including the salary threshold, sponsorship requirements, and the application process.

Do you want me to help you understand any specific section of the requirements on that website, such as the sponsorship documentation needed by the company?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining and providing that link. A 2-3 month timeline is longer than I was hoping for, but at least I know what to expect now. 

Yes, I would appreciate if you could help me understand what the company needs to do for sponsorship. Do they need to provide me with any specific documentation before I leave the UK? I want to make sure I have everything I need before I fly back to Boston so I can start the application process as soon as possible.

[root_agent]: Okay, Elena, let’s delve into the sponsorship requirements.

The employer needs to become a licensed sponsor to employ you on a Skilled Worker visa. This involves a process with the Home Office where they demonstrate they meet certain criteria, including having a genuine need to fill a skilled role and demonstrating they’ve offered you a job that meets the salary requirements.

Before you leave the UK, the company will need to:

1.  **Nominate you for the Skilled Worker visa:** Once they’ve been approved as a sponsor, they’ll need to formally nominate you for the visa through the online Home Office system.
2.  **Provide a ‘Certificate of Sponsorship’ (CoS):** This is a unique reference number and alphanumeric code that proves they are sponsoring you. They’ll assign this to you before you depart the UK. They’ll also need to provide you with a document confirming the job details, salary, and start date.
3.  **Complete a ‘Standard Sponsorship SLA’ (Service Level Agreement):** This outlines the terms of the sponsorship agreement between the employer and the Home Office.

You’ll need to provide the company with copies of your passport, proof of qualifications, and any other documentation they require to complete the sponsorship process.

Do you want me to elaborate on any of these steps, such as how the Certificate of Sponsorship is generated, or what documents the company typically requests?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for breaking that down for me. It's clearer now what needs to happen. Could you please explain a bit more about the Certificate of Sponsorship? Is that something digital they'll email me, or is it a physical document I need to collect from them before I leave? 

Also, do I need to do anything specific on my end in terms of paperwork or preparation before I leave the UK, other than making sure the company has copies of my passport and qualifications?

[root_agent]: That’s a great question, Elena. Let’s clarify the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS).

The Certificate of Sponsorship is a digital document. The employer will generate and send the CoS to you electronically – typically via email. It’s not a physical document you’ll need to collect.

Regarding your preparation before leaving, in addition to providing copies of your passport and qualifications to the company, here’s what you should do:

1.  **Confirm the CoS Allocation:** Ensure the company has successfully allocated the CoS to you before you depart. They will provide you with confirmation of this allocation.
2.  **Receive the CoS Document:** Make absolutely sure you receive the CoS document electronically – it needs to be accessible when you begin your Skilled Worker visa application outside the UK. Keep a secure copy electronically.
3.  **Employment References (Potentially):** The company might request references from previous employers. It’s a good idea to have these readily available to provide.
4.  **Bank Details:** The company will likely need your bank details to make any salary payments before you officially start working.

To reiterate, the core paperwork you need is the CoS document, proof of your qualifications, and your passport.

Would you like me to provide a link to the UKVI’s guidance on the Certificate of Sponsorship, specifically addressing how it's generated and used? [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/certificate-of-sponsorship-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/certificate-of-sponsorship-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it)

Do you have any other questions about the sponsorship process or the upcoming steps?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, that's really helpful. I appreciate the clarification that the CoS is digital - that will make things easier. I'll make sure I have it before I leave the UK.

I think I understand the sponsorship process now. Just to confirm what happens next: I'll go back to Boston, then once I have the CoS from the company, I'll start my Skilled Worker visa application. After that, I'll need to wait 2-3 months for processing before I can return to the UK to start my job. Is that correct?

Also, thank you for offering that link about the Certificate of Sponsorship - that would be useful to have for reference.

[root_agent]: You’ve got it exactly right, Elena! That’s a perfect summary of the next steps.

To reiterate: You’ll return to Boston, obtain the Certificate of Sponsorship from the company, then begin your Skilled Worker visa application outside the UK. After that, you’ll need to patiently await the processing time of approximately 2-3 months before being able to return to the UK and begin your employment.

I'm glad I could clarify things for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, perhaps regarding the visa application process itself, or anything else related to your move to the UK and job opportunity?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming. No, I think you've answered all my questions for now. I'll let the company know that I need to return to Boston and will need the Certificate of Sponsorship from them to start my application there. I appreciate your help in explaining the process so clearly - it's disappointing I can't just switch my visa while I'm here, but at least now I understand what needs to be done. Thanks again for your time.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Elena! I’m truly glad I could help clarify the situation and provide you with a clearer understanding of the process. It's understandable to be disappointed about the visa restrictions, but it’s excellent that you have a plan in place now.

Wishing you all the best with your job application and move back to Boston. If you ever have any further questions in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that I cannot switch from a Standard Visitor visa to a Skilled Worker visa while in the UK. The agent accurately explained I need to return to the USA to apply for "Entry Clearance" from outside the UK, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
