[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Fatima, a new recruit from overseas seeking information about her eligibility for a UK work visa.

Hi, i'm Fatima and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Fatima, it’s lovely to meet you! I’m here to help you understand your eligibility for a UK work visa. To start, could you tell me a little bit about where you’re coming from and what type of job you’re hoping to do in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello! Thank you for your help. I'm coming from Malaysia and I've been offered a job at Logistics Co. in the UK as a supply chain analyst. They said they would sponsor my visa, but I haven't received much information about the process. I'm just trying to understand if I'll be able to get a visa with their sponsorship.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. So you’re coming from Malaysia and you’ve been offered a role as a Supply Chain Analyst at Logistics Co. in the UK. And Logistics Co. has offered to sponsor your visa.

Just to clarify, could you tell me whether Logistics Co. is a registered sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they told me they are a registered sponsor. The HR manager mentioned that they regularly sponsor workers, but I heard from another potential colleague that the company recently had some issues with an audit. I'm not sure what that means for me. They said they're working on assigning me a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS), but I wanted to check if there would be any problems with my visa application.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It’s good to hear they’re regularly sponsoring workers. Regarding the audit issue you’ve heard about, could you tell me whether you know the specific nature of those audit issues that Logistics Co. experienced?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't know all the specific details, but the colleague I spoke with mentioned that the company was downgraded to a B-rating after failing an audit about six months ago. I'm not sure exactly what that means or how it affects my situation. They said the company is working on addressing the issues, but I'm concerned about whether this will affect my ability to get a visa as a new hire. The HR manager didn't mention this when offering me the job.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for sharing that information. It’s understandable that you’re feeling concerned. A B-rating does impact a sponsor’s ability to hire new workers. 

Just to be clear, Logistics Co. currently holds a B-rating due to a previous audit failure, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's my understanding. They currently hold a B-rating because of the failed audit. Does this mean there will be a problem with my visa? I'm worried because I've already given notice at my current job in Malaysia and made arrangements to move to the UK.

[root_agent]: I understand your worry, Fatima. A B-rated sponsor cannot hire new workers – only extend visas for those already sponsored. 

Given that Logistics Co. is currently B-rated, it would be very difficult to secure a visa as a new hire. 

To help me assess your situation fully, could you tell me, does Logistics Co. currently have any workers already sponsored by them?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure if they have current workers on sponsored visas, but I know I would be a new hire - this would be my first time working for them. Does this mean I won't be able to get a visa through them? This is very worrying as they've already offered me the job and said they would sponsor me. What options do I have in this situation?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to be concerned. Because Logistics Co. is currently B-rated, they are unable to sponsor new workers. Therefore, it’s unlikely you’d be able to secure a visa through them as a new hire. 

Let’s explore some options. Since Logistics Co. holds a B-rating, they can only issue Certificates of Sponsorship to existing sponsored workers. 

Would you like me to explain what other sponsorship options might be available to you, or would you prefer to discuss alternative visa routes?

[evaluation_judge]: I would appreciate if you could explain my options. So to be clear, even though they offered me the job with sponsorship, they won't be able to sponsor me because of their B-rating? Is there any way to still work for them, or should I look for other companies? What other visa routes might be available to me?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit the nail on the head – Logistics Co. won’t be able to sponsor you as a new hire due to their B-rating. Let’s explore your options. 

Currently, the most common route for skilled workers is the Skilled Worker Visa. However, because Logistics Co. has a B-rating, they can only extend visas for existing sponsored workers. 

Here are a few potential avenues you could consider:

1.  **Wait for Logistics Co. to improve their sponsorship rating:** They can work to rectify the issues that led to the B-rating. This could take time. 

2.  **Explore other sponsors:** There are many other companies in the UK that *do* hold a standard sponsorship license (A-rating) and could sponsor you for the Skilled Worker Visa.

3. **Consider a different visa route:** While the Skilled Worker Visa is the most common, there are other options like the Health and Care Worker visa, or potentially a Global Business Mobility visa depending on Logistics Co.’s international operations. 

To help me narrow down the best options for you, could you tell me a little more about your qualifications and the specific requirements of the Supply Chain Analyst role at Logistics Co.?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining. I have a bachelor's degree in Supply Chain Management and 5 years of experience in the field. The role at Logistics Co. would involve analyzing supply chain data, optimizing logistics operations, and coordinating with international suppliers. The salary they offered is £38,000 per year.

I'm disappointed to hear they can't sponsor me despite their offer. I think I'll need to look for other companies that have proper sponsorship capabilities. How can I verify if other potential employers have the correct A-rating before accepting job offers? This situation has taught me I need to be more careful.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent information, Fatima – your qualifications and experience certainly make you a strong candidate for many roles. And it's completely understandable to be disappointed, especially after you’ve already made commitments.

You’re right to be cautious, and verifying a company’s sponsorship status is crucial. Here’s how you can check for an A-rating:

*   **GOV.UK Website:** The most reliable source is the official GOV.UK website. You can search for “licensed sponsors” here: [https://www.gov.uk/check-sponsored-worker](https://www.gov.uk/check-sponsored-worker). You can search by company name.

*   **SMS (Sponsorship Management System) Check:** If a company is willing to provide you with a CoS through the SMS, you can often find information about their sponsor license on the system itself.

*   **Ask Directly:** When a company offers you a job, don't hesitate to ask them directly for proof of their sponsorship license. They should be happy to provide this.

Would you like me to clarify any of these steps or perhaps explore some specific companies in the logistics industry known for their robust sponsorship programs?

[evaluation_judge]: I appreciate your advice. I think I'll use the GOV.UK website to check potential employers in the future. Are there any red flags I should be aware of when companies discuss sponsorship during interviews? 

Also, just to confirm my understanding: even if Logistics Co. tries to assign me a CoS, the system should block it, and even if they somehow managed to get one issued, my visa application would be refused because they're B-rated. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: That’s a very astute question, Fatima. Let’s address both those points.

**Red Flags During Sponsorship Discussions:**

*   **Vague Language:** Be wary of companies that use vague terms like "we can explore sponsorship" without clearly stating they hold an A-rating.
*   **Hesitation:** If they're hesitant to provide proof of their sponsorship status, that’s a red flag.
*   **Reliance on “Guarantees”:** Avoid companies that promise sponsorship without concrete evidence. Genuine sponsorship is verified through the official system.
*   **Pressure to Accept Quickly:** A company pushing you to accept a job offer immediately before verifying their sponsorship is a potential sign of trouble.

**Confirming Your Understanding:**

You are absolutely correct! Even if Logistics Co. were to somehow manage to issue a Certificate of Sponsorship, your visa application would still be refused because they hold a B-rating. The UKVI (UK Visas and Immigration) system automatically flags applications linked to B-rated sponsors. It’s designed to prevent visa applications from proceeding when the sponsoring company is not compliant.

Essentially, the system prioritizes compliance, and a B-rating effectively freezes a company’s ability to sponsor new workers.

Do you want me to help you research some companies in the logistics sector that *do* hold an A-rating, and are known for their reliable sponsorship practices?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information. A B-rated sponsor cannot sponsor new workers, but the agent incorrectly stated the Supply Chain Analyst role might be eligible for other visa routes like Health and Care Worker visa or Global Business Mobility visa without verifying if these would actually apply to Fatima's situation. These suggestions could give false hope when the fundamental issue is the B-rating preventing sponsorship of any new hire regardless of visa type.
