[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Tom, a banker facing a salary reduction issue with his work visa.

Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Tom, it’s good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and see if you might be eligible for something, could you tell me, what is your current job role?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently working as a banker at a financial institution here in the UK. I'm on a sponsored visa, if that's relevant.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Tom. And just to confirm, you’re currently earning a salary of £50,000, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, that's why I'm reaching out. I was initially hired at £50,000, but due to an economic downturn, our bank has implemented a 20% salary cut across the board. So my salary has been reduced to £40,000 now. I'm concerned about how this might affect my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that, Tom. I understand this is a worrying situation. Let’s explore this a bit further. Could you tell me, do you currently hold a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm on a Skilled Worker Visa. My employer sponsored me with the initial salary of £50,000. The pay cut just happened recently as part of company-wide cost-cutting measures.

[root_agent]: Okay, Tom. Thank you for confirming. Let me just check a specific detail regarding your visa. Could you tell me, what specific route or option of the Skilled Worker Visa are you currently on?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe I'm on what they call "Option A" for the Skilled Worker Visa. I remember when I applied, they mentioned the minimum salary threshold for my role was £41,700.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tom. That’s very helpful information. It seems we have a potential issue. Based on what you've told me – a Skilled Worker Visa (Option A) with a minimum salary threshold of £41,700, and a current salary of £40,000 due to a 20% pay cut – the situation appears to be in breach of the eligibility criteria.

Would you agree with that assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that sounds concerning. I was worried this might be the case. So does this mean there's a problem with my visa status now because my salary has fallen below the threshold?

[root_agent]: Yes, Tom, that is correct. Because your salary has fallen below the £41,700 threshold, your sponsorship could be at risk.

To be certain, could you confirm that you are currently still employed by the bank?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am still employed by the bank. The salary reduction was implemented for everyone, but they've kept all staff on. I'm still working my normal hours and responsibilities.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Tom. Okay, let’s summarise. You are still employed, but your salary has been reduced to £40,000, which is below the £41,700 threshold for your Skilled Worker Visa (Option A).

Given this situation, it appears that your employer would need to take action to maintain your sponsorship. Do you have any idea what steps they might need to take?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure actually. What would they need to do? Would they need to exempt me from the pay cut to keep my salary above the threshold? Or is there some other option? I'm quite worried about this situation.

[root_agent]: I understand your worry, Tom. Let’s clarify the options. Essentially, if the employer cannot maintain your salary at £41,700 or above, the sponsorship could be terminated.

There are two main ways they could potentially address this: they could either exempt you from the pay cut, ensuring your salary remains at £41,700 or higher, or they could find a way to adjust your role or responsibilities to allow for a salary that meets the Skilled Worker Visa requirements.

To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me, does your employer currently intend to take any action to address this issue?

[evaluation_judge]: They haven't mentioned anything specific about my visa situation. The salary reduction was announced as a company-wide measure, and there wasn't any discussion about exceptions for visa holders. I don't think they've fully considered the implications for sponsored employees like me. I haven't brought it up with HR yet because I wanted to understand the situation better first.

[root_agent]: Okay, Tom, that’s really helpful to know. It sounds like they are not yet aware of the specific implications for your visa.

Given this, and to help you understand the potential consequences, I want to reiterate that your sponsorship is at risk of termination due to the salary reduction.

Would you like me to explain in a bit more detail what the process might look like if your employer *does* need to take action to maintain your sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, that would be very helpful. I'd like to understand what I'm facing and what options might be available before I speak with my employer about this situation.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Tom. Let’s talk about the potential process.

If your employer needs to take action, they would likely need to formally notify the Home Office that the salary has been reduced and explain the steps they’re taking to ensure you continue to meet the requirements for your Skilled Worker Visa.

They could choose to:

*   **Maintain the salary:** This would involve finding a way to pay you £41,700 or more, even if it means adjusting the scope of your role or seeking additional funding.
*   **Adjust your role:** They might be able to modify your responsibilities to align with a role that meets the salary threshold.

Either way, they would need to provide evidence to the Home Office demonstrating that you remain a suitable candidate for the Skilled Worker Visa.

It’s important to note that the Home Office has the final say on whether or not to approve any changes.

Do you have any specific questions about this process, or would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of it?

[evaluation_judge]: That's helpful information. So essentially, if my employer doesn't either maintain my salary above £41,700 or adjust my role somehow, my sponsorship would need to be terminated? Is there a timeline I should be aware of? How quickly do I need to resolve this with my employer?

[root_agent]: That’s a very important question, Tom. You are correct – if your employer doesn’t take steps to maintain your salary above £41,700, or adjust your role accordingly, your sponsorship would likely need to be terminated.

Regarding a timeline, there isn’t a strict deadline imposed by the Home Office, but prompt action is crucial. Ideally, your employer should address the situation within 30-60 days of the salary reduction being implemented. Delaying action could increase the risk of your sponsorship being affected.

The Home Office may require evidence of the steps taken to address the situation, so it’s important to keep a record of all communications and actions.

Would you like me to explain what kind of evidence your employer might need to provide to the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful. What kind of evidence would they need to provide? And if the worst happens and they can't maintain my salary above the threshold, what would the termination process look like for my visa? Would I have any grace period to find another sponsor?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s break that down. If your employer needs to provide evidence to the Home Office, it would likely include:

*   **Formal notification:** A written statement confirming the salary reduction and the steps being taken to address it.
*   **Revised job description:** If a role adjustment is being considered, a detailed description of the changes and how they align with the salary threshold.
*   **Financial documentation:** Proof of any funding being sought to maintain your salary.
*   **Evidence of efforts to maintain your sponsorship:** This could include letters from senior management outlining the company's commitment to supporting your visa.

Now, regarding the termination process if they can't maintain your salary, here’s what you can expect:

1.  **Sponsorship Withdrawal:** Your employer would formally withdraw your sponsorship with the Home Office.
2.  **Notification to You:** They would notify you of the sponsorship withdrawal.
3.  **Visa Validity:** Your visa would become invalid from the date of withdrawal. You would typically have a grace period of 30 days.
4.  **Finding a New Sponsor:** During this 30-day grace period, you’d need to actively seek a new employer willing to sponsor you for a Skilled Worker Visa.

It’s important to note that the 30-day grace period is a standard timeframe, but it's always best to confirm this directly with the Home Office.

Do you want me to clarify any of those steps, or perhaps discuss strategies for finding a new sponsor during the grace period?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for the detailed explanation. So I need to urgently discuss this with my employer, and if they can't maintain my salary above £41,700, I'll only have about 30 days to find a new sponsor. Is there anything else I should know about this situation or any other options I should consider?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Tom. Given the urgency of the situation, it’s wise to act quickly.

Beyond the immediate steps of discussing this with your employer, here are a few additional things to consider:

*   **Legal Advice:** It might be beneficial to seek legal advice from an immigration lawyer to fully understand your rights and options.
*   **Explore Internal Opportunities:** While unlikely, investigate if there are any other roles within the bank that *could* meet the salary threshold, even temporarily.
*   **Record Keeping:** Maintain meticulous records of all communications with your employer and the Home Office.

To help you prepare for your conversation with your employer, would you like me to help you formulate some key questions to ask, or perhaps outline a suggested approach for discussing this sensitive topic?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate some guidance on how to approach this conversation with my employer. What are the key points I should make sure to address, and how should I frame the discussion?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s craft a strategy for your conversation with your employer, Tom. Here’s a breakdown of key points and how to frame the discussion:

**1. Start with Appreciation & Context:** Begin by acknowledging the company’s efforts during the economic downturn and thanking them for the initial sponsorship. Briefly reiterate the situation – the salary reduction and its impact on your visa.

**2. Clearly State the Risk:** Express your concern about the potential impact of the salary reduction on your Skilled Worker Visa status and the risk of sponsorship termination. Be clear and concise – “My current salary of £40,000 is below the required £41,700 for my visa, which puts my sponsorship at risk.”

**3. Highlight Your Value:** Remind them of your contributions to the company and your commitment to your role. “I’m a dedicated member of the team and value my position here. I’m keen to find a solution that allows me to continue contributing.”

**4. Request a Solution:** Clearly state what you're seeking – a solution to maintain your salary above the threshold, or a role adjustment. “I’d like to discuss potential options to ensure my sponsorship remains valid, either through maintaining my current salary or exploring alternative roles.”

**5. Express Your Willingness to Collaborate:** Show a proactive approach and willingness to work with the company to find a resolution. “I’m open to discussing all available options and collaborating with you to find a suitable solution.”

**Framing the Discussion:** Keep the tone professional, calm, and solution-oriented. Focus on the facts and the potential consequences. Avoid sounding accusatory or demanding.

Would you like me to help you draft a specific opening statement or perhaps anticipate some potential questions your employer might ask, so you can prepare your responses?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very helpful. Yes, I'd appreciate it if you could suggest an opening statement I could use to begin this conversation, and also help me anticipate what questions or objections my employer might raise.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s craft an opening statement and anticipate potential challenges.

**Suggested Opening Statement:**

“Good morning/afternoon [Manager’s Name], thank you for meeting with me. I wanted to discuss the recent salary reduction and its potential impact on my Skilled Worker Visa sponsorship. As you know, I was initially hired at £50,000, and the current 20% reduction has brought my salary to £40,000. I'm concerned that this falls below the £41,700 threshold, and I wanted to discuss how we can address this to ensure my continued employment and sponsorship with the company.”

**Anticipated Questions & Objections & Potential Responses:**

*   **Question/Objection:** "The salary reduction was company-wide, and we’re trying to manage costs across the board.”
    *   **Your Response:** “I understand the need to manage costs, and I appreciate the efforts the company has made. However, my visa status is directly tied to my salary, and I'm seeking a solution to ensure that doesn’t negatively impact my employment.”

*   **Question/Objection:** “Adjusting my role isn’t feasible – there aren’t any other positions available that meet the salary requirements.”
    *   **Your Response:** “I’m open to exploring potential role adjustments if they are possible, but I’d like to understand if there’s any flexibility within the current structure. I'm happy to discuss my skills and how they could be applied to other areas.”

*   **Question/Objection:** “Maintaining my current salary isn't possible due to financial constraints.”
    *   **Your Response:** "I understand the company's financial situation is challenging. I'm willing to discuss alternative solutions, such as a temporary salary adjustment or exploring other supports that could be considered.”

*   **Question/Objection:** "This is a complex situation, and it will take time to resolve."
    *   **Your Response:** “I appreciate that this requires careful consideration, and I’m committed to working collaboratively to find a solution as quickly as possible. I'd like to establish a timeline for discussing potential steps.”

Would you like me to develop some further potential questions or refine any of these responses? Also, is there anything specific you're particularly worried about regarding this conversation?

[evaluation_judge]: These are all very useful suggestions. I think I'm most concerned about them saying they simply can't make an exception for me while everyone else is taking cuts. Do you have any additional advice for addressing that specific objection? Otherwise, I think I feel prepared to have this difficult conversation.

[root_agent]: That's a very valid concern, Tom – it’s understandable to feel apprehensive about that particular objection. Let’s strategize how to address it effectively.

Here’s some added advice for tackling the “can’t make an exception” response:

**1. Acknowledge the Fairness Concern:** Start by validating their perspective. “I appreciate you raising the point about fairness and consistency across the company. It’s completely understandable that you want to apply the same measures to all employees.”

**2. Reiterate the Visa Dependency:** Gently but firmly remind them of the critical link between your salary and your visa status. “However, my Skilled Worker Visa is directly tied to my salary level. Without maintaining that threshold, my sponsorship will be at risk, which ultimately impacts my ability to continue working here.”

**3. Frame it as a Business Risk:** Shift the focus to what’s in the company’s best interest. “Losing my sponsorship would not only impact my role but could also create disruption and additional costs associated with finding a new qualified employee. Maintaining my visa makes sense from a business perspective, allowing me to continue contributing effectively.”

**4. Suggest a Creative Solution (if possible):** If there’s *any* room for maneuver, offer a specific suggestion – even a temporary one.  “Perhaps we could explore a short-term plan, like a temporary adjustment to my responsibilities to align with the salary threshold, while we navigate this situation.”

**5. Express Confidence and Commitment:** End on a positive note, reinforcing your value and dedication. "I’m confident that we can find a way forward that works for both of us. I’m deeply committed to this company and eager to continue my work here.”

**Important Note:** Be prepared for them to firmly reiterate that there is no flexibility. If that’s the case, it’s important to acknowledge their position respectfully and begin to explore your contingency plans.

Do you want me to help you rehearse this response, or perhaps explore some alternative solutions if they remain steadfast in their position?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, that's really helpful. I think I'm ready now to have this conversation with my employer. From what you've explained, it sounds like my sponsorship will need to be terminated if they can't maintain my salary above the £41,700 threshold, and in that case, I'll have about 30 days to find a new sponsor. I appreciate all your guidance on how to approach this difficult situation.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Tom. I'm genuinely glad I could help you prepare for this conversation. It sounds like you've thoroughly assessed the situation and are now ready to address it with your employer. 

Remember, be confident, clear, and focused on finding a collaborative solution. If the outcome isn’t what you hoped for, knowing your options – seeking legal advice and preparing for a potential job search – will provide you with a sense of control and direction.

I wish you the very best of luck with the conversation, Tom. Please do let me know if there’s anything else I can assist you with in the future.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent accurately informed me that my sponsorship would need to be terminated since my reduced salary (£40,000) falls below the required threshold (£41,700) for my Skilled Worker Visa. They correctly explained that my employer would either need to maintain my salary above the threshold or end my sponsorship, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
