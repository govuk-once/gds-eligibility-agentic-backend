[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you evaluate another agent's performance in this scenario. I'll play the role of Dr. Aari, a biological researcher from India with a PhD in Microbiology, seeking information about UK visa eligibility.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s start. To help me understand your situation better, could you please tell me what your current job role is?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Aari and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, Aari. Thank you for letting me know. To start, could you tell me what kind of work you are currently doing?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently a biological researcher specializing in microbiology. I have a PhD in Microbiology from India. I've received a job offer as a Senior Lab Technician at a pharmaceutical company in the UK with a salary of £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Aari. That’s very helpful. Now, could you please confirm if you have a sponsor lined up who can support your move to the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a valid sponsor. The pharmaceutical company offering me the position is an approved sponsor in the UK.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And could you tell me what level of education you completed? Specifically, could you confirm that you hold a PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a PhD in Microbiology from a university in India. I completed it two years ago and have been working in research since then.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s great to know. Now, let’s talk about the role itself. Could you describe the main responsibilities of the Senior Lab Technician position you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: In this Senior Lab Technician role, I'll be responsible for overseeing laboratory testing procedures, conducting specialized microbiology research, analyzing samples, managing junior technicians, maintaining lab equipment and protocols, documenting research findings, and collaborating with the pharmaceutical research team on developing new medications. The position requires my specialized knowledge in microbiology, particularly regarding bacterial cultures and analysis techniques.

[root_agent]: Thank you for detailing those responsibilities, Aari. To clarify, could you tell me what the standard going rate is for a Senior Lab Technician role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Based on the information I was provided, the standard going rate for this Senior Lab Technician role is £38,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And to confirm, your salary offer is £34,000 per year, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My salary offer is £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Aari. Just one more question regarding the salary – does your £34,000 salary represent at least 80% of the standard going rate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £34,000 is more than 80% of the standard going rate. Since the standard going rate is £38,000, 80% of that would be £30,400, and my offered salary exceeds that amount.

[root_agent]: Okay, Aari. Thank you for confirming that. One final question – does your salary meet the minimum requirement of £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £34,000 does meet the minimum requirement of £33,400.

[root_agent]: Okay, Aari. Based on the information you’ve provided – a valid sponsor, a PhD in a STEM field (Microbiology), a salary of £34,000 (meeting both the lower threshold and 80% of the going rate) – it appears you are eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa.

**AWARDED.**

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. They verified all necessary criteria - that I have a valid sponsor, a relevant STEM PhD, and that my £34,000 salary meets both the general threshold of £33,400 and exceeds 80% of the standard going rate (£30,400).
