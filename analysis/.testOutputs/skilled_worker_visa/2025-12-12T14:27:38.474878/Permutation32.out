[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ali and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Ali, it’s nice to meet you. To help me determine your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you tell me how long you’ve been studying for your PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been studying for my PhD in Engineering for almost 3 years now. I'm currently in my 3rd year of a 4-year program.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And just to confirm, you haven’t yet graduated from your PhD program?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right, I haven't graduated yet. I still have about a year to go before I complete my PhD.

[root_agent]: Alright. And looking at your PhD, approximately how many months have you spent actively working on it – meaning engaged in research and coursework – now?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been actively working on my PhD for about 32 months now - consistently engaged in research and coursework since I started.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ali. That’s very helpful. Just to be absolutely clear, you’re currently in your third year of a four-year PhD program, and you’ve been actively working on it for around 32 months, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I'm in my third year of a four-year PhD program in Engineering, and I've been actively working on it for about 32 months.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Based on that information, it sounds like you’ve met the criteria. Could you tell me, have you completed 24 months of your PhD studies?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have definitely completed more than 24 months of my PhD studies. As I mentioned, I've been working on it for about 32 months now.

[root_agent]: Okay, Ali. Thank you for confirming. It looks like you are eligible for the Skilled Worker visa route under the “24-Month Rule” for PhD students. Would you like me to explain why that is?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I'd appreciate it if you could explain why I'm eligible under this rule.

[root_agent]: Certainly. As a PhD student, you can switch to a Skilled Worker visa before graduating if you've completed at least 24 months of your degree. This is a specific concession designed to allow PhD students to take advantage of job opportunities while still in their studies. Unlike Bachelor’s or Master’s students, you don’t typically need to have completed the entire course to apply.

Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So because I've completed 32 months of my PhD program, even though I haven't graduated yet, I can switch to a Skilled Worker visa. That's great news as I have a job offer as an Engineering Consultant that I'm hoping to accept. Thank you for explaining this special rule for PhD students.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Ali! I’m delighted to hear that this information is helpful and that you have a job offer. I’m glad I could clarify the “24-Month Rule” for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that covers my questions for now. I'm really relieved to know I can switch to the Skilled Worker visa without having to complete my entire PhD first. This will allow me to take the Engineering Consultant position while still finishing my studies. Thank you for your help!

[root_agent]: You’re most welcome, Ali! I’m so pleased I could help alleviate your worries. Best of luck with your job offer and your PhD – it sounds like a fantastic opportunity. If anything else comes up in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker visa under the "24-Month Rule" for PhD students, accurately explaining that PhD students can switch to this visa before graduating if they've completed at least 24 months of their program, which matches the expected outcome.
