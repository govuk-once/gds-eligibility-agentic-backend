[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Batbayar and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Batbayar. It’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your previous work experience?

[evaluation_judge]: I recently graduated with a degree in Mongolian history, specializing in 13th-century steppe warfare. I've been offered a job as an Office Manager at a UK logistics firm. They specifically mentioned they need someone who speaks fluent Mongolian, which is my native language, and has expertise in my field of study. I'm wondering if I would be eligible for a work visa with this job offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Batbayar. I appreciate you clarifying the specifics of the job offer. Just to be clear, this logistics firm doesn’t currently have any business dealings or clients in Mongolia, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. As far as I know, this logistics firm doesn't have any clients or business dealings in Mongolia. They're a UK-based company that works mostly with European clients. I found it interesting that they specifically required someone with fluent Mongolian and knowledge about 13th-century steppe warfare for an Office Manager position.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Let’s delve a little deeper into the job itself. Could you describe your day-to-day responsibilities as an Office Manager in this role, as outlined by the firm?

[evaluation_judge]: Based on what the company told me, the role would involve typical office manager duties - coordinating office activities, managing supplies, scheduling meetings, handling some administrative tasks, supporting the team with general operations, and so on. They didn't specifically explain how my Mongolian language skills or knowledge of steppe warfare would be used in daily operations, which I found a bit strange. The job description just listed these as "mandatory requirements" but didn't elaborate on why they needed those specific qualifications for office management.

[root_agent]: I understand. Thank you for detailing those responsibilities. Just to be absolutely sure I have a complete picture, could you tell me what type of training or experience you have in office management before this position was offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't actually have specific office management experience. My degree was purely in Mongolian history, and my work experience has been limited to part-time jobs during my studies - mostly in retail and as a research assistant for my department. I was surprised when they offered me the role, to be honest. They seemed very interested in my language skills and historical expertise, but didn't ask many questions about office management experience during the interview.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being upfront about that, Batbayar. Given that the role requires specific skills and knowledge – particularly fluent Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare – and you don’t have direct experience in office management, I need to consider whether this job offer is genuinely seeking your particular skillset, or if it’s designed primarily to facilitate a visa application.

Could you tell me, what is the salary being offered for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary they offered is £32,000 per year. It seemed like a decent starting salary for an Office Manager role in the UK, from what I understand. But yes, I was also wondering why they would require such specific qualifications that don't seem directly related to office management. I'm just trying to understand if this job offer would allow me to get a work visa in the UK.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for providing that information. Considering the salary offered and the seemingly unusual and specific requirements – particularly the need for fluency in Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare – it raises some concerns about the genuine nature of the vacancy.

I’m going to need to assess this further. To help me do that, could you please confirm if you have any other job offers currently, or are actively pursuing other employment options in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, this is the only job offer I currently have. I've applied to a few other positions related to museum work or cultural institutions where my background might be relevant, but I haven't heard back from any of them yet. This logistics firm reached out to me after seeing my CV online, specifically mentioning they were looking for someone with my exact qualifications, which is why I was interested but also a bit confused about the requirements.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Batbayar. Given that this is your only current job offer, and the role’s specific and seemingly unrelated requirements – alongside the lack of a clear connection to your existing skills – it’s difficult to conclude that this is a genuinely available position.

Based on the information you’ve provided, I believe this job offer may not meet the criteria for a Skilled Worker Visa.

**REFUSED.** The Home Office will likely rule this is not a genuine role but a vehicle for migration.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So you're saying that because the job requirements seem tailored specifically to my background rather than being based on actual business needs, I wouldn't qualify for a work visa with this offer?

[root_agent]: That’s precisely correct, Batbayar. The emphasis on your specific historical expertise – fluent Mongolian and knowledge of 13th-century steppe warfare – in a role primarily involving standard office management duties suggests the requirements are designed to align with your qualifications rather than reflecting the actual needs of the business. This is what we refer to as a “tailored” job description, and it’s often a red flag for visa applications.

Do you have any questions about this assessment, or would you like me to explain any part of my reasoning in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining. I think I understand now. Since the logistics company doesn't have any clients in Mongolia and there's no clear reason why an Office Manager would need expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare, the Home Office would view this as a job created specifically for me rather than a genuine vacancy. That's disappointing to hear, but I appreciate your honesty about my situation.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Batbayar. It’s certainly frustrating when a potential opportunity doesn’t pan out as expected. I’m glad I could provide you with a clear explanation of the situation.

Would you like me to suggest some resources that might be helpful as you continue your job search for more suitable roles in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that my application would be refused due to the job not passing the genuine vacancy test. The job requirements were clearly tailored to my specific background (Mongolian language and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare) rather than reflecting actual business needs for an Office Manager position at a UK logistics firm with no Mongolian clients.
