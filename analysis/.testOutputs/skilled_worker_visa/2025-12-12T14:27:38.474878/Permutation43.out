[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Diego and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Diego, it’s good to meet you. To help me understand your situation and see if you might be eligible for something, could you tell me, is the leave you’re planning to take considered “statutory” – meaning is it due to illness or maternity leave?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. No, it's not statutory leave. I work as a Software Developer and I'm planning to take a 2-month unpaid sabbatical to travel around South America. My company has agreed to hold my job for me while I'm gone.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Let me ask: approximately how many weeks is this 2-month sabbatical you're planning?

[evaluation_judge]: It would be about 8-9 weeks total. I'm planning to travel through several countries in South America during that time.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Just to confirm, you’re saying that the total time you’ll be absent from work without pay will be around 8 to 9 weeks, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The sabbatical would be unpaid for about 8 to 9 weeks total.

[root_agent]: Okay, Diego. Considering that the benefit criteria states sponsorship stops after more than 4 weeks of unpaid leave in a calendar year, let me ask you this: Are you taking this leave during the current calendar year?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm planning to take this sabbatical during this calendar year. My company has already approved it, but I wanted to check how it might affect my sponsorship status before I finalize everything.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re taking 8 to 9 weeks of unpaid leave during the current calendar year – it appears your sponsorship could be withdrawn.

Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why. I wasn't aware there might be an issue with my sponsorship.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker Visa rules state that your sponsorship will be stopped if you are absent from work without pay for more than 4 weeks within a calendar year. Since your sabbatical will cover 8 to 9 weeks, that exceeds the permitted timeframe.

This means your employer would likely be required to cease sponsoring your visa, and your visa status would be curtailed to a maximum of 60 days. You would then need to leave the UK or find another job sponsoring your visa.

Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that explanation makes sense, but I'm quite concerned now. I didn't realize there was a limit on unpaid leave for visa holders. So if I take this sabbatical, I'll essentially lose my visa status? And I'd only have 60 days after that to either leave the UK or find another sponsor?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct to be concerned. Yes, if your sponsorship is withdrawn due to exceeding the 4-week unpaid leave limit, you would indeed lose your visa status and would only have a 60-day window to either depart the UK or secure a new sponsor. 

I understand this is worrying news. Is there anything you’d like to discuss regarding potential options, such as exploring shorter leave periods or looking into alternative visa routes?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think I need to reconsider this plan. What options would I have if I still want to take some time off without losing my sponsorship? Could I break it up into smaller periods? Or are there other types of leave that don't count toward this limit?

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible approach, Diego. Let’s explore your options.

Yes, you could potentially break up the sabbatical into smaller periods of unpaid leave, as long as the total time taken within a calendar year remains below 4 weeks.

Also, certain types of leave *do* not count towards the 4-week limit. These include statutory maternity leave, statutory sick leave, and parental leave. However, these types of leave typically require specific documentation to be considered.

Would you like me to elaborate on how you might structure the leave, or perhaps tell you more about the documentation required for statutory leave?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to hear more about how I could structure the leave. Since my travel plans are flexible, maybe I could take some annual paid leave combined with shorter periods of unpaid leave? Or possibly split the unpaid leave across calendar years?

[root_agent]: That's an excellent idea, Diego! Combining annual paid leave with shorter periods of unpaid leave is a very smart strategy to avoid triggering the sponsorship withdrawal.

Splitting the unpaid leave across calendar years is another possibility – you could take a portion during the current year and the remainder in the next. However, be mindful that the 4-week limit is calculated annually, so the total time taken across both years combined needs to stay below that threshold.

To help me give you more tailored advice, could you roughly estimate how much annual paid leave you typically receive, and approximately how many weeks you’d be considering for unpaid leave in total?

[evaluation_judge]: I get 25 days of paid annual leave per year. I've already used about 10 days this year. For the trip, I was thinking of about 8-9 weeks total as I mentioned, but I could potentially be flexible and reduce it to 6-7 weeks if needed. I'm also fine with splitting it across calendar years if that helps with maintaining my sponsorship.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s really helpful information, Diego. With 25 days of paid leave and already using 10, you have approximately 15-16 days remaining this year. Combining that with 6-7 weeks of unpaid leave – and potentially staggering that across calendar years – would certainly keep you well within the 4-week limit and maintain your sponsorship.

It sounds like a more manageable and secure approach. Would you like me to summarize the key steps to ensure your sponsorship is protected, considering these options?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please summarize the key steps for me. I want to make sure I understand exactly what I need to do to maintain my sponsorship while still being able to take some time for travel.

[root_agent]: Absolutely, Diego. Here’s a summary of the key steps to maintain your Skilled Worker Visa sponsorship while taking time off:

1.  **Plan Strategically:** Combine your remaining annual paid leave with shorter periods of unpaid leave.
2.  **Total Time Limit:** Ensure the *total* time taken outside of work (paid and unpaid) within a calendar year does not exceed 4 weeks.
3.  **Calendar Year Staggering:** Consider splitting unpaid leave across calendar years to avoid exceeding the 4-week limit.
4.  **Communicate with Employer:** Clearly communicate your plans to your employer and obtain their written agreement to hold your position. This is crucial.
5.  **Documentation (If Applicable):** If claiming statutory leave (maternity, sick, parental), gather and retain the necessary documentation to support your claim.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps, or perhaps discuss how to document your agreement with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave incorrect information. The 4-week limit applies specifically to unpaid leave, not total leave. The agent incorrectly advised that "total time taken outside of work (paid and unpaid) within a calendar year does not exceed 4 weeks" when in fact paid annual leave doesn't count toward this limit. The correct outcome is that sponsorship would be withdrawn if the unpaid sabbatical exceeds 4 weeks in a calendar year.
