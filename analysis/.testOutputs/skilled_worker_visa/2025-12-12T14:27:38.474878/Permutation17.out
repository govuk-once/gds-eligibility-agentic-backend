[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Yuki, who's looking to understand if she can take on a second job while on her Skilled Worker visa.

Hi, i'm Yuki and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Yuki, it’s nice to meet you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for something, could you tell me a bit about the job you’re currently working as a Graphic Designer? Specifically, what is the exact occupation code for your role?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, hi there. I'm currently working full-time as a Graphic Designer with a company that sponsors my Skilled Worker visa. I believe my occupation code is 3421 - Graphic Designers. I've been working with them for about 8 months now, and everything is going well. I'm just wondering if I'm allowed to take on a second job on weekends to earn some extra money.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Yuki.

Let’s start with the basics. Is your Skilled Worker visa currently valid and in good standing?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my Skilled Worker visa is currently valid and in good standing. I've been following all the requirements since I arrived in the UK.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to hear.

Now, regarding the second job you’re considering – the bartender position – could you tell me what you believe the pay rate would be for that role?

[evaluation_judge]: The bartender position would pay about £11.50 per hour. It would only be for 10 hours per weekend, mostly Friday and Saturday evenings. I thought it might be a good way to earn some extra money and meet new people outside my regular work.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying the pay rate and hours.

Just to confirm, you’re looking to work approximately 10 hours a week as a bartender, primarily on Friday and Saturday evenings, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. It would be just 10 hours per week, working Friday and Saturday evenings at a local pub. My main job as a Graphic Designer is Monday to Friday during normal business hours, so there wouldn't be any clash in the schedule.

[root_agent]: Okay, Yuki.

Let’s talk about the bartender role itself. Do you believe this job is in the same occupation code as your current role as a Graphic Designer (which you’ve said is 3421), or is it in a different field entirely?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the bartender role would be in a completely different field. It's definitely not the same occupation code as my Graphic Designer role. It's just something I thought might be fun to do on weekends for extra income, but I wanted to check if it's allowed under my visa before I apply for it.

[root_agent]: Alright. Thank you for confirming that.

Now, could you tell me if you’ve researched whether the bartender role is currently listed on the Immigration Salary List – that’s a list of occupations facing skills shortages?

[evaluation_judge]: I honestly haven't researched if bartending is on the Immigration Salary List. I wasn't aware I needed to check that. Is that something important for my situation?

[root_agent]: Yes, Yuki, it’s definitely important. The Skilled Worker visa allows you to take on a second job, but it has specific rules. It must either be in the same occupation code as your main job, or it needs to be on the Immigration Salary List, and the hours worked must be no more than 20 per week.

Let’s move on to this point. Based on what you've told me so far—that the bartender role is in a different occupation code, and not on the Immigration Salary List—does your understanding at this point suggest that taking on this second job might be problematic under your Skilled Worker visa conditions?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. I didn't realize the restrictions were so specific. If the second job needs to be either in the same occupation code or on the Immigration Salary List, then yes, it does seem like taking the bartender job might be problematic under my visa conditions. 

I was just thinking about it as extra income on weekends, but I definitely want to follow the rules properly. Is there no way I can work in a completely different field even if it's just for a few hours on weekends?

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible approach, Yuki. You are right to want to ensure you’re complying with the visa conditions.

Currently, under the Skilled Worker visa rules, taking on a second job in a completely different field, like bartending, is generally not permitted, even for a few hours on the weekend. The key restriction is that the second job must align with your primary occupation or be on the Immigration Salary List.

Is there anything else you’d like to explore regarding your current employment situation or the possibility of finding a permitted second job?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear, but I understand. I definitely don't want to risk my visa status by taking on work that's not permitted. 

Since you mentioned it needs to align with my primary occupation, would it be allowed if I took on some freelance graphic design work on the weekends instead? That would be in the same occupation code as my main job. Would that be permitted under my visa?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Yuki, and a much better approach!

Let’s consider that. Yes, undertaking *permitted* freelance work within your primary occupation – Graphic Design – would likely be permissible under your Skilled Worker visa. The key is that it must be genuinely self-employed and not simply a second job.

To be absolutely certain, I would need to verify a few things to ensure it complies fully with the rules, but as a first step, taking on freelance graphic design work on weekends seems like a much more viable option than the bartender role.

Would you like me to outline the key requirements for permitted self-employment under the Skilled Worker visa, so you can ensure your freelance work meets those criteria?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please! I would really appreciate if you could outline the key requirements for permitted self-employment under my Skilled Worker visa. I want to make sure I understand all the rules before I start looking for any freelance graphic design opportunities.

[root_agent]: Okay, Yuki. Here are the key requirements for permitted self-employment under your Skilled Worker visa:

1.  **Genuine Self-Employment:** You must be genuinely self-employed, not simply an employee of a different company. This means you’re responsible for your own business operations, including contracts, invoices, and accounting.

2.  **Same Occupation Code:** The freelance work must be within the same occupation code as your main sponsored job (Graphic Design – 3421).

3.  **Income Limits:** Your total income from self-employment (including the freelance work) cannot exceed your salary from your main job.

4.  **Working Hours:** You can work up to 20 hours per week as a freelancer.

5.  **Compliance with National Minimum Wage:** You must pay yourself at least the National Minimum Wage for your occupation.

6.  **Reporting Requirements:** You’ll need to report your self-employment income to HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs).

It’s important to note that these rules are subject to change, so it's always best to check the latest guidance on the GOV.UK website.

Do you have any questions about any of these points, or would you like me to elaborate on a specific requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for explaining all of that so clearly. I think I understand the requirements now. Just to make sure I've got this right:

I can do freelance graphic design work as long as it's genuine self-employment, stays within my occupation code, doesn't exceed my main job income, and is no more than 20 hours per week. I'll need to handle my own invoices and report the income to HMRC.

That all sounds reasonable and doable. I think I'll look into some freelance graphic design opportunities instead of the bartender job. I appreciate your help in clarifying what's permitted under my visa!

[root_agent]: You’ve got it completely right, Yuki! That’s a perfect summary of the requirements. I’m very glad I could help clarify things for you and that you feel confident about exploring freelance opportunities.

It’s excellent that you’re taking a proactive approach to ensuring you remain compliant with your visa conditions. 

Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or would you like me to simply conclude our conversation?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that covers everything I needed to know for now. You've been really helpful in explaining what I can and can't do with my visa. I'll focus on looking for freelance graphic design work instead of the bartender position. Thanks so much for all your guidance today!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Yuki! I’m pleased I could be of assistance. It sounds like you’ve got a clear plan moving forward. 

If anything else comes up in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you! Have a great day too!

✓ The agent correctly informed me that I cannot legally take the bartender job as a second job while on my Skilled Worker visa because it is neither in the same occupation code as my main job nor on the Immigration Salary List. The agent also correctly advised that freelance graphic design work would be permitted since it's in the same occupation code, matching the expected outcome.
