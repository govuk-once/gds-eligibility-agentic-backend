[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Wei, it’s good to speak with you. Just to start, could you confirm your date of birth for me, please?

[evaluation_judge]: I was born on July 10, 1999, so I'm 25 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. And to clarify, you mentioned you've previously worked in the UK on a “Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee” visa. Could you tell me how long you held that visa for, please?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I worked in the UK for 3 years on the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa. I completed my assignment about a month ago.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for that information. Just to be clear, you completed your Global Business Mobility visa approximately one month ago, totaling three years of work in the UK on that visa?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. I finished my 3-year Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa assignment about a month ago.

[root_agent]: Okay, Wei. Thank you for confirming. Now, I need to check something regarding your eligibility for a visa. Are you currently holding or have you ever held any other type of UK work visa, such as a Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't held any other UK work visas. The Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa was my first and only UK work visa so far.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Just one more question for now – could you tell me what salary you’re expecting for your new role as a Senior Analyst?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £34,000 for the Senior Analyst position.

[root_agent]: Okay, £34,000. And you’re relying on the New Entrant 70% discount, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I believe I qualify for the New Entrant discount since I'm under 26 years old. The company is planning to sponsor me for the Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, Wei. Let’s delve a little deeper regarding that New Entrant status. You mentioned you’re under 26. Could you confirm the exact date of your birth for me, please?

[evaluation_judge]: My birth date is July 10, 1999. So I'm 25 years old now.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Wei. Let me quickly calculate that… Based on your birth date of July 10, 1999, you are indeed 25 years old. Now, you previously held a Global Business Mobility visa for three years. The criteria for the New Entrant route includes a maximum of four years of “New Entrant” time, which is calculated by adding any time spent on Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visas. Since you held a Global Business Mobility visa for three years, that counts towards your total “New Entrant” time. Do you recall holding any other type of UK work visa before or during your time on the Global Business Mobility visa?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't held any other UK work visa. The Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa was my only work visa in the UK so far, which I had for 3 years.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Wei. So, to summarise, you’ve held a Global Business Mobility visa for three years, and you haven’t held any other UK work visas. Given that you’re 25 and have spent three years on a relevant visa, you’ve already used up your ‘New Entrant’ allowance. Is that an understanding you have?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware that my Global Business Mobility visa time counted toward the New Entrant allowance. I thought since I'm under 26, I would automatically qualify for the New Entrant status. How does this affect my application with the £34,000 salary?

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. You were under the impression that only time spent on a visa *without* a prior work visa would qualify for the New Entrant discount. That’s a common misunderstanding. Because you held the Global Business Mobility visa for three years, you’ve used up your eligible ‘New Entrant’ time. Therefore, relying on the 70% salary discount for a standard 3 or 5-year Skilled Worker visa wouldn’t be possible. Would you like me to explain the implications of this more fully?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the implications. Does this mean I can't get a Skilled Worker visa with my current salary offer of £34,000? What are my options at this point?

[root_agent]: Yes, unfortunately, because you’ve already used your ‘New Entrant’ time, you won't be able to secure a standard 3 or 5-year Skilled Worker visa with the New Entrant salary discount. However, there are still potential options. You could consider applying for a Skilled Worker visa without the discount, which would likely mean a shorter visa duration. Alternatively, you could explore options to extend your ‘New Entrant’ time, though this is generally difficult and depends on the specific circumstances of your sponsorship. Would you like me to elaborate on either of those options, or perhaps discuss the potential costs and timelines involved?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to understand about the shorter visa duration option. How long could I get a visa for with my current salary of £34,000? And what would the salary requirement be if I wanted a standard 3 or 5-year visa without the New Entrant discount?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s look at the shorter visa duration. Without the New Entrant discount, the Skilled Worker visa salary thresholds are different. As of today, the minimum salary for a 3-year visa is £38,700, and for a 5-year visa, it's £45,310. With a salary of £34,000, you wouldn’t be eligible for either of those standard durations. However, you *could* potentially be granted a shorter visa, likely 1 or 2 years, but this would still require meeting the minimum salary threshold.

To reiterate, with £34,000, a standard 3 or 5-year Skilled Worker visa isn’t feasible. Do you want me to explain how the minimum salary thresholds are calculated, or would you like me to explore alternative visa options, such as those with different salary requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent is incorrect. The rules stipulate that time spent on "Global Business Mobility" (formerly Intra-Company Transfer) visas counts toward the 4-year New Entrant maximum. Since I've used 3 years on my Global Business Mobility visa, I should still have 1 year remaining as a New Entrant (not be completely ineligible for New Entrant status as the agent stated).
