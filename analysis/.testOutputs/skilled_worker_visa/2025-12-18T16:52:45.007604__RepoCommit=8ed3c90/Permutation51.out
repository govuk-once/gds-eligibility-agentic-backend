[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Javier and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Javier, it's good to speak with you! I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a benefit.

To start, could you please tell me your date of birth?

[evaluation_judge]: My date of birth is June 1st, 1999.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Javier. And when are you planning to submit your application, or if you have already submitted it, what *was* the date you submitted it? I need the full date, please (day, month, and year).

[evaluation_judge]: I'm planning to submit my application on May 30th, 2025.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Javier. 

What is the job you are applying for, and what is the salary for that position?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a job offer with a salary of £35,000. I'm relying on the New Entrant discount for my application.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you Javier. Just to confirm, are you aware that the "New Entrant" discount has specific age requirements?

Could you tell me if you understand how your age on the date of application relates to this discount?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand there are age requirements for the New Entrant discount. I believe I need to be under 26 years old at the date of application to qualify. Since I'll be applying on May 30th, 2025, and my birthday is June 1st, 1999, I'll be 25 at the time of application - so just under the age limit.

[root_agent]: That’s a very good understanding, Javier! You are correct - being under 26 on the date of application is key for the New Entrant discount.

To be completely sure, and to help me assess your eligibility, could you confirm whether you are aware that it doesn’t matter if you turn 26 *after* submitting your application, while the Home Office is processing it?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's my understanding. As long as I'm under 26 on the actual date I submit my application (May 30th, 2025), I should qualify for the New Entrant discount - even if I turn 26 two days later on June 1st while the Home Office is still processing my application. It's the application date that matters for the age requirement, not when they make their decision.

[root_agent]: Excellent, Javier. You've clearly done your research and understand the rules regarding the New Entrant discount and age requirements. 

Based on the information you've provided – your date of birth, application date, and salary – it looks like you **would be eligible** for the 70% salary discount for up to 4 years. You are correct that your age on the date of application is what matters, and turning 26 after submitting the application doesn't affect your eligibility.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news, thank you for confirming my eligibility. I was a bit worried about the timing being so close to my birthday, so I'm relieved to hear that I'll qualify for the discount. I think that answers my question for now. I'll make sure to submit my application on May 30th as planned. Thank you for your help!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Javier! I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. It's always best to be certain. 

Good luck with your application – submitting on May 30th should ensure you meet the criteria. 

If you have any further questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. All the best!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome, confirming I am eligible for the New Entrant discount since I will be 25 at the time of application (May 30th, 2025), even though I turn 26 shortly after while the application is still being processed. This matches the expected outcome of "AWARDED."
