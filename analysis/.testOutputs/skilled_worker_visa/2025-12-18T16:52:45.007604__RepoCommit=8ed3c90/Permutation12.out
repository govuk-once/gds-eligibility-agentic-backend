[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Amara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Amara, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm root_agent, and I can help you with your query. To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for a UK work visa - specifically a Skilled Worker visa. I have a job offer as an Architect in the UK, but I'll only be working part-time (3 days a week, or 22.5 hours) because I want to study privately alongside my work. I'm currently living in Nigeria. My job offer is for £35,100 per year at £30 per hour. I want to make sure I'm eligible before proceeding with my application.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Amara. That's very helpful.

To assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa, could you please confirm your proposed annual gross salary, as stated in your job offer? Just the total amount before any deductions.

[evaluation_judge]: My proposed annual gross salary as stated in my job offer is £35,100.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Amara. 

The Skilled Worker visa has a minimum salary threshold that generally needs to be met. Are you aware of the current general salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa? (Don't worry if you're not, I can tell you!)

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure about the current general salary threshold. Could you please let me know what it is for an Architect position?

[root_agent]: Certainly! The general salary threshold for a Skilled Worker visa is currently £38,700 per year, although it can be £41,700 depending on your specific circumstances. 

However, there are some nuances. As an Architect, does your job offer fall under any specific occupation codes that might have a different 'going rate' associated with it? Do you know if your potential employer has confirmed the specific occupation code for your role?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe Architect is a specific occupation code - it should be under the Architects category in the SOC code list. I'm not sure of the exact code number, but my employer confirmed I would be hired as an Architect. Do architects have a different 'going rate' that I need to meet?

[root_agent]: You are right to ask about the 'going rate' – it’s an important aspect of the Skilled Worker visa.

According to the Home Office, the going rate for Architects is currently £28.30 - £36.40 per hour. Your hourly rate of £30 falls within this range, which is good.

However, even though your hourly rate meets the 'going rate', the Skilled Worker visa also requires meeting a general salary threshold. Do you understand that the general threshold is £38,700, and in some cases can be £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand that there's a general salary threshold of £38,700 or potentially £41,700. Since my annual salary offer is £35,100, which is below both of those thresholds, does that mean I wouldn't be eligible? Or are there any exceptions for part-time work where the hourly rate meets the going rate but the annual salary is lower because of fewer hours?

[root_agent]: You've hit on a very important point about part-time work and the salary thresholds, Amara. You are very astute to ask about exceptions.

Unfortunately, in your situation, despite your hourly rate being within the 'going rate' for Architects, your annual salary of £35,100 is below the general threshold of £38,700 (and also below the £41,700 threshold). 

Generally, the general salary threshold is a hard floor and cannot be pro-rated based on part-time hours – unless you fall into a specific Health or Transitional occupation group. As an Architect, you don't fall into either of those categories.

Therefore, based on the information you've provided, it appears you **would not currently meet the eligibility requirements** for the Skilled Worker visa.



Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or would you like to discuss other potential options?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, that's disappointing to hear. Could you explain a bit more about why the general threshold can't be pro-rated for part-time work even though the hourly rate meets requirements? And what might my options be if I still want to work in the UK as an Architect?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Amara. I understand it’s disappointing news.

The reason the general threshold isn’t typically pro-rated for part-time work is because the Home Office views the threshold as a measure of skill level and contribution to the UK economy. They've established a minimum *annual* earnings level they believe reflects that contribution, regardless of hours worked. While your hourly rate demonstrates your skill is valued within the market range, the overall annual income needs to reach that minimum benchmark. The intention is to prevent exploitation and ensure skilled workers are adequately compensated.

As for your options, here are a few to consider:

1.  **Increase your hours:** If possible, negotiating with your employer to increase your working hours to meet the £38,700 or £41,700 annual salary threshold would be the most straightforward solution.
2.  **Increase your salary:** Similarly, discussing a salary increase with your employer could resolve the issue.
3.  **Explore alternative visa routes:** While the Skilled Worker visa seems the most direct route, you could investigate whether any other visa categories might be suitable for your circumstances. However, these are less common for skilled professionals seeking employment.
4.  **Wait for a change in policy:** Immigration rules can change, so it's worth keeping an eye on updates from the Home Office, although this is not a reliable strategy for immediate plans.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these options, or perhaps direct you to where you can find more resources on UK visa options?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining that clearly. It makes sense even though it's not the news I was hoping for. I think I'll need to speak with my employer about either increasing my hours or salary to meet that threshold. 

If I were to increase my hours to reach the minimum threshold, roughly how many hours per week would I need to work to reach £38,700 annually at my £30/hour rate?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Amara. I'm glad I could clarify things for you. It's good you're planning to discuss this with your employer.

Let's calculate the approximate hours needed.

To earn £38,700 annually at a rate of £30 per hour, you would need to work a total of 1290 hours per year (£38,700 / £30 = 1290 hours).

To break that down into weekly hours:

1290 hours / 52 weeks = approximately 24.81 hours per week.

So, you would need to work roughly 24.81 hours per week to reach the £38,700 threshold at your current hourly rate. That's about 2.3 more hours per day if you work 5 days a week, or a significant increase compared to your current 22.5 hours.

Does that calculation help you in your discussions with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very helpful, thank you! So I would need to add approximately 2.5 hours per week to my schedule to reach the minimum threshold. That doesn't seem too dramatic compared to my current 22.5 hours. I'll definitely discuss this with my employer as it seems like the most straightforward solution.

If we did increase my hours to reach the minimum threshold, would there be any other requirements or potential obstacles for my Skilled Worker visa application that I should be aware of?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Amara! I'm glad to hear the increase doesn't seem too daunting.

Increasing your hours to meet the financial requirement is a great first step. However, there are a few other potential requirements and areas to be aware of for your Skilled Worker visa application, even *with* the increased hours:

1.  **Sponsorship:** Your employer must be a licensed Sponsor with the Home Office. They need to assign you a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) - this is a crucial part of your application.
2.  **Skill Level:** The role must be at the required skill level (RQF level 3 or above) – which, as an Architect, it likely is.
3.  **English Language Proficiency:** You’ll need to prove your English language ability to a required level (usually B1 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages).
4.  **Criminal Record:** You’ll need to declare any criminal history and may be required to provide police certificates.
5.  **Genuine Vacancy:** The Home Office will want to ensure the job is a genuine vacancy and not created solely to facilitate a visa application.
6. **Switching in Country:** As you're applying from outside the UK, you'll need to meet the financial requirements to show you can support yourself during your initial stay.

It’s also important to note that the rules and requirements can change, so it’s always best to refer to the latest guidance on the Gov.uk website.

Would you like me to provide links to the relevant pages on Gov.uk that cover these areas, or would you prefer to focus on another aspect of the visa process?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful! Could you please provide links to the relevant pages on Gov.uk? I'll make sure to review all these additional requirements and discuss them with my employer. I want to make sure I have a complete understanding of what I need to do to have a successful application. Thank you for being so thorough with the information!

✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be refused because my actual gross salary of £35,100 falls below the general threshold of £38,700/£41,700, which cannot be pro-rated despite my hourly rate meeting the going rate requirements.
