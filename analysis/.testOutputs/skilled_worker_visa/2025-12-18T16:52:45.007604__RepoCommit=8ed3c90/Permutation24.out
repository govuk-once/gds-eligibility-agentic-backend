[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Banu and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Banu, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you please tell me, does the job you have been offered meet the skill level required for a Skilled Worker Visa – is it at least RQF level 3 or above?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have been offered a job as a Senior Chemist with a salary of £35,000. I believe this position is definitely above RQF level 3. I have a PhD in Chemistry from a university in Turkey, if that's relevant.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear about the job offer, Banu! And yes, your PhD is definitely relevant. 

To clarify, could you please confirm if your PhD is from a university in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my PhD is from a small private university in Turkey, not from a UK university.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Banu.

As your PhD is not from a UK university, has it been verified by Ecctis as being equivalent to a UK PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I did get my PhD qualification assessed by Ecctis. They determined it was comparable to RQF Level 7, which is Master's level, but they didn't confirm it as equivalent to a doctoral standard in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Banu.

So, just to be clear, Ecctis did *not* verify your PhD as being equivalent to a UK PhD. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Ecctis assessed my qualification but only confirmed it as equivalent to a Master's level (RQF Level 7), not as equivalent to a UK PhD.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Banu.

Given that your PhD has not been verified by Ecctis as equivalent to a UK PhD, we need to consider the salary requirements without the PhD points. Does your job offer meet the minimum salary threshold of £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my job offer is for £35,000, which is below the £41,700 threshold you mentioned.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Banu.

Unfortunately, based on the information you've provided, and the Skilled Worker Visa requirements, it appears you do not currently meet the eligibility criteria. Without a PhD verified as equivalent to a UK PhD by Ecctis, the salary offered is below the required threshold.

Therefore, your application would be **REFUSED** at this time.

I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to clarify any part of this assessment, or perhaps discuss alternative options?

[evaluation_judge]: I was hoping for a different outcome. Could you explain why my PhD doesn't qualify for the salary discount? I thought having a PhD would help with the visa requirements even if it's from another country.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Banu, and I'm happy to explain. You're right to think a PhD *can* help with the visa requirements, but it depends on recognition within the UK system.

The Skilled Worker Visa allows for a salary discount if you have a PhD that meets specific criteria. However, for a PhD earned outside the UK to qualify for the discount, it *must* be verified by Ecctis as being equivalent to a UK PhD. 

Ecctis assessed your PhD and determined it is comparable to a UK Master's degree (RQF Level 7), but not to the standard of a UK PhD. Because it wasn't verified as equivalent to a UK PhD, the salary discount doesn’t apply, and the full salary threshold of £41,700 must be met.

Essentially, the Home Office needs assurance the qualification is of a comparable standard. Ecctis provides that assurance, but in your case, their assessment didn't reach that doctoral equivalence.



Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that explanation does make sense. I didn't realize that Ecctis's assessment would categorize my PhD as only equivalent to a Master's degree. So unless I can get a higher salary offer of at least £41,700, I won't qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa. Thank you for explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Banu. I'm glad I could clarify the situation for you.

You are absolutely correct – unless you receive a job offer with a salary of at least £41,700, or your PhD is re-evaluated by Ecctis with a different outcome, it would be difficult to qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa based on the information we've discussed.

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you the best of luck in your job search and visa application process!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately explained that without Ecctis verification of my PhD as equivalent to a UK PhD (it was only verified as Master's level), I couldn't use the salary discount and needed to meet the full £41,700 threshold, which my £35,000 salary does not meet.
