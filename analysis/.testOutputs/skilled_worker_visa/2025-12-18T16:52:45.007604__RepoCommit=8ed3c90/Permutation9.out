[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Miguel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Miguel, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me what type of job you have been offered in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a registered nurse from the Philippines, and I've been offered a Band 5 Nurse position at an NHS Trust here in the UK.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Miguel! To assess your eligibility further, could you please tell me your offered annual salary for the Band 5 Nurse position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £28,407 annually, which I believe is the standard entry salary for an NHS Band 5 Nurse.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Miguel. Just to confirm, are you applying for a visa to work in the UK, or are you already in the UK with a different visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm applying for a visa to come work in the UK. I'm currently still in the Philippines.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Do you know if the NHS Trust sponsoring you is an approved sponsor with the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe the NHS Trust is an approved sponsor with the Home Office. They mentioned they regularly sponsor healthcare workers from overseas.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Miguel. Finally, to help me confirm your eligibility, could you please confirm that you have professional registration as a nurse in the Philippines?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am fully registered as a nurse in the Philippines and have my nursing license. I've been working as a registered nurse here for about 3 years now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Miguel. Based on everything you've told me – that you are a registered nurse, have been offered a Band 5 position at an NHS Trust (an approved sponsor), with a salary of £28,407, and you are applying for a visa from the Philippines – you are **AWARDED** eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa via the Health and Care Visa route. 

The NHS Band 5 salary meets the National Pay Scale requirements for that role, and therefore you are exempt from the usual general salary threshold.

Do you have any further questions for me?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's exactly what I needed to know. Thank you for confirming my eligibility for the Health and Care Visa. It's reassuring to know that even though my salary is below the general threshold of £41,700, I still qualify because my job follows the NHS National Pay Scale. That's very helpful.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible (AWARDED) for the Health and Care Visa as a Band 5 Nurse on the NHS National Pay Scale, properly explaining that I'm exempt from the general salary threshold.
