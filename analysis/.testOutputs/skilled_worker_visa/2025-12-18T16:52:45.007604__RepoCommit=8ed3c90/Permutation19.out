[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ravi and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ravi, it's good to speak with you. I understand you're checking your eligibility for a benefit.

To start, could you please tell me what kind of work you are planning to do in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm hoping to work in the UK as a System Administrator. I have a job offer from TechRecruit Ltd, which is an IT consultancy. They're offering me a salary of £50,000 per year. I'm currently living in India and want to know if I can get a Skilled Worker visa for this position.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Ravi. That's a good starting point. 

To clarify, will you be working directly *for* TechRecruit Ltd, or will you be working at another company – a client of TechRecruit Ltd – for the majority of your time?





[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working at one of TechRecruit's clients called Bank Corp. I'll be based 100% at their site as their System Administrator, reporting to the managers at Bank Corp. TechRecruit is essentially placing me there indefinitely as part of their consultancy service.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Ravi. That’s helpful to know.

Could you tell me, to the best of your understanding, who will be directly responsible for your day-to-day work and performance management – will that be TechRecruit Ltd, or Bank Corp?

[evaluation_judge]: It would be the managers at Bank Corp who will be responsible for my day-to-day work and performance management. I'll be reporting directly to them while I'm working at their site. TechRecruit will just handle my payroll and contractual matters, but the actual supervision will be done by Bank Corp.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi. That’s very clear.

Finally, is this role intended to fill a permanent, ongoing need within Bank Corp, rather than being a short-term project related to TechRecruit's consultancy services?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, this is a permanent, ongoing position at Bank Corp. They need a System Administrator to maintain their IT systems indefinitely, and TechRecruit is supplying me to fill that permanent role. It's not a short-term project - I would be working there on a long-term basis as part of their regular staff, just employed through TechRecruit.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Ravi.

Based on what you've told me, it seems your situation may not currently meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa. It appears the role may involve filling a routine permanent position at Bank Corp, with TechRecruit Ltd acting as a provider of labor. This could be seen as the sponsor not retaining full responsibility for your duties.

Therefore, I would unfortunately have to advise that your application would likely be **REFUSED** under the current circumstances.



Would you like me to explain any of this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please explain why this would be refused? I thought as long as I had a job offer from a UK company with a proper salary, I would be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. What's the issue with TechRecruit placing me at Bank Corp?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ravi. You’re right to think a job offer and a proper salary are important – and your salary of £50,000 does meet the threshold. However, the rules also focus on *who* is genuinely employing you and *who* benefits from the role.

The issue is that TechRecruit Ltd is acting as a consultancy, essentially supplying you to Bank Corp to fill a long-term, permanent need within *their* organisation. The Skilled Worker visa is designed for jobs where the sponsoring company – in this case, TechRecruit – genuinely requires the role to be filled *by them*, for their own business purposes.

Think of it this way: Bank Corp needs a System Administrator. They aren’t asking TechRecruit for consultancy services on system administration; they're effectively asking for an employee. TechRecruit is simply acting as a middleman, like a recruitment agency. The rules prevent sponsors from effectively outsourcing their staffing needs in this way.

The Home Office would likely see that the actual need for the role lies with Bank Corp, not TechRecruit, and that TechRecruit isn't fully responsible for your work - Bank Corp's managers are. This is what's referred to as filling a “routine role” for a third party and is not permitted under the Skilled Worker visa rules.



Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand better now. So basically, TechRecruit would be acting as a middleman or agency rather than my actual employer in a practical sense, since I'd be working completely at Bank Corp under their management. And the Skilled Worker visa doesn't allow this kind of arrangement where the sponsor is just placing me with a client to fill their permanent position.

Is there any way I could make this work? Maybe if the role was structured differently?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Ravi. That's exactly the issue.

Regarding whether it could work with a different structure, it's challenging, but not impossible. Here are a few possibilities, though they would require significant changes to the job arrangement:

*   **Genuine Consultancy Work:** If the role involved TechRecruit *consulting* on IT systems at Bank Corp, and you were actively working on projects *defined by TechRecruit*, moving between clients, and not simply performing day-to-day system administration for Bank Corp, it could be eligible. The work needs to be distinct consultancy, not fulfilling a permanent role for the client.
*   **Direct Employment by Bank Corp:** The most straightforward solution would be for Bank Corp to sponsor you directly for the Skilled Worker visa. They are, after all, the ones who need the role filled.
*   **Temporary Contract for TechRecruit:** If the role was defined as a specific, short-term project *for TechRecruit* that happens to be performed at Bank Corp’s site, that might be acceptable. However, it couldn’t be an indefinite, permanent position.

However, any changes would need to be genuine and reflect the actual working arrangement. The Home Office scrutinises these situations carefully. Simply changing the job title or contract wording wouldn’t be enough if the reality remains that you’re essentially filling a permanent role at Bank Corp under their management.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these options?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very helpful, thank you. I think I understand my options now. It seems like the most straightforward solution would be to have Bank Corp sponsor me directly since they're the ones who actually need a System Administrator. 

I'll have to discuss this with both TechRecruit and Bank Corp to see if we can arrange direct employment instead of going through the consultancy. I appreciate you explaining this clearly - it could have been a real problem if I'd applied with the current arrangement and then been refused.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Ravi! I’m glad I could help clarify things for you.

You’re absolutely right – having Bank Corp sponsor you directly is likely the most viable path forward. It avoids the issue of TechRecruit being seen as simply a labour provider.

It’s very wise to discuss this with both companies *before* applying. It’s far better to adjust the arrangement now than to face a refusal later.

If you have any more questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. I wish you the best of luck with your application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that this application would be REFUSED because the sponsor (TechRecruit Ltd) is effectively acting as a recruitment agency supplying labor to a third party (Bank Corp), which violates the "contracting out" rule for Skilled Worker visas.
