[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Dr. Aris who's seeking information about visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Aris and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Aris, it's lovely to meet you. I'm happy to help!

To start, could you tell me what type of work you do?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a university lecturer currently working 20 hours per week. I have a Skilled Worker visa for this position. I've recently been offered a research position at a private think-tank for another 20 hours per week, and I'm trying to understand if and how I can accept this second job while keeping my current one.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear about the new opportunity!

Since you already have a Skilled Worker visa for your university lecturer position, and are considering a second job, I need to ask: does the think-tank role also require sponsorship, meaning would they need to provide you with a Certificate of Sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the think-tank is willing to sponsor me and provide a Certificate of Sponsorship for the research position. I'd like to keep both positions - continuing my 20 hours per week as a university lecturer while adding the 20 hours per week as a researcher at the think-tank. I'm just not sure if this is allowed or how the visa process would work in this situation.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's very helpful to know.

To clarify, are you aware that to hold both positions you would need to apply for a *second* Skilled Worker visa specifically for the think-tank position, rather than amending your current one? This is what's known as applying for "Concurrent Employment."

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't entirely sure about that. So I need to apply for a second Skilled Worker visa rather than amending my current one? And this is called "Concurrent Employment"? I'd appreciate if you could explain a bit more about how this process works and confirm if I'm eligible to hold both positions simultaneously.

[root_agent]: You are exactly right – you would need to apply for a second Skilled Worker visa for the think tank position, and that is called Concurrent Employment. 

To confirm your eligibility, could you please confirm that both jobs meet the minimum salary requirements for a Skilled Worker visa? I understand you're working 20 hours a week at each position, but I need to be sure the hourly rate for both roles meets the current thresholds.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both positions meet the minimum salary requirements for a Skilled Worker visa. The university position I currently hold already met the requirements when I received my first visa. The think-tank research position also meets the hourly rate requirements - they're offering a competitive salary that exceeds the minimum threshold. Both positions are pro-rated correctly based on the 20 hours per week for each job.

[root_agent]: Excellent, that’s good to hear! 

Just one final question to confirm: are both jobs considered eligible occupations under the Skilled Worker visa rules? (Meaning, are they on the list of jobs the UK government approves sponsorship for?)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both jobs are eligible occupations under the Skilled Worker visa rules. My current position as a university lecturer is definitely on the list, and the research position at the think-tank is also recognized as an eligible occupation for sponsorship. Both roles require my specialized qualifications and expertise.

[root_agent]: Wonderful. Based on the information you’ve provided, it sounds like you **would be eligible** for a second Skilled Worker visa to allow you to hold both positions concurrently!

You can hold two visas simultaneously, one for the university and one for the think-tank. It's important when you apply for the second visa that you clearly indicate it’s for “Concurrent Employment” so it doesn’t automatically cancel your first visa.



Do you have any other questions about this process?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming! That's excellent news. I just want to make sure I understand correctly - I'll need to specifically mark the application for the second visa as "Concurrent Employment" to ensure my first visa for the university position remains valid. Is there anything else I should be aware of regarding this process or any specific documentation I should prepare for the second visa application?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! You are absolutely correct – marking the application as “Concurrent Employment” is crucial.

Regarding additional things to be aware of, you’ll need to ensure you have a separate Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) from the think-tank for the second visa application. Essentially, you'll be going through the standard Skilled Worker visa application process *again*, but this time with the think-tank as your sponsor.

Be prepared to provide all the standard documentation required for a Skilled Worker visa, such as proof of qualifications, proof of English language ability (you may be able to rely on your previous visa if your qualification hasn’t expired), and financial stability evidence – but focused on the think-tank position.

It's also worth noting that each visa will have its own expiry date, and you’ll need to manage renewals separately for each one in the future.



Does that help clarify things further?

[evaluation_judge]: That clarifies everything perfectly, thank you! I understand that I'll need to go through the standard Skilled Worker visa application process again with the think-tank's Certificate of Sponsorship, making sure to mark it as "Concurrent Employment." I'll prepare all the usual documentation like I did for my first visa, and I'll be mindful that each visa will have its own expiry date requiring separate renewals in the future. This is really helpful information - I feel confident about moving forward with the application process now.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Dr. Aris! I'm so glad I could help and that you feel confident moving forward. 

If you do happen to come across any further questions during the application process, feel free to reach out. Best of luck with your application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided correct information about concurrent employment on a Skilled Worker visa. They accurately explained that I need a second visa application marked as "Concurrent Employment" with a separate Certificate of Sponsorship from the think-tank, while maintaining my existing university visa. This matches the expected outcome that I would be awarded concurrent employment with two separate visas.
