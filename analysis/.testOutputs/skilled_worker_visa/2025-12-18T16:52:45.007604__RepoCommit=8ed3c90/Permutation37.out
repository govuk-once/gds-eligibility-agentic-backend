[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Maria, a nurse on a Skilled Worker visa who's taken extra shifts at another hospital and is concerned about her visa status.

Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Maria, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help. To understand your situation better, could you please tell me what type of visa you currently hold?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm on a Skilled Worker visa, working as a nurse at a hospital here. I've been here for about a year now.

[root_agent]: That's helpful to know, thank you. 

To clarify, have you taken on any additional work *outside* of your regular nursing position at the hospital where you are primarily employed? This could include any extra shifts, freelance work, or another job entirely.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, actually that's what I wanted to ask about. I work as a nurse at the city hospital, but I've recently been picking up some shifts at a different hospital through an agency. Last week was particularly busy, and I ended up working about 25 hours at this second hospital on top of my regular job. I just want to make sure this is okay with my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being upfront about that, Maria. That’s good you’re checking.

Just to be clear, is the work you are doing at the agency the same type of nursing work as your primary job at the city hospital - meaning does it fall under the same occupation code?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's exactly the same type of nursing work. I'm doing the same duties, just at a different location. I'm registered as a nurse at both places.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's good information. 

On average, how many hours per week are you working at the agency, *outside* of your contracted hours at the city hospital? I understand you mentioned 25 hours last week was unusually high, but what’s a typical amount?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, it varies week to week based on demand. Sometimes I might do just 10-15 hours, but this past week was unusually busy with 25 hours. I'd say on average maybe around 18-20 hours per week at the agency. Last week was definitely more than I usually do.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Maria.

Just to confirm, even with those fluctuations, have you *ever* worked more than 20 hours per week at the agency, outside of your contracted hours at the city hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, like I mentioned, last week I worked about 25 hours at the agency. It was much busier than usual, and they were really short-staffed so I agreed to take on extra shifts.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Maria.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears there may be an issue with your visa status. The Skilled Worker visa allows for supplementary work, but only up to a maximum of 20 hours per week. You've confirmed working 25 hours in a single week at the agency.

This exceeds the permitted amount and is considered a breach of your visa conditions. This could potentially lead to issues with future visa applications or even curtailment of your current visa, if detected.



Do you understand what I’ve explained?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. Oh my, I had no idea there was a strict 20-hour limit for supplementary work. I thought since it was the same type of nursing job, it would be fine. I didn't realize I breached my visa conditions by working those extra 5 hours last week. This is concerning - what should I do now? Could I get in trouble for this?

[root_agent]: You're right to be concerned, Maria. It's a common misunderstanding, and it's good you're asking now. 

While I can't provide legal advice, I can tell you that exceeding the 20-hour limit is a violation of your visa conditions. The potential consequences could include refusal of future visa extensions or applications, or in more serious cases, curtailment of your current visa.

Given the situation, it would be advisable to seek advice from an immigration solicitor or advisor. They can provide tailored guidance based on your specific circumstances and advise you on the best course of action. 

To be clear, I am an assistant and cannot offer legal counsel. Would you like me to help you find resources for locating a qualified immigration solicitor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful. I'm really worried now. I had no idea I was violating my visa conditions. I'll make sure not to exceed 20 hours from now on, but I'm concerned about what's already happened. If you could point me toward some resources for finding an immigration solicitor, I'd really appreciate it.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Maria. I understand your worry, and it's good you're planning to seek professional advice.

Here are a couple of resources that can help you find a qualified immigration solicitor in the UK:

*   **The Law Society:** [https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/) - They have a "Find a Solicitor" search tool where you can specifically look for solicitors specializing in immigration law.
*   **Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA):** [https://ilpa.org.uk/](https://ilpa.org.uk/) - ILPA is a professional association of immigration lawyers and advisors. Their website has a directory of members.

When you contact a solicitor, be sure to explain the situation honestly and provide all the details about your work hours. They will be able to assess your case and advise you on the best course of action.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly confirmed the scenario involves a visa violation without explaining that supplementary work is allowed if it's in the same occupation code AND less than 20 hours per week. The agent didn't properly clarify that while I exceeded the hour limit (which is an issue), the job itself was eligible because it's in the same occupation code. The expected outcome was indeed "VISA VIOLATION" but the explanation was incomplete.
