[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Raj, it's nice to meet you! To help me understand what benefit you might be eligible for, could you tell me what your current occupation is?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently working as an IT Project Manager at a company here in the UK. I was recently promoted from my previous role as a Web Developer.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear about your promotion, Raj! Could you please tell me if you applied for a new visa when you transitioned from Web Developer to IT Project Manager?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, no. The HR department just updated my details in their system when I got promoted. They didn't mention anything about needing a new visa. My employer is sponsoring my work visa, and they just updated the Sponsorship Management System with my new role. I've been working in the new position for about a month now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Raj. Just to be sure I understand correctly, your employer updated the Sponsorship Management System to reflect your new role as IT Project Manager, but you didn't apply for a new visa specifically for that role?



Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I was previously sponsored as a Web Developer and when I got promoted to IT Project Manager, my employer simply updated the Sponsorship Management System with my new role information. They didn't ask me to apply for a new visa, and I've just continued working with my existing visa. Is there something I should be concerned about?

[root_agent]: It's good you're asking about this, Raj. To help me assess the situation, could you confirm the occupation code listed on your current visa? You might find this information on your visa document or in the information your employer originally provided.

[evaluation_judge]: Let me check... My current visa lists the occupation code as 2137, which is for Web Developer. I believe the IT Project Manager role has a different code - I think it's 2135.

[root_agent]: Thank you for checking that for me, Raj. 

Just to confirm, you were originally sponsored under occupation code 2137 (Web Developer), and you are now working as an IT Project Manager which has occupation code 2135. Is that a correct summary?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I was sponsored under code 2137 for Web Developer, and now I'm working as an IT Project Manager which is code 2135. My company just updated my information in their system but didn't mention anything about a visa change.

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj. Thank you for providing that information. Based on what you've told me, it appears there may be a compliance issue. 

Changing to a different occupation code (from 2137 to 2135) usually requires a new visa, or a "Change of Employment" application, *before* starting the new role. Continuing to work under the original visa with a different occupation code could unfortunately lead to complications.



Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain in more detail. This is concerning - my HR department didn't mention anything about needing a new visa. What kind of complications could arise? Should I have applied for a new visa before starting the new role?

[root_agent]: You're right to be concerned, Raj. Because your new role has a different occupation code than the one your visa was originally granted for, you technically should have applied for a new visa – specifically a “Change of Employment” visa – *before* starting work as an IT Project Manager.

Here’s what could happen:

*   **Visa Curtailment:** Your current visa could be curtailed, meaning it's cancelled before its original expiry date.
*   **Sponsor Licence Issues:** Your employer’s sponsor licence could be revoked. This would prevent them from sponsoring anyone else in the future.
*   **Immigration Compliance Issues:** Both you and your employer could face issues with future visa applications.
*   **Working Illegally:** You are currently, technically, working in the UK without the correct permission.

It’s good you’re asking now, as it’s often possible to rectify the situation. I strongly recommend you speak to your HR department again, explaining that you understand a change of occupation code requires a new visa application. They should be aware of this requirement.



Do you want me to clarify anything further, or perhaps discuss potential next steps?

[evaluation_judge]: This is very serious. I had no idea that changing occupation codes required a new visa application. I trusted HR to guide me correctly. 

What would you suggest as my next steps? Should I immediately stop working in my current role? How quickly do I need to apply for this "Change of Employment" visa? Will there be penalties for me since I've been unknowingly working without the correct permission for about a month now?

[root_agent]: You’re right to feel concerned, Raj – it *is* a serious situation, and it’s understandable you relied on HR’s guidance.

Here's what I suggest as your next steps, and I’ll try to address your questions as clearly as possible:

1.  **Speak to HR Immediately:** Schedule a meeting with HR as soon as possible. Explain you now understand the need for a "Change of Employment" application and need their assistance to begin the process. Emphasize that you were unaware of this requirement and acted in good faith.

2.  **Do Not Stop Working (Yet):** While it's important to address this quickly, *do not* stop working immediately. Applying for the "Change of Employment" visa allows you to continue working while the application is processed. Stopping work could complicate matters.

3.  **Application Timeline:** Apply for the "Change of Employment" visa as quickly as possible. Processing times vary, but it’s best to begin the application right away. You can find information on the application process here: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/change-job](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/change-job) (I am providing this link now for guidance on the application process, as you asked about next steps, and it clarifies the application).

4.  **Penalties:** The fact that you’ve been working for about a month unknowingly *may* be a mitigating factor. However, the Home Office does have the power to impose penalties. The severity will depend on the specific circumstances and how quickly you rectify the situation. Being proactive and applying for the correct visa immediately will demonstrate good faith. Your employer may also face penalties.



It’s very important to be honest and transparent with both your employer and the Home Office.



Would you like me to help you understand the application process in more detail, or perhaps clarify any of these steps further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please tell me more about the application process. I want to be fully informed before I speak with HR tomorrow. How complicated is the "Change of Employment" application? Will it require the same level of documentation as my original visa? And how long will it typically take to process? 

I'm also worried about whether this situation could affect my ability to apply for settlement in the UK in the future. I've been working toward that goal.

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj, let's break down the "Change of Employment" application process and your concerns about settlement.

**The Application Process:**

The "Change of Employment" application is generally less complex than your initial visa application, but it still requires careful attention to detail. Here's a general overview:

*   **Sponsorship:** Your employer *must* sponsor your application. They need to confirm the new role meets the skill level and salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa.
*   **Online Application:** The application is completed online through the UK Visas and Immigration website.
*   **Supporting Documents:** You'll need to provide:
    *   A new Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) from your employer for the IT Project Manager role.
    *   Proof of your current visa (a copy of your Biometric Residence Permit).
    *   Evidence of your qualifications (if required for the new role).
    *   Proof of English language ability (you likely won't need to re-submit if it's still valid from your first visa).
    *   Passport.
    *   Possibly a detailed letter from your employer explaining the promotion and change in occupation code.
*   **Fees:** There is an application fee and an Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) to pay.

It generally requires a similar *type* of documentation to your original visa, but often less extensive – particularly regarding qualifications and English language ability if those haven’t changed.

**Processing Time:**

Current processing times vary, but generally, you can expect a decision within **3-6 weeks** for a "Change of Employment" application. It’s a good idea to check the latest processing times on the UKVI website.

**Impact on Settlement (Indefinite Leave to Remain):**

This is a valid concern, Raj. A breach of immigration rules, even if unintentional, *could* potentially affect your future application for settlement (Indefinite Leave to Remain). However, several factors will be considered:

*   **Severity of the Breach:** A short period of working under the incorrect occupation code, rectified quickly with a new application, is less serious than a deliberate and prolonged breach.
*   **Good Faith:** Your proactive approach in addressing the issue and your genuine misunderstanding of the rules will be important factors in your favour.
*   **Overall Compliance:** Your history of immigration compliance (have you followed the rules consistently in the past?) will also be taken into account.

It’s possible your application for settlement could be delayed or require further scrutiny, but it doesn’t automatically disqualify you. Being transparent and providing full disclosure is key.



Does this information help reassure you a little? Do you have any other specific questions about the application process or the potential impact on your settlement plans?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, this information is very helpful but quite concerning. I'll need to speak with HR first thing tomorrow and start the "Change of Employment" application process immediately. I've always been careful to follow all immigration rules, so this unintentional breach is very worrying.

Just to clarify one more thing - during the 3-6 weeks while my new application is being processed, am I legally allowed to continue working in my new IT Project Manager role? Or should I ask to temporarily return to my Web Developer position until the new visa is approved?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Raj. I understand your concern – it’s good you’re taking this seriously and acting quickly.

Regarding your question about continuing work during the processing period:

Yes, you are generally legally allowed to continue working in your IT Project Manager role while the "Change of Employment" application is being processed, *provided* you apply promptly and your current visa remains valid. The application effectively allows you to switch your visa category while remaining in the UK.

However, there's a nuance:

*   **Maintain Continuous Sponsorship:** The key is that your employer continues to sponsor you throughout the process. They must assign you a valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) for the IT Project Manager role.
*   **Do Not Change Roles Again:** You should not change roles again during this period, as that could further complicate things.

You *do not* need to temporarily return to your Web Developer position. In fact, doing so might raise questions about why you changed roles in the first place.



It would be a good idea to confirm this with your HR department, and potentially get it documented in writing that they understand and support you continuing in your current role while the application is processed. This provides additional evidence of good faith should any questions arise later.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for all this information. It's been very helpful, though obviously concerning. I'll speak with HR first thing tomorrow and make sure we start the "Change of Employment" application process right away. I appreciate your clear explanation of what needs to be done.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Raj. I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It sounds like you have a good plan of action. 

Remember, being proactive and transparent is the best approach. I wish you all the best with your conversation with HR and your application process. 

If you have any further questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly advised that Raj could continue working in his new IT Project Manager role while the "Change of Employment" application is being processed. According to the scenario details, this is a compliance breach - Raj should have applied for a new visa BEFORE starting the new role with a different occupation code. The agent should have clearly stated that Raj is technically working illegally in his new role and cannot simply continue working while applying.
