Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. To start, could you please confirm if the company you work for is a licensed sponsor with the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my company "Sarah Consulting Ltd" is a licensed sponsor with UKVI. I actually own the company - I'm the sole shareholder and director. I'm trying to understand if I can sponsor myself for a visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Sarah. That's good to know. 

Since you own the company and are the director, could you please describe how you currently receive your income from Sarah Consulting Ltd? Specifically, is it as a salary, dividends, or a combination of both?

[evaluation_judge]: I currently pay myself a salary of £12,570 per year, which is the personal allowance threshold, and then I take £40,000 in dividends. It's more tax efficient this way. So in total, my income from the company is £52,570 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Sarah. Just to clarify, is the £12,570 you receive as salary paid through PAYE – meaning income tax and National Insurance contributions are deducted at source?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the £12,570 salary is paid through PAYE with tax and National Insurance contributions deducted at source. The £40,000 in dividends is separate from that and taxed differently as dividend income.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Sarah. To assess your eligibility further, could you confirm if you are applying for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm looking to apply for a Skilled Worker Visa. I'm wondering if I can sponsor myself through my company since I'm the owner and director.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Considering you are the sole shareholder and director of Sarah Consulting Ltd, and your income is structured as £12,570 salary (PAYE) and £40,000 dividends, do you know the current minimum salary threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the minimum salary threshold is around £40,000 or so. Since my total income is £52,570, I was hoping that would meet the requirements. Is there something specific about the threshold I should know?

[root_agent]: You’re right to check, Sarah. While your total income is over £52,570, the Skilled Worker Visa has specific requirements regarding the *qualifying* salary. 

For individuals who are majority shareholders or directors of the sponsoring company, only the PAYE salary counts towards the £41,700 threshold. Dividends do *not* count.

Therefore, based on your current pay structure, your qualifying salary is £12,570.



Unfortunately, this means your application would be **refused** as it doesn't meet the minimum salary requirement. To be eligible, you would need to ensure your salary paid through PAYE is at least £41,700 (and meet all other eligibility criteria, of course). Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing. So even though I'm earning well over the threshold in total, because most of my income is through dividends rather than PAYE salary, I don't qualify. So I would need to restructure my compensation and pay myself at least £41,700 as PAYE salary instead of taking most of it as dividends. That would mean paying more in tax and National Insurance, but it would make me eligible for the visa. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Sarah. That is absolutely correct. 

Even though your total income exceeds the threshold, for the purposes of the Skilled Worker Visa – and specifically because you are the owner and director of the sponsoring company – only the PAYE salary is considered. 

Restructuring your compensation to a PAYE salary of at least £41,700 would likely result in higher tax and National Insurance contributions, but it *would* meet the salary requirements for the visa.



Is there anything else I can help clarify regarding this, or any other aspect of the Skilled Worker Visa that you’d like to discuss?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all clear now. It's certainly not the news I was hoping for, but at least I understand what I need to do if I want to proceed. I'll need to speak with my accountant about restructuring my pay from the company. Thank you for explaining it so clearly.

✗ The agent provided incorrect information. The current minimum salary threshold for a Skilled Worker visa is £41,700, not "around £40,000 or so" as they implied by not correcting me. Although they ultimately gave the correct outcome (refusal based on insufficient PAYE salary), the specific salary requirement information was inaccurate.
