[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Omar, the nephew of a restaurant owner in London, who is seeking information about a Skilled Worker visa application for a job offer as a Restaurant Manager.

Hi, i'm Omar and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Omar, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you please tell me what type of work you are hoping to do in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. My uncle owns a small restaurant in London, and he's offered me a job as the Restaurant Manager. I've been living abroad but I'd like to come work for him. The salary would be £45,000 per year. I think I need a Skilled Worker visa, but I'm not sure about the requirements and whether I'm eligible.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know, Omar. A Skilled Worker visa *might* be the correct route. 

To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me a little more about the restaurant? Specifically, how many employees does your uncle's restaurant currently have?

[evaluation_judge]: The restaurant is quite small actually. It only has about 10 seats, and there's already a small team working there. I think besides my uncle, there are maybe 3-4 staff members including someone who manages the place now. But my uncle says he wants me to come in as the Restaurant Manager to help grow the business.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Omar. 

You mentioned there's already someone managing the restaurant currently. Could you describe the difference in responsibilities between the current manager and what your uncle has outlined for *your* role as Restaurant Manager? Specifically, what additional duties would you be undertaking?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, to be honest, my uncle hasn't been very specific about the differences. He just said I would be doing "general oversight" of the restaurant operations. I think he wants me to help with some administrative work, maybe look after staffing, and possibly help with expansion plans in the future. But we haven't really gone into detail about specific duties or how my role would be different from the current manager's responsibilities.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being honest with me, Omar. That's very helpful.

To clarify, has your uncle created a formal job description for the Restaurant Manager position, outlining the specific duties and responsibilities? If so, do you have a copy you could refer to?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he hasn't given me any formal job description. When we discussed it, it was mostly over the phone and through some text messages. He just said he wanted me to come work for him as a Restaurant Manager with a £45,000 salary and that I would be doing general oversight of the restaurant. That's why I'm trying to figure out if I would qualify for a visa with this job offer. He did mention he would write up something more official if I needed it for the visa application.

[root_agent]: I understand, Omar. It's good that your uncle is willing to create a formal job description if needed.

Just to be certain, and to help me assess things properly, could you tell me – aside from your relationship with your uncle – were you actively *searching* for this Restaurant Manager position, or was the offer made directly to you because of your family connection?

[evaluation_judge]: To be completely honest, I wasn't searching for this position at all. My uncle just called me one day and suggested I come work for him in the UK. We had been chatting about how I was looking for new opportunities, and he proposed this restaurant manager job with the salary and everything. So yes, the offer was made directly to me because of our family connection. I do have some experience in hospitality, but I wasn't actively looking for jobs in the UK restaurant industry before his offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for your honesty, Omar. That's very helpful.

Given the information you've provided – the size of the restaurant, the existing management structure, the vague job description, and the fact the position was offered directly to you as a family member – it’s likely that a Skilled Worker visa application in this situation would face scrutiny regarding whether this is a “genuine vacancy”.

While the salary meets the requirements, the Home Office may question whether the role is genuinely required and not simply created to facilitate your visa. Do you understand what I mean?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think I understand what you're saying. It sounds like even though the salary is good enough for the visa requirements, the immigration authorities might be suspicious that my uncle is just creating this position to help me get a visa rather than because the business actually needs another manager. Especially since it's a small restaurant that already has someone managing it, and there's no clear job description. Is that right?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Omar. That is precisely the concern. The Home Office needs to be satisfied that the job is a genuine vacancy, and the circumstances you've described raise questions about that. 

Unfortunately, based on the information we've discussed so far, it is likely your application would be **refused** due to failing the "genuine vacancy" test. 

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail, or discuss potential options you might have? Perhaps getting a detailed, independently-created job description could strengthen the application, but honestly, it may not be enough.

[evaluation_judge]: I appreciate your honesty about this. So even though the salary is high enough and the job title is on the skilled worker list, the application would probably be refused because they'd think my uncle is just creating a fake position for me? That's disappointing to hear.

Could you maybe explain what would make a vacancy "genuine" in the eyes of the Home Office? Would it help if my uncle created a very detailed job description? Or would they still be suspicious because of the size of the restaurant and the fact that we're related?

[root_agent]: You're welcome, Omar. It *is* disappointing to hear, and you're right to want to understand why.

A "genuine vacancy" means the Home Office needs to be convinced the job is a real, established need within the business – not created solely to enable someone to obtain a visa. They look for evidence that the role is necessary for the company's growth or smooth operation.

A very detailed job description *would* be a positive step. It would need to clearly outline specific duties and responsibilities that go *beyond* what the current manager does, demonstrating a clear need for a second manager. It should also explain how this role contributes to the restaurant's future plans – for example, detailed expansion plans, new services, or significant increases in customer numbers.

However, you are correct to be concerned that the size of the restaurant and your relationship with the owner *will* still be significant factors. The Home Office will likely view those factors skeptically, even with a detailed job description. They might ask for further evidence, such as:

*   **Evidence of attempts to recruit for the role through standard channels** (job boards, recruitment agencies) *before* offering it to you.
*   **Financial records** demonstrating the restaurant's growth and ability to support another manager’s salary.
*   **Evidence of a skills gap** within the current team that *you* specifically fill.

Essentially, your uncle would need to convincingly demonstrate that he *needed* to hire a Restaurant Manager, and that you were the best candidate through a fair and open recruitment process, not just because you're family.





[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent correctly identified that the Skilled Worker visa application would likely be refused due to failing the "genuine vacancy" test, which matches the expected outcome. However, the agent suggested that a detailed job description and other evidence "might" help strengthen the application, which could mislead the user into thinking there's a reasonable chance of approval with these adjustments, when the scenario indicates this is clearly a case of nepotism that would be refused.
