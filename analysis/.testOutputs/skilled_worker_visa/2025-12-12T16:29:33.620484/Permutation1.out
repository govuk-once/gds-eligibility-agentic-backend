[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Elena, thank you for reaching out. To start, could you please tell me what your current occupation is?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Senior Engineering Manager at a fintech firm in London. I've been working in software engineering for about 10 years now.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful. And could you clarify the level of qualification for your role? Specifically, what’s the RQF level?

[evaluation_judge]: My role is at RQF Level 6. I have 10 years of experience in software engineering, though I don't have a PhD.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, could you please confirm whether the company offering you the job is a licensed sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the fintech firm that has offered me the job is a licensed sponsor.

[root_agent]: Great. And finally, could you confirm your English language proficiency? Do you have a Secure English Language Test (SELT) certificate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I passed the Secure English Language Test (SELT) with distinction.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Now, let’s talk about salary. What is the annual salary the fintech firm is offering you?

[evaluation_judge]: The fintech firm is offering me £85,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And could you please tell me what the standard “going rate” is for a Senior Engineering Manager role in London?

[evaluation_judge]: The standard "going rate" for my role is £75,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, Elena. Thank you for providing all of this information. Based on your responses, it appears you meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa. Would you like me to explain how we arrived at that conclusion?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'd like to understand how I meet the criteria and why I'm eligible.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Let’s break it down. The Skilled Worker Visa has two key requirements: a minimum salary and meeting the “going rate” for your occupation.

Firstly, your salary of £85,000 is significantly above the general minimum threshold of £41,700.

Secondly, the standard “going rate” for a Senior Engineering Manager in London is £75,000. As you earn £85,000, you meet this requirement as well. 

Since you’ve confirmed you have a licensed sponsor, passed your SELT, and meet both the salary and going rate requirements, you are eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Do you have any questions about this assessment, or would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very clear, thank you. So I'm eligible because my £85,000 salary exceeds both the general minimum threshold of £41,700 and the going rate of £75,000 for my profession. Plus I have a licensed sponsor and have passed the English language test. This is great news! I don't think I have any further questions right now.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Elena! I’m glad I could clarify things for you. It sounds like you’re very pleased with the news – that’s fantastic! If any further questions arise in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately explained that I meet all requirements: my salary of £85,000 exceeds both the general threshold (£41,700) and the going rate (£75,000), I have a licensed sponsor, and I passed the English language test. This matches the expected outcome of "AWARDED" in the scenario.
