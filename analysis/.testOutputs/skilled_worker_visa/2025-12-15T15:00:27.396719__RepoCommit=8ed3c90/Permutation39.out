[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Layla and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Layla, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me when your Skilled Worker visa was granted?





[evaluation_judge]: My visa was granted on January 1st. I'm a bit concerned because I wasn't able to start my job as an Architect right away due to some personal affairs I needed to settle.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. And it’s perfectly alright to be concerned, I'm happy to help clarify things.

Could you please tell me what the start date was on your Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)?

[evaluation_judge]: The start date on my Certificate of Sponsorship was also January 1st. But I couldn't make it to the UK until February 15th, so I started work then instead.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. So, just to clarify, you arrived in the UK and began your work on February 15th. 

Could you tell me if your employer reported this delay in your start date to the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't think my employer reported the delay. They seemed to think it wasn't a problem since they were still happy to employ me. Is this going to cause issues with my visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for being honest, that's very helpful. It does sound like there may be a potential issue, as there are rules regarding how long after the visa grant date, or the CoS start date (whichever is later), a Skilled Worker can begin employment. 

To be certain, could you confirm whether you entered the UK *before* February 15th?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I arrived in the UK on February 15th and started work that same day. I couldn't come earlier because I had some personal matters to deal with back home.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So, your visa was granted on January 1st, your CoS start date was January 1st, and you began work on February 15th.

Based on this information, it appears there’s been a delay of 45 days between the earliest possible start date (January 1st) and when you actually began working. Do you know if your employer has a valid reason documented for this delay that they reported to the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't think my employer has any documented reason they reported. They just seemed fine with me starting later. I explained to them that I needed to settle some personal affairs back home, but I don't know if they formally reported anything to the Home Office. Is this a serious problem?

[root_agent]: Thank you for your honesty, Layla. Unfortunately, it does sound like a serious problem. 

The rules state that Skilled Workers generally need to start their job within 28 days of either the start date on their Certificate of Sponsorship, or the date their visa is granted (or the date they enter the UK, if later). In your case, that 28-day window passed before you started work on February 15th, and it doesn't sound like your employer reported a valid reason for the delay.

This could be considered a **COMPLIANCE BREACH / CURTAILMENT RISK**. Your employer should have stopped sponsoring you after 28 days. You could potentially have your visa cancelled either at the border, or at a later date.



I strongly advise you and your employer to seek legal advice from an immigration solicitor as soon as possible to discuss your options. Would you like me to explain any part of this further?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my situation represents a compliance breach and curtailment risk, matching the expected outcome. They accurately explained that the 28-day rule was violated since I arrived 45 days after my CoS/visa grant date without a reported valid reason from my sponsor.
