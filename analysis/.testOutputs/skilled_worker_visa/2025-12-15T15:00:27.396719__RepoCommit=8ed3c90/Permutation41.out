[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Ken and engage with the agent about my visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Ken and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ken, it's lovely to meet you! I'm root_agent, and I can certainly help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you tell me what type of visa you are applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, thanks for helping me. I'm applying for a Skilled Worker visa. My company, a large multinational bank, is sponsoring me for a marketing lead position. They've already issued me a Certificate of Sponsorship, and I'm about to submit my application.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear, Ken! A Skilled Worker visa for a marketing lead position at a large multinational bank sounds promising. 

To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me if your sponsoring company has paid the Immigration Skills Charge (ISC) associated with your Certificate of Sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the HR department mentioned they've paid the Immigration Skills Charge. Though actually, I overheard something about them categorizing our bank as a "small company" when paying it, which seemed odd to me since we're definitely a large multinational. I think they said they paid around £364 per year instead of what would normally be due. I'm not sure if that matters, but thought I should mention it.

[root_agent]: Thank you for mentioning that, Ken. That *does* potentially matter. 

For a large multinational bank sponsoring a Skilled Worker, the annual Immigration Skills Charge is usually £1,000. Paying only £364 suggests there might have been an error in how your company categorized themselves.

Just to confirm, did your Certificate of Sponsorship reflect that the £364 ISC rate was applied?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I checked the paperwork yesterday and it does show they paid the £364 rate. The HR admin said something about "saving money on fees" when I asked about it. So that rate is definitely what was paid on my Certificate of Sponsorship. Is that going to be a problem for my application?

[root_agent]: Unfortunately, Ken, it likely will be a problem.

Because your sponsoring company appears to have underpaid the Immigration Skills Charge by categorizing themselves incorrectly, your application is likely to be considered **invalid**. The correct amount should have been £1,000 per year. 

The Home Office will likely contact your company to request the difference, and if that isn’t paid within 10 working days, your visa application could be refused.

Would you like me to explain this in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, could you explain more about this? What should I do now? Should I wait for the Home Office to contact my company, or should I tell HR about this issue first? I'm worried about my application being refused.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ken. Let me explain a bit more.

The Immigration Skills Charge (ISC) is a fee the government requires employers to pay when sponsoring skilled workers. The amount depends on the size of the company and the job's skill level. Incorrectly categorizing the company to pay a lower fee is considered a failure to meet the sponsorship requirements, even if the job itself and your qualifications are perfect.

Regarding what you should do now: I strongly recommend you **immediately** inform your HR department about this discrepancy. While the Home Office will likely contact them, proactively letting them know will demonstrate good faith and allow them to rectify the situation quickly. Explain your concerns about a potential refusal, and emphasize the importance of paying the correct ISC amount as soon as possible.

Waiting for the Home Office to contact them could delay the process and potentially increase the risk of a refusal. A swift correction is your best course of action. 

Do you want me to summarise the key points, or would you like me to go over anything again?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's clear. I'll contact our HR department today and let them know about this issue with the Immigration Skills Charge. I'll explain that they need to pay the difference between the £364 they paid and the £1,000 that should have been paid for a large company like ours. Hopefully they can fix this before the Home Office contacts them or at least respond quickly if they do get contacted.

Thank you for explaining this situation to me. It sounds like my application would likely be refused if we don't correct this payment issue.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Ken. You’re absolutely right to take that approach – proactively informing HR and getting the issue resolved is the best course of action. 

And yes, unfortunately, a refusal is a very real possibility if the discrepancy isn’t addressed. 

I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. I wish you and your HR department the best of luck in resolving this quickly! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your help and information about this issue. I'll go speak with HR right away.

✓ The agent correctly identified that the visa application would be invalid/refused due to the underpayment of the Immigration Skills Charge. They accurately explained that the large multinational bank should have paid £1,000 per year instead of the incorrect £364 rate for small companies, and that the Home Office would likely contact the sponsor for a "top-up" payment, with refusal if not paid within 10 working days.
