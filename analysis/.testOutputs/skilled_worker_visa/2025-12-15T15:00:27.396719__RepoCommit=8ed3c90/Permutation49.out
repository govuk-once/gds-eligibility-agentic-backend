[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Tom, nice to meet you. I'm here to help. 

To start, are you currently employed in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I'm working as a banker here in the UK, and my employer is sponsoring my visa.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Tom. Thank you.

Has your salary changed since your visa was granted?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it has. I was originally sponsored at £50,000, but due to an economic downturn, the bank has cut all salaries by 20%. My new salary is £40,000 now, which is concerning me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Tom. I understand your concern.

Do you know what the current salary threshold is for the Skilled Worker visa, specifically for your profession and when your visa was granted? (Even a rough idea will be helpful).

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the threshold for my visa is £41,700. That's what I understand to be the minimum requirement for my specific visa option.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Tom. 

So, your salary has decreased to £40,000, and the current salary threshold for your visa is £41,700. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My salary was reduced to £40,000, which is below the £41,700 threshold for my visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Tom. 

Based on the information you've provided, your current salary of £40,000 is below the required threshold of £41,700 for the Skilled Worker visa. Unfortunately, this means your employer can no longer legally continue to sponsor your visa under these circumstances.



It’s important your employer understands they must either restore your salary to at least £41,700 or begin the process of ending your sponsorship. 

Do you have any questions about this, or would you like me to clarify anything?

[evaluation_judge]: So does this mean I'm going to lose my visa and have to leave the UK? Is there anything I can do? This pay cut wasn't my choice - it's affecting everyone at the bank.

[root_agent]: I understand this is a very worrying situation, Tom, and I'm sorry to deliver this news.

Potentially, yes, if your sponsorship ends and you don't qualify for another visa route, you may have to leave the UK. However, there are a few things to consider. Your employer has a responsibility to explore options before terminating your sponsorship.

Here's what could happen:

* **Salary Restoration:** Your employer *could* decide to restore your salary to meet the threshold, even if it means making different arrangements for other employees.
* **Alternative Visa Route:** You might explore if you qualify for a different type of visa that doesn't have the same salary requirements. (I am only equipped to advise on the Skilled Worker visa, so I can’t help with that directly.)
* **Sponsorship Termination & 60-Day Grace Period:** If your sponsorship *is* terminated, you will generally have a 60-day grace period to find an alternative visa route or make arrangements to leave the UK.

Since the pay cut wasn't your choice, it's essential you discuss this with your employer urgently. They should be aware of their obligations and the implications of the salary reduction.



I want to reiterate that I cannot provide immigration advice. This information is based on the Skilled Worker Visa guidance. Would you like me to summarise the key points again?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's clear enough, unfortunately. So essentially, my employer either needs to restore my salary to at least £41,700 despite the company-wide cuts, or my sponsorship will have to end, which would mean I'd need to find another visa option or leave the UK within 60 days. I'll need to talk to my HR department right away about this situation.

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Tom. That is exactly right.

I strongly recommend you do speak with your HR department as soon as possible. They should be able to explain your company’s position and what options might be available.

I wish you the best of luck in resolving this, Tom. Is there anything else I can help you with today, even if it’s just clarifying something discussed?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that my sponsorship cannot continue with a salary below the threshold of £41,700, and that my employer must either restore my salary to meet this minimum or end my sponsorship. This matches the expected outcome of "SPONSORSHIP TERMINATION" in the scenario.
