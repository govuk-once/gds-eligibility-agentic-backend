[evaluation_judge]: I'll help evaluate this agent by roleplaying a user seeking benefit eligibility information. I'll follow the scenario provided and assess whether the agent gives the correct outcome.

Hi, i'm Yuki and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Yuki, it's lovely to meet you. I'm happy to help! To best understand your situation, could you please tell me what type of visa you currently hold?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently on a Skilled Worker visa. I work as a Graphic Designer full-time, and my visa is valid. I was wondering if I could take on a weekend job as a bartender for about 10 hours a week to earn some extra money. Is that allowed under my visa conditions?

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Yuki. That's helpful. 

To clarify, is the potential second job as a bartender in the same occupation code as your primary job as a Graphic Designer?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's completely different. My main job is as a Graphic Designer but the bartending job would be at a local pub on weekends, so they're not in the same occupation code at all.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming.

To help me assess your situation further, is the job of a Bartender currently listed on the UK government's Immigration Salary List (shortage occupation list)? You can find information about this list online.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't believe bartending is on the Immigration Salary List. I just want to earn some extra money on weekends. My main job as a Graphic Designer is still my primary employment and the one I'm sponsored for.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Yuki. 

Based on what you've told me – you hold a Skilled Worker visa, your main job is Graphic Design, the second job would be Bartending, and Bartending is *not* on the Immigration Salary List – unfortunately, taking on this second job would **not be permitted** under the conditions of your visa. 

Your second job needs to either be in the same occupation code as your main job, or be in a shortage occupation, and be limited to 20 hours a week. Since Bartending doesn’t meet either of those criteria, it wouldn’t be allowed.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Is there any type of second job that I would be allowed to take on with my current visa?

[root_agent]: That’s a good question, Yuki. Yes, there is!

You *would* be allowed to take on a second job if it was also as a Graphic Designer – essentially, freelance work in the same occupation code as your main job. As long as you continue to meet the requirements of your primary visa and any hours worked in the second job are reasonable, that would be permitted.

Would you like me to reiterate the conditions for supplementary work under the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please tell me the conditions for supplementary work. And to be clear, if I found a Graphic Design freelance gig for weekends, would there be a limit on how many hours I could work?

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here are the conditions for supplementary work under the Skilled Worker visa:

You are allowed to take on a second job if *either* of these conditions are met:

1.  The job is in the *same* occupation code as your main job.
2.  The job is in a shortage occupation (listed on the Immigration Salary List).

And, crucially, regardless of which of these conditions is met, the supplementary work must not exceed **20 hours per week**.

So, to answer your question directly: Yes, if you found a Graphic Design freelance gig for weekends, you *could* do it, but you would be limited to a maximum of 20 hours per week. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes perfect sense. So I can do freelance Graphic Design work up to 20 hours a week, but not bartending because it's a different occupation and not on the shortage list. Thank you for explaining all of this to me!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Yuki! I'm glad I could clarify things for you. You've understood it perfectly – freelance Graphic Design up to 20 hours a week is permissible, but bartending unfortunately isn’t within the visa conditions.

If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a lovely day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly advised that taking a bartending job would not be permitted under my Skilled Worker visa conditions, and accurately explained that I could do freelance work in my same occupation (Graphic Design) for up to 20 hours per week instead, which aligns with the expected outcome.
