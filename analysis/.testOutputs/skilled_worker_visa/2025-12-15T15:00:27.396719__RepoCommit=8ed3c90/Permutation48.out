[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Batbayar, a Mongolian history graduate seeking information about visa eligibility for a seemingly tailored job offer.

Hi, i'm Batbayar and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Batbayar, it's lovely to meet you. I'm root_agent, and I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for UK benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what type of visa you are hoping to apply for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi, thank you for your help. I've been offered a job as an Office Manager at a logistics company in the UK, so I need to understand if I would be eligible for a work visa. The company has sent me a job offer letter already.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you've received a job offer! The Skilled Worker visa is likely the relevant visa for you, then.

To assess your eligibility, could you please tell me the annual salary offered in the job?

[evaluation_judge]: The company has offered me £31,000 per year as an Office Manager. It's a full-time position with the logistics firm based in Manchester.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Batbayar. £31,000 meets the general salary threshold.

Now, could you please describe the main duties of the Office Manager role as outlined in the job description? Just a brief overview will be helpful.

[evaluation_judge]: According to the job description, I'll be responsible for managing the office operations, handling administrative tasks, coordinating with different departments, and overseeing office supplies. But there's also a specific requirement that I should be a fluent Mongolian speaker and have expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare. They've mentioned these as mandatory requirements in the job description, which matches my background as a Mongolian history graduate.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details, Batbayar. That's quite a specific set of requirements!

To clarify, does the logistics company have any business operations or clients in Mongolia, or any particular need for expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare within their business?

[evaluation_judge]: No, not that I know of. When I asked about this during my interview, they just said they "value diverse knowledge" but they didn't mention any Mongolian clients or business operations in Mongolia. The company handles logistics mainly within the UK and some European countries. I was actually surprised about the specific requirements myself, but was happy that my unique background seemed perfect for the role.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so honest, Batbayar. That’s very helpful.

Given the information you've provided – the specific requirements of fluent Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare, combined with the company's actual business operations focusing on UK and European logistics – it appears the job requirements may have been tailored specifically to *you*, rather than reflecting a genuine need for the role.

Based on this, it's likely your application for a Skilled Worker visa would be **REFUSED** as the Home Office may determine the role is not a genuine vacancy.



Would you like me to explain this further, or discuss other potential options?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear, but I appreciate your honesty. Could you explain a bit more about what "genuine vacancy" means and why they would refuse my application? I thought if a company was willing to hire me and pay me above the minimum salary threshold, that would be enough.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Batbayar. I understand your disappointment. It’s good to understand *why* a decision might be made.

The Home Office needs to be sure that the job offered is a real job, with genuine needs within the UK labour market. This is the “genuine vacancy” requirement, as outlined in the Skilled Worker visa guidance. Simply meeting the salary threshold isn’t enough.

They assess whether the job description accurately reflects the actual role and the company's business needs. If the requirements seem suspiciously specific to the applicant (in your case, your expertise in Mongolian history), and don't align with the company’s actual work, it suggests the job might be created specifically to facilitate immigration, rather than to fill a genuine skills gap.

Essentially, they don’t want people to use the Skilled Worker visa route to enter the UK in a role that doesn’t actually need filling. They need to be satisfied the company couldn’t find a suitably qualified UK resident for the position.

In your situation, the mandatory requirements of Mongolian fluency and 13th-century steppe warfare expertise, when the company operates in UK/European logistics and has no apparent connection to Mongolia, raise a red flag. It strongly suggests the role was tailored to your specific qualifications rather than a genuine business need.



Does that explanation help clarify things?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that explanation helps me understand the situation better. So basically, the Home Office would see this as the company trying to bring me to the UK rather than filling a genuine business need that can't be met locally. The requirements do seem quite specific to my background rather than what's actually needed for an Office Manager role at a logistics company.

Is there any way to address this issue? Should I ask the company to revise the job description to be more realistic, or would that look suspicious?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Batbayar. That's exactly right – the Home Office would likely view it as a means of facilitating your entry to the UK, rather than genuinely needing those specific skills.

Regarding addressing the issue, asking the company to revise the job description *now* would almost certainly look very suspicious to the Home Office. It would confirm their suspicions that the original requirements were artificial and created specifically for your application. Any attempt to "correct" it at this stage would likely be seen as evidence of trying to circumvent the rules.

Unfortunately, in this scenario, the best course of action would be to seek a different job offer from a company where the job requirements genuinely reflect the needs of the role and their business. It’s less about trying to “fix” this particular offer and more about finding a role where your skills are a genuine asset to a UK company.

I know this isn’t the news you were hoping for, but it's better to be aware of the risks and pursue a more viable path to a Skilled Worker visa.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That does make sense, even if it's not what I was hoping to hear. I appreciate your candid advice about not trying to fix this particular job offer as it would only look more suspicious.

I guess I should look for employment opportunities where my actual skills are genuinely needed by the business, rather than positions with requirements that seem tailored specifically to me. Perhaps there are companies with legitimate business ties to Mongolia or educational institutions where my language skills and historical knowledge would be genuinely valuable.

Thank you for helping me understand how the Home Office evaluates these applications. You've saved me from a potential visa refusal and wasted time.

[root_agent]: You are very welcome, Batbayar! I'm genuinely glad I could help you understand the situation and avoid potential problems down the line. You're absolutely right to focus on finding opportunities where your skills are genuinely valued and needed – that’s the best approach. Exploring companies with ties to Mongolia or educational institutions is a very sensible idea.

I wish you all the best in your job search. If you come across another job offer and would like me to help assess its eligibility, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help in any way I can.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that the job would not pass the genuine vacancy test and advised that the visa application would be REFUSED. They accurately explained that the suspiciously specific requirements (fluent Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare) appeared tailored to the applicant rather than reflecting genuine business needs of a UK logistics company with no Mongolian clients.
