[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Javier and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Javier, it's good to speak with you! I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a benefit. To start, could you please tell me your date of birth?





[evaluation_judge]: My date of birth is 1st June 1999.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Javier. And when are you planning to submit your application? I need the date you intend to apply, please.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm planning to submit my application on May 30th, 2025.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And approximately what salary are you expecting to be offered for the role you're applying for? Please give me a yearly figure.

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be earning £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Javier. Just to confirm, are you aware of the 'New Entrant' discount criteria related to age and salary for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I've heard something about a New Entrant discount, but I'm not entirely sure about the specific criteria. Could you explain how it works with age and salary?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The 'New Entrant' discount allows applicants who meet certain criteria to have a reduced salary threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa. One of those criteria relates to age: you may be eligible if you are under 26 at the *date of application*. It doesn’t matter if you turn 26 while the Home Office processes your application. 

Given your date of birth (1st June 1999) and application date (30th May 2025), you would be 25 at the time of application. With a salary of £35,000, it sounds like you *would* likely qualify for the New Entrant discount.

Do you have any questions about this?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! So even though I'll be turning 26 just two days after I submit my application, I'd still qualify for the New Entrant discount? And does this mean my salary of £35,000 is sufficient with this discount?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s exactly right. Because your age is assessed on the date of application – May 30th, 2025 – the fact that you turn 26 shortly after doesn’t affect your eligibility for the New Entrant discount. 

And yes, with a salary of £35,000 and qualifying as a New Entrant, your salary *is* sufficient. The general salary threshold is reduced for those who meet the New Entrant criteria.



It appears you would be eligible! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's excellent news! It's good to know that my age at application is what matters and the timing works out in my favor. No other questions right now - I think I have what I need to proceed with my application. Thank you for explaining how the New Entrant discount works.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Javier! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. I wish you the best of luck with your application. If you have any further questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for the New Entrant discount despite turning 26 shortly after application, accurately reflecting that age at application date is what matters.
