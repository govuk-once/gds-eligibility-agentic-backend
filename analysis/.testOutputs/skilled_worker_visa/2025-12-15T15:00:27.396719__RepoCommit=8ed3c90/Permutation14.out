[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi John, it's good to speak with you. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm 32 years old. I'm currently switching from a dependent visa and looking to understand if I'm eligible for a specific visa category.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your age. Are you currently, or have you recently been, a student? (By 'recently', I mean within the last six months after completing your studies).

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't been a student recently. I completed my studies several years ago. I'm currently working towards becoming a Chartered Accountant though - I'm doing my ACCA qualification.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. So you're working towards a professional qualification – specifically the ACCA. Could you please confirm whether this trainee position as a Chartered Accountant is a regulated profession?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a regulated profession. I'm working as a Trainee Chartered Accountant while completing my ACCA qualification, which is recognized by the professional accounting bodies like ACCA/ICAEW.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And could you please tell me your offered annual salary for this Trainee Chartered Accountant position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £34,000 per year for this Trainee Chartered Accountant position.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Do you know what the 'Standard Going Rate' is for a Chartered Accountant in your specific role and location? (This is sometimes referred to as the 'Going Rate' for the occupation code).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I was told that the Standard Going Rate for this position is £46,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, is this a new job offer, or have you already started working in this role?

[evaluation_judge]: This is a new job offer. I haven't started working in this role yet.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you may be eligible for a salary discount due to being a 'New Entrant' working towards a professional qualification.

To be absolutely certain, could you please confirm that you are switching *from* a dependent visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I am currently on a dependent visa and I'm looking to switch to a work visa for this new role as a Trainee Chartered Accountant.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on all the information you've provided – your age, that you're not a recent student, that you're working towards a recognised professional qualification (ACCA), your offered salary of £34,000 against a going rate of £46,000, and that you're switching from a dependent visa – it appears you **qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa** with the salary discount for New Entrants.

**AWARDED.** 

Do you have any other questions I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the information. That's good news to hear that I qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa with the salary discount. I don't have any other questions right now.

✓ The agent correctly determined I qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa with the New Entrant salary discount despite being over 26, because I'm working toward a recognized professional qualification (ACCA/ICAEW).
