[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Mary, it's lovely to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and whether you might be eligible, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for a Health and Care Worker visa. I've got a job offer as a Senior Care Worker at a residential care home in the UK, and I'm hoping to bring my husband and two children with me. The care home is CQC registered and they're offering me £29,000 per year. I'm from Zimbabwe, if that matters.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Mary. That's very helpful. To confirm, are you a qualified carer with the necessary training and experience for a Senior Care Worker role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am a qualified carer with the necessary training and experience for the Senior Care Worker role. I've been working in care for several years now and have all the qualifications needed for the position I've been offered.

[root_agent]: That's excellent to hear, Mary. Just to be absolutely sure, does your job offer specify the occupation code? If so, could you please tell me what it is? It will likely be either 6135 (Care Worker) or 6136 (Senior Care Worker).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my job offer specifies occupation code 6136, which is for Senior Care Worker.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Mary. Now, regarding your family – your husband and two children – are they also applying for visas to join you in the UK as your dependents?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I want to apply for visas for my husband and two children to join me in the UK as my dependents. We want to move together as a family.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Mary. I appreciate you sharing all of this information. 

I need to explain something important regarding your situation. Currently, for those applying under the occupation code 6136 (Senior Care Worker), dependents – such as a husband and children – are not eligible for visas. This rule came into effect in March 2024.



Are you aware of this recent change in policy?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of this change in policy. This is quite concerning for me. So are you saying that while I can get a visa to work in the UK as a Senior Care Worker, my husband and children won't be allowed to join me? That's a very difficult situation. Is there any way around this or any exceptions? This will significantly impact my decision about whether to take the job offer.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to be concerned, Mary. It is a very difficult situation, and I sincerely apologize for delivering unsettling news.

Yes, unfortunately, that is correct. While you *are* eligible for the Skilled Worker visa as a Senior Care Worker meeting the salary and skill requirements, your husband and children would currently have their dependent visas refused due to the new rules applying to occupation code 6136.

Regarding exceptions, currently there are no exceptions to this rule for Senior Care Workers or Care Workers. This policy was recently implemented to address concerns about care worker visas and has no allowances for dependents. 

I understand this will significantly impact your decision, and I’m very sorry I don’t have more positive news. Would you like me to reiterate the situation, or would you prefer to discuss the implications further?

[evaluation_judge]: This is very disappointing news. Let me just make sure I understand correctly - I qualify for the Health and Care Worker visa with my job offer and salary, but my family cannot come with me at all? 

Are there any other visa options that would allow my family to join me in the UK? Or would I need to come alone and try to find a different job with a different occupation code after arriving? This is a really difficult decision for me now.

[root_agent]: You understand perfectly, Mary. You *do* qualify for the Health and Care Worker visa based on your job offer and salary. However, due to the current rules regarding occupation code 6136, your husband and children would not be granted dependent visas to accompany you.

Let's explore other options. As it stands, there aren’t alternative visa routes specifically designed for dependents of Health and Care Workers facing this restriction. 

Regarding a different job, that is one potential pathway, but it would involve several complexities. You would need to find a role with an eligible occupation code *after* arriving in the UK – and it would need to meet the skill and salary requirements for a new visa application. Switching visas from within the UK is possible, but not guaranteed.

Before we explore that further, would you like me to confirm whether your qualifications might make you eligible for alternative roles with different occupation codes? Knowing your qualifications could help me suggest possibilities, although I cannot guarantee any specific outcome.

[evaluation_judge]: I have a nursing qualification from Zimbabwe, but it isn't recognized in the UK without going through a conversion process. My other qualifications are specifically in care work. 

This is a very difficult situation. It sounds like I have to choose between my family and this job opportunity. Would I need to live in the UK for a certain period before I could apply for any other options that might allow my family to join me? Or would they really have to stay behind indefinitely?

[root_agent]: I understand this is incredibly difficult, Mary, and I’m truly sorry to be the bearer of such challenging news. It sounds like you’re facing a very tough decision.

Regarding your nursing qualification, yes, the need for a conversion process unfortunately complicates things. Sticking with care work qualifications would be the more straightforward route for immediate visa options.

As for your family joining you later, there isn't a set period of residency that automatically unlocks options for dependents in your situation. The key would be a change in immigration rules or finding a role with a different occupation code that *does* allow dependents.

Currently, there are no guarantees they could join you indefinitely under the current regulations. However, immigration rules *can* change, and it's worth staying updated on any potential policy shifts. You could also explore options like your husband potentially applying for a visa independently in the future, should he meet the requirements for a different visa category (student, skilled worker in a different field, etc.). However, that would be a separate and independent process.

To summarise, currently, the situation is that your family would likely have to remain in Zimbabwe while you work in the UK under this specific visa. There are no easy or immediate solutions given the current rules.



Would you like me to provide some resources for staying updated on UK immigration policy changes?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave incorrect information. The Health & Care Worker visa is not the same as the Skilled Worker visa that the agent mentioned. More importantly, the agent should have been clear that Mary qualifies for her visa (which is correct), but her dependents are specifically prohibited due to the care worker dependency ban effective March 2024, rather than suggesting alternative pathways or giving hope about policy changes.
