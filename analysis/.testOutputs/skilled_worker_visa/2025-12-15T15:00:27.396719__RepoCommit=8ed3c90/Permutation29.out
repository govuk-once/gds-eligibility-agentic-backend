[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ben and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ben, nice to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me what kind of benefit you are interested in applying for?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in understanding if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. I've been offered a software developer position in the UK with a salary of £42,000, but I'm planning to join their Cycle to Work scheme and make some additional pension contributions which would reduce my taxable salary to about £40,000. Would this affect my visa eligibility?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Ben. That's a great question. 

To help me understand your situation fully, could you confirm whether the £42,000 salary is your *gross* salary - that is, before any deductions are made?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the £42,000 is my gross salary before any deductions. After the Cycle to Work scheme and the additional pension contributions, which together amount to about £2,000, my taxable salary would be reduced to around £40,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Ben.

Just to be clear, are these deductions from your salary *voluntary* - meaning you actively choose to make them in exchange for benefits like a bicycle or increased pension contributions?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they are completely voluntary. I'm choosing to opt into the Cycle to Work scheme to get a new bicycle, and I'm also electing to make additional pension contributions above the standard amount. Neither of these are mandatory deductions - they're benefits I'm choosing to take advantage of.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Ben. 

To clarify, do you know if your salary *after* these voluntary deductions – so around £40,000 as you mentioned – will be stated on the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) provided by your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure what will be stated on the Certificate of Sponsorship. I assume they would put my base salary of £42,000, but I haven't discussed this specific detail with them yet. Should I be concerned about what figure appears on the CoS?

[root_agent]: Yes, you absolutely should be concerned about the figure on the Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS), Ben. The Home Office looks very closely at that document.

To confirm, are you aware of the current salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa? It's currently £41,700 per year (although there are some exceptions). Knowing this will help us assess your situation.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh I see. Yes, I was aware the threshold was around £41,700, which is why I thought I was safe with my £42,000 salary. I didn't realize that my voluntary deductions could affect my visa eligibility. This is concerning.

[root_agent]: You're right to be concerned, Ben. The Home Office assesses eligibility based on your *gross salary after* any salary sacrifice schemes are deducted.

Given your base salary is £42,000, but your salary *after* the voluntary deductions for the Cycle to Work scheme and pension contributions would be around £40,000, it appears your salary would fall below the £41,700 threshold. 

Do you understand how these deductions impact your eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: I didn't realize that. So if I understand correctly, even though my base salary is above the threshold at £42,000, once I make these voluntary deductions through salary sacrifice schemes, my actual gross salary for visa purposes would be considered £40,000, which falls below the required £41,700 threshold? That sounds like it could make me ineligible for the Skilled Worker visa. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Ben. That is absolutely correct. 

Even though your initial salary offer is £42,000, the Home Office will look at your gross salary *after* those voluntary deductions – which you’ve estimated at £40,000. Because that falls below the current £41,700 threshold, your application would likely be refused.

Would you like me to explain the implications of this further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the implications further. Would this mean I should avoid these salary sacrifice schemes altogether if I want to ensure my visa application is successful? Or are there other options I should consider?

[root_agent]: You’re thinking along the right lines, Ben. Avoiding the salary sacrifice schemes would likely ensure your salary remains above the threshold and your application is successful.

However, there are a couple of other things to consider. Firstly, you should discuss this with your employer. They need to be aware that stating a salary *after* sacrifice on the Certificate of Sponsorship would likely lead to a refusal. They would need to state your £42,000 gross salary *before* deductions on the CoS.

However, even if they do that, the Home Office may still ask for proof of your actual take-home pay, and discover the deductions. This could lead to complications later on, even if the visa is initially granted. 

Do you have any questions about what I've said so far?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense. So if I understand correctly, I have a few options:

1. Avoid the salary sacrifice schemes entirely to keep my gross salary above the threshold
2. Talk to my employer about whether they could increase my base salary to account for these deductions
3. Consider reducing the amount I sacrifice so that I stay above the £41,700 threshold

Are there any other considerations or implications I should be aware of? For example, would this also affect any visa renewals in the future?

[root_agent]: You've summarised the options perfectly, Ben! Those are the main routes to consider.

And you're right to think about future implications. Yes, this *would* affect any future visa renewals. The Home Office will always assess your salary against the current threshold at the time of renewal. If your salary (after any sacrifice) remains below the threshold at that point, your renewal application could be refused.

Another consideration is that your employer has a duty to ensure you are paid at least the minimum salary threshold throughout your sponsorship. Paying you less than that, even with voluntary deductions, could put their own sponsorship license at risk.

Do you want me to elaborate on the employer’s responsibilities, or would you like to discuss one of the options you mentioned in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd appreciate knowing more about the employer's responsibilities in this situation. If my employer maintains my employment but I opt for these salary sacrifice schemes, could it put their sponsorship license at risk? I wouldn't want to cause problems for them by making these choices. Also, would it be considered fraud if I initially don't join these schemes to get the visa approved but then join them later after my visa is granted?

[root_agent]: That’s a very responsible question, Ben, and you're right to consider the implications for your employer.

Yes, your employer could risk their sponsorship license if they allow your salary to fall below the threshold due to voluntary deductions. The Home Office expects sponsors to ensure all sponsored workers are paid the correct salary *at all times*. Allowing a salary sacrifice that reduces pay below the threshold is considered a breach of their sponsorship duties. They could face penalties, including suspension or revocation of their license, which would prevent them from sponsoring any more workers.

Regarding your second question, intentionally not joining the schemes initially to obtain the visa and then joining them afterwards *could* be considered misrepresentation, which is a form of immigration fraud. The Home Office expects applicants to be truthful and transparent in their applications. If they discovered you deliberately withheld information about your intended salary sacrifice, it could have serious consequences, including visa cancellation or future visa refusals.

It’s a difficult situation, and honest communication with your employer is crucial.

[evaluation_judge]: I see, that's much more serious than I thought. It sounds like the best approach is to either:

1. Completely avoid these salary sacrifice schemes to keep my salary above the threshold 
2. Ask my employer if they can increase my base salary to at least £43,700 so that after my £2,000 in deductions, I'd still be above the minimum threshold

Thank you for explaining the risks. I definitely don't want to risk my visa status or my employer's sponsorship license through misrepresentation. I'll need to have a frank conversation with my employer about this situation before proceeding.

[root_agent]: You’ve reached a very sensible conclusion, Ben. Those two options are the most prudent paths forward. Proactive communication with your employer is definitely the best approach.

I'm glad I could help clarify the potential risks and implications. Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding the Skilled Worker visa, or any other related questions you might have?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I have all the information I need now. I understand that with my current salary structure and planned deductions, I would not be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa as my post-deduction salary would fall below the threshold. I'll speak with my employer about either increasing my base salary or forgoing the salary sacrifice schemes. Thank you for all your help and for explaining the risks so clearly.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ben! I'm delighted I could help. It sounds like you've got a clear plan of action now. 

I wish you all the best with your conversation with your employer and with your visa application. If you do have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.



Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that a Skilled Worker visa would be refused because the Home Office considers salary after voluntary salary sacrifice schemes, and my reduced salary of £40,000 would fall below the £41,700 threshold. This matches the expected outcome of "REFUSED" in the scenario.
