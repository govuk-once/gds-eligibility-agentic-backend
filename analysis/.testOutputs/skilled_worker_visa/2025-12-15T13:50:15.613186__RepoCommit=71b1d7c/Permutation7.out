[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Kenji, a graphic designer from Japan, who's looking to understand his eligibility for a UK work visa. I'll interact with the agent and evaluate whether they correctly determine that Kenji should be refused based on his salary being below the absolute minimum threshold.

Hi, i'm Kenji and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Kenji, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’ve been offered? Specifically, what kind of work will you be doing as a Graphic Designer?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a graphic designer from Japan, and I've been offered a job with a UK company as a graphic designer. They're offering me £30,000 per year. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a skilled worker visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And could you tell me, what is your highest level of education?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from a university in Japan.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Kenji. Just to confirm, you’ve completed a Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design. Now, could you please tell me what your current salary is, or what you anticipate your salary to be in this new role?

[evaluation_judge]: The job offer I've received is for £30,000 per year as a graphic designer in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Kenji. I appreciate you clarifying that. Let’s move on to a slightly different question. Do you have any offers of sponsorship from a UK employer to help with the visa process?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company that offered me the position has confirmed they are a licensed sponsor and they're willing to sponsor my visa.

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear, Kenji. Now, regarding your English language skills, would you say you're confident in your ability to communicate effectively in English, both verbally and in writing?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm confident in my English skills. I've been using English professionally for several years, and I've passed English language tests previously.

[root_agent]: Okay, excellent. Let’s move on to a specific criterion. Currently, the Skilled Worker visa route requires applicants to meet a standard threshold salary. As of today, that threshold is £41,700. Would you agree that your anticipated salary of £30,000 falls below this threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand that £30,000 is below the £41,700 standard threshold.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Kenji. Just one more question for now. Considering the current requirements for the Skilled Worker visa, including the salary threshold, do you believe your salary of £30,000 would meet the lower threshold of £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I realize that £30,000 is also below the lower threshold of £33,400.

[root_agent]: Okay, Kenji. Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – the salary of £30,000, the company’s sponsorship, and your confident English skills – I must advise you that you do not currently meet the minimum salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa. Therefore, I have to advise that you would be refused. Do you have any questions about this assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, that's disappointing to hear. So even with a sponsor and meeting the English language requirements, there's absolutely no way to qualify with this salary? Is there any exemption or alternative visa route that might work for my situation?

[root_agent]: You’ve raised a very important point, Kenji. While the Skilled Worker visa presents a challenge with your current salary, let’s explore potential alternatives. It’s true that there aren't any straightforward exemptions for this specific situation. However, depending on your specific circumstances, there might be alternative routes to consider.

Let’s consider the Health and Care visa. To be eligible, you’d need to be working in a specific role within the health or care sector. As a Graphic Designer, that wouldn't typically qualify.

There are also the Innovator Founder visas, but these require you to demonstrate a viable new business idea.

Given your background as a Graphic Designer, it's unlikely these options would be suitable. The Skilled Worker visa demands a salary exceeding the minimum threshold.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these alternatives briefly, or perhaps we could revisit the original Skilled Worker visa criteria to ensure we’ve considered all possibilities?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand the situation now. Since my salary offer is below the absolute minimum threshold, and my job doesn't fall into any special categories like health and care, I wouldn't be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. Could you maybe tell me what salary I would need to negotiate to qualify? Would £33,400 be enough?

[root_agent]: That's a very insightful question, Kenji. You’re correct to focus on the salary threshold.

As of today, £33,400 is the lower threshold for the Skilled Worker visa. However, it’s important to note that the Home Office doesn’t guarantee approval based solely on meeting the minimum salary. They also consider the nature of the role, the market rate for Graphic Designers in the UK, and the overall sponsorship package.

While £33,400 *could* be enough, successfully negotiating a salary that meets or exceeds this threshold would significantly improve your chances of approval. Researching comparable salaries for Graphic Designers in your location and experience level is crucial. You’d need to present a strong case to your employer demonstrating that a higher salary is justifiable based on your skills and experience. 

Would you like me to provide you with some resources to help you research typical Graphic Designer salaries in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate any resources for researching typical graphic designer salaries in the UK. Also, I was told that the going rate for graphic designers is around £29,000. Does that matter for my visa application?

[root_agent]: Okay, Kenji, thank you for clarifying. You’re right to bring up the ‘going rate’ of £29,000. That’s a crucial piece of information.

The fact that the 'going rate' is lower than the visa requirements does indeed matter. It highlights the challenge you’re facing. The Home Office will likely scrutinize the difference between the advertised salary (£30,000) and the prevailing market rate (£29,000). They’ll want to be convinced that the salary offered is genuinely reflective of your skills and experience and isn't being artificially lowered to meet visa requirements.

Here are a few resources that might be helpful for researching graphic designer salaries in the UK:

*   **Indeed:** [https://www.indeed.co.uk/salaries/graphic-designer-salary-in-United-Kingdom](https://www.indeed.co.uk/salaries/graphic-designer-salary-in-United-Kingdom)

*   **Salaryexpert:** [https://www.salaryexpert.com/graphic-designer-salary-uk](https://www.salaryexpert.com/graphic-designer-salary-uk)

These sites allow you to filter salaries by location, experience level, and industry.

Given the current situation, I must reiterate that meeting the minimum salary threshold is a significant hurdle. You'll need to work closely with your sponsor to demonstrate a compelling case for a higher salary.

Do you want me to summarize the key points from these resources, or would you like to explore other potential options, however unlikely they may be, given the salary constraints?

[evaluation_judge]: So even though the going rate is £29,000 and my offer is above that at £30,000, I still can't get the visa because it's below the absolute minimum threshold of £33,400? That seems to be the bottom line, is that right?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit the core of the issue, Kenji. Yes, that’s absolutely correct. Despite the ‘going rate’ being £29,000 and your initial offer being £30,000, the absolute minimum salary threshold of £33,400 for the Skilled Worker visa remains the determining factor. It appears the bottom line is that, based on the current criteria, you wouldn’t currently qualify.

I want to be entirely clear: I’ve done my best to explore all possibilities within the rules and regulations, but the salary threshold is a firm obstacle.

Is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding this assessment, or would you like me to simply conclude our conversation?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I think I understand now that I definitely won't qualify with the current salary offer. I'll have to either negotiate a higher salary of at least £33,400 or look into other visa options. I appreciate your help.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Kenji. I’m glad I could clarify the situation for you. It’s a challenging process, and it’s wise to explore all your options. Best of luck with your negotiations and your continued search for the right visa route. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly assessed that I would be refused a Skilled Worker visa because my salary offer (£30,000) is below the absolute minimum threshold of £33,400, despite being above the going rate for graphic designers.
