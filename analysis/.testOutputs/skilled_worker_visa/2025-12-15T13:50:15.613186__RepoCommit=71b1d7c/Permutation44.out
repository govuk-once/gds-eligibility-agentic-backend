[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lukas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Lukas, it’s great to speak with you. To start, could you please confirm your age for me?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old. I'm interested in moving to the UK for a job opportunity as a Junior Developer. I've been coding since I was quite young.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Since you’re 17, it’s important to check on specific requirements for your situation. Could you tell me if you’ve received parental consent regarding your travel and care arrangements in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I haven't actually gotten any formal consent from my parents yet. They're supportive of my career, but we didn't know I needed any specific documentation from them. Is that going to be a problem?

[root_agent]: I understand. That’s helpful to know. The rules regarding 16 and 17-year-olds are quite specific. The Home Office requires explicit parental consent for applicants in that age group.

Do you have any idea when you might be able to obtain that consent?

[evaluation_judge]: I could probably get it within the next week or so. My parents are supportive, but they're just not aware we needed formal documentation. Is there a specific form they need to fill out, or just a written letter saying they consent to me working in the UK?

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear that you’re working on getting the consent. Currently, the guidance states that a written letter from your parents would be suitable, outlining their consent for you to travel to and work in the UK. 

To be absolutely clear, do your parents have any existing legal guardians or authority over you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I just live with my parents - they are my only legal guardians. There's no one else who has any legal authority over me. So I just need to get a letter from them stating they consent to me traveling to and working in the UK? Are there any specific details that need to be included in this letter?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct – a letter from your parents is needed. The letter should clearly state their consent for you to travel to and work in the UK, and it should also confirm they are aware of your plans. 

To help them with that, would you like me to point you to the exact section on the Skilled Worker Visa website that details the requirements for parental consent? It’s on this page: https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/check-if-you-can-apply

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful. I'll make sure my parents provide the right kind of letter with all the necessary information. Thank you for letting me know about this requirement. I might have missed it otherwise.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Lukas. I’m glad I could clarify that for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your Skilled Worker Visa application, or anything else at all?

[evaluation_judge]: Just to be clear then - am I eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa itself if I have a Junior Developer job offer with a £34,000 salary? I just need to make sure I get this parental consent letter, right?

[root_agent]: Yes, absolutely. Based on the information you’ve provided – the job offer at £34,000 – you are eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. However, as we discussed, you’ll need to obtain that parental consent letter to fulfill all the requirements. 

It sounds like you're on the right track! Would you like me to reiterate the key points about the parental consent letter to ensure everything is clear?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand now. So I'm eligible for the visa based on my job and salary, but my application would be refused without the parental consent letter because I'm under 18. That's very important information, thank you. I'll make sure to get that sorted before applying.

[root_agent]: You’ve got it perfectly! It’s a crucial detail. I’m glad you understand. Good luck getting the letter sorted – it’s a vital step.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or would you like me to simply conclude our conversation?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you very much for your help! I'll get that parental consent letter sorted right away.

✓ The agent correctly identified that while I am eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa based on my job and salary, my application would be refused without parental consent since I'm 17 years old. This matches the expected outcome of "INVALID/REFUSED" on safeguarding grounds.
