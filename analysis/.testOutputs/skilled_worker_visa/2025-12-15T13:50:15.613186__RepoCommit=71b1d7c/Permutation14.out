[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, John. It’s good to speak with you. To start, are you under 26 years old, or have you recently been a student?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm 32 years old and I haven't been a student recently.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, John. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently working towards a recognized professional qualification, such as a Chartered Accountancy qualification?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I'm training to become a Chartered Accountant. I'm working towards my ACCA qualification.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news, John! It sounds like you’re on a great path. To confirm, you’re actively studying for your ACCA qualification, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. I'm actively studying for my ACCA qualification as part of my role as a Trainee Chartered Accountant.

[root_agent]: Okay, John. Thank you for confirming. Given that you’re over 26, not a recent student, and working towards a recognized professional qualification, does this qualify you as a “New Entrant” under the Skilled Worker Visa rules?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure about the visa rules to be honest. I'm currently on a dependent visa and have been offered this trainee role. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa with my job offer.

[root_agent]: I understand. Let’s focus on the qualification then. Could you tell me which professional body you’re studying with – is it, for example, the ICAEW or ACCA?

[evaluation_judge]: It's the ACCA. I'll be studying with them while working in this trainee role.

[root_agent]: Thank you, John. That’s very helpful. Now, considering you’re studying for the ACCA qualification while working as a Trainee Chartered Accountant, does that grant you “New Entrant” status for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe it does from what my potential employer told me, but I'm not entirely sure how that works with the visa requirements. That's why I'm trying to find out more information.

[root_agent]: Okay, John. Let’s clarify something. Regarding the salary, what is the annual salary you’re being offered for this Trainee Chartered Accountant role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £34,000 per year for the trainee role.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, if we look at the Skilled Worker Visa requirements, what is considered the “Standard Going Rate” for a Trainee Chartered Accountant role, according to the official guidance?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure exactly, but I believe my employer mentioned the standard going rate was around £46,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, John. Let me quickly calculate that for you. Is £34,000 greater than 70% of £46,000?

[evaluation_judge]: I think so, but I'm not exactly sure of the calculation. If you could work it out for me, that would be helpful.

[root_agent]: Certainly. 70% of £46,000 is £32,200. Since £34,000 is greater than £32,200, yes, it does meet the threshold. Based on your age, not being a recent student, and qualifying as a New Entrant due to your ACCA studies and salary, you appear to be eligible for the salary discount under the Skilled Worker Visa.

**AWARDED.** Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this assessment, or perhaps provide some further information about the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I'm eligible for the Skilled Worker visa as a New Entrant due to my professional qualification training, despite being over 26, with my salary meeting the 70% threshold requirement.
