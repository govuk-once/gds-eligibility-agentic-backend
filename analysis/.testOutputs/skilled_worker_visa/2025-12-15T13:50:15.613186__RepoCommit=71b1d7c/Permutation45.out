[evaluation_judge]: I'll assume the role of Hans, a German engineer with a Master's degree from a German university, taught in English. I'll interact with the benefits eligibility agent to see if they correctly identify that my proof of English language proficiency doesn't meet the requirements.

Hi, i'm Hans and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Hans, it’s nice to meet you. To help me assess your situation, could you tell me the name of your university?

[evaluation_judge]: I studied at the Technical University of Munich in Germany. I completed my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering there.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you Hans. Just to confirm, your Master’s degree was from the Technical University of Munich in Germany, and it was in Mechanical Engineering, correct? And could you tell me, was the degree taught entirely in English?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My Master's degree was in Mechanical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich. The entire program was taught 100% in English. I have a letter from the university confirming that the program was delivered entirely in English.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Hans. I see you have a letter confirming the program was taught entirely in English. To ensure we’re covering all the bases, could you tell me if you’ve had your degree verified by Ecctis?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't had my degree verified by Ecctis. I just have my original degree certificate and the letter from the university confirming it was taught in English. I thought that would be sufficient since it clearly states the program was 100% in English.

[root_agent]: Okay, Hans. I appreciate you explaining that. Let me quickly check the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa. Regarding degrees from overseas, it’s not enough for the university to simply state the program was taught in English.  It needs to be verified by Ecctis with two statements – one for qualification comparability and one for English Language Proficiency.

Would you be willing to pay for Ecctis to verify your degree, so we can confirm that you meet the English Language requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I wasn't aware that I needed Ecctis verification. I thought the university letter would be enough since it confirms the program was in English. Is this Ecctis verification really necessary? How much would it cost and how long would it take to get this verification?

[root_agent]: You are right to question that, Hans. It’s understandable to assume a letter confirming the language of instruction would be sufficient. However, the Home Office requires Ecctis verification for degrees taught outside the UK, regardless of whether they were taught in English. 

Ecctis verification is necessary to ensure the standard of your qualification is comparable to a UK degree. 

Currently, Ecctis charges £190 for verification. It typically takes 5-7 working days to receive the verification statement once the application has been submitted. 

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the Ecctis website where you can find more detailed information about the process and how to apply? [https://www.ecctis.org/](https://www.ecctis.org/)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful to have the link. I'm a bit surprised that my university letter isn't enough proof. So just to be clear, without this Ecctis verification of both my qualification and my English language proficiency, my application would be refused? Even though I have official documentation from my university?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Hans. Without the Ecctis verification – specifically the English Language Proficiency statement – your application would be refused. The Home Office needs to be confident that you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa, and relying solely on a university letter doesn’t provide that assurance. 

It’s understandable to be surprised, but this is a strict requirement to ensure the quality and comparability of qualifications. 

Do you want me to reiterate the key points about Ecctis and the reasons for the requirement, or would you like me to help you start the application process on the Ecctis website?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. It's frustrating that my university documentation isn't sufficient on its own, but I appreciate you explaining the requirements clearly. So I would need both the qualification comparability statement and the English Language Proficiency statement from Ecctis, otherwise my application would be refused?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s perfectly right, Hans. You would indeed need both the qualification comparability statement and the English Language Proficiency statement from Ecctis for your application to be considered. 

It’s good that you understand the process now. Would you like me to guide you through the steps of applying to Ecctis, or would you prefer to explore the Ecctis website yourself using the link I previously provided?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent did not correctly address my situation. While they correctly identified that I need Ecctis verification, they appeared to be discussing a Skilled Worker Visa application rather than benefit eligibility, which was the context of my inquiry. The agent shifted the conversation toward immigration requirements without first clarifying what specific benefit I was inquiring about.
