[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Wei, it’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about the specific type of work you’ll be doing as a Physicist? Specifically, what occupation code does your job fall under?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a physicist from China and I've been offered a Postdoctoral Researcher position at a UK university. The occupation code for my role is 2114. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with this job offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Wei. That’s very helpful. Now, could you please tell me what salary you’ve been offered for this Postdoctoral Researcher position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £33,500 per year for this postdoctoral researcher position.

[root_agent]: Okay, £33,500 per year. And could you tell me what the standard going rate is for a physicist with this type of role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: The standard going rate for my role as a Physicist in the UK is £46,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Wei. Just to confirm, the standard going rate for a physicist role is £46,000 per year, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The standard going rate for my physicist role is £46,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Finally, could you confirm whether you or your employer will be able to provide sponsorship for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a valid sponsor. The university offering me the position is authorized to sponsor Skilled Worker visas.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic news, Wei! Thank you for confirming that. Based on this information – your occupation code (2114), salary (£33,500), the standard going rate (£46,000), and the fact that you have a valid sponsor – it appears you do indeed meet the criteria for a Skilled Worker Visa. 

Would you like me to elaborate on how this meets the requirements, or would you like to explore anything further about the visa process?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please elaborate on how I meet the requirements? I'm particularly curious about the salary requirements since my offer (£33,500) is below the standard going rate of £46,000. Does my role as a postdoctoral researcher qualify for any special considerations?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Wei. Let’s break down how you meet the requirements.

The Skilled Worker Visa has two key salary thresholds: a Lower General Threshold of £33,400, and a discounted Going Rate Threshold. The Going Rate is based on the standard for a particular job, and it’s calculated at 70% of that rate.

In your case, the standard going rate for a physicist is £46,000. 70% of that is £32,200. Your salary of £33,500 is *above* both thresholds.

Furthermore, postdoctoral research roles like yours often qualify for a discount. This discount recognises the specialist skills and often the lower pay associated with this type of research position. 

Therefore, you meet the salary requirements through both the Lower General Threshold and the discounted Going Rate.

Does that clarification help you understand how you meet the criteria?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that clarification is very helpful! So if I understand correctly, my salary of £33,500 meets both requirements: it's above the Lower General Threshold of £33,400 and also above 70% of the standard going rate (£32,200). And this discount applies specifically because I'm in a postdoctoral research position as a physicist. So based on this, I'm eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: Absolutely correct, Wei! You’ve summarised it perfectly. Your salary of £33,500 satisfies both the Lower General Threshold and the discounted Going Rate, and the discount is indeed specific to eligible postdoctoral research positions.

Based on all the information you’ve provided, I can confirm that you are eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. Congratulations!

Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding the visa application process, or perhaps information about other potential benefits you might be interested in?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately explained that my role as a postdoctoral researcher qualifies for the discount, and that my salary meets both the Lower General Threshold (£33,400) and the discounted Going Rate (70% of £46,000, which is £32,200).
