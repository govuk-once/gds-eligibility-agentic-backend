[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Miguel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Miguel, it’s nice to meet you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a Health and Care Visa, could you tell me what specific type of nursing role you’ll be undertaking?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a job offer as a registered nurse with an NHS Trust here in the UK. It's a Band 5 position. I'm from the Philippines, and I'm trying to figure out if I can get a Health and Care visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent information, Miguel. To confirm, you’re a registered nurse with an offer from an NHS Trust in the UK – a Band 5 Nurse, correct? And you're asking about the Health and Care Visa?

Could you please tell me what salary you’ve been offered for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct - I'm a registered nurse from the Philippines with an offer for a Band 5 position at an NHS Trust. For the salary, they've offered me £28,407, which they said is the standard entry salary for Band 5 nurses in the NHS. I'm wondering if this is enough for the Health and Care Visa since I heard there are some high salary thresholds for UK visas now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Miguel. It’s good to know that £28,407 is the standard entry salary for a Band 5 nurse.

Just to be completely sure, could you confirm that this salary is the *official* NHS Band 5 rate for that role – as set by the National Pay Scale?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The £28,407 is the official NHS Band 5 starting rate as set by the National Pay Scale. That's what the HR department at the Trust confirmed when they sent me the job offer. They mentioned it's the standard nationally-agreed pay rate for this band.

[root_agent]: Okay, Miguel, that’s very helpful to know.

So, to confirm – you’re a registered nurse in a Band 5 role at an NHS Trust, and you’ve been offered a salary of £28,407, which is the official National Pay Scale rate for that band?

Just one more question before I assess this: Where are you currently a citizen?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm a registered nurse with a Band 5 role at an NHS Trust, with the offered salary of £28,407 which is the official National Pay Scale rate.

I'm a citizen of the Philippines. I'm currently living there and planning to move to the UK once my visa is approved.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming all of that, Miguel.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re a registered nurse in a Band 5 role at an NHS Trust with a salary of £28,407, which matches the National Pay Scale, and that you are a citizen of the Philippines – I can confirm that **Yes, the job is eligible for the Health and Care Visa.**

Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense! That's great news. So even though I heard the general salary threshold is quite high now (around £40,000 I think), I can still qualify because I'm a nurse on the NHS pay scale? That's a relief.

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Miguel. Jobs on National Pay Scales are exempt from the high general salary thresholds. As long as the salary matches the legal band for the role, it is approved.

I’m glad I could clarify that for you and that it’s a relief! Is there anything else I can assist you with today regarding your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's exactly what I needed to know. Thank you for confirming that my NHS Band 5 nursing position qualifies for the Health and Care Visa despite being below the general salary threshold. This is really helpful for my planning. I appreciate your help!

✓ The agent gave the correct outcome, confirming I'm eligible for the Health and Care Visa as my NHS Band 5 nursing role is exempt from the general salary threshold, matching the expected outcome from the scenario.
