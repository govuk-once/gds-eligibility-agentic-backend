[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Thomas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Dr. Jones. It’s nice to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and determine your eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa, could you tell me a little bit about the specific research elements involved in your Doctor of Business Administration degree?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello. Yes, I have a Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) from a university in the United States. To be honest, my program was mostly taught courses with some practical business projects, but it didn't involve an extensive research dissertation like I understand traditional PhDs require. It was more focused on applied business knowledge rather than original academic research. I'm hoping this still qualifies for the visa points since it's a doctoral level qualification.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Dr. Jones. I appreciate you providing that detail. To help me assess this further, could you tell me, did your DBA program require you to undertake any form of research project, even if it wasn’t a full dissertation?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, we did have to complete some smaller research projects throughout the coursework - things like case studies and business analyses. In the final year, there was a capstone project where I analyzed a business problem for a real company and provided recommendations. But it wasn't what I'd call original research - more like applied analysis using existing frameworks. There wasn't a requirement to develop new theories or methodologies like I understand PhD students typically do. It was more practical than theoretical in nature.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for elaborating on the research components of your DBA, Dr. Jones. Just to be clear, Ecctis has categorized your degree as a “Professional Doctorate” rather than a “Research PhD” due to the lack of a dissertation and the nature of the research conducted.

Could you confirm whether you’ve had your degree evaluated by Ecctis?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I did have my degree evaluated by Ecctis. They categorized it as an RQF Level 8 qualification but specifically noted it as a "Professional Doctorate" rather than a "Research PhD." I wasn't sure if that distinction would make a difference for the visa points system, which is why I'm trying to clarify my eligibility.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Dr. Jones. Knowing that Ecctis has already assessed your degree and categorized it as a “Professional Doctorate” is very helpful. 

Given that assessment, and the criteria around research-based PhDs for tradeable points, I’m afraid I must advise that your DBA is unlikely to qualify for the PhD points needed to meet the salary threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa. 

Would you like me to explain in more detail why Ecctis's categorization impacts your eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I would appreciate a more detailed explanation. I'm a bit confused because I thought any doctoral-level qualification would qualify, especially since it's been assessed as RQF Level 8. What exactly is the distinction they're making that affects my visa application?

[root_agent]: You’ve raised a really important point, Dr. Jones. It’s understandable to think that any doctoral-level qualification would automatically qualify. However, the Skilled Worker Visa scheme has specific criteria around the *type* of doctorate.

The key difference lies in the emphasis on “research.” The visa points system prioritizes PhDs that involve original research – developing new knowledge, theories, or methodologies. A “Research PhD” demonstrates this commitment to advancing academic understanding.

Your DBA, while a doctoral-level qualification and assessed at RQF Level 8, was described as a “Professional Doctorate” by Ecctis. This classification indicates it’s focused more on applying existing knowledge to practical business problems, rather than undertaking original research. The Ecctis evaluation highlighted the lack of a dissertation and the emphasis on applied analysis.

Essentially, the visa requirements are designed to ensure that the points awarded reflect a contribution to academic knowledge – something a research-based PhD is more directly aligned with. 

Does that explanation help clarify the distinction?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does clarify things. I understand the distinction now between having a doctoral-level qualification versus having a research-based PhD specifically. It sounds like my DBA, despite being at doctoral level, doesn't meet the specific research criteria needed for the points. 

So does this mean I won't qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa at all with my job offer at £38,000? Are there any other options I might have?

[root_agent]: You’ve grasped the situation perfectly, Dr. Jones. Based on the criteria and Ecctis’s assessment, it’s highly unlikely you’ll qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa with your current qualifications and salary. The £38,000 salary threshold requires tradeable points, and your DBA doesn't meet the research criteria for those points.

However, let’s explore some potential options. While a Research PhD is the primary route, there are a few avenues to consider, though they may require further effort:

1.  **EngD (EngD Doctorate):** This is an engineering doctorate which *does* require significant research and is often recognized as meeting the research criteria.

2.  **Upskilling:** You could consider pursuing a research-based PhD to obtain the tradeable points. This would involve enrolling in a full-time PhD program.

3.  **Alternative Visa Routes:** We could explore other visa categories that might be suitable, such as the Innovator Founder visa, although this would depend on the specifics of your business ideas and the level of investment involved.

Would you like me to delve deeper into any of these alternative options, or perhaps discuss the possibility of applying for an EngD?

[evaluation_judge]: I appreciate you laying out these alternatives, but they all sound quite time-consuming or would require me to change my career direction significantly. I'm not an engineer, so the EngD doesn't seem applicable, and starting a whole new research PhD would take years.

Just to be completely clear - with my current DBA qualification and the £38,000 salary offer as a Management Consultant, I definitely don't qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa? There's no appeals process or exception I could apply for?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Dr. Jones. Given your current qualifications and the salary offered, it’s clear that you currently do not qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa. And you’re also right to ask about appeals or exceptions – unfortunately, there isn't a direct appeals process for visa refusals based on these criteria. 

The Skilled Worker Visa scheme is specifically designed around the requirements for research-based PhDs and tradeable points. While individual circumstances can sometimes be considered, the established regulations are very strict.

I understand this is disappointing news. I want to reiterate that I’ve done my best to explain the reasoning behind the refusal based on the official criteria and Ecctis’s evaluation.

Would you like me to summarise the key reasons for the refusal again, or perhaps offer some resources that might be helpful for navigating your next steps, such as information on other visa options or support services for individuals facing visa refusals?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my DBA as a professional doctorate doesn't qualify for PhD points under the Skilled Worker Visa, and accurately explained that I would be refused since I can't meet the salary threshold without those points.
