[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Wei, it’s good to speak with you. Thanks for reaching out. To start, could you please confirm your age for me?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 25 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And to clarify, you mentioned you previously worked in the UK on a “Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee” visa, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I worked in the UK for 3 years on a Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. And just to be clear, you’re now being offered a position as a Senior Analyst with a salary of £34,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I've been offered a position as a Senior Analyst with a salary of £34,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, Wei. Considering you’ve worked in the UK for 3 years on a Global Business Mobility visa, would you say you’re primarily concerned about qualifying for the “New Entrant” route?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I think I should qualify as a New Entrant since I'm under 26 years old. I'm hoping to use that status for my new job offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just to confirm, you’ve been under 26 for the majority of your time working in the UK, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently 25, and I've been under 26 for my entire time working in the UK on the Global Business Mobility visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to hear. Now, let's delve a little deeper. Can you tell me how long you’ve actually spent on a “Tier 2” or “Skilled Worker” visa during your time in the UK, besides the Global Business Mobility visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I haven't had any other visas. I've only been on the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa for the 3 years I've spent working in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Wei. Just one more question before we assess this: During those 3 years on the Global Business Mobility visa, did you at any point work in the UK under a “Tier 2” or “Skilled Worker” visa?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I've only ever been on the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa for my entire 3-year work period in the UK. I haven't held any other type of visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, Wei. Thank you for providing that information. Based on your previous time on a Global Business Mobility visa and not having held any other visas, it appears you have exhausted your eligibility for the “New Entrant” route. Specifically, the criteria includes time spent on “Tier 2” or “Skilled Worker” visas, and you haven’t held those during your 3 years.

Therefore, I must advise that you won’t be eligible for a standard 3 or 5-year visa with the New Entrant salary discount. Would you like me to explain the reasoning behind this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I'm a bit confused. I thought being under 26 years old qualified me as a New Entrant regardless of my previous visa history. Could you explain why my Global Business Mobility visa affects my New Entrant status?

[root_agent]: Certainly. You’re right to question that – it can be a bit confusing. The “New Entrant” route has a specific limit of a maximum of 4 years of qualifying time. This 4-year limit includes *all* time spent on qualifying visas, such as “Tier 2” or “Skilled Worker” visas, *and* your Global Business Mobility visa.

Because you’ve spent 3 years on the Global Business Mobility visa, that reduces your remaining eligible time for the New Entrant route. You’re currently under 26, but you’ve already used a significant portion of your allowed qualifying time.

Does that explanation help clarify why your previous visa history affects your eligibility for the New Entrant route?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so it's not just about being under 26 - there's also a 4-year time limit that includes time spent on Global Business Mobility visas. Since I've already used 3 years on my Global Business Mobility visa, that means I only have 1 year remaining as a New Entrant. And if my sponsor is requesting a standard 3-year visa with the New Entrant salary discount, that wouldn't work because I don't have enough New Entrant time left. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Wei. You’ve grasped the situation perfectly. If your sponsor were to request a 3-year visa with the New Entrant discount, it would indeed be unsuccessful because you only have one year remaining of qualifying time.

Given this, I must advise that you cannot be granted a standard 3 or 5-year visa with the New Entrant salary discount.

Do you have any other questions about this, or would you like me to explore other visa options that might be suitable for you?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave incorrect information. The criteria stated that the "New Entrant" 4-year max limit includes time spent on "Global Business Mobility" visas, but the agent first claimed Wei was ineligible because he hadn't held Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visas, then later correctly stated that his GBM visa time counted against the 4-year limit. The expected outcome of REFUSED was ultimately communicated, but the initial explanation was contradictory and incorrect.
