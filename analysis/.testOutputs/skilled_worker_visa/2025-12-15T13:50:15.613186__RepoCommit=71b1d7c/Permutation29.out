[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Ben, a software developer looking into eligibility for a benefit.

Hi, i'm Ben and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Ben, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what your current gross salary is before any deductions?

[evaluation_judge]: My gross salary is £42,000. I work as a Software Developer.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And are you currently enrolled in any salary sacrifice schemes, such as Cycle to Work or pension contributions?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, actually I just signed up for a Cycle to Work scheme and also made additional pension contributions. Together they reduce my salary by about £2,000.

[root_agent]: Alright, Ben. Thank you for clarifying that. Just to confirm, your gross salary is £42,000, and you've had £2,000 deducted for the Cycle to Work scheme and pension contributions, leaving you with a revised taxable salary of £40,000, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. My base salary is £42,000, but with the £2,000 in salary sacrifice arrangements, my taxable salary is now £40,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Ben. Just one more quick question – are you currently employed by a company that sponsors Skilled Worker visas?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I'm currently working in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa which my company sponsors.

[root_agent]: Okay, Ben. Thank you for providing all of that information. Based on your revised taxable salary of £40,000 after the salary sacrifice deductions, I must advise that you are not eligible for this particular benefit. The threshold is £41,700.

Do you have any questions about this outcome?

[evaluation_judge]: Why does it matter that my salary after deductions is below the threshold? I thought they would only care about my base salary, which is above the threshold at £42,000.

[root_agent]: That’s a really important question, Ben, and it’s understandable why you’d think that. The Home Office doesn’t just look at your base salary. They’re interested in what you *actually* pay income tax on.

Salary sacrifice schemes, like the Cycle to Work and pension contributions you’ve mentioned, reduce your taxable income. They effectively lower the amount of income tax and National Insurance Contributions you pay.

So, the threshold – £41,700 – is the amount you earn *after* those deductions. It’s the amount that determines if your sponsorship is compliant and if you’re eligible for the Skilled Worker visa.

Does that explanation make more sense now?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So even though my contract says £42,000, because I'm only being taxed on £40,000 after these voluntary deductions, I'm actually below the threshold for my visa. That's concerning - does that mean there's an issue with my current visa status?

[root_agent]: You’ve grasped the key point perfectly, Ben. Yes, your contract stating £42,000 is irrelevant in this situation. It’s the *taxable* income that matters.

And you're right to be concerned. If your salary after deductions is below the £41,700 threshold, it could indeed create a compliance breach. This could potentially lead to issues with your current visa status, although it doesn't automatically mean it will be refused. 

It’s best to discuss this directly with your sponsor – your employer – to understand how they intend to address the situation. They may need to adjust your salary arrangements.

Would you like me to suggest any resources for you to review regarding sponsor responsibilities when it comes to salary thresholds?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information. The scenario clearly indicates that if salary after sacrifice falls below the threshold (which mine has), the visa should be REFUSED or considered a compliance breach. The agent correctly identified that my salary after sacrifice (£40,000) falls below the threshold (£41,700), but then stated "it doesn't automatically mean it will be refused" which contradicts the expected outcome in the scenario.
