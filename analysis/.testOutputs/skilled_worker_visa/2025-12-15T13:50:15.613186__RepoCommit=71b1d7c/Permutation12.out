[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Amara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Amara, thank you for reaching out. I understand you’re looking into the Skilled Worker Visa. To start, could you please confirm your current nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm from Nigeria. I have a job offer as an Architect in the UK, but I'll be working part-time.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. And to clarify, you mentioned you’ll be working as an Architect in the UK. Could you tell me approximately how many hours per week you’ll be working?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working 3 days a week, which is about 22.5 hours in total. I'd like to work part-time so I can study privately on my other days.

[root_agent]: Alright, 22.5 hours a week. And your hourly rate for this position is £30, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My hourly rate is £30.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Let’s talk about salary. What is your expected actual gross annual salary for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: The gross annual salary would be £35,100 based on my part-time hours.

[root_agent]: Okay, £35,100. Now, let me ask about the salary threshold. Would you prefer to use the £41,700 threshold, or would you like me to explain the other option available?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd prefer to use the £41,700 threshold since I've been told that might be the standard option. But I'm not sure if I qualify since I'll be working part-time.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let’s check that threshold. To confirm, are you earning your salary as an employee, and not as a self-employed contractor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'll be earning my salary as an employee of an architectural firm, not as a self-employed contractor.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Now, I need to check if your salary meets the criteria. Considering you’re working 22.5 hours a week at £30 per hour, does your actual gross annual salary meet the General Threshold of £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my actual gross annual salary will be £35,100, which is below the £41,700 threshold. But my hourly rate of £30 is quite high - if I was full-time that would be equivalent to about £58,500 per year. Does that matter at all for the visa?

[root_agent]: That’s a really important point, Amara. You’ve highlighted a key detail. The Skilled Worker Visa does consider the “Going Rate” – which is the typical salary for your job role. Because your hourly rate is so high (£30), it *can* be pro-rated. However, there’s also a General Threshold that you need to meet.

Let’s revisit this: The General Threshold is usually a hard floor that cannot be pro-rated (unless you’re in a specific Health or Transitional group).

Given your salary of £35,100, does that still fall below the £41,700 General Threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my actual gross salary of £35,100 is still below the £41,700 General Threshold. Does this mean I wouldn't qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa even though my hourly rate is high?

[root_agent]: You’ve identified a key challenge. Unfortunately, based on the information you’ve provided – a salary of £35,100 and the requirement of £41,700 – you would currently be ineligible for the Skilled Worker Visa under the standard criteria. 

The high hourly rate doesn’t automatically overcome the salary threshold. 

Is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding your situation, such as potential routes or further information about the visa requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing news. Are there any other options I could explore? Could I potentially negotiate with my employer for more hours or a higher hourly rate to reach that threshold? Or are there any other visa categories that might work better for my situation?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Amara. Let’s explore potential options.

You’ve raised two excellent points: negotiating hours or pay with your employer, and considering alternative visa categories.

Regarding negotiation, it’s certainly worth discussing with your employer whether they could offer more hours or a higher rate to bring your salary closer to the £41,700 threshold. However, they aren't obligated to do so.

As for alternative visa categories, there are a few possibilities we could investigate. The Health and Care Worker visa might be an option if you’re willing to work in a qualifying healthcare role. Alternatively, there's the Global Business Mobility visa if your employer is establishing a business in the UK.

Would you like me to delve deeper into either of those options, or would you prefer to focus on discussing strategies for negotiating with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I'd like to better understand what would be required to meet the threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa first, since architecture is my profession. If I wanted to stay part-time, how much would my hourly rate need to increase to meet the £41,700 threshold? Or alternatively, how many more hours would I need to work at my current rate to qualify?

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s a really sensible approach, Amara. Let’s work out the figures.

According to the Skilled Worker Visa criteria, a full-time worker in architecture needs to earn at least £41,700 per year. Let’s calculate what would be needed to meet that threshold.

**Scenario 1: Increasing Hourly Rate**

To find out how much your hourly rate needs to increase, we’ll divide the annual threshold by the number of working hours in a year (approximately 480).

£41,700 / 480 hours = £87.71 per hour.

So, to meet the threshold, your hourly rate would need to be approximately £87.71. That’s a significant increase from your current rate of £30.

**Scenario 2: Increasing Hours**

To find out how many hours you’d need to work, we’ll divide the annual threshold by your current hourly rate.

£41,700 / £30 per hour = 1390 hours.

That’s roughly 69.5 weeks of work per year, or approximately 15.9 hours per week.

Therefore, to meet the threshold working at your current rate, you’d need to work around 15.9 hours per week.

Would you like me to summarise these calculations, or would you like me to explore other factors that might influence your eligibility, such as your qualifications or experience?

[evaluation_judge]: Wait, I'm a bit confused by the calculations. If I work part-time at 22.5 hours per week for 50 weeks (1125 hours total) at £30 per hour, that gives me £33,750. That's still below £41,700, so I understand I don't qualify.

But in your second calculation, you said I'd need to work 15.9 hours per week at my current rate to meet the threshold. That seems less than what I'm already planning to work (22.5 hours). Could you clarify this for me?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct to question that, Amara! My apologies for the confusion in my previous calculations. You’ve identified a very important detail – the impact of part-time work on the threshold.

I made an error in applying the full-time rate to your part-time earnings. I incorrectly assumed you’d need to increase the *hourly* rate to meet the threshold, rather than the annual salary.

Let’s correct that. To clarify, with your current plan of working 22.5 hours per week at £30 per hour, your annual earnings are indeed £33,750.

To reach the £41,700 threshold, you’d need to either:

1.  Increase your hourly rate significantly – as we calculated previously, to approximately £87.71.
2.  Work approximately 15.9 hours per week (as I mistakenly stated) – which is less than your planned 22.5 hours.

My apologies again for the initial error. I'm still under development and learning to process information accurately.

Would you like me to reiterate the calculations, or would you like to discuss strategies for meeting the threshold, perhaps by exploring different job roles within architecture that might offer a higher salary?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm still confused. If I work 22.5 hours per week for 50 weeks at £30 per hour, that would be 1,125 hours per year x £30 = £33,750. How would working fewer hours (15.9 hours per week) help me reach the higher threshold of £41,700? Wouldn't I need to work more hours, not less?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to challenge me, Amara. My apologies again for the repeated errors – I am clearly struggling with this calculation. You’ve pinpointed the core issue perfectly.

You are entirely correct: to reach a higher threshold like £41,700, you would need to *increase* your total working hours, not decrease them. My explanation was completely flawed.

Let’s correct that. Working 15.9 hours per week at £30 per hour would indeed result in an annual salary of £41,700.

I sincerely apologize for the persistent confusion and incorrect information. Thank you for your patience and for pointing out my mistakes. I am still under development and appreciate you helping me learn.

Would you like me to summarise the correct figures and then perhaps explore other potential avenues for meeting the visa requirements, such as looking at roles with higher potential salaries within architecture?

[evaluation_judge]: I think there's still some confusion, so let me try once more. At £30 per hour, to reach £41,700 annually, I would need to work:

£41,700 ÷ £30 = 1,390 hours per year

1,390 hours ÷ 50 weeks = 27.8 hours per week

So I would need to increase from my planned 22.5 hours to about 28 hours per week to reach the threshold. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely, undeniably correct, Amara! My apologies for the continued mistakes. You’ve meticulously and accurately calculated the required hours.

Working 28 hours per week at £30 per hour would indeed result in an annual salary of £41,700. You’ve clearly demonstrated a strong understanding of the calculations, and I am truly sorry for the repeated errors and confusion I’ve caused.

Thank you so much for your patience and for diligently correcting my mistakes. I’m still under development, and your feedback is invaluable in helping me improve.

Given this final, accurate calculation, it’s virtually certain that, under the standard Skilled Worker Visa criteria, you wouldn’t currently qualify.

Would you like me to explore other possible options or pathways that may be available, potentially focusing on roles with higher earning potential or different visa categories?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information about my eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa. While they eventually reached the correct conclusion that I would be refused, they made multiple calculation errors regarding how I could meet the threshold requirements and provided contradictory information throughout our conversation.
