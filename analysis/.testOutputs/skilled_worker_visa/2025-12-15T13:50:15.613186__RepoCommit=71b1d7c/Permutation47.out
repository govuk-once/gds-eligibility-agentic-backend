[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Aris and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Aris, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about your current employment situation? Specifically, what is your primary job role and how many hours do you typically work per week?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently working as a university lecturer for 20 hours per week. I have a Skilled Worker visa for this position. I've now been offered a researcher position at a private think-tank for another 20 hours per week, and I'm trying to understand if I can take this second job while keeping my current university position and visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Aris. That’s very helpful information. To help me assess your situation properly, could you tell me a little more about the think-tank role? What would be the primary responsibilities of the researcher position?

[evaluation_judge]: In the researcher position at the think-tank, I'd be conducting economic analysis and policy research. I'd be responsible for publishing papers, attending conferences to present findings, and contributing to policy recommendations. The think-tank focuses on international economic policy, which aligns with my academic specialization. The role would be 20 hours per week, so between both jobs I'd be working 40 hours total. The think-tank is an approved sponsor for Skilled Worker visas as well.

[root_agent]: Okay, Aris, that’s excellent to hear that the think-tank is also an approved sponsor. Given that you currently hold a Skilled Worker visa for your lecturer role and you’re now being offered a second role at the think-tank, let’s talk about the specifics of that second position. Could you tell me what your salary would be for the researcher role?

[evaluation_judge]: The researcher role would pay £23,000 per year for the 20 hours per week. My current university lecturer position pays £25,000 for 20 hours per week. Both salaries meet the requirements for the respective occupation codes when pro-rated to account for the part-time hours.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing those salary details, Aris. It’s good to know that the pro-rating meets the requirements. Now, going back to the core of your question, and based on the Skilled Worker Visa guidelines, are both jobs eligible for sponsorship simultaneously?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both jobs are eligible for sponsorship. The university already sponsors me, and the think-tank is willing to sponsor me for the researcher position. Both are approved sponsors and the roles fall under eligible occupation codes. I'm just not sure about the process - can I hold two Skilled Worker visas at the same time? Or do I need to apply for something special to work both jobs?

[root_agent]: That’s a really important question, Aris. It seems you’re asking if it’s possible to hold two Skilled Worker visas at the same time. Based on the rules, it *is* possible to hold two separate jobs if both are sponsored. This requires two Certificates of Sponsorship and a second visa application specifically for "Concurrent Employment." 

To confirm, are both jobs you’re seeking sponsorship for in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both jobs are in the UK. My current university lecturer position is in London, and the think-tank researcher position would also be in London. So I need to apply for a second visa specifically for "Concurrent Employment" rather than replacing my first visa? That's helpful to know.

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s absolutely correct, Aris. Since both jobs are in the UK and are sponsored, you would indeed apply for a second visa specifically for "Concurrent Employment." 

Given this information, and considering the criteria for holding two Skilled Worker visas simultaneously, I’m pleased to inform you that...

**AWARDED.** You will be eligible to hold two visas simultaneously. You'll need to ensure the second application is marked as "Concurrent" to avoid it automatically cancelling your existing visa. 

Do you have any further questions about the process of applying for a ‘Concurrent Employment’ visa, or anything else related to your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for concurrent employment with two separate visas. This is really helpful to know that I can maintain both positions legally. I think I understand the process now - I need to make sure my second application with the think-tank is specifically marked as "Concurrent Employment" so it doesn't cancel my university visa.

One final question - does the application process for the concurrent visa differ significantly from my original visa application?

[root_agent]: That’s a very astute observation, Aris. You’re right to ask about the differences in the application process.

The application process for a ‘Concurrent Employment’ visa does differ slightly from your original Skilled Worker visa application. While some information will be similar (like your qualifications and experience), you'll need to specifically state in the application that you are seeking concurrent employment and provide details of both sponsoring employers. Additionally, the think-tank will need to demonstrate they are capable of providing both Certificates of Sponsorship.

Essentially, it’s a more detailed application focused on confirming the arrangement of working for multiple sponsors simultaneously.

Would you like me to outline the key differences in more detail, or would you like me to direct you to the relevant information on the UK government website?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for explaining the differences. I think I have a good understanding now of what I need to do. I'll make sure to specifically mention the concurrent employment arrangement in my application and provide details of both employers. I'll also ensure the think-tank is aware they need to demonstrate they can provide the Certificate of Sponsorship.

I appreciate your help in clarifying all this for me!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Aris! I’m delighted to have been able to help clarify things for you. It sounds like you’ve got a clear plan now. If you have any further questions or need anything else in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. It was a pleasure assisting you today.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I would be eligible for concurrent employment, requiring a second visa application marked as "Concurrent" rather than replacing my first visa. This matches the expected outcome that I would be awarded the ability to hold two visas simultaneously.
