[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lars and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Lars, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please confirm if you have a valid sponsor for your visa application? This means a UK employer who is licensed by the Home Office to sponsor workers.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a valid sponsor. I'm a stonemason from Norway and I have a job offer from a UK employer who is licensed to sponsor workers.

[root_agent]: That's excellent to hear, Lars.

My next question is: what skill level is the job you've been offered? Specifically, is it at RQF level 3 or above?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my job is at the required skill level. I'm a Specialist Stonemason, which is above RQF level 3.

[root_agent]: Great! That’s another positive step.

Now, could you please confirm that you meet the English language requirements for the visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements for the visa.

[root_agent]: Wonderful. 

Is the specific job you have been offered listed on the Immigration Salary List? You can find a list of eligible occupations online, but I’m looking to confirm if your role – Specialist Stonemason – is included.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my job as a Specialist Stonemason is listed on the Immigration Salary List.

[root_agent]: That's very good news, Lars! 

Now, could you please tell me your annual salary offer in pounds (£)?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lars.

Finally, do you know what the standard going rate is for a Specialist Stonemason in the UK? I need to know the 100% going rate for the role, as listed by official sources.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the standard going rate for a Specialist Stonemason in the UK is £33,500 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Lars.

Based on everything you've told me: you have a valid sponsor, the job is at the required skill level, you meet the English language requirements, your job is on the Immigration Salary List, your salary of £34,000 meets the lower general threshold of £33,400, and your salary exceeds the standard going rate of £33,500.

Therefore, according to the criteria, you would be **AWARDED** eligibility. The Immigration Salary List allows you to bypass the usual £41,700 threshold, provided you are paid at least the full market rate for your role, which you are.



Do you have any other questions for me?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome (AWARDED) as the job being on the Immigration Salary List allows bypassing the £41,700 general threshold, and my offered salary (£34,000) exceeds both the lower threshold (£33,400) and the going rate (£33,500).
