[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lukas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lukas, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility. To start, could you please confirm your age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks Lukas. That's helpful to know.

As you are 17, do you have a letter of consent from both of your parents or legal guardians allowing you to travel to and be cared for in the UK? This letter needs to detail the arrangements for your care whilst you are here.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any letter from my parents. I didn't know I needed one. I've been offered a Junior Developer position with a salary of £34,000. Do I really need my parents' permission? I'm already very independent.

[root_agent]: I understand your feeling of independence, Lukas. However, as you are 17, the UK government requires explicit written consent from your parents or legal guardians for you to be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa. This is to ensure your well-being and proper care while you are in the UK. 

The Home Office needs to be sure that suitable arrangements are in place for your travel and ongoing care. Unfortunately, without this letter of consent, your application wouldn’t meet the requirements.



Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: So even though I have a good job offer as a developer with a decent salary, my visa application would be refused without my parents' consent letter? What exactly should this letter include? And does it need to be notarized or anything official like that?

[root_agent]: You are correct, Lukas. Even with a good job offer and a good salary, your application would likely be refused without the parental consent letter. The Home Office considers this a safeguarding requirement for applicants under 18.

The letter should include:

*   Confirmation that your parents/legal guardians consent to your travel to the UK.
*   Details of the care arrangements they have put in place for you while you are in the UK - who will be responsible for your accommodation, wellbeing, and general care.
*   Confirmation they understand you will be living and working in the UK.
*   Their contact details.

Regarding notarization, the guidance doesn’t *specifically* require notarization, but it’s advisable to have it notarized to add further weight and authenticity to the document. It's also a good idea to have it translated into English if it isn’t originally written in English.



Would you like me to clarify any of those points?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's a bit disappointing as I thought I could handle this on my own. Apart from this parental consent letter issue, would my application meet all other requirements? I have a job offer with a £34,000 salary as a Junior Developer. I'm from Estonia, which I believe is eligible.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Lukas. It's great that you're confident and capable!

Regarding the other requirements, a salary of £34,000 as a Junior Developer *does* meet the new entrant salary threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa. And yes, Estonia is a fully eligible country. 

To confirm everything else, I would ideally need to ask a few more questions, but based on what you've told me so far, *assuming* you meet all the other criteria (like the job being on the list of eligible occupations, and your qualifications being recognised), the parental consent letter is currently the only outstanding issue preventing your eligibility.



Would you like me to ask those additional questions to provide a more complete assessment, keeping in mind the parental consent issue?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's okay. I think I have a clear picture of the situation now. So basically, I'm eligible for the visa from a job and salary perspective, but I'm missing this important parental consent document because I'm under 18. Without it, my application would be refused even if everything else is perfect. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: That is absolutely correct, Lukas. You’ve understood the situation perfectly. You are eligible based on the job and salary, and your nationality, but the missing parental consent letter is a critical requirement due to your age, and without it, your application would unfortunately be refused.

I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. If you obtain the letter and have further questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. Best of luck with getting the consent letter sorted!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that despite meeting salary and job requirements, I would be refused a Skilled Worker Visa without parental consent documentation due to being 17 years old, which matches the expected outcome of "INVALID/REFUSED" on safeguarding grounds.
