[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Layla and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Layla, it's nice to meet you. I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a benefit.

To start, could you please tell me the date your Skilled Worker visa was granted?





[evaluation_judge]: My visa was granted on January 1st. I'm an architect and was supposed to start work on that date, but I had to delay my travel to the UK to settle some affairs back home. I actually arrived on February 15th and started work then.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Layla. 

Just to clarify, the start date listed on your Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) was also January 1st, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The start date on my Certificate of Sponsorship was January 1st, the same as when my visa was granted.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Layla. And to be absolutely clear, you arrived in the UK and *began* your work as an architect on February 15th, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I arrived in the UK and started my work as an architect on February 15th, which was about 45 days after my visa was granted and the CoS start date.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming those dates for me, Layla.

To help me understand your situation fully, did your employer report the delay in your start date to the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't think they did. My employer didn't mention anything about reporting the delay to the Home Office. They seemed to think it wasn't an issue and that I could just start when I arrived.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Layla.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears there may be a compliance issue with your visa. As a Skilled Worker, you are generally expected to begin work within 28 days of either the visa grant date or the start date on your Certificate of Sponsorship – whichever is later. In your case, that deadline was January 29th. Because you started work on February 15th, and your employer didn't report a valid reason for the delay, your visa may not be compliant with the rules.

Do you understand what I've explained so far?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand what you're explaining. I didn't realize there was a 28-day rule about starting work after my visa was granted. My employer never mentioned this to me. So you're saying that because I started work on February 15th, which was beyond the 28 days, there might be a problem with my visa?

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly, Layla. Because you started work more than 28 days after your visa grant date and the start date on your Certificate of Sponsorship, and your employer didn't report a valid reason for the delay to the Home Office, there's a risk of a compliance breach. 

This could potentially lead to curtailment of your visa (meaning it could be cancelled before its original expiry date) or issues when trying to re-enter the UK in the future. It's a serious situation, but understanding it is the first step.

Would you like me to explain what steps you might consider taking next?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I'm quite concerned now. I had no idea this could be an issue. What should I do to address this situation? I definitely want to make sure my visa status is valid and compliant.

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, Layla. It's good you're taking this seriously.

The first thing to do is to discuss this with your employer immediately. They have a legal responsibility to ensure your visa is compliant, and they need to understand the potential consequences of not reporting the delay. They may need to contact the Home Office to explain the situation and potentially apply for a new Certificate of Sponsorship with a corrected start date, although this isn’t guaranteed to be approved.

Simultaneously, you should gather any documentation you have relating to your visa, CoS, and arrival date in the UK. It would also be wise to seek legal advice from an immigration solicitor. They can assess your specific situation and advise you on the best course of action.

Do you have any questions about these initial steps?

[evaluation_judge]: That sounds serious. Would the Home Office definitely cancel my visa, or is there a chance they might be understanding about this situation? And will I need to leave the UK while this is being sorted out? 

Also, could you recommend how I find a good immigration solicitor? I've never needed legal advice in the UK before.

[root_agent]: Those are very valid questions, Layla.

It's difficult to say *definitely* whether the Home Office would cancel your visa. It depends on a number of factors, including your employer's cooperation, the reason for the delay (even though it wasn't reported), and any previous immigration history. However, a failure to comply with the 28-day rule is a significant issue, and the Home Office *could* take action, ranging from a warning to curtailment or cancellation.

Regarding leaving the UK, it's possible you *might* be asked to leave while the situation is being sorted out, particularly if the Home Office decides to investigate further. However, this isn’t automatic. An immigration solicitor will be best placed to advise you on your personal risk of this happening.

To find a good immigration solicitor, I recommend:

*   **The Law Society:** They have a "Find a Solicitor" tool on their website ([https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/)). You can filter by location and area of expertise (immigration).
*   **The Immigration Law Practitioners' Association (ILPA):** ILPA lists accredited immigration lawyers and advisors ([https://www.ilpa.org.uk/](https://www.ilpa.org.uk/)).
*   **Ask for Recommendations:** If you know anyone else who has used an immigration solicitor, ask for their recommendations.

When choosing a solicitor, make sure they are regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) and have experience with Skilled Worker visas. It's also a good idea to have an initial consultation with a few different solicitors to discuss your case and get a feel for their approach.

Would you like me to elaborate on anything I've said, or do you have any other questions at this point?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for this detailed information. I'll speak with my employer right away and look into finding an immigration solicitor using the resources you suggested. 

Just to be clear on the outcome - based on what you've told me, my current visa situation is a compliance breach and I'm at risk of having my visa curtailed because I started work more than 28 days after the CoS start date without a reported valid reason. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: Yes, Layla, that is a correct and concise summary of the situation. 

Based on the information you’ve provided, your current visa status does represent a compliance breach. You are at risk of having your visa curtailed because you began employment more than 28 days after the start date on your Certificate of Sponsorship, and this delay was not reported to the Home Office.

It’s important to address this proactively with your employer and seek legal advice as soon as possible. I hope speaking with your employer and a solicitor helps to clarify your options and achieve a positive outcome.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my situation represents a compliance breach as I started work more than 28 days after my CoS start date without a valid reported reason, which matches the expected outcome of "COMPLIANCE BREACH / CURTAILMENT RISK."
