[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Hans and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Hans, welcome! It's good to chat with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm looking to apply for a skilled worker visa for the UK. I've got a job offer from a UK company as an engineer. I have a Master's degree in Engineering from a university in Germany and the whole program was taught in English. I'm wondering about the English language requirement for the visa. Do I need to take an English test?

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you have a job offer! Regarding the English language requirement for the Skilled Worker visa, having a degree taught in English can sometimes meet the requirement. 

Could you tell me – have you had your German degree assessed by Ecctis to confirm both its comparability to a UK degree *and* your English language proficiency?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't had my degree assessed by Ecctis yet. My university gave me a letter confirming that my entire Master's program was taught in English. I thought that would be sufficient. Is that not enough?

[root_agent]: I understand. Unfortunately, a confirmation letter from your university stating the program was taught in English isn’t enough on its own to satisfy the English language requirement for the Skilled Worker visa. 

The Home Office requires either a degree from a UK university, *or* verification from Ecctis with two specific statements: one confirming the qualification is comparable to a UK degree and another specifically confirming your English language proficiency.

To clarify, have you started the process of getting your degree verified by Ecctis at all?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't started the process with Ecctis at all. I assumed the letter from my German university would be sufficient since the program was taught entirely in English. So I need to go through this Ecctis verification to get both statements - one for the qualification comparison and one for English language proficiency?

[root_agent]: You are exactly right. You will need to go through the Ecctis verification process to obtain *both* statements – one confirming the comparability of your qualification to a UK degree, and a separate statement specifically confirming your English language proficiency. 

Without those two statements from Ecctis, your degree alone won't be accepted as proof of English language ability for the Skilled Worker visa.

Would you like me to explain a little more about what the Ecctis verification process involves?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the Ecctis verification process. How long does it typically take, and what documents will I need to provide? Is this something I need to do before I submit my visa application?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Ecctis verification process involves submitting your qualifications to Ecctis for assessment. They will then provide you with two statements, as we discussed – one confirming the comparability of your degree to a UK qualification, and the other specifically confirming your English language proficiency.

You’ll need to submit your original degree certificate and a transcript from your university. You may also need to provide a certified translation if your documents aren’t in English. You can find more details on the Ecctis website (though I'm not able to provide a direct link).

The processing time can vary, but it generally takes around 10-20 working days once Ecctis receives all the required documents. It’s a good idea to check their current processing times on their website.

**And yes, you absolutely need to complete the Ecctis verification *before* you submit your Skilled Worker visa application.** The Home Office will require evidence of the Ecctis statements as part of your application.



Does that make sense? Would you like me to clarify anything further about the process?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense, thank you. So just to be clear, without the two statements from Ecctis (one for qualification comparison and one for English language proficiency), my Skilled Worker visa application would be refused - even though my program was taught entirely in English and I have a letter from the university confirming this?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct. Even with a letter from your university confirming your program was taught entirely in English, your Skilled Worker visa application would be refused without those two statements from Ecctis – one for qualification comparison and one specifically for English language proficiency.

The Home Office has specific requirements for demonstrating English language ability, and unfortunately, a university letter doesn’t meet those requirements for qualifications obtained outside the UK.

Essentially, the Ecctis statements are considered necessary proof in your situation.



Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your visa application or the Ecctis process?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for clarifying. I'll make sure to get my degree verified through Ecctis before submitting my visa application. One last question - are there any other options for proving my English language proficiency besides the Ecctis verification, like taking an English test such as IELTS?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify things.

Yes, you are right to ask about alternatives. While Ecctis verification is the route for your German degree, you *can* also prove your English language proficiency by taking a Secure English Language Test (SELT). 

IELTS is one of the accepted SELT tests, along with PTE Academic, Pearson PTE Academic, and Trinity SELT. You would need to achieve the required score (usually at least B1 level) on one of these tests.

So, you have two options: Ecctis verification, *or* passing a SELT like IELTS. Which route you choose is up to you!

Do you have any questions about the SELT tests, or would you like me to provide more information about the required scores?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave inconsistent information. Initially they correctly stated that my German degree would require both Ecctis statements (qualification comparability AND English language proficiency), but then incorrectly suggested I could skip the Ecctis verification entirely by taking a SELT test. For a German degree taught in English, the correct pathway is getting both Ecctis statements as the original answer indicated.
