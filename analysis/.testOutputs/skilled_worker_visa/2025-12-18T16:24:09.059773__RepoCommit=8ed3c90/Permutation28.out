[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Katarina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Katarina, it's good to speak with you. I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a benefit. 

To start, could you tell me what kind of job you have been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a waitress at an upscale event venue here in the UK. They're offering me £20 per hour, which seems pretty good, but it's on a zero-hours contract. They've given me a letter saying they expect me to work around 40 hours a week, which would be about £41,600 per year. I'm wondering if this is enough for me to be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Katarina. That's very helpful.

To clarify, is the £41,600 a *guaranteed* annual salary stated in your contract, or is it an *expected* amount based on the predicted hours?

[evaluation_judge]: It's not guaranteed. It's an expected amount based on the predicted hours since I'd be on a zero-hours contract. The employer's letter says they "expect" me to work 40 hours a week, but there's nothing in the contract guaranteeing those hours. I'm just guaranteed the £20 hourly rate whenever I do work.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Katarina.

Just to be certain, does your contract specify a minimum number of guaranteed hours per week or year?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's what concerns me. There's no minimum number of hours guaranteed in the contract at all. It's a true zero-hours contract, so technically they could give me very few hours some weeks. The letter mentions they "expect" me to work 40 hours weekly, but there's nothing binding in the actual contract about minimum hours.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Katarina. 

Based on the information you've provided, and the rules for the Skilled Worker visa, unfortunately, your situation would likely result in a refusal. The visa requires a guaranteed salary that meets the minimum threshold, and a zero-hours contract doesn’t provide that guarantee even if the hourly rate is high and they *expect* you to work a certain number of hours.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So I won't be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa with this zero-hours contract, even though the hourly rate is good? Is there anything I can do? Maybe ask for a different type of contract with guaranteed hours?

[root_agent]: You are correct, Katarina. Even with a good hourly rate, the zero-hours contract prevents meeting the Skilled Worker visa requirements because the salary isn’t guaranteed.

Asking your employer for a contract with guaranteed hours would be the best course of action. If they can offer you a contract that guarantees a minimum number of hours each week or year – enough to meet the minimum salary threshold – you would then potentially be eligible. 

Would you like me to remind you of the current minimum salary threshold for a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful to know what the minimum salary threshold is so I can discuss it with my potential employer. Then I might be able to negotiate a contract with guaranteed hours that meets that threshold.

[root_agent]: Certainly. As of April 4th, 2024, the general threshold for a Skilled Worker visa is £38,700 per year. 

However, there are some exceptions to this general threshold depending on the job role. Your specific job code might have a lower threshold, or a 'going rate' which is different. 

To confirm the exact amount applicable to your role as a waitress, you would need to check the eligible occupations list and the associated 'going rate' for that occupation. However, as a starting point for discussion with your employer, aiming for £38,700 per year with guaranteed hours is a good idea.

Does that help?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very helpful, thank you. I'll definitely talk to my potential employer about changing my contract to include guaranteed hours that would meet that £38,700 threshold. Since they were expecting to pay me around £41,600 anyway based on the expected hours, hopefully they'll be open to guaranteeing enough hours to reach that threshold. Thank you for explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Katarina! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. 

It sounds like a reasonable request, especially since their expectations are already above the threshold. I wish you the best of luck in your negotiations with your employer. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks again! You've been very helpful. I'll see what my employer says about the guaranteed hours contract. Have a good day too!

✓ The agent correctly identified that my zero-hours contract with no guaranteed minimum hours would make me ineligible for a Skilled Worker visa, even with a high hourly rate and expected earnings above the threshold. This matches the expected outcome of REFUSED.
