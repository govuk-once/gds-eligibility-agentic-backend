[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ahmed and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ahmed, nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you tell me what kind of job you have been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a chef, and I've been offered a position as a Head Chef in the UK. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a work visa with this job offer.

[root_agent]: That's great, Ahmed! A Head Chef position sounds interesting. 

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you tell me how many hours per week you are contracted to work in this role?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working 60 hours per week as the Head Chef.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ahmed. And could you please tell me your hourly rate for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: My hourly rate is £13.50.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ahmed. Just to clarify, is this £13.50 your gross hourly rate, before any deductions?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. £13.50 is my gross hourly rate before any deductions.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming, Ahmed. 

To help me assess your eligibility, could you confirm your total annual salary based on these details (60 hours a week at £13.50 per hour)? Just a rough figure is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: Based on my contract of 60 hours per week at £13.50 per hour, my total annual salary would be £42,120 (60 hours × £13.50 × 52 weeks).

[root_agent]: Thank you for that calculation, Ahmed. That's very helpful.

The Home Office has specific rules about how they calculate salary for visa eligibility. They only consider earnings for the first 48 hours worked in a week. 

Knowing this, can you calculate what your weekly earnings would be based on 48 hours at your rate of £13.50 per hour?

[evaluation_judge]: Let me calculate that. At £13.50 per hour for 48 hours, my weekly earnings would be £648 (£13.50 × 48 hours).

[root_agent]: Great, Ahmed. And based on that weekly figure of £648, what would your annual salary be, calculated over 52 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Based on the weekly figure of £648, my annual salary calculated over 52 weeks would be £33,696 (£648 × 52 weeks).

[root_agent]: Thank you for working that out, Ahmed. 

Currently, the minimum salary threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa is £41,700 per year.

Considering your assessable annual salary of £33,696, does this meet the current minimum salary threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that doesn't meet the minimum salary threshold of £41,700. My assessable annual salary of £33,696 is below that requirement.

[root_agent]: You are correct, Ahmed. Unfortunately, based on the information you’ve provided, your application would be **REFUSED**.

While your contracted salary of £42,120 appears to meet the threshold, the Home Office assesses eligibility based on a 48-hour work week, resulting in an assessable salary of £33,696, which is below the required £41,700.

To be eligible, your sponsor would need to increase your *hourly* rate, rather than just offering more hours.



Is there anything else I can help you with today, Ahmed?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing news. Could you tell me what hourly rate I would need to meet the threshold if I'm still working 48 hours per week?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ahmed. Let's calculate that for you.

To meet the £41,700 annual salary threshold with a 48-hour work week, we need to determine the required hourly rate. 

Here's the calculation: £41,700 / (48 hours/week * 52 weeks/year) = £16.62 per hour (rounded to the nearest penny).

Therefore, you would need an hourly rate of approximately **£16.62** to meet the Skilled Worker Visa salary threshold, assuming you work 48 hours per week.



Does that help clarify things for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that helps a lot. So I would need to negotiate an hourly rate of at least £16.62 with my employer for this to work out. Thank you for explaining this clearly. I appreciate the information.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ahmed! I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you. 

You are absolutely right - negotiating an hourly rate of at least £16.62 would be necessary to meet the visa requirements, if you continue to work 48 hours per week.

If you have any other questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. I wish you the best of luck with your negotiations and your visa application!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the information and your well wishes. This has been very helpful.

✓ The agent correctly explained that my application would be refused because the Home Office only considers earnings from the first 48 hours of work when calculating the salary threshold. My assessable salary of £33,696 is below the £41,700 threshold, and the agent correctly identified that I would need an hourly rate of £16.62 to meet the requirement.
