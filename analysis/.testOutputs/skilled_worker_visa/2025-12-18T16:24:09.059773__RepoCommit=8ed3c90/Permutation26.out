[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by roleplaying as a user named Klaus in this scenario. I'll engage with the agent being tested regarding immigration salary requirements and eligibility.

Hi, i'm Klaus and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Klaus, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help! To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in getting a skilled worker visa for the UK. I have a job offer as a welder, but I'm not sure if I meet the salary requirements. The company is offering me £30,960 per year, and they told me this is enough because welding is on the Immigration Salary List.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Klaus. That's helpful. To understand your situation better, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 45 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Klaus. And could you confirm the going rate for a welder in your specific location, as stated in the official guidance?

[evaluation_judge]: The going rate for a welder is £38,700 according to the information I have. My employer said that because welding is on the Immigration Salary List, they only need to pay me 80% of this going rate, which is why they're offering £30,960.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Klaus. Just to be absolutely sure, have you previously worked in the UK, or are you applying as a first-time worker coming to the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: This would be my first time working in the UK. I've never worked there before.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Klaus. Based on the information you've provided, unfortunately, your application would likely be refused. 

The rules regarding the Immigration Salary List have changed. While welding *is* on the list, being on the list doesn’t automatically mean your employer can pay you 80% of the going rate. Unless you are a ‘New Entrant’ – which generally means you have recently graduated – you need to be paid the full going rate. 

As the going rate for a welder is £38,700 and you are being offered £30,960, this doesn’t meet the current requirements. Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this in more detail. I was sure my employer was right about this. They seemed confident about the 80% rule. Is there something else I'm missing?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Klaus. You're right to question it – the rules have recently changed, and it's understandable your employer might be relying on older information.

Previously, jobs on the Shortage Occupation List (which the Immigration Salary List replaced) *did* allow employers to pay 80% of the going rate in many cases. However, the Immigration Salary List operates differently. It sets a lower *general* threshold, but you still generally need to meet the full going rate unless you fall into a specific category called 'New Entrant'.

A 'New Entrant' generally refers to someone who has recently graduated. As you haven’t mentioned being a recent graduate, the 80% rule doesn’t apply in your case. Your employer is applying the rules from before April 2024.

Essentially, the Immigration Salary List doesn’t automatically grant permission to pay 80% of the going rate like the old Shortage Occupation List did. You need to be paid at least £38,700 to meet the Skilled Worker Visa salary requirements for a welder.

Does that make things a little clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make it clearer. So if I understand correctly, even though my job is on the Immigration Salary List, I still need to be paid the full going rate of £38,700 because I'm not a 'New Entrant'? And this is a recent change that my employer might not be aware of?

[root_agent]: You understand perfectly, Klaus! That is exactly correct. Even though welding is on the Immigration Salary List, you need to be paid the full going rate of £38,700 because you are not a ‘New Entrant’.

And yes, this is a recent change to the rules – implemented in April 2024 – so it’s very possible your employer isn’t aware of the updated guidance. Many employers were previously operating under the old rules regarding the Shortage Occupation List.

I'm glad I could clarify that for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you'd like me to summarise the key points again?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand the situation now. So I should go back to my employer and explain that the rules changed in April 2024, and that I need to be offered the full going rate of £38,700 for my visa application to be successful. Thank you for the clear explanation about these new rules with the Immigration Salary List. I don't think I have any other questions at the moment.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Klaus! You've got a clear plan of action now – explaining the April 2024 rule change to your employer and requesting the full going rate of £38,700. I'm happy I could help.

If you do have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you the best of luck with your visa application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be refused based on the salary requirements. They accurately explained that being on the Immigration Salary List doesn't automatically allow payment at 80% of the going rate (as was the case with the old Shortage Occupation List), and that I would need the full going rate of £38,700 since I'm not a New Entrant. The explanation about the April 2024 rule changes was also accurate and helpful.
