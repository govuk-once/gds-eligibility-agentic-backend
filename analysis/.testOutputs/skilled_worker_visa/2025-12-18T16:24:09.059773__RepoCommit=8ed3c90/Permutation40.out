[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Ms. Dubois, a French teacher at a UK private school, seeking information about immigration benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Marie and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Marie, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help! To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in exploring your eligibility for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hello! I'm interested in finding out if I'm eligible for a skilled worker visa. I'm French and I currently teach French at a private school here in the UK. I've been offered to continue my position, but I need to understand if I qualify with my salary.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you're hoping to continue your position! To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you please tell me your job title as it will appear on your Certificate of Sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a French teacher at a secondary school level. That's what my Certificate of Sponsorship will say - "Secondary School Teacher - French".

[root_agent]: Thank you. And could you please tell me your annual salary, *before* any deductions? Just the gross amount.

[evaluation_judge]: My annual gross salary is £33,750. I should mention that I only work during term time, which is 39 weeks of the year. If I worked the full year, the equivalent salary would be £45,000, but since I'm on a term-time only contract, my actual pay is £33,750.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you work term-time only. That's very helpful to know. 

To confirm, is £33,750 the amount you *actually* receive each year, paid over 39 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. £33,750 is the total amount I actually receive each year for working the 39 weeks of term time. The school pays me this amount spread over the academic year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. To help me understand your situation fully, does your Certificate of Sponsorship state the going rate for a Secondary School Teacher - French? If so, what is that rate? If not, that's okay, just let me know.

[evaluation_judge]: I don't believe my Certificate of Sponsorship specifically states a going rate. I was just told that my salary would be £33,750 for the academic year. I'm not sure what the going rate is for Secondary School Teachers in my field.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Based on the information you’ve provided, and considering you work term-time only, the Skilled Worker Visa requires a salary meeting a specific threshold. 

Currently, the general threshold is £41,700 per year. As your actual annual salary is £33,750, which is below this threshold, I'm afraid you currently do not meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or explore if there are any other potential routes to eligibility that might apply to your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain more. I thought maybe because I'm a teacher and only work during term time, there might be some special consideration. My full-time equivalent salary would be £45,000 if I worked year-round - doesn't that count? Are there any exceptions for teachers or education professionals?

[root_agent]: You are right to ask about special considerations for term-time workers, and it’s good you brought up your full-time equivalent salary. The rules do address this specifically for those in the education sector.

While your full-time equivalent salary *is* £45,000 – which is above the £41,700 general threshold – the Skilled Worker Visa rules stipulate that for term-time workers like yourself, the salary assessment is based on your **actual earnings** for the work you *do* perform.

Therefore, the Home Office will assess your eligibility based on the £33,750 you actually earn for 39 weeks of work, not the £45,000 you *would* earn if working 52 weeks. Because £33,750 is below the £41,700 threshold, you unfortunately do not meet the standard salary requirements.

There are some exceptions, such as a lower salary threshold for those with a PhD or those who are considered 'new entrants', but based on the information you've given me so far, it doesn't sound like either of those apply.

Would you like me to provide you with information on the 'new entrant' criteria, just to be sure? Or perhaps you have a PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a PhD. And I've been teaching for several years now, so I don't think I would qualify as a 'new entrant' either. This is quite disappointing - I didn't realize that my term-time contract would affect my visa eligibility this way. Is there absolutely no consideration for the fact that teaching roles naturally operate on term-time schedules? It feels like I'm being penalized for working in education.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, and you are right to feel frustrated. It does seem counterintuitive that your term-time contract impacts your eligibility in this way. Unfortunately, the current rules do assess eligibility based on actual earnings for term-time workers, and do not offer specific consideration for the typical term-time schedules within the education sector. 

While the going rate *can* be pro-rated, your actual salary still needs to meet the minimum threshold. As your actual salary is below the £41,700 threshold, and you don't qualify for the new entrant or PhD exceptions, you do not currently meet the requirements.

I'm very sorry to deliver this news. I can, if you wish, direct you to the official government guidance on salary requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa, so you can review the details yourself: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa).

Is there anything else I can help you with today, or any other aspect of the Skilled Worker Visa you'd like me to clarify?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly stated my visa eligibility. According to the scenario, for term-time workers like me, while the going rate for the occupation code can be pro-rated, the actual salary (£33,750) must still meet the general threshold (£41,700). The agent correctly identified that my salary is below the threshold, but incorrectly suggested that going rates can be pro-rated while still failing to meet the minimum threshold. This is misleading information about visa eligibility rules for term-time workers in education.
