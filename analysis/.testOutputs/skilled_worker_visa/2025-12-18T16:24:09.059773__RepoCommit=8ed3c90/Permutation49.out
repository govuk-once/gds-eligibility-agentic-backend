[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Tom, a banker whose salary has been cut below the visa threshold requirement.

Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Tom, it's good to speak with you. I'm here to help. To best understand your situation, could you tell me – are you currently employed?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am currently employed at a bank here in the UK. I've been working there for about two years now on a sponsored visa.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear you're still employed. And you mentioned you're on a sponsored visa - that's helpful. Has your salary recently changed at all?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, unfortunately it has changed. Due to an economic downturn, the bank has implemented a 20% salary cut for all employees. My salary was £50,000 but has now been reduced to £40,000. I'm concerned about how this might affect my visa status since I'm sponsored.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Tom. I understand your concern about the salary cut and your visa. To clarify, could you confirm the *minimum* salary required for your specific Skilled Worker visa when it was originally approved? Do you happen to know what visa option you were granted under (e.g., general threshold, new entrant, etc.)? Knowing this will help me assess your situation.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe I was granted a standard Skilled Worker visa under Option A, which requires a minimum salary of £41,700. My original salary of £50,000 was well above that threshold when I was first sponsored.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Tom. So, your current salary is £40,000, and the minimum requirement for your visa (Option A) is £41,700. 

Based on this information, does your current salary meet the criteria for continuing your sponsorship under the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my current salary of £40,000 doesn't meet the minimum requirement of £41,700 for my visa. That's what I'm worried about.

[root_agent]: You are right to be concerned, Tom. As your salary has fallen below the £41,700 threshold required for your visa, your sponsorship is no longer compliant with the Skilled Worker visa rules. 

Essentially, your employer would need to either increase your salary back to at least £41,700 or, unfortunately, they would need to terminate your sponsorship. Do you understand this?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. So the company has two options - either increase my salary back to at least £41,700 or end my sponsorship. They can't legally continue employing me at the £40,000 salary while maintaining my visa sponsorship. That's quite serious. What would happen if my sponsorship is terminated?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Tom – it is serious.

If your sponsorship is terminated, you would be subject to the standard rules for those whose visa sponsorship ends. This generally means you would have a limited amount of time – 60 days, to be precise – to either:

1.  Find a new sponsor and switch to a new Skilled Worker visa.
2.  Apply for a different type of visa that you are eligible for.
3.  Leave the UK.

Do you have any questions about those options, or would you like me to elaborate on any of them?

[evaluation_judge]: I do have a question about finding a new sponsor. Would I need to secure a new job that pays at least £41,700 to qualify for another Skilled Worker visa? And are there any restrictions on changing employers when your previous sponsorship is terminated?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Tom. Yes, to qualify for a new Skilled Worker visa through a new sponsor, the job must meet the minimum salary threshold of £41,700 (under Option A, which applied to your previous visa). The specific salary requirements can vary depending on the job’s skill level and whether it's on the shortage occupation list, but £41,700 is a safe baseline to consider.

Regarding restrictions on changing employers, there are a few things to be aware of:

*   **Cooling-off period:** There isn't a mandatory cooling-off period *if* your previous sponsorship was terminated by the employer, as is likely in your situation. This means you can apply for a new visa immediately.
*   **Compliance:** The new sponsor will need to be fully satisfied that you were compliant with the terms of your previous visa and that your previous sponsorship ended correctly. 
*   **Switching in-country:** As you are already in the UK with a Skilled Worker visa, you would generally be able to switch to a new sponsor *without* having to leave the country, provided all requirements are met.



Would you like me to go into more detail regarding any of these points, or perhaps provide information on resources to help with finding a new sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for clarifying. One more thing - if my employer decided to reverse the salary cut for me specifically to meet the visa requirements while keeping other employees at the reduced rate, would that be allowed? Or would that create other compliance issues?

[root_agent]: That’s a very insightful question, Tom. It’s good you're thinking about all the possibilities.

While it *might* be legally permissible for your employer to reverse the salary cut for you specifically, to ensure continued compliance with your sponsorship, it could create other compliance issues and is generally not advisable. Here’s why:

*   **Genuine Vacancy:** The Home Office expects sponsorship to be for a *genuine vacancy*. If the sole reason for maintaining your salary is to satisfy visa requirements and isn't tied to your actual role and responsibilities, it could be viewed as an artificial arrangement.
*   **Equal Treatment:** A significant disparity in pay between you and colleagues doing similar work could raise concerns about fair treatment and potential discrimination. While not a direct visa issue, it could attract scrutiny during a Home Office audit.
*   **Transparency:** The Home Office values transparency. Any perceived attempt to circumvent the rules could damage your employer’s credibility as a sponsor.

Essentially, while technically possible, it’s a risky approach that could lead to complications in the future. It would be far more compliant for your employer to *genuinely* maintain a salary that meets the requirements for all sponsored employees, or to end your sponsorship if that’s not feasible.

Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It seems like the situation is quite clear-cut - either my salary needs to genuinely meet the threshold of £41,700 for legitimate business reasons, or my sponsorship would need to be terminated. Thank you for explaining all this - it's given me a much clearer picture of where I stand and what options might be available to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Tom. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. You’ve accurately summarized the situation – it really does come down to those two main options. 

If you have any further questions arise as you discuss this with your employer or begin exploring potential next steps, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here to help in any way I can.

I wish you the best of luck in resolving this situation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you for your help with this difficult situation.

✓ The agent gave the correct outcome of sponsorship termination due to the salary falling below the required threshold. They accurately explained that the employer must either maintain the salary at £41,700 or end the sponsorship, and that continuing employment at £40,000 would not be legally compliant with visa requirements.
