[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Omar in this scenario and interact with the agent being tested regarding visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Omar and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Omar, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help assess your eligibility. To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. My uncle owns a restaurant in London and has offered me a job as a Restaurant Manager. I'm not from the UK originally, so I wanted to check if I would be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa to take up this position.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Omar. A Skilled Worker visa could be a good option. 

To start assessing your eligibility, could you tell me what your current annual salary would be for the Restaurant Manager position?

[evaluation_judge]: My uncle has offered me a salary of £45,000 per year for the Restaurant Manager position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Omar. £45,000 is a helpful piece of information. 

Could you describe the size of the restaurant – roughly how many seats does it have?

[evaluation_judge]: It's actually quite a small restaurant, only about 10 seats. It's more of a cozy family-style place.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that detail. That gives me a better understanding of the restaurant's size.

Currently, does the restaurant already *have* a manager in place?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they actually do already have a manager working there.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Omar. That’s helpful to know. 

Could you tell me a bit more about the specific responsibilities outlined in the job description for the Restaurant Manager position? What would your day-to-day tasks involve?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, my uncle said it would involve general oversight of the restaurant operations. To be honest, the job description is a bit vague. He mentioned things like "supervising staff" and "ensuring customer satisfaction," but there weren't many specific details beyond general management duties.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being honest about the job description being a bit vague, Omar. That’s very helpful.

Just to clarify, is this a newly created position, or is it replacing someone who previously held the role of Restaurant Manager?

[evaluation_judge]: It's actually a newly created position. My uncle said he wants to expand the business and needs more help with management, but the restaurant has been operating with just the current manager until now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that it’s a newly created position.

To help me understand the role a little better, approximately how many employees work at the restaurant in total?

[evaluation_judge]: There are only about 3 or 4 employees in total, including the current manager. It's a very small operation.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Omar. That provides a clearer picture of the restaurant's staffing.

Given the size of the restaurant and the existing management structure, could you tell me what specific new functions or responsibilities *wouldn't* be possible without someone in this new Restaurant Manager position?

[evaluation_judge]: That's a good question. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what specific functions would require a new manager. My uncle mentioned the current manager is busy, but he didn't explain what additional responsibilities couldn't be handled by the existing staff. I think he just wants someone he trusts to help oversee things, especially as family.

[root_agent]: Thank you for your honest answer, Omar. I appreciate you being upfront with me.

Just one final question for now: is there anything about this role that was specifically created *because* you were available to fill it, rather than being a response to a clear and demonstrable business need?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think my uncle is really creating this position for me specifically. When we were talking about it, he mentioned that he wanted to help me move to the UK and thought this would be a good opportunity. I don't think he was planning to hire another manager before I expressed interest in moving to London.

[root_agent]: Thank you for your honesty, Omar. I really appreciate you answering my questions so openly.

Based on the information you've provided, and considering the size of the restaurant, the existing management structure, the vague job description, and the fact that the position seems to have been created specifically with you in mind, it's likely that a Skilled Worker visa application for this role would be carefully scrutinized by the Home Office. There's a significant risk it could be refused due to concerns about whether it’s a genuine vacancy.

Would you like me to explain this further, or discuss other potential visa options?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please explain why it might be refused? What does the Home Office mean by a "genuine vacancy" exactly?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Omar. The Home Office needs to be assured that the job you're being offered is a *genuine vacancy* – meaning it’s a real need within the business, and not simply created to facilitate your visa application.

They're looking to avoid situations where jobs are created as a “sham” or to circumvent immigration rules, like offering a position to a friend or family member without a true business requirement.

In your situation, several factors raise concerns:

*   **Small Restaurant Size:** A restaurant with only 10 seats and 3-4 employees doesn't typically require two managers.
*   **Existing Manager:** The fact that a manager is already in place suggests the business is currently functioning without needing additional management.
*   **Vague Job Description:** The lack of specific duties raises questions about the necessity of the role. "General oversight" isn't enough to justify a skilled worker visa.
*   **Family Connection & Timing:** The fact that the position was created after you expressed interest in moving to the UK, and your uncle specifically mentioned wanting to help *you* move, strongly suggests it wasn’t a pre-existing business need.

The Home Office might request further evidence to demonstrate the genuine need for the position. They could interview your uncle, ask for detailed business plans showing growth necessitating a new manager, or request evidence of unsuccessful attempts to fill the role through standard recruitment channels.

Essentially, they need convincing that the restaurant would be demonstrably unable to operate effectively *without* a second full-time manager. Because of the circumstances you've described, proving that would be difficult.



Does that explanation help clarify things, Omar?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that explanation is very clear, thank you. I understand now that this job offer might not be considered genuine by the Home Office since it seems to have been created specifically for me rather than out of a true business need. It sounds like I need to look into other visa options or perhaps my uncle needs to offer me a position that genuinely exists in his business with clear responsibilities that aren't already covered by existing staff. I appreciate your honest assessment.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Omar. I’m glad I could provide a clear explanation. You've understood the situation perfectly. 

Exploring other visa options or restructuring the job offer to reflect a genuine business need would definitely be advisable. 

If you’d like to discuss other potential routes to the UK, or if you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help in any way I can.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the helpful information. I'll definitely think about other visa options or see if there's a more genuine position available. Have a good day!

✓ The agent correctly determined that the Skilled Worker visa would be refused based on the "Genuine Vacancy" test. The agent identified all the relevant issues: the small restaurant size, existing manager, vague job description, and family connection suggesting the role was created specifically for me rather than out of business necessity. This matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
