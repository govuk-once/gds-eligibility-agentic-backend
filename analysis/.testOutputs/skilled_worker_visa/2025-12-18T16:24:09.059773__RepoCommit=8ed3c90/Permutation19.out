[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ravi and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ravi, it's good to speak with you. I'm here to help determine your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you please tell me, who is sponsoring your visa – that is, which company will be employing you?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a job offer from TechRecruit Ltd. They're an IT consultancy company that's offering to sponsor my visa to work in the UK as a System Administrator.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Ravi. 

And where would you be working most of the time – at TechRecruit Ltd’s offices, or at another company's location?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working 100% of the time at Bank Corp, which is a client of TechRecruit. I'd be based at their offices and working as their System Administrator.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi.

To clarify, would you be reporting to managers *at* TechRecruit Ltd, or to managers *at* Bank Corp?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd be reporting to managers at Bank Corp directly. They would supervise my work and give me tasks as their System Administrator.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Ravi.

And how long do you anticipate working at Bank Corp, if the role proceeds as planned? Would this be a short-term project, or an indefinite arrangement?

[evaluation_judge]: The arrangement is indefinite. I'd be working at Bank Corp permanently as their System Administrator for as long as needed. There's no specific end date to the assignment.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi. Finally, just to confirm, is the salary for this System Administrator role at least £35,700 per year, or above the going rate for the role, whichever is higher?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the salary is £50,000 per year, which I understand is above both the general threshold and the going rate for a System Administrator role in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Ravi. 

Based on what you’ve told me - that you’ll be working 100% of the time at Bank Corp, reporting to their managers indefinitely, and that TechRecruit Ltd are sponsoring your visa for this role - it appears your application would likely be **REFUSED**. 

This is because the Skilled Worker visa rules state that the sponsor (TechRecruit Ltd) must retain full responsibility for your duties. In this scenario, it seems TechRecruit Ltd is effectively supplying labor to Bank Corp, which is not permitted under the Skilled Worker visa guidelines.



I hope this is helpful, even if it's not the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing to hear that my application would likely be refused. I wasn't aware that this arrangement wouldn't be allowed under the Skilled Worker visa guidelines.

So even though the salary meets the requirements, I can't be sponsored if I'll be working permanently at a client site reporting to their managers? Is there any way TechRecruit could structure this differently to make it work?

[root_agent]: You're right to be disappointed, Ravi, and it's good you're asking about potential solutions.

Even with the salary meeting the requirements, the core issue is that the role appears to be a routine, permanent position filled *at* a client organization (Bank Corp), rather than a genuine employment opportunity *within* the sponsoring company (TechRecruit Ltd).

To potentially make it work, TechRecruit Ltd would need to demonstrate that they retain full responsibility for your duties. Here are a few ways they *might* structure things differently, though I cannot guarantee success as the Home Office makes the final decision:

*   **Genuine Project Work:** If your role was tied to a specific, defined *project* at Bank Corp with a clear end date, and TechRecruit Ltd retained control over how that project was executed, that could be acceptable. However, an indefinite, ongoing System Administrator role doesn’t fit this.
*   **Regular Transfer Between Clients:** If TechRecruit Ltd regularly moved you between different client sites, demonstrating that you weren't permanently embedded at Bank Corp, that could be considered.
*   **Direct Control and Oversight:** TechRecruit Ltd would need to demonstrate significant control over your day-to-day tasks, performance management, and overall work – not simply placing you under the direction of Bank Corp managers.

Essentially, they need to prove you are an employee of TechRecruit Ltd *working at* Bank Corp, not an employee of Bank Corp provided *by* TechRecruit Ltd.



Does that explanation help clarify the situation, and the options TechRecruit Ltd might consider?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that clarifies things a lot, thank you. It sounds like the current arrangement wouldn't work because it makes me look like I'm essentially a Bank Corp employee being supplied through TechRecruit.

I'll need to speak with TechRecruit about restructuring this arrangement. Maybe they could set up a specific project with a clearer end date, or ensure that my reporting line stays with TechRecruit managers who would then liaise with Bank Corp.

I appreciate your explanation of the options they might consider to make this work within the Skilled Worker visa guidelines.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Ravi. I’m glad I could help clarify the situation.

You’ve understood the key issue perfectly – it’s about demonstrating a genuine employment relationship with TechRecruit Ltd, rather than appearing as a supplied worker to Bank Corp.

I wish you the best of luck in your discussions with TechRecruit Ltd. If you have any further questions after speaking with them, or if the situation changes, feel free to come back and ask.



Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. I'll discuss these options with TechRecruit and see if we can find a way to structure the arrangement properly. Thank you for your help!

✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be refused based on the third-party ban criteria. They accurately explained that TechRecruit was effectively acting as a recruitment agency supplying labor to a third party (Bank Corp), which violates the Skilled Worker visa guidelines.
