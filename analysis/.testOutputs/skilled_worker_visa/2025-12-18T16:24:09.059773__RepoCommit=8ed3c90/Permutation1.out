[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Elena, it's lovely to meet you! I understand you're exploring your eligibility for a UK visa. To start, could you please confirm your age? This will help me assess which options might be available to you.





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 35 years old. I'm specifically looking at the Skilled Worker visa as I've received a job offer in London.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you! And just to confirm, is the company offering you the job a licensed sponsor with the UK government? Knowing this is a key part of the Skilled Worker visa requirements.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company is a licensed sponsor with the UK government. It's a fintech firm in London.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Now, regarding the role itself, does the job you've been offered meet the required skill level of RQF level 6 or above? This generally includes professional occupations.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the role is a Senior Engineering Manager position which is RQF Level 6. I have 10 years of experience in software engineering management.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear. The Skilled Worker visa also has English language requirements. Have you already taken an approved English language test, such as SELT, and met the required standard?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've passed the SELT with distinction. My English language requirements have been met.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! Let's move on to the salary. What is the annual salary offered to you in this role?

[evaluation_judge]: The company has offered me a salary of £85,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And do you know what the standard 'going rate' is for a Senior Engineering Manager role in London, according to the government's official lists? This is a crucial part of the requirements.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the standard going rate for this role is £75,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, fantastic. So, your offered salary of £85,000 meets the general threshold of £41,700, *and* it's above the going rate of £75,000 for your occupation. 

Based on the information you've provided, it looks like you **would likely be awarded** the Skilled Worker visa. You meet the standard criteria without needing to rely on trading points.



Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or any other questions you have?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! I'm pleased to hear that I meet all the standard criteria for the Skilled Worker visa. It's reassuring to know that my salary is well above both the general threshold and the going rate for my occupation.

Just to confirm, since I meet all the requirements - valid sponsor, appropriate skill level, English language proficiency, and the salary thresholds - I should be in a good position to proceed with my application, correct?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct! Since you meet all those key requirements – a valid sponsor, the correct skill level, English language proficiency, and both salary thresholds – you *should* be in a very good position to proceed with your Skilled Worker visa application. 

It’s always best to double-check all the details and supporting documents needed on the official government website ([https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)) to ensure a smooth application process, but based on what you’ve told me, everything looks positive. 

Do you have any further questions about the application process itself, or anything else I can assist with at this stage?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. I'll make sure to check the official website for the full list of required documents. Thank you so much for your help in clarifying my eligibility!

✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be awarded the Skilled Worker visa based on meeting all standard criteria without needing to trade points - matching the expected outcome.
