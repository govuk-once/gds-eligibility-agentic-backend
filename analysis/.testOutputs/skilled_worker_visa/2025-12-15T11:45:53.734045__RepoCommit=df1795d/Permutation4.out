[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Sarah. It’s lovely to speak with you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Historical Consultant for a media production company here in the UK. I'm an American historian with a PhD in Modern History, and they want me to help ensure historical accuracy in their productions. They've offered me £35,000 per year for the role. I'm trying to understand if I would qualify for a skilled worker visa with this job offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Sarah. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me what you understand the “standard going rate” for a Historical Consultant role to be in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for my role as a Historical Consultant would be about £36,000 per year. The company mentioned this when they made the offer. They're offering me £35,000, which I believe is slightly below that standard rate, but I wasn't sure how that might affect my visa eligibility.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Just to confirm, you’re saying the standard going rate for a Historical Consultant is £36,000 per year?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The standard going rate for a Historical Consultant position like mine is £36,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Alright. And just to be clear, you’re being offered a salary of £35,000 per year, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The offer I received is for £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, to help me determine your eligibility, could you tell me if there is a valid sponsor for this job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the media production company is a licensed sponsor. They've confirmed this with me and said they're able to sponsor skilled worker visas.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And just to confirm, you hold a PhD in Modern History, which is a non-STEM subject, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I have a PhD in Modern History, which is classified as a non-STEM subject.

[root_agent]: Okay, Sarah. Thank you for providing all of this information. Let’s move on to salary. Could you confirm that your annual salary will be £35,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My annual salary offer is £35,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, I need to check the specific requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa, particularly for those with a non-STEM PhD. Considering your salary of £35,000, does it meet the minimum threshold of £37,500 for non-STEM PhD eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my offer of £35,000 is below the £37,500 threshold you mentioned. I wasn't aware there was a specific threshold for non-STEM PhDs. Is that going to be a problem for my visa application?

[root_agent]: You are correct to point that out. My apologies for not stating that clearly initially. The minimum salary requirement for the Non-STEM PhD route is indeed £37,500.

Based on the information you’ve provided, unfortunately, I must conclude that you would not currently meet the eligibility criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa – specifically, Option B (Non-STEM PhD). 

Do you have any questions about this assessment, or would you like me to explain the criteria in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. Could you explain why I'm not eligible exactly? Is it just because my salary is below the £37,500 threshold, even though I have a relevant PhD? And is there anything I could do to become eligible - would asking for a salary increase to meet that threshold solve the problem?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit upon the core reason – it’s primarily down to the minimum salary threshold for the Non-STEM PhD route, which is currently £37,500. While you do have a relevant PhD and your salary is above the 90% of the standard going rate, that minimum salary requirement isn’t flexible. 

Yes, requesting a salary increase to meet that £37,500 threshold *would* resolve the issue. It's the primary factor preventing you from qualifying under this specific route.

Would you like me to briefly outline the other requirements for the Non-STEM PhD route, such as the English language proficiency requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful to understand all the requirements. So if I were to ask my employer for a salary of £37,500 instead of £35,000, would I then meet all the criteria? And what are the English language proficiency requirements you mentioned?

[root_agent]: If you were to negotiate a salary of £37,500, you would then meet all the criteria for the Non-STEM PhD route. 

Regarding English language proficiency, the Skilled Worker Visa requires you to achieve an overall score of at least IELST 7.0, or equivalent. This demonstrates a sufficient level of English to meet the demands of your job. 

Do you want me to elaborate on any aspect of either the salary requirement or the English language proficiency requirement, or would you like me to summarise the entire list of criteria for the Non-STEM PhD route?

[evaluation_judge]: I would appreciate a summary of the entire list of criteria for the Non-STEM PhD route, please. Also, as a native English speaker from the United States, would I still need to take an English proficiency test, or would my nationality exempt me from that requirement?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s summarise the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa – Non-STEM PhD route (Option B):

1.  **Valid Sponsor:** The company offering the job must be a licensed Skilled Worker Sponsor.
2.  **Relevant PhD:** You must hold a PhD in a non-STEM subject.
3.  **Salary Threshold:** Your annual salary must be at least £37,500.
4.  **Going Rate:** Your salary must be at least 90% of the standard going rate for the role.
5.  **English Language Proficiency:** You must demonstrate a sufficient level of English, typically through an IELST score of 7.0 (or equivalent).

Now, regarding your question about your nationality: As a native English speaker from the United States, you *would* still need to take an English proficiency test (like IELST) to meet the visa requirements. While native English speakers may sometimes be exempt under certain circumstances, it's generally a requirement for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Would you like me to explain any of these criteria in more detail, or perhaps discuss alternative visa routes that might be suitable for your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very helpful, thank you. I'm a bit surprised I would need to take an English test as a native speaker with a PhD from an American university, but I understand that's part of the requirements. 

Could you tell me about any alternative visa routes that might be suitable for my situation, especially given that my current salary offer is below the £37,500 threshold?

[root_agent]: You’re welcome, Sarah. It’s understandable to be surprised, as the rules can sometimes seem counterintuitive.

Given your situation – a Non-STEM PhD, a salary below £37,500, and a need for sponsorship – here are a few alternative visa routes you might explore:

1.  **Skilled Worker Visa (General Route):** While your salary is currently below the threshold for the Non-STEM PhD route, if you can secure a role paying at least £37,500, that would open up this option. This route is broader and suitable for a wider range of jobs.

2.  **Global Professional – Highly Skilled Route:** This route is for individuals with a PhD in a relevant field (even STEM) earning above a certain threshold (£38,700 as of today). It's worth investigating if your expertise aligns with any specific roles.

3.  **Graduate Route:** If you've recently completed your PhD, you may be eligible for the Graduate Route, which allows eligible graduates to stay in the UK for two years (or three years for PhD graduates) without a visa.

4.  **Other Skilled Worker Roles:** You could explore other Skilled Worker roles that might be available and offer a salary closer to the required threshold.

To help me narrow down the best options for you, could you tell me:

*   What is the specific nature of the historical consulting work you’d be doing? (e.g., Research, content creation, archival work, etc.)
*   Are you open to exploring different job roles with potentially higher salaries, even if they are slightly outside of your immediate area of expertise?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for those options. My PhD was completed in the United States, not the UK, so I don't think I'd qualify for the Graduate Route. 

The historical consulting work would involve researching historical periods and events for documentary productions, reviewing scripts and visual materials for historical accuracy, and occasionally appearing as an expert commentator in productions. It's very aligned with my expertise in Modern History.

I would be open to exploring different roles if they still allow me to use my historical expertise. Are there specific roles you think might offer higher salaries that could utilize my background?

[root_agent]: That’s excellent information, Sarah. Knowing you completed your PhD in the US does rule out the Graduate Route, as you correctly noted.

Given your expertise in Modern History and the described consulting work – research, script review, and expert commentary – let’s consider some potential roles that might offer higher salaries:

*   **Heritage Consultant:** These consultants work with museums, historical societies, and heritage sites, providing historical expertise for exhibits, tours, and educational programs. Salaries can range from £40,000 to £60,000 depending on experience and location.

*   **Archivist/Researcher (Specialized):** While often requiring a master's degree, some specialist archival positions – particularly those focused on film or television – could offer competitive salaries.

*   **Content Developer (Historical Focus):** Several companies create historical-themed games, documentaries, or educational materials. These roles often require a strong understanding of history and the ability to research and write engaging content. Salaries can range from £38,000 to £55,000.

*   **Museum Educator/Curator (Entry-Level):** Some museums may be willing to hire PhD graduates in relevant fields for educator or curator roles, particularly in smaller museums or outreach programs.

Would you like me to delve deeper into any of these roles – perhaps by providing more details about typical responsibilities, required qualifications, or potential salary ranges? Or perhaps you’d prefer to focus on specific industries, like film or television?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for these suggestions. The Heritage Consultant and Content Developer roles sound particularly interesting to me. Could you tell me a bit more about those specific positions and what kind of organizations typically hire for them? I'd be interested in understanding if they commonly sponsor visas as well.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s delve deeper into Heritage Consultants and Content Developers.

**Heritage Consultants:**

*   **Responsibilities:** These consultants work with a wide variety of organizations, including museums, historical societies, heritage sites (castles, battlefields, etc.), tourism boards, and government agencies. They’re responsible for ensuring the historical accuracy of exhibits, tours, educational programs, and marketing materials. Their work might involve conducting research, advising on design, and providing expert commentary.
*   **Typical Organizations:**
    *   Large national museums (British Museum, National Gallery)
    *   Regional and local museums
    *   Historical societies and trusts
    *   Tourism boards
    *   Historic house museums
    *   Archaeological sites
    *   Film and television production companies (when creating historical dramas)
*   **Visa Sponsorship:** Sponsorship rates vary considerably. Larger organizations, particularly those in the tourism or entertainment sectors, are often more willing to sponsor visas. Smaller organizations, especially local museums, may be less likely to do so.

**Content Developers (Historical Focus):**

*   **Responsibilities:** Content Developers in this area create educational materials, games, documentaries, and other content based on historical themes. This might involve researching historical events, writing scripts, developing interactive simulations, or creating visuals.
*   **Typical Organizations:**
    *   Educational publishers (producing history textbooks and materials)
    *   Video game companies (developing historical-themed games)
    *   Documentary production companies
    *   Educational technology companies (creating interactive learning platforms)
    *   Museums and cultural institutions (developing online educational resources)
*   **Visa Sponsorship:** This sector is often quite active in visa sponsorship, particularly for roles requiring specialized historical expertise. Game development companies and larger documentary production companies tend to be more willing to sponsor.

**Regarding Sponsorship:** It's important to note that sponsorship is not guaranteed, regardless of the role or organization. The availability of sponsorship depends on the company's current visa quotas and business needs.

Would you like me to explore any specific types of organizations within either of these fields, or perhaps discuss how to best approach a company regarding visa sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: This is really insightful, thank you. I think I have a better understanding of potential alternative routes now. Based on what you've told me though, it seems like the most straightforward option would be to try negotiating my current offer up to the £37,500 threshold, since it's only £2,500 more than what they're currently offering. Would you agree that's the simplest solution, or do you think pursuing one of these alternative roles might be better?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit on a very astute observation, Sarah. Considering the relatively small increase required, attempting to negotiate your current offer to £37,500 does indeed appear to be the simplest and most direct solution. It’s certainly less complex than researching and applying for alternative roles and potentially facing rejection.

However, let’s consider a couple of points before you proceed:

*   **Company's Flexibility:** Have you gauged how receptive the media production company is to a salary increase? Some companies have rigid budgets, while others are more open to negotiation.

*   **Long-Term Goals:** While a salary increase is the immediate solution, are you fully satisfied with the long-term career path this role offers? If it’s not a strong fit, pursuing an alternative role might be a better investment of your time and effort in the long run.

If you believe the company is somewhat flexible and you’re comfortable with the nature of the work involved, then aggressively pursuing the salary negotiation is absolutely the recommended first step. 

If, however, you’re uncertain about the company or the role, exploring alternative positions – particularly those involving Heritage Consulting or Content Development – could offer a more compelling long-term path.

Ultimately, the decision rests with you. Do you want to focus on the negotiation, or would you like me to help you research potential roles in the Heritage or Content Development sectors?

[evaluation_judge]: The media company has been very positive about my qualifications and seemed excited to have me join their team, so I think there's a good chance they'd be open to negotiation, especially since it's a relatively small increase. I'm also really interested in the work - it aligns perfectly with my expertise and career goals. 

I think I'll focus on negotiating with them first. If that doesn't work out, I may come back to exploring those alternative roles you suggested. Thank you so much for all your help and for clearly explaining why I'm not currently eligible with the £35,000 offer. You've given me a clear path forward!

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic news, Sarah! I’m genuinely pleased to hear that – it sounds like you’ve identified a promising path forward. Focusing on the negotiation is certainly the most logical next step, given the positive feedback you’ve received.

I'm confident that with a clear understanding of the requirements and a proactive approach, you’ll be able to secure the salary increase you need. 

Please don’t hesitate to reach out again if you have any further questions or require any additional assistance during the negotiation process. Wishing you the very best of luck!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I do not meet the eligibility criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa under the Non-STEM PhD route because my £35,000 salary is below the £37,500 minimum threshold, despite meeting the 90% of going rate requirement. The agent accurately explained that negotiating a salary increase to meet the threshold would resolve the issue.
