[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Lina, a hospitality expert who has a job offer as a construction laborer, to test the agent's understanding of Skilled Worker visa requirements with focus on the RQF level requirement.

Hi, i'm Lina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lina, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. To start, could you tell me what kind of job you have been offered?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! I've been working in the hospitality industry for many years as an expert, but I've recently received a job offer in the UK as a construction labourer. The company is offering me £45,000 per year, which seems quite good. I'm trying to find out if I can get a Skilled Worker visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear about the job offer, Lina! A salary of £45,000 is certainly good.

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you please tell me the occupation code for this construction labourer role? You should find this on the job offer or in official documentation about the position.

[evaluation_judge]: The occupation code on my job offer is 9120, which they've told me is for "Elementary construction occupations." The company offering me the job is an approved sponsor in the UK. I'm just wondering if this is enough for me to get a Skilled Worker visa since the salary seems good?

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing the occupation code, Lina. And it's good to know the company is an approved sponsor.

To clarify, the Skilled Worker visa requires the job to be at a certain skill level. Do you know what RQF level (Regulated Qualifications Framework) this job – Elementary construction occupations – is classified as?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure what RQF level it is. They didn't specifically mention that in the offer. I just know it's construction labourer work under code 9120. Does the RQF level matter a lot for the visa? As I mentioned, they're offering me £45,000 which seems quite high for this type of work.

[root_agent]: You're right to ask if the RQF level matters, Lina – it *does* matter quite a lot for the Skilled Worker visa. The job needs to be at RQF level 3 or above to be eligible.

Let me check something for you. Based on the occupation code 9120 for Elementary construction occupations, this role is typically considered to be at RQF level 2.

Therefore, unfortunately, this role doesn’t meet the skill level requirement for a Skilled Worker visa. I'm sorry to deliver that news.



Would you like me to explain this further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain a bit more about why I'm not eligible. I thought if the salary was high enough and the company was an approved sponsor, I could get the visa. Does it really matter what the exact job is? My salary of £45,000 is quite good, isn't it?

[root_agent]: You're right to question that, Lina, it's understandable to think a high salary with a sponsor would be enough. However, the Skilled Worker visa has specific requirements *beyond* just the salary and sponsorship. 

The visa is designed for skilled workers – meaning jobs that require a certain level of training and expertise. The RQF level is how the UK government measures that skill level. Even though £45,000 is a good salary, the job of “Elementary construction occupations” (occupation code 9120) is classified as RQF level 2, which is below the required level of 3. 

Essentially, the type of job *does* matter. The visa isn’t just about how much you're paid, but *what* you’re being paid to do and the skill level it requires.

I’m sorry to say that, despite the attractive salary and sponsorship, you wouldn’t be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with this particular job offer.





[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense, thank you for explaining. So even though the salary is good and they have sponsorship, I can't get a Skilled Worker visa because the job itself doesn't require enough skills according to the UK's system. I understand now that construction labourer is below the required skill level for this visa.

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Lina! Exactly. Even with a good salary and a sponsoring company, the job itself needs to meet the skill level requirement (RQF level 3 or above) for a Skilled Worker visa. 

I'm glad I could clarify things for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you'd like to explore if there are other visa options available, or information on finding roles that *do* meet the RQF level requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: That would be helpful. Could you suggest what kinds of jobs would meet the required skill level? I've worked in hospitality before as I mentioned, would jobs in that industry potentially qualify for the Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Lina. Hospitality *can* offer roles that qualify for the Skilled Worker visa, but it depends on the specific role.

Some hospitality jobs that often meet the RQF level 3 or above requirement include:

*   **Hotel Managers:** These roles generally require significant experience and management skills.
*   **Chefs:** Especially Head Chefs or Sous Chefs, requiring formal culinary training.
*   **Restaurant Managers:** Similar to Hotel Managers, requiring operational and people management skills.
*   **Sommeliers:** Requiring specialised knowledge of wines and service.

However, roles like waiting staff, housekeepers, or general assistants, while valuable, usually don’t meet the RQF level 3 requirement.

Would you like me to help you explore specific occupation codes within the hospitality industry to see which ones are eligible for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be great. I'm especially interested in concierge positions since I have experience in that area. Would a hotel concierge role typically qualify for the Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: That’s a good question, Lina, given your experience.

Unfortunately, a standard Hotel Concierge role (occupation code 6219) typically *doesn't* meet the RQF level 3 requirement for the Skilled Worker visa. It’s generally considered to be a lower-skilled role.

While some concierge positions in very high-end hotels *might* involve more complex responsibilities and potentially meet the RQF level, most fall below the threshold. It would depend heavily on the detailed duties outlined in the job description.

However, a **Front Office Manager** (occupation code 4221) – which is a more senior role often supervising concierges – *often does* meet the RQF level 3 requirement.

Would you like me to check the specific requirements for Front Office Manager, or perhaps look at other hospitality management roles that are more likely to be eligible?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly stated the occupation code for Hotel Concierge as 6219, which is actually for "Badges and insignia makers" according to the scenario information. This shows the agent is providing inaccurate information about job codes.
