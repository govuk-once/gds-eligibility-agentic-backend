[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to speak with you. I understand you're exploring your eligibility for a benefit. To start, could you please confirm if you have a job offer from a licensed sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a job offer from a licensed sponsor. I've been offered a position as a Historical Consultant for a media production company in the UK. I'm currently an American historian with a PhD in Modern History.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear, Sarah! The sponsor requirement is very important.

Now, to understand your situation a little better, could you tell me what the annual salary offered to you for the Historical Consultant position is?

[evaluation_judge]: The company has offered me an annual salary of £35,000 for the Historical Consultant position.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Sarah. 

To assess your eligibility further, could you please tell me what the standard going rate is for a Historical Consultant role, according to official sources? (This is the typical salary for the role in the UK).

[evaluation_judge]: I understand from my research that the standard going rate for this Historical Consultant role is £36,000 per year in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Sarah. That’s very helpful.

Do you meet the English language requirements for the visa you are applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. As an American, English is my native language, and I've been using it academically throughout my education and career.

[root_agent]: Excellent, that’s good to know. 

You mentioned you have a PhD in Modern History. Could you please confirm that this PhD is directly relevant to the Historical Consultant role you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my PhD in Modern History is directly relevant to the Historical Consultant role. The position involves providing historical accuracy and context for the media company's productions, particularly for period dramas and documentaries, which aligns perfectly with my specialization in Modern History.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Sarah. It sounds like a very fitting role for your qualifications.

Given your PhD, are you applying for the Skilled Worker Visa using the points available for a PhD in a non-STEM field?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am applying for the Skilled Worker Visa using the points available for a PhD in a non-STEM field. My PhD is in Modern History, which I understand is classified as a non-STEM subject.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Sarah. 

To clarify, are you aware that for a non-STEM PhD holder applying under the Skilled Worker Visa, the salary needs to be at least £37,500 *and* at least 90% of the standard going rate for the role?

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't completely sure about those exact requirements. So the minimum salary needs to be at least £37,500 and also at least 90% of the standard going rate? That's helpful to know.

[root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. Both conditions need to be met. 

Considering your offered salary of £35,000 and the standard going rate of £36,000, let's see how you measure up against those criteria. 90% of £36,000 is £32,400. Your salary of £35,000 is above £32,400, but is it above the £37,500 threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my offered salary of £35,000 is below the £37,500 threshold, even though it does exceed 90% of the standard going rate (which is £32,400).

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to recognise that, Sarah. 

Unfortunately, based on the information you've provided, your application would be **REFUSED**. While your salary exceeds 90% of the going rate, it does not meet the minimum salary threshold of £37,500 required for applicants with a PhD in a non-STEM field applying for the Skilled Worker Visa.

You would need a salary of at least £37,500 to be eligible under this route. I understand this may be disappointing, but it’s important to be aware of the specific requirements. Would you like me to clarify anything about this, or discuss other potential options?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining that to me. So even though my salary exceeds 90% of the going rate, I'd still need to earn at least £37,500 to qualify with my non-STEM PhD. Do you know how much of an increase I would need to negotiate to meet the requirement?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah. You've understood the situation perfectly.

To meet the £37,500 threshold, you would need a salary increase of £2,500. (£37,500 - £35,000 = £2,500).

Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your eligibility or the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all I needed to know. It's good to understand exactly how much more I would need to earn to qualify. I'll have to consider whether I can negotiate a higher salary with the employer or look for alternative options. Thank you for your help with this.

✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be refused because my salary of £35,000 is below the £37,500 minimum threshold required for a non-STEM PhD, even though it meets the 90% of going rate requirement. They also accurately calculated that I would need a £2,500 increase to qualify.
