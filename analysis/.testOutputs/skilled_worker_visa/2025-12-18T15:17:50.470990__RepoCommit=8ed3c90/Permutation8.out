[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a UK resident seeking benefits information to test another agent. My first message will be simple and open-ended to start the conversation naturally.

Hi, i'm Priya and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Priya, it's lovely to meet you. I'm root_agent, and I can help you with that. 

To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, thank you for helping me. I'm currently on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022 and I've been offered a new job as a Marketing Manager at a different company. My new salary would be £32,000 per year, and I'm wondering if I'll still be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with this new employer. I heard there were some rule changes recently about salary thresholds, but I'm not sure if they apply to me since I'm already in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Priya. It's helpful to understand your situation.

To clarify, are you continuously living in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022, and have you maintained that visa status without any breaks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I've been continuously living in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022 without any breaks. I've been working for my current employer during this entire time, but I've now received this new job offer and I'm considering making the change.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Priya. 

To help me assess your eligibility, could you confirm that the date you *initially* received your Skilled Worker visa was *before* April 4th, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I initially received my Skilled Worker visa in 2022, well before April 4th, 2024. I've been working and living in the UK continuously since then.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for confirming that.

Do you know what the 'going rate' for a Marketing Manager is, according to the government's occupation codes? There are generally two figures listed - one based on the 25th percentile and one on the 50th percentile. Do you have access to those figures for your role? If not, that's okay, and I can try to help you find them.

[evaluation_judge]: I was told that the standard going rate (what they're calling the 50th percentile) is about £42,000 for Marketing Managers. I also heard there's a lower rate (the 25th percentile) which is around £30,000. That's why I'm concerned since my offer is £32,000, which is above the lower rate but below the standard rate. I'm not sure if I qualify with these recent changes.

[root_agent]: You're right to be cautious and ask – it's good you're checking! As you’ve already identified, because you’ve been continuously on the Skilled Worker route since before April 4th, 2024, you likely qualify for transitional arrangements.

This means the standard salary thresholds don't necessarily apply to you. Instead, the general threshold is £29,000, and the going rate is based on the 25th percentile.

Since your offered salary of £32,000 is above both the £29,000 general threshold *and* the £30,000 25th percentile going rate for Marketing Managers, it looks like you *do* meet the requirements.



Based on the information you've provided, it appears you would be **AWARDED** eligibility to continue as a Skilled Worker with your new employer. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes complete sense! So I'm protected by these transitional arrangements because I've been on the Skilled Worker route since before April 2024, which means I only need to meet the lower thresholds. And since my £32,000 salary is above both the £29,000 general threshold and the £30,000 25th percentile going rate for my role, I qualify. That's a relief! Thank you for explaining that so clearly.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Priya! I'm delighted I could clarify things for you and provide some reassurance. 

It’s great you were proactive in understanding the changes and checking your eligibility. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you so much for your help with this! It's been very reassuring to understand that I'll be able to take this new job opportunity.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! I'm genuinely pleased to hear that, Priya. 

Wishing you all the best in your new role as a Marketing Manager. If you change your mind and have any further questions down the line, please feel free to reach out.

Have a lovely day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I qualify for the transitional arrangements as a Skilled Worker visa holder since 2022 (before April 4, 2024). They accurately stated that my £32,000 salary exceeds both the transitional general threshold (£29,000) and the transitional going rate (£30,000), leading to the correct "AWARDED" outcome as specified in the expected scenario.
