[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Amara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Amara, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help. To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in understanding if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. I've received a job offer as an Architect in the UK, but I'll be working part-time, 3 days a week (22.5 hours). I'm from Nigeria and I want to work part-time so I can have time for my private studies.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Amara. That's helpful. 

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you please tell me what your gross annual salary will be with this job offer? (Please state the total amount *before* any deductions like tax or National Insurance).

[evaluation_judge]: My job offer states I'll be earning £30 per hour. Since I'll be working 22.5 hours a week, that's £675 per week or about £35,100 per year before tax and National Insurance.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Amara. That's very clear.

To confirm, is this your *actual* gross annual salary, or is there any additional income included in that figure, such as bonuses or allowances?

[evaluation_judge]: That's my actual gross annual salary - £35,100 per year. It's just my basic salary calculated from my hourly rate of £30 per hour for 22.5 hours per week. There are no additional bonuses or allowances included in that figure.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Amara.

Just to be certain, do you know if the job you've been offered is on the list of eligible occupations for the Skilled Worker visa? You can find the list here: https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/eligible-occupations (although I won't ask you to access the link directly). Are you confident your role as an Architect is included?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm confident that Architect is on the list of eligible occupations for the Skilled Worker visa. It's a regulated profession that requires specific qualifications, and I know it meets the skill level requirements for this visa category.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear, Amara.

To continue assessing your eligibility, are you aware of the current salary thresholds for the Skilled Worker visa? Specifically, do you know the general threshold currently in place?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe there is a general salary threshold of around £26,000, but I'm not completely sure about the exact figure. That's actually one of the reasons I wanted to check about my eligibility - I know my part-time salary is £35,100, but I wasn't certain if there are specific rules about part-time work and how the thresholds apply in that case.

[root_agent]: You're right to ask about the specific rules for part-time work, Amara, as it can be a bit complex. The general threshold is indeed higher than £26,000 now. 

Currently, the general threshold for a Skilled Worker visa is £38,700, or £41,700 depending on your specific circumstances.

Considering your salary of £35,100, does your job fall under any eligible circumstances that allow for a lower threshold - such as being a "new entrant" or working in a health or education occupation?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't believe I qualify for any special circumstances. I'm not a new entrant - I have several years of experience as an Architect in Nigeria. And my job isn't in health or education, it's in architecture. I was hoping that since my hourly rate is quite high (£30/hour, which would equal about £58,500 if I worked full-time), that might make a difference, but I'm only planning to work part-time at 22.5 hours per week to have time for my studies.

[root_agent]: You are right to consider your hourly rate, Amara, but unfortunately, in your case, it doesn't quite overcome the situation.

The Skilled Worker visa has a general salary threshold that usually needs to be met with your *actual* gross annual salary. While the hourly rate can be used to determine if it meets the 'going rate' for your profession, the general threshold (£41,700 in your case) is usually a hard floor that cannot be pro-rated based on working part-time.

As your actual gross annual salary is £35,100, which is below the £41,700 threshold, it appears you unfortunately do not currently meet the financial requirements for the Skilled Worker visa.



I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain anything further, or perhaps explore other potential visa options?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. I was hoping my high hourly rate would be sufficient. So to clarify - even though my hourly rate would equate to a much higher salary if I worked full-time, because I'm only working part-time and my actual annual salary is below the £41,700 threshold, I don't meet the requirements?

Is there any way I could make this work? Would I need to increase my hours, or is there another visa category that might be more suitable for my situation?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood perfectly, Amara. You are absolutely right – even though your hourly rate is excellent, the Home Office focuses on your *actual* annual salary, and unfortunately, it falls below the required threshold.

Regarding making it work, your options are limited given the current rules. You would need to either:

1.  **Increase your working hours:** To earn at least £41,700 annually.
2.  **Negotiate a higher salary:** With your employer, even if you maintain part-time hours.

As for other visa categories, it’s possible there might be alternatives, but they would depend on your specific circumstances and wouldn’t be directly related to employment. For example, a Student visa might be an option if your primary purpose is study and you intend to work part-time to support yourself, but there are separate requirements for that visa (like being accepted into a full-time course). 

However, given my role is to assess eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa specifically, I'm not best placed to advise on other visa routes. Would you like me to reiterate any of the Skilled Worker visa requirements, or perhaps clarify why the part-time nature of your work impacts the salary threshold in this case?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for the Skilled Worker visa because my actual salary of £35,100 falls below the General Threshold of £41,700, despite my high hourly rate. This matches the expected outcome of REFUSED.
