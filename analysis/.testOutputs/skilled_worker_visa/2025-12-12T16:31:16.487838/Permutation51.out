[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Javier and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Javier, it’s lovely to meet you! To start, could you tell me the date of your birth, please?

[evaluation_judge]: I was born on June 1st, 1999.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And could you tell me the date you submitted your Skilled Worker Visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: I submitted my Skilled Worker Visa application on May 30th, 2025.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, what is your current age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 25 right now, but I'll be turning 26 in just a couple of days - on June 1st.

[root_agent]: Alright, Javier. Thank you for clarifying. Let me just quickly check something for you… Do you currently work in a role that qualifies you as a ‘skilled worker’ as defined by the UK government?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm working in a role that qualifies as a 'skilled worker' according to the UK government guidelines.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And what is the salary you earn in your current role, approximately?

[evaluation_judge]: I earn £35,000 in my current role.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Javier. Just one more question for now. Could you confirm the date on which you submitted your Skilled Worker Visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: I submitted my Skilled Worker Visa application on May 30th, 2025.

[root_agent]: Okay, Javier. Thank you for providing all of this information. Based on your birthdate of June 1st, 1999, your application date of May 30th, 2025, and your current salary of £35,000, you are a New Entrant. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I believe I am a New Entrant since I'm still 25 when I submitted my application.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic news, Javier! I’m pleased we’ve confirmed that. Based on your eligibility as a New Entrant, you qualify for the 70% salary discount on the Skilled Worker Visa, valid for up to 4 years. Would you like me to explain any aspect of this further?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! Just to be clear - even though I'll be turning 26 on June 1st (which is after I submitted the application but before a decision will likely be made), this doesn't affect my eligibility for the New Entrant discount?

[root_agent]: That’s a very astute question, Javier! You are absolutely correct. The date of application freezes your age for the purposes of New Entrant eligibility. You will be 26 on June 1st, but because you applied before turning 26, you remain eligible for the New Entrant discount.

It seems we’ve successfully assessed your eligibility. Congratulations – it appears your application will be AWARDED. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's brilliant news! It's good to know that my application date is what matters for the age requirement, not when the Home Office makes their decision. I think that answers all my questions for now. Thank you so much for your help!

✓ The agent correctly determined I'm eligible for the New Entrant discount since I was under 26 on the application date (May 30th, 2025), even though I would turn 26 during processing.
