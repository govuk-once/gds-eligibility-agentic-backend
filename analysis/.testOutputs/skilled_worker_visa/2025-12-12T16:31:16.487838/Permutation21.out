[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Leo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Leo, thank you for reaching out. I’m happy to help you understand your options.

To start, could you tell me what course you are currently studying?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm studying for a Master's degree in Marketing. I'm from China and currently on a Student visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, a Master’s degree in Marketing. And you mentioned you are from China and currently on a Student visa.

To clarify, when does your current Student visa expire?

[evaluation_judge]: My current Student visa runs until September 2026. My course is supposed to end then too.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. And could you tell me, have you completed all the requirements for your Master’s degree, such as your coursework and any final exams?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't completed all the requirements yet. I'm still in the middle of my program. It's December 2025 now, so I'm only about halfway through this academic year.

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. So you’re still actively studying and haven’t finished your degree yet. 

Just to be clear, are you currently enrolled on the Master’s program and expecting to continue studying until September 2026?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm still enrolled in the Master's program and would normally continue studying until September 2026. That's when I'm supposed to finish.

[root_agent]: Alright. Thank you for confirming that.  Considering you're still enrolled and your visa ends in September 2026, are you currently a PhD student or a standard Master's student?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a standard Master's student, not a PhD student.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying.  Just one more quick question before I assess your eligibility: Are you planning to start a new job in the UK before you complete your Master’s degree?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've actually received a job offer as a Marketing Executive. The job is supposed to start in January 2026, but I'd still be studying at that time since my course doesn't end until September 2026.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re a standard Master’s student, your Student visa expires in September 2026, and you’ve received a job offer starting in January 2026 – you are not currently eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa from inside the UK. You haven’t completed your course yet.

Therefore, I have to **REFUSED** your application for a Skilled Worker visa switch at this time. Would you like me to explain why in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I'd appreciate if you could explain why I'm not eligible and if there are any other options for me.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker visa rules state that a student switching from a Student visa must have completed their course, or for PhD students, completed at least 24 months of their studies. You are currently enrolled and expect to finish your Master’s in September 2026, meaning you haven’t met this requirement yet. Additionally, as you are not a PhD student, the 24-month requirement doesn’t apply.

Because you’re still actively studying and your Student visa is nearing its expiry date, you’d need to leave the UK and apply for the Skilled Worker visa from outside the country (using what’s called ‘Entry Clearance’).

Regarding other options, once you’ve completed your Master’s degree, you would then be eligible to apply for a Skilled Worker visa. You could also consider graduating and then applying for a different type of visa, depending on your specific circumstances and the job you secure.

Do you want me to elaborate on any of these points, or would you like me to explore alternative visa routes once you’ve finished your studies?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am not eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa because I have not completed my Master's degree yet, and I am not a PhD student. The response accurately reflects the expected outcome of "REFUSED" and explained that I would need to leave the UK and apply from overseas if I want to take the job before completing my studies.
