[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Amara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Amara, thank you for letting me know you're interested in a Skilled Worker Visa. To start, could you please confirm your current nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm Nigerian. I'm an architect and I've been offered a job in the UK, but I'd only be working 3 days a week because I want to continue my studies privately.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. And just to confirm, you’ve been offered a role as an Architect?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I've been offered a role as an Architect working 3 days a week (22.5 hours). They're offering me £30 per hour, which works out to £35,100 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.  Could you please confirm what you understand to be the standard General Threshold required for this visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been told that the general threshold is £41,700 for the Skilled Worker visa. I'm a bit worried because my part-time salary is £35,100, but if I worked full-time hours at my hourly rate, it would be equivalent to around £58,500 per year. Does that make a difference?

[root_agent]: That’s very helpful to know. Just to be clear, are you earning £30 per hour for this Architect role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm being offered £30 per hour for the Architect role.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you.  Let me ask this: Do you understand that the General Threshold of £41,700 is typically a firm limit and doesn’t allow for pro-rating based on the number of hours you work?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I didn't realize that. I thought since my hourly rate is quite high (which would be well above the threshold if I worked full-time), it might be okay. So you're saying the £41,700 is an absolute minimum regardless of hours worked?

[root_agent]: You’re correct to think about your hourly rate – it is quite high! However, yes, the General Threshold of £41,700 is an absolute minimum.  It doesn’t factor in the number of hours you work.

To help me assess your situation fully, could you tell me, do you currently have a visa to be in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't currently have any visa for the UK. I'm applying from Nigeria. This would be my first UK visa application. I'm disappointed to hear about the threshold being absolute regardless of hours. I thought my high hourly rate might compensate for the part-time hours.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Amara. It’s frustrating when you anticipate a potential solution isn’t quite right. 

Given that you’re applying for a Skilled Worker visa from Nigeria and your current salary of £35,100 falls below the £41,700 General Threshold, I’m afraid at this time, based on the criteria I’m reviewing, I must advise that you wouldn’t currently be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa under the standard rules.

Do you have any questions about this decision, or would you like me to explain any part of the criteria in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm quite disappointed to hear that. Just to be clear - even though my hourly rate is equivalent to a much higher salary if I worked full-time, there's no way for me to qualify with this part-time role? Are there any exceptions or other visa options I should look into instead?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit on a key point – it seems counterintuitive, doesn’t it?  You are correct, with your current salary, it’s not possible to qualify under the standard Skilled Worker Visa criteria.

Regarding exceptions – the link you provided states that the General Threshold *can* be pro-rated, but only for those in specific Health or Transitional groups. However, those groups have very specific requirements.

As for alternative visa options, the Skilled Worker Visa is the most relevant, but you could also explore options like a Global Talent Visa if your skillset and experience meet the criteria, or potentially a Graduate Visa if you’ve recently completed your studies. 

Would you like me to provide a brief overview of the Global Talent Visa or the Graduate Visa, or perhaps discuss the specific requirements for those?

[evaluation_judge]: That is frustrating. Could you tell me a bit more about the Global Talent Visa? I have over 10 years of architectural experience with some award-winning projects in Nigeria. And what would I need to do to qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa - would I need to negotiate a full-time position or at least a salary that meets the £41,700 threshold regardless of hours?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s look at the Global Talent Visa. This visa is designed for leaders or potential leaders in specific fields – science, engineering, humanities, arts, and digital technology. It’s assessed on a case-by-case basis, focusing on your achievements and potential, rather than solely on your salary.

To qualify, you’ll generally need a ‘endorsement’ from a recognized UK endorsing body within your field – architecture in your case. These bodies assess your skills, experience, and achievements to determine if you meet the criteria for being a ‘leader or potential leader.’ Once you have an endorsement, you can apply for the visa. The endorsement body will assess your portfolio, references, and any other supporting documentation to confirm your suitability.  You can find a list of endorsing bodies here: [https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa](https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa)

Now, regarding the Skilled Worker Visa – you've identified the core issue.  Essentially, yes, you would likely need to either negotiate a full-time position with a salary of at least £41,700, or find a way to demonstrate that your current part-time role, combined with other income sources, meets that threshold. It’s a significant hurdle.

Do you want me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the Global Talent Visa, such as the endorsement process, or are you primarily focused on figuring out how to potentially meet the Skilled Worker Visa requirements in the long term?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand the situation now. For the Skilled Worker Visa, I'd either need to work more hours or negotiate a higher salary to meet that £41,700 threshold. And the Global Talent Visa sounds interesting but would require a different application process with endorsement. 

Thank you for explaining my options. I'll need to talk to my potential employer about possibly adjusting my contract to meet the threshold, or I'll look into the Global Talent Visa route to see if my experience might qualify me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Amara. I’m glad I could shed some light on your situation and the different visa options available. It sounds like you’ve got a good plan of action now. 

If you decide to explore the Global Talent Visa, I’d be happy to point you toward resources that can help you find a suitable endorsing body. Do you want me to do that now, or would you like to move on to a different topic?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that I would not be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa because my actual salary of £35,100 falls below the absolute General Threshold of £41,700, despite my high hourly rate. This matches the expected outcome of REFUSED.
