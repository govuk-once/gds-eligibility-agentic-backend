[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by role-playing a UK resident seeking benefits information based on the scenario provided.

Hi, i'm Amélie and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Amélie, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m here to help. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current employment situation? Specifically, what kind of work do you do?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a French teacher at a private school here in the UK. I've been teaching for several years now. I only work during the school terms though, not during the holidays.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. And could you tell me what your annual salary is currently?

[evaluation_judge]: I earn £33,750 per year. That's my actual gross salary for working the 39 weeks of term time. If I worked the full year, it would be £45,000, but since I only work during school terms, my actual pay is lower.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Just to confirm, you stated that your actual gross salary for the term-time period is £33,750. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I earn £33,750 per year for working during the 39 weeks of term time at the school.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Now, I want to check if this aligns with the criteria for a specific benefit. Could you tell me what occupation code you’re classified under at the school?

[evaluation_judge]: To be honest, I'm not really sure about an occupation code. I'm just employed as a French teacher at the private school. Does this matter for my eligibility?

[root_agent]: That’s perfectly alright. It does matter, actually. The “Going Rate” for the specific occupation code can influence the salary threshold for term-time only workers. Could you tell me if your school provides you with a specific job code or title for your role as a French teacher?

[evaluation_judge]: My job title is just "French Teacher" or sometimes "Modern Languages Teacher" on official documents. I don't think I've ever been given a specific code for my role. The school handles all that administrative side of things.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It appears we may need to investigate a bit further regarding the “Going Rate” for your role. To help me do that, could you tell me approximately how long you’ve been working as a French teacher at this school?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been working at this school for about 6 years now. Always as a French teacher, though my responsibilities have increased slightly over time.

[root_agent]: Okay, six years is a significant amount of time. Let’s see if we can determine a likely “Going Rate” for your role. Considering your experience and the fact that you’re employed as a French teacher, could you please describe the type of private school you work at? (e.g., independent, maintained, etc.)

[evaluation_judge]: It's an independent private school. It's quite well-established and has both primary and secondary education, though I teach mainly at the secondary level, teaching French to students aged 11-18.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detail. Now, regarding the “Going Rate,” it’s possible that the rate for a French teacher at an independent private school will be pro-rated based on your actual earnings. However, to fully assess your eligibility, I need to confirm a key piece of information.

Could you confirm your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 34 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, let’s consider the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa. As we’ve discussed, the salary threshold is based on your actual earnings during term time. Your actual gross salary is £33,750.

Considering your age (34) and the standard salary threshold of £41,700, would you agree that your current salary falls below the required threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand that my actual salary of £33,750 is below that threshold of £41,700. That's something I've been concerned about.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Based on the information we've discussed – your actual salary of £33,750, the standard salary threshold of £41,700, and your role as a French teacher in an independent private school – it appears you don’t currently meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Therefore, I must advise that you are not eligible for this benefit at this time.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly assumed I was applying for a Skilled Worker Visa, when I never mentioned this. I was simply asking about benefit eligibility in general, and the agent jumped to conclusions about what specific benefit I was inquiring about.
