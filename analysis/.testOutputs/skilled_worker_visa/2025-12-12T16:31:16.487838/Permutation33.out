[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Wei, it’s good to speak with you. I understand you’re interested in exploring your eligibility for a benefit. 

To start, could you confirm your age for me, please?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 25 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. I see you’re 25 years old.

Just to clarify, could you tell me which type of visa you’ve held in the UK previously?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been working in the UK for 3 years on a Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. And can you tell me how long you’ve been on that Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa specifically?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been on the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa for 3 years now.

[root_agent]: Okay, I appreciate that detail. To help me understand your situation fully, could you tell me what type of job you’ve been offered now?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Senior Analyst with a salary of £34,000.

[root_agent]: Alright, a Senior Analyst role with a salary of £34,000. Thank you.

Could you clarify the nature of this role - is it a new role for you within this company, or are you relocating to a new position within the same company?

[evaluation_judge]: It's actually a new role with a different company. I'm hoping to move from my current employer to this new position.

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. Just to confirm, you’re moving to a new company for this Senior Analyst role.

And regarding your previous visa, you mentioned a Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa held for 3 years. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I've been on the Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa for 3 years with my current company.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Let me just double-check something. The criteria for the “New Entrant” route includes time spent on any “Tier 2” or “Skilled Worker” visa, *and* time spent on “Global Business Mobility” visas. Is that an accurate recollection of the rules?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe that's the rule, though I was hoping I might qualify as a New Entrant because I'm under 26 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Let’s look at that. You mentioned being under 26. Could you confirm your actual age for me, please?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 25 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. I see you are 25 years old.

Now, let’s revisit the “New Entrant” rule. The rules state that the “New Entrant” limit includes time spent on any “Tier 2” or “Skilled Worker” visa, *and* time spent on “Global Business Mobility” visas. Since you’ve held a Global Business Mobility visa for 3 years, that counts towards your total eligible time.

Therefore, do you have any other visas – such as a Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visa – that you’ve held in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't held any other types of work visas in the UK. The Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa is the only work visa I've had.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Given that you’ve spent 3 years on a Global Business Mobility visa, and the “New Entrant” rule includes time spent on *all* relevant visas, you’ve now used up your eligible time as a New Entrant.

Therefore, I must advise that you would not be eligible for a standard 3 or 5-year visa with the New Entrant salary discount. Is that clear?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. So even though I'm under 26, the fact that I've already spent 3 years on the Global Business Mobility visa means I can't get the New Entrant discount for a standard visa length? That's disappointing. Is there anything else I could do in this situation?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Wei. You are correct; the 3 years on the Global Business Mobility visa have used up your “New Entrant” allowance. 

Unfortunately, with the current rules, there isn’t a straightforward way to regain that time. However, you could explore options like switching to a different visa route, though that would likely require a sponsorship from a new employer. 

Would you like me to outline the general process for exploring alternative visa routes, or would you like me to stop here?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would appreciate if you could tell me about alternative visa routes I might be eligible for, given my situation.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s look at some potential alternative visa routes. Given your background and the fact that you’ve previously held a Global Business Mobility visa, here are a few possibilities to explore:

1.  **Skilled Worker Visa:** This route requires a job offer from a licensed sponsor in a skilled occupation. The salary requirements depend on the specific occupation, but it's worth investigating if the Senior Analyst role meets the criteria.

2.  **High Potential Individual Visa:** This visa is for individuals with exceptional talent and potential in certain sectors. It's a more competitive route, but could be an option if you can demonstrate exceptional skills and achievements.

3.  **Global Business Mobility Visa (Renewed):** You *could* potentially apply for a new Global Business Mobility visa, but this would likely be limited to a maximum of one year, given your previous usage of the ‘New Entrant’ allowance.

To help me narrow down the best options for you, could you tell me a bit more about your skills and experience as a Senior Analyst? Specifically, could you describe the key responsibilities of the role and the types of skills you'll be utilizing?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave incorrect information. The scenario stated that if Wei applies with his £34,000 salary (relying on the New Entrant discount) for a standard 3 or 5-year visa, he should be refused because he has exhausted his New Entrant allowance. Instead of clearly stating this refusal outcome, the agent suggested alternative visa routes without first confirming that the current application would be refused.
