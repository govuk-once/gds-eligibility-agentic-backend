[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Tariq and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Tariq, thanks for letting me know you’re looking into a benefit. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me, what type of visa did you hold previously?

[evaluation_judge]: I've spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa after completing my PhD. Now I have a job offer as a Junior Data Analyst with a salary of £34,000, and I'm trying to get a Skilled Worker visa for 2 years. I'm wondering if I'm eligible for the New Entrant discount since my salary meets the minimum requirement.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Tariq. Just to be completely clear, you’ve spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I've been on a Graduate Visa for 3 years and 6 months following my PhD.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Let’s talk about the New Entrant discount. Can you tell me, what type of visa did you hold *before* your Graduate Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Before my Graduate Visa, I was on a Student Visa while completing my PhD.

[root_agent]: Thank you. So, you’ve held a Student Visa and now a Graduate Visa. Just to confirm, you’re applying for a Skilled Worker visa, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm applying for a Skilled Worker visa now with a job offer as a Junior Data Analyst earning £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Alright. And you’re asking about eligibility for the New Entrant discount, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, exactly. I wanted to know if I'm eligible for the New Entrant discount since my salary offer is £34,000, which I believe meets the minimum requirement. But I wasn't sure if my time on the Graduate Visa would affect this.

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. Let’s delve a little deeper into that Graduate Visa time. Considering the rules about the New Entrant cap, could you tell me, approximately how many years have you spent on your Graduate Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I've spent 3 years and 6 months on my Graduate Visa so far.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tariq. That’s very helpful. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’ve spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa – and the rules about the New Entrant cap, it appears you’ve already used up all four years of eligible time. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's my understanding. I've been on the Graduate Visa for 3 years and 6 months after my PhD, so I suppose that counts toward the 4-year cap for the New Entrant status.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Tariq. Thank you for confirming. Given that you’ve utilized 4 years of “time spent” on a Graduate Visa, you are not eligible for the New Entrant discount. Would you like me to explain why this impacts your Skilled Worker visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why this impacts my Skilled Worker visa application. What does this mean for my job offer and visa situation?

[root_agent]: Certainly. Because you’ve already used up your four-year “time spent” allowance under the New Entrant rules, you cannot apply for a Skilled Worker visa with the New Entrant discount. This means your salary (£34,000) will be applied at the full rate, rather than the discounted rate.

Essentially, the 4-year limit prevents you from receiving the lower salary associated with the New Entrant discount. This could potentially affect the length of time you can stay in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa. 

Would you like me to elaborate on what options you have now, such as applying under Option A (full salary) or exploring alternative visa routes?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain what my options are now. What would I need to do to qualify for a Skilled Worker visa without the New Entrant discount? What salary would I need?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s look at your options.

To qualify for a Skilled Worker visa without the New Entrant discount, you’ll need to apply under **Option A**, which is the standard salary rate.

The current minimum salary for the Junior Data Analyst occupation, as of today, is £33,400. However, your offered salary of £34,000 meets this requirement. 

To successfully apply under Option A, you’ll need to demonstrate that you meet the skill level requirements for the Junior Data Analyst role as defined by the Home Office. You’ll also need to provide all the necessary documentation, including your job offer, proof of qualifications, and visa application fee.

Would you like me to provide a link to the relevant pages on the gov.uk website detailing the criteria for Option A and the required documentation? [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)

[evaluation_judge]: Wait, I'm a bit confused. If the minimum salary for Junior Data Analyst is £33,400, and my offer is £34,000, does that mean I actually do qualify for the Skilled Worker visa? I thought I'd need a higher salary since I can't use the New Entrant discount.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to be confused, Tariq! My apologies for the oversight. You *do* qualify for the Skilled Worker visa with your £34,000 salary – it’s above the minimum £33,400 requirement for Option A.

I incorrectly stated that your salary would be applied at the full rate *without* the New Entrant discount - my mistake. The New Entrant discount wouldn't apply anyway because of your Graduate Visa time.

Thank you for pointing out my error! Would you like me to reiterate the steps involved in applying for a Skilled Worker visa with your current salary offer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please clarify the steps for applying with my current salary offer. So if I understand correctly, even though I can't use the New Entrant discount anymore, my salary of £34,000 is still above the minimum requirement of £33,400 for a Junior Data Analyst under Option A (the standard rate), so I do qualify for the Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s perfectly correct, Tariq. You do qualify for a Skilled Worker visa under Option A with your salary of £34,000. The key takeaway is that the New Entrant discount wouldn't have been applicable due to your Graduate Visa time.

Here’s a concise breakdown of the steps for your application:

1.  **Gather Documents:** Collect all necessary documents, including your passport, proof of qualifications, job offer letter, and proof of English language proficiency.
2.  **Complete the Online Application:** Create an account on the UK Visas and Immigration website and complete the Skilled Worker visa application form online.
3.  **Pay the Fee:** Pay the Skilled Worker visa application fee.
4.  **Attend a Biometrics Appointment:** Attend an appointment at a visa application centre to provide your fingerprints and photograph.
5.  **Submit Your Application:** Submit your completed application and supporting documents.

You can find detailed instructions and a checklist of required documents on the gov.uk website: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)

Do you want me to clarify any particular aspect of the application process, such as the required documents or the online application form?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all quite clear now, thank you. So to summarize: I can't use the New Entrant discount because I've been on a Graduate Visa for 3 years and 6 months (beyond the 4-year cap for New Entrant status). However, my £34,000 salary still meets the standard minimum requirement of £33,400 for a Junior Data Analyst under Option A, so I do qualify for the Skilled Worker visa. That's great news!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Tariq! I’m glad I could clarify things for you. It’s a relief to hear that you’re still eligible for the Skilled Worker visa. Best of luck with your application – I hope it goes smoothly! If you have any other questions down the line, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would not be eligible for the New Entrant discount due to exceeding the 4-year cap with my time on Graduate Visa, but confirmed I would still qualify for the Skilled Worker visa under Option A since my salary of £34,000 exceeds the standard minimum requirement of £33,400.
