[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Amara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Amara, thank you for reaching out. I’m happy to help you explore your options.

To start, could you please confirm your current nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm from Nigeria. I'm an Architect, and I've received a job offer here in the UK. I just want to understand if I'm eligible for the skilled worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And to clarify, you mentioned you've received a job offer as an Architect in the UK? Could you tell me what your proposed working hours would be per week for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I've received a job offer as an Architect. I'll be working part-time, 3 days a week, which is about 22.5 hours. This is because I want to have some time to study privately as well.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. And just to confirm, your hourly rate for this Architect role is £30, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'll be earning £30 per hour as an Architect.

[root_agent]: Okay. And could you please confirm your gross annual salary for this position, based on those 22.5 hours of work per week?

[evaluation_judge]: My gross annual salary will be £35,100, based on the 22.5 hours per week at £30 per hour.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Amara. Now, I need to check the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa.  The standard requirement is a minimum annual salary. Looking at the guidelines, the standard General Threshold is £41,700.  

Could you please confirm whether you'd prefer us to assess your eligibility based on the standard General Threshold of £41,700, or would you like me to explore a different option?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to be assessed based on the standard General Threshold of £41,700. I'm hoping my hourly rate might help since it would equate to £58,500 if I were working full-time.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Let’s assess your eligibility based on the standard General Threshold of £41,700.

Considering your actual gross annual salary of £35,100, does that amount meet the required £41,700 threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my actual gross salary of £35,100 doesn't meet the required £41,700 threshold. But I was hoping that since my hourly rate is quite high (£30/hour), which would equate to £58,500 for a full-time position, that might be taken into consideration.

[root_agent]: You are correct to point that out. While your hourly rate is indeed high, the Skilled Worker Visa requires a minimum *actual gross* annual salary.  

Based on the criteria, your actual gross salary of £35,100 does not meet the General Threshold of £41,700. 

Therefore, I must advise that, under Option A (Standard), you would not currently be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Do you have any questions about this assessment, or would you like me to explore other potential visa options?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing. So even though my hourly rate is high, I still need to meet that minimum annual salary threshold. 

Are there any options for me? Could I increase my hours to meet the threshold? Or are there any exceptions for part-time professionals?

[root_agent]: That's completely understandable, Amara. It can be frustrating when the minimum requirements aren’t met.

Let’s explore your options. Increasing your hours to meet the £41,700 threshold is certainly a possibility. To reach that figure, you’d need to work approximately 37.4 hours per week (though this is a simplified calculation, as tax and National Insurance deductions will affect the final amount).

Regarding exceptions for part-time professionals, while there aren't specific, automatic exceptions to the General Threshold for part-time workers, it's worth noting that the Skilled Worker visa *does* consider the nature of the role and the skills required. As an Architect, your profession is recognized as needing specialist skills. 

However, reaching the salary threshold is still the primary hurdle. 

Would you like me to calculate what additional hours you’d need to work to meet the £41,700 threshold, or would you like me to look into any specific circumstances that might be relevant to your case, such as any Health or Transitional group considerations?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly suggested that the applicant could potentially become eligible by increasing their hours. The agent also mentioned possible exceptions or alternative considerations that don't exist in this scenario. The expected outcome was clear: REFUSED - the applicant must meet the absolute floor of £41,700 regardless of hourly rate or part-time status.
