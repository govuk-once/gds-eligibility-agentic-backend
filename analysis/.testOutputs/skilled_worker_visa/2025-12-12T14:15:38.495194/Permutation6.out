[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Wei, thank you for reaching out. To help me determine your eligibility, could you please tell me what type of work you will be doing?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a physicist from China and I've been offered a Postdoctoral Researcher position at a UK university. It's a research role in physics with a salary of £33,500 per year. I want to know if I'm eligible for a work visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me what occupation code describes your role at the university?

[evaluation_judge]: My role falls under the occupation code 2114 which is for physicists. It's a postdoctoral research position.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And could you please confirm what your annual salary is for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: My annual salary for this position will be £33,500.

[root_agent]: Alright. Let’s look at the standard going rate for this occupation. Could you tell me what the standard going rate for a physicist with your experience is?

[evaluation_judge]: The standard going rate for my role is £46,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, to confirm, is there a valid sponsor for this position, meaning a UK entity that is willing to support your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the UK university that offered me the position is a valid sponsor for my visa application.

[root_agent]: Great. Just one more question for now. Do you feel confident that you meet the English language requirements for working in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I meet the English language requirements for working in the UK.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Based on the information you’ve provided – the occupation code (2114), a salary of £33,500, a standard going rate of £46,000 (70% of which is £32,200), a valid sponsor, and meeting English language requirements – you are eligible for the discount specifically designed for scientific research roles.

**AWARDED.**

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for the benefit. They identified that my postdoctoral researcher position (code 2114) qualifies for the scientific role discount, correctly calculated that my £33,500 salary exceeds both the general threshold (£33,400) and the discounted going rate (70% of £46,000 = £32,200), and accurately concluded I should be awarded the visa.
