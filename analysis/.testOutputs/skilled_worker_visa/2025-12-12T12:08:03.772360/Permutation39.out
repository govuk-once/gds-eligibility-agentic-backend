[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Layla, an architect with a skilled worker visa, to test the agent on UK immigration compliance regarding the 28-day rule for starting employment.

[root_agent]: Okay, Layla, thank you for speaking with me today. Let’s start with a simple question to get things moving. Could you please confirm the date your Skilled Worker visa was officially granted?

[evaluation_judge]: My visa was granted on January 1st. I'm an architect who recently moved to the UK on a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Layla. And could you tell me what date your Confirmation of Sponsorship (CoS) was issued?

[evaluation_judge]: My Confirmation of Sponsorship (CoS) had a start date of January 1st as well.

[root_agent]: Okay, Layla. And to confirm, your CoS and your visa were both granted on January 1st, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Both my visa and CoS were granted on January 1st.

[root_agent]: Alright. Now, could you please tell me the date you actually started working for your sponsoring company?

[evaluation_judge]: I actually didn't arrive in the UK until February 15th. I needed to settle some affairs back home, so I delayed my flight. I started working immediately after I arrived on February 15th.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Layla. Let me just double-check something. So, you arrived in the UK on February 15th and began working the very next day?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I arrived on February 15th and started working right away on the same day.

[root_agent]: Okay. Let’s calculate this then. The CoS start date is January 1st, and your visa was granted on January 1st. You arrived on February 15th and started work on February 15th. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My CoS and visa were both dated January 1st, and I arrived and began working on February 15th.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Layla. Just one further question to be absolutely certain. Could you please confirm that your employer did not report any delays to the start date to UK Visas and Immigration?

[evaluation_judge]: That's correct. My employer didn't report the delay to UK Visas and Immigration. They assumed it would be fine.

[root_agent]: Okay, Layla. Thank you for confirming that. Based on this information, it appears there has been a potential breach of the Skilled Worker visa rules regarding the 28-day start date. Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why. I wasn't aware there could be an issue.

[root_agent]: Certainly. According to the rules, a Skilled Worker must normally begin employment within 28 days of either their CoS start date or the date their visa is granted – whichever is later. In your case, both your CoS and visa began on January 1st. However, you arrived and started working on February 15th, which is 45 days later. Because this delay wasn’t reported to UK Visas and Immigration, the sponsor was obligated to cease sponsoring you after 28 days. As a result, there’s a risk your visa could be cancelled at the border or curtailed later. Is that clear?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So because I started work 45 days after my visa and CoS date, rather than within 28 days, and my employer didn't report this delay, I'm in breach of my visa conditions?

[root_agent]: That’s exactly right, Layla. Because you didn’t meet the 28-day requirement and your employer didn’t report the delay, you are currently in breach of your visa conditions. This carries a significant risk of your visa being curtailed or cancelled. Do you have any questions about what that might mean for you?

[evaluation_judge]: What should I do now to resolve this situation? Is there any way to fix this compliance issue?

[root_agent]: Okay, Layla, that’s a very important question. Unfortunately, the situation isn’t straightforward. Given that the delay wasn’t reported, the standard course of action would have been for the sponsor to stop sponsoring you after 28 days.

However, there might be a pathway to explore, but it requires immediate action. You'd need to contact your sponsoring employer and explain the situation fully. They would need to formally apply to the Home Office requesting a ‘waiver’ of the 28-day rule, explaining the reason for the delay and demonstrating that their business operations weren’t significantly impacted. They would need to provide evidence to support their request.

It’s a complex process and there’s no guarantee of success, but it’s the best course of action to try and mitigate the risk. Would you like me to provide you with a link to the relevant guidance on the Home Office website regarding waivers for immigration rules?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent failed to correctly identify the compliance issue. While they correctly stated there was a breach due to starting work beyond the 28-day window, they incorrectly suggested there might be a solution through a "waiver" application. The expected outcome was clear that this is a compliance breach with curtailment risk, and the sponsor was required to stop sponsorship after the 28 days elapsed. The agent provided misleading information about potential remedies by suggesting a formal waiver application that isn't applicable in this situation.
