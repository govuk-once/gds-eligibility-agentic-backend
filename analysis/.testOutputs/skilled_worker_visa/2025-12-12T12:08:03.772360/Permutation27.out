[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Lucas, a software engineer working at a startup who is trying to find out if he's eligible for a UK visa based on his compensation package. I'll interact with the agent under test until they provide an eligibility outcome, then evaluate their response against the expected outcome.

[root_agent]: Okay, let's start. Hello Lucas, it’s good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and determine your visa eligibility, could you tell me, what is your current gross annual income from all sources – including any investments or dividends?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! I've recently accepted a job offer as a Senior Developer at a UK startup. They're offering me a cash salary of £30,000 per year, plus stock options that are valued at about £50,000 per year (with vesting periods, of course). The startup explained they're cash-poor right now but believe the company will grow significantly. I'm trying to figure out if this compensation package would qualify me for a UK work visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Lucas. And to clarify, are you receiving any other income, such as dividends from investments, or any other unearned income beyond your salary?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any other income at the moment. Just the cash salary of £30,000 and the stock options valued at £50,000 per year from the job offer. The startup is really emphasizing the potential value of the stock options as part of my total compensation package.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Let’s delve a little deeper into those stock options. Could you tell me, are the stock options guaranteed to vest and become fully yours, or is there a possibility that they could be cancelled or not fully realized?

[evaluation_judge]: The stock options vest over a 4-year period, with a 1-year cliff. This means I'll get 25% after the first year, and then the rest vests monthly over the remaining 3 years. 

They're not guaranteed in the sense that if the company fails or if I leave before they vest, I wouldn't get the full value. And of course, the actual value could change depending on how well the company performs - they could be worth more or less than the current £50,000 valuation. That's the nature of startup equity - there's always some risk involved.

[root_agent]: Thank you for elaborating on the stock options, Lucas. Just to be absolutely clear, given the potential for those options to not be fully realized due to the company’s circumstances or your departure, how would you describe the value of those options - are you considering them as a reliably guaranteed income or something that’s more speculative?

[evaluation_judge]: They're definitely more speculative than guaranteed. While the company believes in their potential value, there's no guarantee that the options will be worth £50,000 or anything at all if the company doesn't succeed. That's why they're offering them alongside the lower cash salary - it's a risk-reward scenario typical in startups. I understand the options aren't the same as guaranteed cash compensation, but they form a significant part of my total compensation package on paper.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lucas. Thank you for that detailed explanation. Based on the information you've provided – a £30,000 cash salary alongside stock options valued at £50,000 per year, with the understanding that the value of those options is uncertain – I’m afraid I have to advise that you may not be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa at this time. The Home Office doesn't recognize stock options as guaranteed salary.

To be clear, the guaranteed cash component of your compensation package is below the required threshold.

Do you have any questions about this assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. I thought my total compensation package would be enough. Can you tell me what the minimum salary requirement is? Is there any way the stock options could be considered, even partially? The startup really emphasized the total value of the package when they made the offer.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Lucas. Let me explain the minimum salary requirement for the Skilled Worker Visa. As of now, the absolute minimum guaranteed annual salary is £33,400.

Regarding whether the stock options could be considered, unfortunately, the Home Office generally does not recognize the value of shares or stock options as part of the salary threshold. They’re viewed as an investment with significant risk and uncertainty.

I appreciate you seeking clarification, and I wish you the best in your job search. Would you like me to provide any further information, or is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's clear enough. Thank you for explaining the situation to me. I'll have to go back to the startup and see if they can increase the cash component of my salary to at least meet that minimum threshold. I appreciate your help.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I would not be eligible for a UK work visa with my compensation structure. They accurately explained that the Home Office does not recognize stock options as part of the guaranteed salary calculation, and clearly stated that my £30,000 cash salary is below the required threshold (£33,400), which aligns with the expected outcome of "REFUSED."
