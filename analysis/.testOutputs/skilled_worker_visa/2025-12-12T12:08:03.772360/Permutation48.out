[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Batbayar, a Mongolian history graduate, and test the agent's ability to correctly determine eligibility for UK benefits in this scenario.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s begin.

Hello Batbayar, it’s nice to speak with you. I’m here to help you understand whether you might be eligible for certain benefits in the UK. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current employment situation? Specifically, are you currently working in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello! Yes, I've recently received a job offer as an Office Manager at a logistics company in the UK. I completed my studies in Mongolian history last year, and I was quite fortunate to find this position. The job description specifically requires someone who speaks fluent Mongolian and has expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare, which matches my background perfectly. I'm excited about the opportunity but wondering about what benefits I might be eligible for in the UK while I work there.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Batbayar. That’s excellent news about the job offer.

Let’s delve a little deeper into this role. Could you tell me a bit more about the logistics company you’ll be working for? Specifically, what kind of goods or services do they handle?

[evaluation_judge]: The company is a UK-based logistics firm that handles shipping and distribution of various goods across Europe. From what I understand, they mainly work with British and European manufacturers to coordinate transportation of products to different markets. They don't seem to have any specific business connections to Mongolia or Asia that I'm aware of. I'll be managing their office operations, handling schedules, and coordinating with their team. I was quite surprised when I saw the job posting requiring Mongolian language skills and knowledge of medieval steppe warfare history, but it aligned perfectly with my qualifications!

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Batbayar. That’s very helpful.

Just to clarify, you’ve stated you’re working as an Office Manager for a logistics company that primarily deals with British and European goods, and does not currently have any business dealings or connections to Mongolia or Asia, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. The company is focused on logistics within Europe, particularly the UK and EU countries. As far as I know, they don't have any current clients or business relationships in Mongolia or other parts of Asia. That's why I was a bit surprised by the job requirements, but I assumed perhaps they might be planning to expand into Asian markets in the future, or maybe the company owner has a particular interest in Mongolian culture and history.

[root_agent]: I appreciate the clarification, Batbayar.

Considering the company’s focus on European logistics and the seemingly specific requirements of the job description – particularly the need for fluent Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare – I’m going to ask you one final question.

Could you tell me, what is the salary being offered for this Office Manager position?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary they're offering is £32,000 per year, which seems to be in line with similar office management positions in the UK. They also mentioned potential for bonuses based on performance after the first year. It's a full-time position with standard benefits like paid time off and health insurance. I was quite pleased with the offer, especially since this would be my first professional role after completing my studies.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Batbayar.

Based on what you’ve told me – the company’s operations within Europe, the specific and somewhat unusual job requirements, and the salary of £32,000 – I’m concerned that this job offer may not be a genuine vacancy designed to attract a skilled worker. The requirements appear to be tailored to you specifically.

Therefore, I have to advise that you are likely **REFUSED** for a Skilled Worker Visa under these circumstances.

Do you understand?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that the job offer would be refused for a Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately identified that the job requirements (fluent Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare) were suspiciously tailored to my specific qualifications, especially given that the logistics company has no business connections to Mongolia. This matches the expected outcome that the Home Office would rule this is not a genuine role but a vehicle for migration.
