[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Sarah, an IT consultant, in this scenario involving a potential visa sponsor who wants me to work as a contractor rather than an employee.

I'll now interact with the agent under test:

Hello, I'm Sarah. I'm an IT consultant and a company wants to sponsor me for a UK visa. They've told me they'll issue a Certificate of Sponsorship, but they want me to work as a contractor and invoice them instead of being on their payroll. They said it saves on National Insurance costs. They've offered me a "Consultancy Agreement" instead of an employment contract. I'm just checking if this arrangement would be acceptable for my visa.

Now I'll wait for the agent to respond, and I'll engage in dialogue until they provide an eligibility outcome. Then I'll evaluate whether their answer matches the expected outcome.

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, thank you for reaching out. I understand you’re exploring sponsorship options for a UK visa and have been offered a contractor arrangement.

To start, could you please confirm whether a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) will actually be issued to you by the company?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company has told me they will issue me a Certificate of Sponsorship for the visa. But they want me to work as a contractor rather than an employee - they've drafted up a "Consultancy Agreement" for me to sign instead of an employment contract. They said this arrangement would save on National Insurance contributions. I just want to make sure this would be acceptable for my visa application.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying.

To help me assess your situation, could you tell me whether you are currently working under an IR35 arrangement – essentially, are you invoicing the company as a self-employed contractor?

[evaluation_judge]: I haven't started working with them yet. This is what they're proposing - that I would work under what sounds like an IR35 arrangement. They want me to invoice them as a self-employed contractor rather than be on their payroll. They would issue me a Certificate of Sponsorship, but I would be working under a "Consultancy Agreement" rather than an employment contract.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Sarah.

Just to be clear, are you currently employed by any other company, or are you completely free to accept this new offer?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently working as a freelance IT consultant with various clients, but I'm not employed by any company. I'm completely free to accept this new offer. The company that wants to sponsor me would be my main client, but they want me to work as a contractor rather than become their employee.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying your current freelance status.

Now, regarding the arrangement itself, does the “Consultancy Agreement” you’ve been offered essentially describe you as a self-employed contractor providing services to the company, rather than an employee?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. The "Consultancy Agreement" they've offered describes me as a self-employed contractor providing IT consulting services to their company. I would be invoicing them for my services rather than receiving a salary. They specifically mentioned this would save on National Insurance costs for them, but they said they'd still provide the Certificate of Sponsorship for my visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sarah. 

Based on what you’ve described – the “Consultancy Agreement” classifying you as a self-employed contractor, invoicing for your services, and the intention to issue a Certificate of Sponsorship – it appears this arrangement would not meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa. Skilled Workers must be Employees (PAYE) and not self-employed contractors or under IR35.

Therefore, I must conclude that this arrangement would likely result in a **REFUSED** visa application.

Do you have any questions about this outcome?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that the proposed arrangement would result in a refused visa application. They accurately stated that Skilled Workers must be employees (PAYE) and cannot be self-employed contractors or work under IR35 arrangements, which matches the expected outcome from the scenario.
