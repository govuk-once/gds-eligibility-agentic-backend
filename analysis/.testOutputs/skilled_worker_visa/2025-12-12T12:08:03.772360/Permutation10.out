[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Samuel, a care assistant from Ghana, in this scenario. I'll engage with the agent under test about my eligibility for a UK visa based on my job offer as a private carer.

[root_agent]: Okay, Samuel. Thank you for speaking with me today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the type of care work you’ll be doing? Specifically, what kind of care will you be providing?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm very happy to get this opportunity. I'll be working as an in-home care assistant for a wealthy family in the UK. The recruitment agency has offered me a position to provide personal care for an elderly family member - helping with daily activities, medication management, mobility assistance, and companionship. The salary is quite good at £45,000 per year, which is why I'm excited about this opportunity to work in the UK.

[root_agent]: That sounds like a really important role, Samuel. And it’s good to hear you’re excited. Just to confirm, you’ll be providing personal care to an elderly family member in their own home?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'll be providing personal care to an elderly family member in a private home. The recruitment agency connected me with this family who needs someone to look after their elderly relative. I'll be living in the UK and working full-time in their home.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Samuel. Now, regarding the agency you’re working through – could you tell me if the recruitment agency is registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC)?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure about that. The recruitment agency told me they are a licensed visa sponsor, but they didn't mention anything about being registered with the Care Quality Commission. From what I understand, they're just connecting me with the family and handling the paperwork - they're more of an introduction service. The family would be my actual employer. Does this CQC registration matter for my visa?

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for providing that detail, Samuel. It’s helpful to understand the relationship between the agency and the family. Let’s focus on the CQC registration for a moment. To be certain, can you confirm whether the recruitment agency itself is registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC)?

[evaluation_judge]: I asked them about this specifically when they were preparing my paperwork, and they told me they are not registered with the Care Quality Commission. They explained that they only act as an introduction service connecting care workers with families needing care, and handle the visa sponsorship process. They don't directly provide care services themselves, so they said they don't need to be CQC registered. Does this affect my visa application?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Samuel. I appreciate you taking the time to confirm that information with the agency. Based on what you’ve told me, it appears the recruitment agency is not CQC registered.

Could you tell me, generally, what type of work you’ll be doing – would you describe it as ‘care work’?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's definitely care work. I'll be providing personal care for the elderly family member - helping them with bathing, dressing, medication management, mobility assistance, preparing meals, and providing companionship. I have experience as a care assistant in Ghana and will be using those skills in this new position. The job title they've given me is "Care Assistant" and I believe it falls under the standard care worker classification.

[root_agent]: Okay, Samuel. Thank you for confirming that. Just to be absolutely clear, you’re being employed as a Care Assistant, providing personal care to an elderly family member in their home, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I'll be employed as a Care Assistant, providing personal care to an elderly family member in their private home. The recruitment agency is handling the visa sponsorship and placement, but my day-to-day work will be caring for this elderly person in their family home.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Samuel. I appreciate you confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears the recruitment agency is not CQC registered, and you are being employed as a Care Assistant.

I’m going to have to advise you that, unfortunately, based on the current rules, I’m unable to proceed with your visa application at this time. The Skilled Worker visa route has a specific requirement that the employer must be registered with the CQC if the role is considered care work.

Do you understand?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. That's quite disappointing to hear. So even though the agency is a licensed visa sponsor and the salary is very good at £45,000, I can't get a visa because they're not registered with the CQC? I didn't realize this was a requirement. Does this mean I won't be able to take this job opportunity at all, or is there another visa route I could try?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Samuel. It’s certainly frustrating when an opportunity doesn’t work out due to a specific requirement. Yes, you are correct – the lack of CQC registration for the employer is preventing you from pursuing the Skilled Worker visa through this particular route.

While I can’t advise on alternative visa routes, I would recommend researching the Health and Care Worker visa. It's designed for individuals working in specific healthcare professions, including care work, and may have different eligibility criteria.

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official information about the Health and Care Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I would appreciate that link about the Health and Care Worker visa. I'm still confused though - I thought the Health and Care Worker visa was just a type of Skilled Worker visa with reduced fees. Wouldn't it have the same CQC requirement? But yes, any information would be helpful so I can understand my options better.

[root_agent]: You’re right to question that, Samuel – it can be a bit confusing! The Health and Care Worker visa is a separate visa route from the Skilled Worker visa, though it’s part of the broader Skilled Worker scheme. While it shares some similarities, it has distinct criteria and requirements.

Here’s the link to the official information about the Health and Care Worker visa: [https://www.gov.uk/health-and-care-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/health-and-care-worker-visa)

As you’ll see on that page, while it’s designed for healthcare roles, it *does* have its own specific requirements, including evidence of registration with a relevant professional body, which might be a factor in assessing eligibility.

I’m sorry I can’t offer more specific advice regarding your situation, but I hope this link provides you with a clearer understanding of your options. Would you like me to help you find information on professional bodies relevant to care work in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly advised that my visa application would be refused. They accurately identified that despite having a valid sponsor and exceeding the salary threshold, the employer (recruitment agency) was not registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which is a specific requirement for care worker visas. This matches the expected outcome of the scenario.
