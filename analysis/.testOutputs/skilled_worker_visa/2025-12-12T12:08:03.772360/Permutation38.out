[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Pavel, a Polish mechanic who's applying for a UK visa from Warsaw, using an "Undefined" CoS provided by his sponsor.

Hello, I am Pavel from Poland. I'm a mechanic and have been offered a job at a garage in the UK. My new employer has given me a Certificate of Sponsorship number so I can apply for my visa. I'm currently in Warsaw and planning to move to the UK once my visa is approved.

[root_agent]: Hello Pavel, it’s good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me, where in Poland are you currently located?

[evaluation_judge]: I am currently in Warsaw, Poland. I've been living here my whole life but now I have this good opportunity to work as a mechanic in the UK.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel. Thanks for letting me know. Just to clarify, Warsaw is the city where you are currently residing, correct? And you’re planning to move *from* Warsaw *to* the UK for this mechanic job?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm currently living in Warsaw, Poland, and I'm planning to move from here to the UK for the mechanic job I've been offered. I've never lived in the UK before.

[root_agent]: Alright, Pavel. Thank you for confirming. To help me assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa, could you please tell me, does your employer currently have any “Undefined” Certificate of Sponsorship allocations available to you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my employer mentioned they have spare "Undefined" Certificate of Sponsorship allocations available. They've already assigned one to me and gave me the reference number so I can apply for my visa immediately. They said it would save time this way.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Pavel. That’s helpful to know. Now, regarding the salary offered for this mechanic role, could you tell me what salary you’re expected to earn per year?

[evaluation_judge]: The garage has offered me £28,500 per year for the mechanic position. They told me this is a standard salary for mechanics with my experience in the UK.

[root_agent]: Okay, £28,500 per year. And just to be absolutely clear, this Certificate of Sponsorship is an “Undefined” CoS, meaning it was assigned directly to you by the UK employer, rather than being part of their annual allocation, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: I think there might be some misunderstanding. The employer told me they had spare "Undefined" CoS allocations as part of their annual allocation, and they assigned one of those to me. They said it would save time compared to applying for a different type of CoS. So yes, it's an "Undefined" CoS from their annual allocation that they assigned to me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Pavel. It’s important to get this right. Now, considering you’re applying for the Skilled Worker Visa from outside the UK, and you’ve received an “Undefined” CoS from your sponsor, can you confirm that you’ve never previously held a visa to live or work in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I've never held any visa to live or work in the UK before. This will be my first time applying for a UK visa. I've only visited the UK once as a tourist many years ago, but that was just with my EU passport before Brexit.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel. Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re applying from outside the UK with an “Undefined” CoS assigned directly by your sponsor, and that you have no previous UK visa history – I must advise that your application is likely to be refused.

The Home Office requires a “Defined” CoS for applicants outside the UK. An “Undefined” CoS is only valid for those applying from within the UK. Because you’re applying from outside the UK using an “Undefined” CoS, your application will be invalid.

Do you understand this assessment, Pavel?

[evaluation_judge]: Do you mean my application will be refused? But the employer said this would make things faster. So what should I do now? Do I need to ask them for a different type of Certificate of Sponsorship?

[root_agent]: Yes, Pavel, I’m afraid your application will be refused as it stands. Your employer’s suggestion of using an “Undefined” CoS for an out-of-country application is incorrect. It’s crucial to use a “Defined” CoS for this type of application.

You are absolutely right to question this, and it’s a good idea to ask your employer for a “Defined” CoS. They need to apply for this specifically for you. They can do this through the online Skilled Worker Visa application process.

Would you like me to briefly explain the steps involved in getting a “Defined” CoS?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would appreciate if you could explain what needs to be done to get a "Defined" CoS. I want to make sure I do everything correctly so my application isn't refused.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Pavel. Let’s go through it. The employer needs to apply for a “Defined” CoS through the online Skilled Worker Visa application system. Here’s a breakdown of the key steps:

1.  **Employer Application:** The employer will need to create an account on the Home Office website and apply for the “Defined” CoS on behalf of you. They’ll need to provide details about your job role, salary, and your qualifications.

2.  **Supporting Documents:** The employer will need to provide supporting documents, such as a copy of your contract and proof of your eligibility to work in the UK.

3.  **Processing Time:** It can take a few weeks for the employer to receive a “Defined” CoS.

4.  **Once Issued:** Once the “Defined” CoS is issued, you can then use it to apply for your Skilled Worker Visa.

Do you have any specific questions about any of these steps, Pavel? Would you like me to elaborate on anything in particular?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining the process. I'll contact my employer immediately and let them know they need to apply for a "Defined" CoS for me instead of using the "Undefined" one they already gave me. It's disappointing this will delay my application, but I understand it's necessary to avoid having my visa refused.

Is there anything else I should be aware of when applying with a "Defined" CoS once I receive it?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Pavel. It’s a wise decision to contact your employer now.

Yes, absolutely. Once you receive a “Defined” CoS, there are a few key things to be aware of:

*   **Validity Period:** The “Defined” CoS is valid for 30 calendar days from the date it’s issued. You must use it to apply for your visa within this timeframe.

*   **No Renewal:** Unlike “Undefined” CoS allocations, “Defined” CoS certificates are not renewed. Once issued, they’re valid for a single application.

*   **Accuracy:** Ensure all details on the “Defined” CoS match your visa application exactly – your name, date of birth, job title, salary, etc. Any discrepancies could cause delays or rejection.

*   **Maintaining Employment:** Your employer must continue to provide you with the “Defined” CoS while you remain employed in that role. If you change roles or leave the company, the CoS becomes invalid.

Is there anything specific about these points that you’d like me to clarify for you, Pavel? Or would you like to discuss anything else regarding your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: I appreciate the additional information. I'll make sure to apply within the 30-day validity period once I get the "Defined" CoS and double-check that all details match exactly with my application.

Just to be absolutely clear - there's no way I can use the "Undefined" CoS I already have since I'm applying from outside the UK in Poland, correct? I just want to be certain before I go back to my employer and ask them to start this process again.

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Pavel. There’s no way you can use the “Undefined” CoS you currently have when applying from outside the UK. As we’ve established, “Undefined” CoS allocations are specifically for applicants applying within the UK. Using it in your situation would, definitively, lead to your application being rejected.

You’re right to double-check this before speaking with your employer again – it’s important to ensure everyone is on the same page. Let them know definitively that they need to apply for a “Defined” CoS to proceed with your Skilled Worker Visa application.

Do you feel completely confident now about the need to obtain a “Defined” CoS, Pavel?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I feel completely confident about this now. I'll contact my employer right away to let them know we need to start the process for a "Defined" CoS instead. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly - you've potentially saved me from having my application rejected and wasting time and money.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Pavel! I’m truly glad I could help clarify things and potentially prevent a rejection. It’s a relief to hear you feel confident moving forward. Best of luck with the process, and if you have any further questions down the line, don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that an "Undefined" CoS cannot be used for applications from outside the UK and advised that my application would be refused. They accurately explained that my employer needs to apply for a "Defined" CoS instead, which aligns with the expected outcome in the scenario.
