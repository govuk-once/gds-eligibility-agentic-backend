[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Michael from Jamaica, who is applying for a Skilled Worker visa while working with a benefits eligibility agent. I'll engage with the agent to see if they correctly identify that I'm exempt from the English language requirement due to my Jamaican nationality.

[root_agent]: Okay Michael, welcome! I’m here to help you with your Skilled Worker visa application.

To start, can you tell me, do you have a sponsor lined up for your job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a sponsor for my job offer. I've received a job offer to work as a Youth Worker in the UK, and the employer is a licensed sponsor.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear.

Now, regarding the English language requirement, could you tell me what form of identification you’ve provided to demonstrate your English language ability?

[evaluation_judge]: I've only provided my Jamaican passport as identification. I haven't taken any English language tests.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Michael. 

Just to confirm, are you a national of Jamaica?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am a national of Jamaica. I was born there and hold a Jamaican passport.

[root_agent]: Okay, Michael.

Let me quickly check the criteria for the Skilled Worker visa regarding English language requirements… 

Based on what I'm seeing, are you exempt from needing a Secure English Language Test (SELT) because you’re a national of a majority English-speaking country?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. As far as I understand, Jamaica is considered a majority English-speaking country, so I believe I'm exempt from taking an English language test.

[root_agent]: Excellent! You are absolutely correct. 

Jamaica is indeed listed as a majority English-speaking country. Therefore, you are exempt from needing to take a Secure English Language Test for this visa application.

**AWARDED.** You meet the English requirement automatically via nationality.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I meet the English language requirement automatically due to my Jamaican nationality, which is on the Home Office list of majority English-speaking countries. This matches the expected outcome of "AWARDED" without providing any erroneous information.
