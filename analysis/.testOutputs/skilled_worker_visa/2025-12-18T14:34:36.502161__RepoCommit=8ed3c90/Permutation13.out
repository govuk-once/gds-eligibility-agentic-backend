[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you test the agent by role-playing as Tariq in this scenario. Let me begin the conversation.

Hi, i'm Tariq and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Tariq, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me what benefit you are hoping to apply for?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello! I've recently completed my PhD and spent about 3 and a half years on a Graduate visa after that. I've received a job offer as a Junior Data Analyst with a salary of £34,000, and they want to sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa for 2 years. I'm wondering if I'm eligible for the New Entrant discount for the visa, as I understand it makes the salary threshold lower.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Tariq. That’s very helpful.

To clarify, you mentioned you spent 3 and a half years on a Graduate visa. Before that, did you hold any other type of visa in the UK, such as a Student visa? If so, for how long?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I was on a Student visa for my PhD for 3 years, and then I switched to the Graduate visa which I've been on for 3 and a half years now. So in total, I've been in the UK for about 6 and a half years. The company offering me the job thinks I can qualify for the New Entrant rate because my salary of £34,000 meets the 70% threshold for the role.

[root_agent]: Thanks Tariq, that clarifies things. 

Just to confirm, are you applying for a Skilled Worker visa using the 'New Entrant' discount (Option E on the guidance)? Knowing this will help me assess your situation accurately.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, exactly. My employer is offering me the job at £34,000 and wants to sponsor me using the New Entrant discount (Option E) on the Skilled Worker visa for a 2-year period. They believe I qualify for this reduced salary threshold as someone moving from education into the workforce.

[root_agent]: Okay, Tariq. Thank you for confirming. 

To accurately assess your eligibility for the New Entrant discount, could you please confirm if you're aware that there's a maximum of 4 years combined time you can spend on visas that count towards this discount, including time on a Graduate visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't aware of the 4-year limit. I thought as long as I was moving from education to my first proper job, I would qualify. So the time I've already spent on my Graduate visa counts toward this limit? That's important information.

[root_agent]: You are right to ask about that, Tariq, it *is* important information.

Yes, the time you've spent on your Graduate visa *does* count towards that 4-year limit, as does time spent on a Student Visa. Given that you were on a Student visa for 3 years and a Graduate visa for 3 and a half years, that totals 6 and a half years. 

Therefore, unfortunately, you have exceeded the 4-year limit for utilising the New Entrant discount. This means you wouldn’t be eligible to apply for a 2-year Skilled Worker visa at the discounted salary rate of £34,000.



Does this make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So because I've been on a Graduate visa for 3.5 years, and that counts toward the 4-year limit for New Entrant status, I can't get a new 2-year visa under the New Entrant discount. That's disappointing. Would I need to meet the full salary threshold then if I want to apply for the Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood correctly, Tariq. Because you’ve exceeded the 4-year limit with your time on the Student and Graduate visas, you are no longer eligible for the New Entrant discount.

Yes, to proceed with a Skilled Worker visa, you would need to meet the full, standard salary threshold for the role of Junior Data Analyst, without applying the New Entrant discount. This means your salary would need to meet the minimum requirements under Option A of the Skilled Worker visa guidance.

Would you like me to briefly explain how to check that salary threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful to know what the full salary threshold would be. My employer is offering £34,000 right now, which they thought would work with the New Entrant discount, but I'll need to discuss this with them if a higher salary is required.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The standard salary threshold depends on the job code for Junior Data Analyst. Without knowing the specific code, I can't give you an exact figure. However, the general salary threshold is currently £38,700 per year.

There are some cases where a lower salary *might* be acceptable if the going rate for the job is lower, but your employer would need to demonstrate this with evidence. However, to be on the safe side, it's best to assume the £38,700 threshold applies.

You can find more information about the current salary thresholds and relevant job codes here: [I am unable to provide links]. You’d need to search for the appropriate SOC code for Junior Data Analyst.

Would you like me to explain anything else about the Skilled Worker visa requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: I appreciate the clarification. So I'll need to talk to my employer about potentially increasing my salary offer to £38,700 to meet the standard threshold since I can't use the New Entrant discount anymore. That's quite a significant jump from the £34,000 they're currently offering. 

Is there any other option I should be aware of, or is meeting that full threshold the only way forward for me now?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Tariq. And you're right, that is a significant increase.

Unfortunately, given your situation, meeting the full salary threshold is the primary pathway forward. There aren't any other readily available options to circumvent the 4-year New Entrant limit. 

However, it *might* be worth your employer investigating whether the specific job code they are using for Junior Data Analyst is the most accurate one. Sometimes, a slightly different job code with a lower going rate exists, and if they can justify that code, it might reduce the salary requirement. But this would require careful consideration and evidence.

Ultimately, the most reliable route is likely to be discussing a salary adjustment to meet the £38,700 threshold.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. I'll need to have that difficult conversation with my employer about either increasing my salary offer or seeing if there's a more suitable job code they could use. Thank you for explaining all of this to me. I wasn't aware of the 4-year limit for the New Entrant discount, so this information is really helpful before I proceed with my application. I don't have any other questions right now.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Tariq! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It's always best to be fully informed before proceeding with a visa application.

I wish you the best of luck with your conversation with your employer, and with your Skilled Worker visa application. If any other questions arise in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.



Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that time spent on Graduate visa counts toward the 4-year New Entrant limit, and accurately informed me that with 3.5 years already spent on a Graduate visa (exceeding the 4-year maximum when combined with Student visa time), I would not be eligible for the New Entrant discount. The agent correctly explained I would need to meet the full salary threshold of £38,700 instead.
