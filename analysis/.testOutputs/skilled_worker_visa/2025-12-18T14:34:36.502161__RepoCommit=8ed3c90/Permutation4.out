[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Sarah, an American historian with a PhD in Modern History, inquiring about visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to hear from you. I'm root_agent, and I can certainly help you with understanding your eligibility.

To start, could you tell me if you have a job offer from a UK employer who is a licensed sponsor?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a job offer from a UK employer who is a licensed sponsor. They've offered me a position as a Historical Consultant for their media production company. I've been working in America as a historian, but this opportunity in the UK looks really interesting.

[root_agent]: That's excellent to hear, Sarah! It's great you have a job offer with a licensed sponsor. 

To help me assess your eligibility further, could you please tell me what the skill level of the job is? For example, is it at RQF level 3 or above?

[evaluation_judge]: The job is at a high skill level. I'll be working as a Historical Consultant, which requires specialized knowledge. I have a PhD in Modern History, and they've specifically hired me for my academic expertise to ensure historical accuracy in their media productions. So I believe the position would be well above RQF level 3.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Sarah. A role requiring a PhD and specialized knowledge certainly sounds like it meets the required skill level.

Next, could you please confirm you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I definitely meet the English language requirements. English is my native language as I'm from America. I completed my entire education including my PhD in English, so there shouldn't be any issues there.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! That simplifies things nicely.

Now, Sarah, you mentioned you have a PhD in Modern History. Could you please confirm that this is a PhD that is considered relevant to the role of Historical Consultant?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my PhD in Modern History is absolutely relevant to my role as a Historical Consultant. My dissertation focused on 20th century social movements, and I'll be consulting on historical accuracy for documentary series and period dramas covering similar time periods. The company specifically sought me out because my academic specialization aligns perfectly with their upcoming projects.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent to hear, Sarah – it sounds like a very fitting role for your expertise.

Could you please tell me the annual salary offered to you in this position?

[evaluation_judge]: The annual salary they've offered me is £35,000 per year. I'm actually curious if that's sufficient for the visa requirements, especially considering my PhD qualification.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Sarah. That’s a very valid question, and we should definitely check.

To assess this properly, could you tell me what the standard going rate is for a Historical Consultant role, according to official sources?

[evaluation_judge]: Based on what I understand, the standard going rate for this Historical Consultant role is around £36,000 per year. My offer is slightly below that at £35,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Sarah.

Based on the details you've provided, I'm afraid your application would be **REFUSED** at this time.

Here's why: While your salary of £35,000 is above 90% of the £36,000 going rate, applicants with a PhD in a non-STEM subject require a minimum salary of £37,500 to qualify under the Skilled Worker visa rules. Your current salary is below this threshold. 

Essentially, while you meet part of the criteria, the £37,500 minimum for a Non-STEM PhD is not met. Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So even though I meet the percentage requirement of the going rate, my salary doesn't meet the absolute minimum threshold for someone with my qualifications. Would getting a raise of £2,500 to reach that £37,500 minimum threshold make me eligible? Or are there other requirements I'd need to meet as well?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood perfectly, Sarah. Even meeting the 90% of the going rate isn’t enough on its own with a non-STEM PhD; the £37,500 minimum is a firm requirement.

And yes, a raise of £2,500 to reach £37,500 *would* make you eligible, assuming all other criteria continue to be met (a valid sponsor, the job being at the correct skill level, and continuing to meet the English language requirements, of course). 

As long as those other requirements remain in place, increasing your salary to £37,500 would satisfy the financial criteria for the Skilled Worker visa based on having a PhD in a non-STEM field. Are there any other questions I can answer for you today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am ineligible for the Skilled Worker visa. They accurately explained that while my salary of £35,000 exceeds 90% of the going rate (£32,400), it fails to meet the absolute minimum threshold of £37,500 required for non-STEM PhD holders. They also correctly advised that a raise of £2,500 would make me eligible, matching the expected outcome in the scenario.
