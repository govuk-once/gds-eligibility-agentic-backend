[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Samuel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Samuel, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me the exact job title offered to you?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a care assistant for a wealthy family in the UK. I'd be working in their home, providing care for an elderly family member. It's through a recruitment agency.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Samuel. Is the recruitment agency you are working with a registered sponsor with the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the agency is a licensed visa sponsor. They told me they can sponsor my visa to work in the UK.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know, Samuel. Could you please confirm the salary offered for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: They're offering me £45,000 per year, which seems quite good for a care assistant role. The family is very wealthy.

[root_agent]: That is a very good salary for a care assistant role, Samuel. To confirm, is the job code for your position 6135 (Care Worker) or 6136 (Senior Care Worker)?

[evaluation_judge]: The job code is 6135 - Care Worker.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Samuel. Now, this is an important question regarding your potential employer. Is the recruitment agency registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England?

[evaluation_judge]: No, they're not registered with the CQC. They explained to me that they only act as an introduction service between caregivers like me and the families who need care. The actual employment would be with the family directly.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Samuel. Based on the information you’ve provided, and specifically the fact that the agency is not CQC registered, I’m afraid your application for a Skilled Worker Visa under the care worker route (code 6135) would be **REFUSED**. 

Although you have a valid sponsor and a salary that meets the requirements, the rules state that for care worker roles, the *employer* – in this case, the family employing you directly – must be registered with the CQC. This is to ensure safe and regulated care. The agency acting as an introducer doesn’t fulfill this requirement.



I understand this may be disappointing news. Is there anything else I can help you with?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing to hear. I thought with the high salary and the agency being able to sponsor me, it would be possible. So even though the agency has a sponsorship license, I can't get a visa because they're not CQC registered and the family would be my actual employer?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to understand it that way, Samuel. Even though the agency *has* a sponsorship license, it's the CQC registration of the actual *employer* – the family you'd be working for – that is crucial for this specific care worker visa route. The rules are in place to protect both workers and those receiving care, and ensure standards are met.

Essentially, the agency sponsoring doesn’t override the requirement for the end employer to be CQC registered when the job code is 6135. It's a specific requirement to prevent potential exploitation in direct, private household employment situations.

I’m sorry I couldn’t deliver better news. Is there anything else I can clarify for you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's clear enough. Thank you for explaining it to me. I'll need to reconsider my options.

✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be refused because the employer is not CQC registered, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
