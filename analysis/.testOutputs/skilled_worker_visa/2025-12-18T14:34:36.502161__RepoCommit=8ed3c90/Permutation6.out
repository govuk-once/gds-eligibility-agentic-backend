[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Wei, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me what type of job you have been offered in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a physicist from China, and I've been offered a Postdoctoral Researcher position at a UK university. It's in physics research, and I'm trying to figure out if I qualify for a work visa.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Wei! A Postdoctoral Researcher position sounds interesting. Could you please tell me the occupation code for this position? You might find this on the job offer letter.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the occupation code on my job offer is 2114, which is for Physics researchers. It's a research position at the university's physics department.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Wei. Could you please tell me your annual salary for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: The university has offered me a salary of £33,500 per year for this postdoctoral researcher position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Wei. Do you know what the standard going rate is for a Physics Researcher (occupation code 2114) in the UK? This information should be available from the job offer or potentially from the university. If you don’t know exactly, an approximate figure is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe the standard going rate for my role (Physics Researcher, code 2114) is about £46,000 per year. The university mentioned this is the typical market rate for this position in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you very much for that information, Wei. Finally, just to confirm, do you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. I've taken the required English proficiency test and passed with the necessary scores for the visa application.

[root_agent]: Excellent, Wei! Based on the information you've provided – your occupation code is 2114, your salary is £33,500, the standard going rate is £46,000, and you meet the English language requirements – it appears you **qualify for the discount** specifically designed for scientific research roles. 

Therefore, you **AWARDED**. You meet all the criteria for a Skilled Worker Visa under these conditions.



Do you have any other questions for me?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa. My postdoctoral position (code 2114) qualifies for the scientific research role discount, my £33,500 salary exceeds both the lower threshold (£33,400) and 70% of the going rate (£32,200), matching the expected "AWARDED" outcome.
