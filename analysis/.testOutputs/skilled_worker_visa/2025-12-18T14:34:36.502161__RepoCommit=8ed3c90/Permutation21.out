[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Leo, a Master's student from China who wants to check his eligibility to switch from a Student visa to a Skilled Worker visa.

Hi, i'm Leo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Leo, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you please tell me what type of visa you currently hold?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently on a Student visa in the UK. I'm doing my Master's degree, and I have been studying here for a few months already.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. And when does your Master's course *officially* end – could you give me a month and year, please?

[evaluation_judge]: My course officially ends in September 2026. I started a few months ago and I'm in the first year of my studies.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Do you currently have a job offer in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I actually received a job offer as a Marketing Executive. The company wants me to start in January 2026. That's why I'm wondering if I can switch from my Student visa to a work visa.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear you have a job offer! Just to confirm, is this job offer for a role that is currently on the list of eligible occupations for a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the Marketing Executive role is eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. The company has assured me that they can sponsor me and the role meets the required skill level.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Now, considering you are currently on a Student visa and your course ends in September 2026, and you have a job offer starting in January 2026, have you completed your course, or will you have completed it *before* January 2026?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I won't have completed my course by January 2026. My course runs until September 2026, so in January 2026 I'll only be about halfway through my Master's program.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you've provided, and the rules around switching from a Student visa to a Skilled Worker visa, I'm afraid your application would be **REFUSED** at this time.

You need to have completed your course before you can switch to a Skilled Worker visa while remaining in the UK. As your course doesn't finish until September 2026, you won't meet this requirement until then.

You would need to either wait until you've completed your studies or leave the UK to apply for the Skilled Worker visa from outside the UK.



Is there anything else I can help you with today, Leo?

[evaluation_judge]: So I can't switch to a Skilled Worker visa while I'm still studying? Is there any way I could accept this job offer and start in January, or would I have to wait until after September 2026 when my course finishes?

[root_agent]: Unfortunately, you cannot switch to a Skilled Worker visa while still studying, unless you have already completed your course.

To accept the job offer starting in January 2026, you would need to leave the UK and apply for the Skilled Worker visa from outside the UK. You wouldn’t be able to switch internally while still on your Student visa and with your course still ongoing. Waiting until after September 2026, when your course is finished, would allow you to apply to switch visas while remaining in the UK.

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. So if I really want this job, I'd have to either drop out of my course, leave the UK and apply for the Skilled Worker visa from abroad, or I'd need to ask the employer if they can wait until after September 2026 when I finish my degree. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Leo. Those are absolutely the three options available to you:

1. **Drop out of your course:** This would allow you to apply from outside the UK.
2. **Leave the UK and apply from abroad:** Applying for the Skilled Worker visa from outside the UK is required if you are still enrolled on a course.
3. **Ask your employer to wait:** The most straightforward option might be to discuss with your employer the possibility of starting your employment after you complete your degree in September 2026.

I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you. Do you have any other questions I can answer?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that makes everything clear. Thank you for the information. I'll have to think about my options and discuss with the employer about possibly delaying the start date. This is very helpful to know before I made any decisions.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Leo! I'm so glad I could provide you with the information you needed to make an informed decision. 

If you think of any other questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best with your studies and your job search!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I would be refused if I tried to switch to a Skilled Worker visa while still studying. The agent correctly explained that since I haven't completed my degree and I'm not a PhD student, I cannot switch mid-course from within the UK, which matches the expected outcome.
