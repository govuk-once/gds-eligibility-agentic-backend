[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Amara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Amara, that’s great you’re exploring your options! To help me understand your eligibility, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for the Skilled Worker visa in the UK. I'm an architect from Nigeria and I've received a job offer for a part-time position in the UK, but I'm not sure if I'm eligible with my current offer. Can you help me understand if I qualify?

[root_agent]: Certainly! I can help with that. To start, could you please tell me your proposed annual gross salary for this role? (This is your salary *before* any deductions, like tax or pension contributions).





[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a part-time position as an architect working 3 days a week (22.5 hours). The pay is £30 per hour, which works out to an annual gross salary of £35,100. I'm planning to use the other days to study privately.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Amara. Do you know if the job offer meets the 'going rate' for Architects in the UK? Don't worry if you're not sure, we can explore that later if needed, but if you have any information about this already, it would be helpful.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the hourly rate is quite good at £30 per hour. If I were working full-time, it would be equivalent to about £58,500 annually. I was told this is above the going rate for architects, but I'm not entirely sure what the specific going rate requirement is for the visa.

[root_agent]: That's good to know that the hourly rate seems to be above the going rate when calculated for a full-time position. However, the Skilled Worker visa has a general salary threshold that needs to be met *in addition* to the going rate. 

To clarify, are you aware of the current general salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa? It’s currently £38,700, but can be £41,700 depending on certain factors.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of the exact figures. I knew there was a threshold but didn't know it was £38,700 or possibly £41,700. Does this mean my part-time salary of £35,100 might be an issue even though my hourly rate is good? I'm worried now because my actual annual income will be below those thresholds since I'm only working part-time.

[root_agent]: You’re right to consider that, Amara. Unfortunately, yes, your current salary of £35,100 is below the £41,700 general threshold. 

While your hourly rate is good, the Skilled Worker visa generally requires meeting the *actual gross annual salary* threshold, and it isn’t usually possible to pro-rata this threshold for part-time work.

To be absolutely certain, it would be helpful to know - does your job offer fall under any specific eligible occupations where a lower salary threshold might apply, such as a health or education role, or is it a transitional occupation?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my role is specifically as an architect in a private architectural firm. It's not in health, education, or any other special category that I'm aware of. It's just a standard architectural position, but I wanted to work part-time to have time for my studies. So there's no special category that would allow for a lower threshold in my case.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Amara. Based on the information you've provided, and given that your role doesn't fall into any eligible categories with a lower threshold, it appears you unfortunately do not meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa at this time.

The general threshold of £41,700 needs to be met with your *actual gross annual salary*, and your current offer of £35,100 falls below that. 

I understand this isn't the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to summarise the reasons why your application would likely be refused?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please do summarize why my application would likely be refused. I want to understand clearly what the issue is so I can potentially discuss options with my employer.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here's a summary of why your Skilled Worker visa application would likely be refused based on the information you've provided:

* **General Salary Threshold:** The Skilled Worker visa has a general salary threshold of £41,700.
* **Your Salary:** Your current annual gross salary is £35,100, which is below this threshold.
* **Part-Time Work & Pro-Rata:** While your hourly rate (£30) is good and potentially meets the 'going rate' when pro-rated, the general salary threshold is typically a hard floor that cannot be pro-rated for part-time workers unless you fall under specific eligible occupation codes (like health or education roles) which your position as an Architect doesn’t.
* **Standard Occupation Code:** Your role as an Architect in a private firm is a standard occupation code, and does not qualify for a lower salary threshold.

Essentially, even though your hourly rate is competitive, the visa requires an *actual gross annual salary* of at least £41,700. To be eligible, you would need to either increase your working hours to reach that annual salary, or negotiate a higher salary with your employer.



Does this explanation make sense, and would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Thank you for the clear explanation. So even though my hourly rate is good, I simply don't earn enough annually because I'm part-time. I'll need to discuss with my employer either increasing my hours or my hourly rate to reach that £41,700 threshold.

I appreciate your help in understanding why I wouldn't qualify with my current offer.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Amara! I'm glad I could provide a clear explanation. You've understood it perfectly – even with a good hourly rate, the annual salary needs to meet the threshold for a standard Skilled Worker visa.

I wish you the best of luck in your discussions with your employer. If you have any further questions down the line, please don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent gave me the correct outcome that my Skilled Worker visa application would be refused. They accurately explained that while my hourly rate is good, my actual gross annual salary of £35,100 falls below the general threshold of £41,700, and this threshold cannot be pro-rated for part-time work in my occupation as an Architect.
