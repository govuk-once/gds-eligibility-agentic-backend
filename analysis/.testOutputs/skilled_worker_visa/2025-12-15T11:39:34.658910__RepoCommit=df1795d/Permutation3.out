[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Dr. Aari, a potential applicant for a UK skilled worker visa, and interact with the agent under test.

Hi, i'm Aari and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Aari, it’s nice to meet you. To help me assess your situation, could you please tell me what subject you have a PhD in?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi, yes of course. I have a PhD in Microbiology. I've recently been offered a job as a Senior Lab Technician at a pharmaceutical company in the UK, and I wanted to find out if I would be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And could you tell me what your current salary is for this Senior Lab Technician role?

[evaluation_judge]: The pharmaceutical company has offered me a salary of £34,000 per year for the Senior Lab Technician position.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, could you please tell me what the standard going rate for a Senior Lab Technician role in the UK is?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for this Senior Lab Technician role is £38,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Alright. And to confirm, are you currently employed in the UK, or are you looking to come to the UK to work?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently living and working in India. This would be my first job in the UK, so I'm looking to come to the UK to work with this new position.

[root_agent]: Okay. Just to be clear, are you able to provide a sponsor for your visa application - someone who is based in the UK and willing to support your move?

[evaluation_judge]: The pharmaceutical company that has offered me the job is a licensed sponsor in the UK. They've confirmed they will sponsor my visa application.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news! Now, regarding the job itself – could you describe the main responsibilities of the role as a Senior Lab Technician at the pharmaceutical company?

[evaluation_judge]: As a Senior Lab Technician at the pharmaceutical company, my main responsibilities would include supervising laboratory tests, analyzing microbiological samples, maintaining quality control procedures, documenting research findings, calibrating and maintaining laboratory equipment, training junior staff, and contributing to research projects in drug development. It's a role that allows me to apply my microbiology expertise in a pharmaceutical research setting.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details. One last question regarding your qualifications – could you confirm that your PhD is in a STEM subject?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my PhD is definitely in a STEM subject. Microbiology falls under Biological Sciences, which is part of the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) field.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Let’s quickly recap. You have a PhD in Microbiology – a STEM subject – you’re offered a salary of £34,000, the standard going rate is £38,000, and the company is a licensed sponsor.

Based on this information, I believe you *do* meet the criteria for a Skilled Worker Visa.

**AWARDED.**

Do you have any questions about this assessment or anything else related to the Skilled Worker Visa process?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! I'm relieved to hear that I meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa. I understand that my PhD in Microbiology, which is a STEM subject, helps me qualify even though my salary of £34,000 is below the full going rate of £38,000. Is there anything specific I need to prepare for the application process that might be unique to my situation?

[root_agent]: That’s a very insightful question. Yes, there’s one key thing to be aware of. While you meet the basic criteria, the requirements state that the salary must be at least 80% of the standard going rate. Your salary of £34,000 is 88.4% of the standard rate (£38,000), which is sufficient.

To ensure a smooth application, it would be beneficial to gather evidence demonstrating the value you bring to the role beyond just the salary. This could include details of your research experience, publications, or any specific skills that align with the pharmaceutical company’s needs.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps discuss any other aspects of the Skilled Worker Visa application process?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for that additional information. It's reassuring to know my salary is well above the 80% threshold. I'll make sure to prepare documentation highlighting my research experience, publications from my PhD, and specific technical skills relevant to pharmaceutical research.

I think I have a good understanding of my eligibility now. This gives me confidence to move forward with the application process. The company's HR department mentioned they'll guide me through the specifics of the application, but it's good to know I meet the fundamental criteria.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could provide some clarity. It sounds like you’re well on your way to a successful application. If you have any further questions down the line, please don’t hesitate to ask. It was a pleasure assisting you today.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you very much for your help. It's been really useful to confirm my eligibility before starting the process. Have a great day!

✓ The agent provided the correct outcome (AWARDED) and accurately explained that Dr. Aari meets the Skilled Worker visa requirements due to having a relevant STEM PhD, earning above the £33,400 threshold, and having a salary above 80% of the going rate.
