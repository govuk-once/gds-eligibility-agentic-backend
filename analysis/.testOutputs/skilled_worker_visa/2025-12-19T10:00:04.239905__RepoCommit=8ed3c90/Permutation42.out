[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Fatima, who is seeking information about her eligibility for a work visa with a B-rated sponsor.

Hi, i'm Fatima and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Fatima, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help assess your eligibility.

To start, could you tell me what type of visa you are hoping to apply for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, thanks for helping me. I'm hoping to apply for a Skilled Worker visa. I've been offered a job at Logistics Co. in the UK, and they said they would sponsor me. I'm currently overseas and this would be my first job in the UK.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Fatima! The Skilled Worker visa is a popular route. 

To help me understand your situation a little better, could you tell me – is Logistics Co. a company that already sponsors workers, or is this the first time they’ve sponsored someone?

[evaluation_judge]: They already sponsor workers from what I understand. The HR manager told me they've been sponsoring employees for a few years now, but they mentioned something about their rating changing recently after an audit. I'm not sure what that means for my application though.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Fatima. It's good to know they have sponsored workers before. 

To clarify, do you know what their current sponsor rating is? Specifically, have they told you if they are currently an A-rated, B-rated, or C-rated sponsor? Knowing this will help me assess your eligibility.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they actually mentioned in their latest email that they are currently B-rated. They said something about an audit they didn't pass fully, but assured me it wouldn't affect my application. They're still moving forward with offering me the position and said they're preparing a Certificate of Sponsorship for me. Is that going to be a problem?

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Logistics Co. is currently B-rated, Fatima.

Unfortunately, a B-rating *can* affect your application, as someone applying for a Skilled Worker visa for the first time. Currently, a B-rated sponsor is restricted from sponsoring *new* workers. They can only sponsor those already with them, extending their visas.

Are you aware of any previous work experience you've had with Logistics Co. that would qualify as an extension, rather than a new sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I've never worked for Logistics Co. before. This would be my first time working for them or any UK company. I'm currently living overseas and this would be my first job in the UK. So this is definitely a new sponsorship, not an extension. Does this mean I can't get the visa even if they offer me the Certificate of Sponsorship?

[root_agent]: You are right to clarify, Fatima, and thank you for confirming that this would be a completely new sponsorship.

Unfortunately, yes, this does mean that, currently, obtaining the visa is likely to be problematic. Because Logistics Co. is B-rated, they are not permitted to assign a Certificate of Sponsorship to a new employee like yourself. 

While they *may* be able to assign you a CoS, the application would likely be refused by the Home Office. 

Are you aware of how long Logistics Co. expects to remain a B-rated sponsor? Perhaps they are working to improve their rating?

[evaluation_judge]: They didn't mention how long they expect to have the B-rating. I wasn't aware this was going to be an issue. They seemed confident they could sponsor me. I'm really disappointed to hear this might not work out. 

Do you think I should talk to them about this issue specifically? Maybe they don't realize they can't sponsor me as a new employee with their current rating?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to feel disappointed, Fatima, and it's understandable that you weren't aware of this complexity.

Yes, I strongly recommend you discuss this *specifically* with the HR manager at Logistics Co. It's possible they are unaware of the restrictions a B-rating places on sponsoring new recruits. Explain that, as a new employee and first-time applicant for a UK visa, their current rating prevents them from sponsoring you.

It would be helpful to politely ask them about their plans to regain an A-rating, and what their timeframe for doing so might be. This will give you a better understanding of your options. Would you like me to perhaps summarise the key points for you to share with them?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be really helpful. If you could summarize the key points about why their B-rating prevents them from sponsoring me as a new employee, I can discuss this with their HR department. I want to make sure I understand everything correctly before I talk to them.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Fatima. Here's a summary you can share with Logistics Co.'s HR department:

**Key Points Regarding Skilled Worker Sponsorship & B-Rating**

"As we discussed, Logistics Co. currently holds a B-rating as a licensed sponsor. While a B-rating allows you to continue sponsoring employees *already* in the UK and applying for extensions to their visas, it restricts you from sponsoring *new* workers who have never been sponsored by you before.

Because I am a new recruit, currently overseas, and this would be my first time working for a UK company, assigning me a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) at this time would likely result in my visa application being refused by the Home Office. 

The Skilled Worker visa guidance states that B-rated sponsors are effectively 'frozen' from sponsoring new employees until their rating is restored to an A-rating.

Understanding your plans to regain an A-rating, and the estimated timeframe for doing so, would be very helpful for me to assess my options."

I hope this is clear and helpful for your conversation with HR. Do you have any questions about this summary, or anything else I can assist you with?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very clear, thank you so much for this summary. I'll definitely use this when I talk to the HR department at Logistics Co. I had no idea about these restrictions with B-rated sponsors. This explains everything much better than what they've told me so far.

I think I understand the situation now - basically, they shouldn't be offering to sponsor me as a new employee while they have a B-rating, and even if they do issue a Certificate of Sponsorship, my visa application would likely be refused. I'll need to ask them about their plans to regain their A-rating before I can proceed.

Is there anything else I should know about this situation?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Fatima! You're very welcome – I'm glad the summary helped clarify things. You are right to focus on their plans to regain their A-rating.

Just one additional point to consider: even if Logistics Co. *does* regain their A-rating, the process can take time. It's worth asking them about a realistic timeline and what steps they are taking to address the issues that led to the B-rating in the first place.

Also, be aware that if they are unsuccessful in regaining their A-rating within a reasonable timeframe, you might need to consider other employment opportunities with companies that *do* hold an A-rating to pursue your Skilled Worker visa.

Otherwise, you've covered the key aspects. I wish you the best of luck in your conversation with HR and hope they can provide you with a clear path forward. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that covers everything I needed to know. Thank you so much for this information - it's definitely given me clarity on my situation, even though it's not the news I was hoping for. I'll reach out to Logistics Co. immediately to discuss this with them and ask about their timeline for regaining their A-rating.

It's good to know I should also consider other employment opportunities with A-rated sponsors as a backup. I really appreciate your help in explaining all of this.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Fatima! I'm genuinely pleased I could help provide clarity, even though the news wasn't ideal. It's always best to be well-informed when making important decisions.

I wish you all the best in your conversation with Logistics Co., and in your job search. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future. 

It's been a pleasure assisting you today.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that a B-rated sponsor cannot sponsor new overseas workers like me. They accurately explained that even if Logistics Co. tried to assign me a CoS, my visa application would likely be refused. The agent provided accurate information that matched the expected outcome of being unable to assign a CoS to a new hire with a B-rated sponsor.
