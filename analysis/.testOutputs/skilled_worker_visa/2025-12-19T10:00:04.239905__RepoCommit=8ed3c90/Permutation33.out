[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Wei, it's lovely to meet you.

To help me understand your eligibility, could you please tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 25 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Wei. 

Have you previously had any UK visas that allowed you to work?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been working in the UK for 3 years on a Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Wei.

Just to clarify, are you currently applying for a Skilled Worker Visa, or are you just exploring your options at this stage?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm applying for a Skilled Worker Visa. I have a job offer as a Senior Analyst with a salary of £34,000. I thought I would qualify for the New Entrant discount since I'm under 26 years old.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear about the job offer, Wei! £34,000 is a good salary.

To confirm, are you relying on the 'New Entrant' discount to meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm relying on the New Entrant discount since I'm under 26 years old. I thought that would qualify me for the reduced salary threshold.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Wei. 

Considering you've already spent 3 years in the UK on a Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa, and the 'New Entrant' allowance has a maximum of 4 years including time on previous visas like that one, do you understand that your time on the Graduate Trainee visa counts towards that 4-year limit?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I didn't understand that. I thought being under 26 was enough to qualify as a New Entrant. Are you saying that my previous 3 years on the Global Business Mobility visa counts toward the 4-year New Entrant limit?

[root_agent]: Yes, you are absolutely right to clarify, Wei. It's understandable to think being under 26 is enough. However, the rules state that the 4-year 'New Entrant' limit includes time spent on *any* previous "Tier 2" or "Skilled Worker" visa, **and** time spent on "Global Business Mobility" visas.

Since you’ve already spent 3 years on the Global Business Mobility visa, you only have 1 year remaining of the 'New Entrant' allowance. Therefore, you wouldn’t be eligible for the full 3 or 5-year visa with the discounted salary.



Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense, but it's disappointing. So are you saying my application for a Skilled Worker visa would be refused if I'm relying on the New Entrant discount for the full 3-year period?

[root_agent]: Yes, unfortunately, that is correct, Wei. Based on the information you've provided, your application would likely be **refused** if it relies on the 'New Entrant' discount for the full 3-year period. You've used 3 years of the 4-year allowance, leaving only 1 year remaining. 

You could potentially be granted a visa, but it would be for only 1 year, and you would need to meet the standard salary threshold for the remaining years of the visa if you wish to extend.



I'm sorry to deliver disappointing news, but I want to be sure you’re aware of the situation so you can make informed decisions.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's very disappointing news. Thank you for explaining the situation to me. So my application would be refused if I applied for a standard 3-year visa with the New Entrant salary discount. I'll need to discuss this with my potential employer to see if they can either increase the salary or if they'd be willing to sponsor me for just 1 year initially.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Wei. I’m glad I could clarify things for you, even if it wasn’t the news you were hoping for.

You've summarised the situation perfectly - a standard 3-year visa with the discount wouldn't be possible in your case. Discussing options with your employer, like a salary increase or a 1-year sponsorship, is a very sensible approach.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, Wei? Perhaps information about the standard salary threshold, or anything else related to the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. I'll go back to my employer with this information. Thank you for your help.

✓ The agent correctly informed me that my application would be refused because I've already used 3 years of my 4-year New Entrant allowance on my Global Business Mobility visa, leaving only 1 year remaining, which means I can't be granted a standard 3-year visa with the salary discount.
