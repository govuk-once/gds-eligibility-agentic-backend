[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lars and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lars, it's good to speak with you. I can certainly help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you please tell me what type of visa you are hoping to apply for?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! I'm from Norway and I've got a job offer here in the UK as a specialist stonemason. I'm trying to figure out if I can get a work visa. The company is offering me £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you have a job offer as a specialist stonemason! It sounds like you're looking into the Skilled Worker Visa. 

To assess your eligibility, could you please confirm if the company offering you the job is a licensed sponsor with the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they confirmed they are a licensed sponsor with UKVI. They've been bringing over skilled stonemasons from abroad for some time now, so they're familiar with the process.

[root_agent]: That's excellent news! Knowing they are a licensed sponsor is a very important step.

Now, could you please confirm that the job of "specialist stonemason" is at the required skill level – that is, at least RQF level 3 or above?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been told that specialist stonemason is definitely at RQF level 3 or above. I've got over 10 years of experience working with historical buildings back in Norway.

[root_agent]: That's fantastic to hear about your experience and that the role meets the skill level requirement.

Do you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa? This usually involves passing an approved English language test.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do. I recently passed the English language test at the required level. I've been speaking English for many years in my work, so that part wasn't difficult for me.

[root_agent]: That's wonderful! Passing the English language test is another key requirement ticked off.

Now, is the role of specialist stonemason on the Immigration Salary List? You can find lists of eligible occupations on the UK government website. Do you happen to know if it is?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been told that specialist stonemason is on the Immigration Salary List. The employer specifically mentioned this when they made the offer.

[root_agent]: Great! That's very positive. 

Just to confirm all the details, your salary is £34,000 per year, correct? And what is the standard going rate for a specialist stonemason in the UK? Do you happen to know?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the salary is £34,000 per year. I was told the standard going rate for a specialist stonemason in the UK is £33,500 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, this is all coming together. So, to summarise: you have a licensed sponsor, the job is at the required skill level, you meet the English language requirements, the job is on the Immigration Salary List, your salary is £34,000, and the standard going rate is £33,500.

Based on this information, it appears you **would be awarded** the visa. Because the role is on the Immigration Salary List, the general salary threshold of £41,700 doesn't apply. Your salary of £34,000 meets both the £33,400 lower threshold *and* exceeds the standard going rate of £33,500.



Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: That's fantastic news! I'm glad to hear I should be eligible for the visa. I was a bit worried about the salary threshold, so it's a relief that being on the Immigration Salary List makes a difference. I don't think I have any other questions right now. I'll start gathering all my documents for the application. Thank you so much for your help!

✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be awarded the visa because my job is on the Immigration Salary List, which means I only need to meet the lower threshold of £33,400 (which my £34,000 salary exceeds) and the standard going rate of £33,500 (which my salary also exceeds).
