[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Kenji, a Graphic Designer from Japan, who is inquiring about eligibility for a UK visa with a job offer below the minimum salary threshold.

Hi, i'm Kenji and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Kenji, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for UK benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me what type of visa you are hoping to apply for?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, I have a job offer as a Graphic Designer in the UK. The company is offering me £30,000 per year and they say they can sponsor me. I think I need a Skilled Worker visa? I'm currently living in Japan and want to move to the UK for this position. I have good English skills too.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you have a job offer as a Graphic Designer! A Skilled Worker visa is likely the correct route.

To help me assess your eligibility, could you please confirm – is the company offering you sponsorship a licensed sponsor with the Home Office? You can ask them to provide you with their sponsor license number.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company confirmed they are a licensed sponsor with the Home Office. They've already provided me with their sponsor license number and assured me that they can sponsor my visa application. I've checked and they appear to be on the official register of licensed sponsors.

[root_agent]: Excellent, that’s a very positive step! 

Now, could you please tell me a little more about your qualifications? Specifically, do you hold a bachelor's degree, a PhD, or equivalent professional qualifications?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from Musashino Art University in Tokyo. I've been working as a professional graphic designer for about 4 years since graduating. I don't have a PhD though, just the bachelor's degree and my professional experience.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Kenji. That’s helpful.

Now, to assess your eligibility further, could you please confirm the exact salary offered in your job offer, *per year*, after tax? (Just the gross salary before any deductions). You’ve mentioned £30,000, but I want to be absolutely sure.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the gross salary is exactly £30,000 per year before any tax or other deductions. That's what's stated in my formal job offer from the company.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Kenji.

Based on the information you've provided, I'm afraid your application for a Skilled Worker visa would likely be **REFUSED**. 

Currently, the minimum salary requirement for a Skilled Worker visa is £33,400 per year, even for those with a bachelor’s degree and relevant experience. While your employer is sponsoring you and you meet the educational requirements, the salary offered is below this threshold.

I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or perhaps explore if any other visa routes might be available to you?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing to hear. I didn't realize there was such a strict minimum salary requirement. My potential employer told me that the going rate for graphic designers in the UK is around £29,000, so they thought their offer of £30,000 would be sufficient.

Are you absolutely certain there are no exceptions to this rule? Or perhaps there's another type of visa I could apply for instead? I'm really keen on this opportunity.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Kenji, and I’m happy to explain further. You are right to ask about exceptions.

Unfortunately, there are very few exceptions currently. While the 'going rate' is a factor considered when the sponsor applies for a Certificate of Sponsorship, the absolute minimum salary floor of £33,400 currently applies to *all* applicants with a bachelor's degree. Even if your role was considered to be at the 'going rate', £30,000 is below that floor.

Regarding other visa options, the Skilled Worker visa is the most appropriate for sponsored employment. Other visa routes, such as the Youth Mobility Scheme, have different requirements (age, nationality etc.) and may not be suitable for your circumstances.

I can confirm, based on the current rules, there aren’t any exceptions that would allow you to qualify for a Skilled Worker visa with a £30,000 salary and a bachelor's degree.

Would you like me to reiterate any of this information, or do you want to discuss potentially negotiating a higher salary with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. Thank you for explaining this so clearly. I think I'll need to discuss this with my potential employer to see if they might be able to increase the salary offer to meet the minimum requirement of £33,400.

Just to be absolutely clear - there's no way around this minimum salary floor? Even if the company really wants to hire me specifically and is willing to sponsor me? And you mentioned £33,400 is the minimum - would exactly that amount be enough or would I need more?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Kenji. I'm glad I could clarify things.

You are correct to ask for absolute clarity. Unfortunately, no, there is currently no way around the minimum salary floor of £33,400 for a Skilled Worker visa with a bachelor's degree. The Home Office is very strict on this requirement, even with a strong sponsorship offer.

Regarding the amount: £33,400 *is* the absolute minimum. Meeting exactly that amount would be sufficient for your application to be considered, *provided* all other requirements are met. However, it's worth noting that a higher salary could potentially make your application stronger and demonstrate the job is genuinely skilled.

It’s a good idea to discuss this thoroughly with your potential employer. Perhaps they could explore whether they can adjust other benefits alongside the salary to make the overall package more attractive, while also meeting the visa requirements.



Is there anything else I can help you with at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the detailed information. I'll definitely talk to my potential employer about increasing the salary to at least £33,400 to meet the minimum requirement. It's helpful to know that exact amount would be sufficient if they can manage it.

I think I have all the information I need for now. I appreciate your help in explaining the visa requirements so clearly.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Kenji! I'm really glad I could help. 

I sincerely hope your discussion with your employer is productive, and that you're able to secure a salary that meets the visa requirements. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. I wish you the best of luck with your visa application and your potential move to the UK!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be REFUSED a Skilled Worker visa because my £30,000 salary offer is below the absolute minimum threshold of £33,400, even though I met other requirements like having a licensed sponsor and appropriate qualifications.
