[evaluation_judge]: I'll now assume the role of Dr. Aari seeking information about benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Aari and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Aari, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help.

To start, could you please tell me, do you have a valid sponsor for your visa application? This means a UK employer licensed by the Home Office to sponsor workers.





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a valid sponsor. I have a job offer from a pharmaceutical company in the UK. They've confirmed they have a sponsor license.

[root_agent]: That's excellent to hear, Aari! 

Next, is the job you've been offered at the required skill level? According to the Skilled Worker visa guidelines, it needs to be at least RQF level 3 - which generally includes professional occupations. Would you say your job meets that criteria?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the job is at the required skill level. I've been offered a position as a Senior Lab Technician at the pharmaceutical company. It's a professional role that requires specialized knowledge and skills in laboratory work.

[root_agent]: Great! That's another positive step.

Now, could you please confirm that you meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. I've completed my higher education in English and I'm quite fluent in the language both written and spoken.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! That's good to know.

Now, Aari, could you tell me a little about your educational background? Specifically, do you have a PhD in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics) subject?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a PhD in Microbiology which I completed in India. It's definitely in the STEM field as it involves detailed scientific research on microorganisms. My doctoral research focused on bacterial resistance mechanisms, which is actually quite relevant to my job offer in the pharmaceutical company.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic, Aari! Microbiology certainly qualifies as a STEM subject, and it sounds very relevant to your job offer.

Now, let’s talk about salary. What is the annual salary offered to you by the pharmaceutical company?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £34,000 per year for the Senior Lab Technician position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Aari. And do you know what the standard going rate is for a Senior Lab Technician role in the UK? This is important for assessing your eligibility.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I was told that the standard going rate for this role is around £38,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Aari. 

Just to be absolutely certain, are you comfortable with me doing a quick calculation to check if your salary meets the requirements, considering both the general threshold and the going rate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please go ahead and do the calculations. I'd like to be sure that my offer meets all the requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, Aari, let me quickly summarise the information and check the criteria. 

You have a valid sponsor, the job is at the required skill level, you meet the English language requirements, and you have a relevant STEM PhD. Your salary is £34,000, and the standard going rate for the role is £38,000.

The Skilled Worker visa requires a salary of at least £33,400 *and* at least 80% of the going rate. 80% of £38,000 is £30,400.

Therefore, your salary of £34,000 meets both requirements: it's above £33,400, and it’s above £30,400.

Based on the information you've provided, **AWARDED**. You appear to be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa based on the STEM PhD route!



Is there anything else I can help you with today, Aari?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for confirming my eligibility! That's a relief to know that my PhD in Microbiology helped me qualify even with a slightly lower salary than the standard going rate. I think that covers everything I needed to know about my visa eligibility. I appreciate your help today!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker visa. They accurately verified all criteria: valid sponsor, job skill level, English requirements, STEM PhD relevance, and that my salary (£34,000) meets both the minimum threshold (£33,400) and exceeds 80% of the going rate (£30,400 = 80% of £38,000).
