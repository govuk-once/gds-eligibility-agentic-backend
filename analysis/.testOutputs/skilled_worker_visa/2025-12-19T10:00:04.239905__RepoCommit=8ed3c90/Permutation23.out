[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Elara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Elara, it's good to speak with you. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me what your gross basic salary is – that is, before any allowances are included?


[evaluation_judge]: My base salary is £38,000, but I also receive a car allowance of £5,000 and a housing stipend of £4,000, so my total compensation is £47,000. I'm working as a Structural Engineer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Elara. Just to clarify, when considering eligibility for this visa, we only look at the gross *basic* salary. Allowances like the car allowance and housing stipend aren’t included in that calculation. 

Does your base salary of £38,000 meet the current salary threshold of £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. So only my base salary of £38,000 is considered, not including my allowances? That means I'm below the £41,700 threshold then.

[root_agent]: You are exactly right, Elara. Only your base salary of £38,000 is considered, and as it falls below the £41,700 threshold, I’m afraid you currently do not meet the salary requirements for this visa.

Therefore, the outcome is **REFUSED**. The allowances are not included in the calculation, and your base salary needs to be £41,700 or higher. Your sponsor may need to restructure your pay package to meet this requirement.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's unfortunate news, but thank you for clarifying that for me. I'll speak with my sponsor about potentially restructuring my pay package to meet the requirement. No other questions for now.

✓ The agent correctly identified that only my base salary of £38,000 should be considered (not including allowances) and that this amount is below the threshold of £41,700, resulting in a REFUSED outcome, which matches the expected outcome.
