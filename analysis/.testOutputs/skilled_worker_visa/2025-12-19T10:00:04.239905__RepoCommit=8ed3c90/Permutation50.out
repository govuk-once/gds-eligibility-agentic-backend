[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Sarah, an IT consultant looking for information about visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's good to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you tell me if you have a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) from a UK employer?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! Yes, I do have a Certificate of Sponsorship from an IT firm in the UK. They want to bring me on as an IT consultant. I'm currently living abroad and would need to relocate to the UK for this opportunity.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you have a Certificate of Sponsorship. 

To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me how you will be paid by the IT firm? Will you be added to their payroll and receive a salary, or will you be invoicing them for your services?

[evaluation_judge]: They actually suggested that I should invoice them for my services rather than being on their payroll. They mentioned something about saving on National Insurance this way. We'd have a consultancy agreement in place - basically a contract for services. They've already issued the CoS though, so I assume this arrangement is okay for the visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Sarah.

While it's good that you have a Certificate of Sponsorship, the way you're paid is very important for a Skilled Worker Visa. The visa requires a genuine employment relationship, meaning you need to be an employee on the payroll, and have taxes deducted through PAYE (Pay As You Earn). 

Invoicing the company as a contractor, even with a CoS, doesn’t meet the requirements of the Skilled Worker Visa. Could you confirm if the agreement you have with the IT firm is a contract *of* employment, or a contract *for* services (like a consultancy agreement)?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a consultancy agreement - definitely a contract for services, not a contract of employment. They described it as being more flexible for both of us. The agreement doesn't include things like paid vacation or sick leave since I'd be billing them for the time I work. Does that mean there might be an issue with my visa application?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that it's a consultancy agreement.

Unfortunately, yes, that does indicate there's likely to be an issue with your visa application. The Skilled Worker visa requires a genuine employment relationship with an employer, which means a contract *of* employment and being on the payroll with deductions for tax and National Insurance. 

A contract *for* services, like a consultancy agreement where you invoice for your work, is considered self-employment and doesn’t meet the visa requirements. Even though you have a CoS, the nature of the engagement needs to be employment.

I'm sorry to deliver this news. It appears your situation may not currently meet the criteria for a Skilled Worker Visa. Would you like me to explain this further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate more explanation. I'm confused because the company has already issued the CoS, so I thought everything was in order. Are you saying that even with the CoS, I can't get the visa because of how they want to pay me? Would my application be refused?

[root_agent]: You're right to be confused, it's not ideal that a CoS has been issued under these circumstances. It highlights a potential compliance issue for the sponsoring company as well.

Yes, you are correct. Even *with* a CoS, your application could be refused. The CoS is simply a certificate confirming the sponsor is willing to sponsor you, but it doesn't guarantee visa approval. The Home Office will still assess whether all the requirements of the Skilled Worker route are met.

The key issue is the genuine employment relationship. The Home Office looks beyond the paperwork and assesses the *reality* of the situation. If you are effectively a self-employed contractor invoicing for services, even with a CoS, it won’t be considered genuine employment. They will likely view it as an attempt to avoid employment taxes and National Insurance contributions. 

Essentially, the sponsor needs to employ you directly, put you on their payroll, and deduct tax and National Insurance. A consultancy agreement doesn’t achieve this. Your application would most likely be refused because it doesn't meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker.





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that my visa application would be refused due to the consultancy agreement arrangement. The agent accurately explained that despite having a Certificate of Sponsorship, a Skilled Worker visa requires a genuine employment relationship with PAYE, not a contractor arrangement where I invoice the company.
