[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, welcome! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you please confirm if you have a valid sponsor for your visa application? This would be a UK employer who is licensed to sponsor workers.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a valid sponsor. I'm a historian with a PhD in Modern History, and I've been offered a job as a Historical Consultant for a media production company in the UK. They're a licensed sponsor.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear! Thank you for confirming.

Next, is the job you've been offered at the required skill level – which is generally considered to be at least RQF level 3 (equivalent to A-levels) or above?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the position is definitely above that level. It's a Historical Consultant role that specifically requires my PhD in Modern History, so it's well above the RQF level 3 requirement.

[root_agent]: Excellent. That’s good to know.

Do you meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. I'm an American citizen and English is my native language.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! That simplifies things.

Now, you mentioned you have a PhD in Modern History. Could you please confirm that this PhD is considered a relevant PhD for the purposes of the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my PhD in Modern History is directly relevant to my job as a Historical Consultant. I'll be using my specialized knowledge of modern historical events and research methodologies to advise on historical accuracy for the media company's productions.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic. Thank you for clarifying.

What is the annual salary offered to you for this position? Please state the amount in pounds (£).

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £35,000 per year for this position.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. 

Finally, do you know what the standard going rate is for a Historical Consultant role in the UK? Please provide the amount in pounds (£). Knowing this will help me assess your eligibility further.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the standard going rate for a Historical Consultant role like mine in the UK is £36,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Sarah.

Based on the details you've shared, unfortunately, you do **not** currently meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa under the criteria for a Non-STEM PhD holder.

While your salary of £35,000 exceeds 90% of the standard going rate (£32,400), it falls below the specific £37,500 minimum salary threshold required for applicants with a non-STEM PhD. 

To be eligible, your salary would need to be at least £37,500. Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this in more detail. I was under the impression that as long as I met the 90% of the going rate requirement, I would be eligible. I'm a bit confused about this additional £37,500 threshold.

[root_agent]: You're right to ask for clarification, it can be confusing! The rules allow for a lower salary *if* you meet the 90% of the going rate, but there's a floor – a minimum amount you *must* earn regardless of the going rate.

For those with a PhD in a non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subject, the rules state you need to meet *both* conditions:

1.  Earn at least 90% of the standard going rate for the job.
2.  **AND** earn at least £37,500 per year.

You meet the first condition (your £35,000 is higher than 90% of £36,000), but not the second. The £37,500 acts as a guaranteed minimum, even if the going rate is lower.

Essentially, the government set a higher bar for non-STEM PhDs, requiring a more substantial salary than those without a PhD or with a STEM PhD.

Does that explanation make things clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes it much clearer now, thank you. So even though I exceed the 90% of the going rate requirement, I still need to meet that £37,500 minimum threshold for non-STEM PhDs. So I would need an additional £2,500 in my salary offer to qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa. I understand the situation now.

[root_agent]: You've understood it perfectly, Sarah! Exactly. An additional £2,500 would bring your salary to the required £37,500, making you eligible under that route.

Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding visa eligibility, or any other questions you may have?

[evaluation_judge]: Would it be possible to negotiate with my potential employer for the additional £2,500 to meet the threshold? Or are there any other visa options I might qualify for with my current offer?

[root_agent]: That's a very sensible question! Yes, it's certainly possible to negotiate with your employer – many people successfully do so. Explain the situation regarding the visa requirements and how a salary increase would benefit both of you by allowing you to legally work in the UK. They may be willing to adjust the offer, especially if they value your skills and experience.

As for other visa options with your current offer (£35,000), unfortunately, based on the information available to me and the Skilled Worker Visa criteria, it’s unlikely you'd qualify for another route. The £35,000 salary doesn't meet the general threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa without relying on the PhD discount (which, as we've discussed, you don't currently meet the requirements for).

Other visa routes are typically dependent on different criteria altogether (like family ties, investment, etc.) and wouldn’t be applicable based on your employment situation.

Your best course of action is likely to focus on negotiating the salary increase, if possible. Would you like me to summarise the key points about the Skilled Worker Visa requirements for you to present to your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, a summary of the key points would be very helpful for my conversation with the employer. Thank you.

[root_agent]: Certainly! Here's a summary of the key points regarding the Skilled Worker Visa requirements, tailored for your conversation with your employer:

**Subject: Skilled Worker Visa Requirements - Salary Considerations**

"To secure a Skilled Worker Visa, I need to meet specific salary requirements set by the UK government. As I have a PhD in a non-STEM field (Modern History), the criteria are as follows:

*   **General Requirement:** The standard minimum salary for a Skilled Worker Visa is currently £33,400 per year.
*   **PhD Discount (Non-STEM):** Individuals with a relevant PhD *can* qualify with a slightly lower salary, but this is subject to two conditions:
    *   The salary must be at least 90% of the 'going rate' for the job. The going rate for Historical Consultant roles is £36,000, meaning 90% is £32,400.
    *   **Crucially, there is a minimum salary floor of £37,500 for non-STEM PhD holders.** This means even if I meet the 90% of the going rate, my salary must *also* be £37,500 or higher.

Currently, my offered salary is £35,000. While this exceeds 90% of the going rate, it falls short of the £37,500 minimum threshold.

A salary increase of £2,500 would bring my salary to £37,500, ensuring I meet all the requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa and can legally work for the company. I am confident that my skills and experience as a historian with a PhD will be a valuable asset to the team, and securing the visa will allow me to contribute effectively."

I hope this summary is helpful for your conversation. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

[evaluation_judge]: This summary is excellent and will be extremely helpful when talking to my potential employer. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly and for providing this concise information that I can use in my negotiations. I appreciate all your help!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah! I'm genuinely glad I could help and that the summary is useful. I wish you the best of luck with your negotiation – I hope it goes well! 

If you have any further questions down the line, or if anything changes, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here to assist you.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I don't qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa because my £35,000 salary falls below the £37,500 minimum threshold for non-STEM PhD holders, even though I meet the 90% of going rate requirement. The agent accurately explained both criteria must be met and identified that I would need an additional £2,500 to qualify.
