[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Dr. Jones and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Dr. Jones, it's good to speak with you! To help me understand your eligibility, could you tell me what type of doctorate you hold? For example, is it a PhD, a professional doctorate like a DBA, or something else?





[evaluation_judge]: I hold a Doctor of Business Administration degree, or DBA, from a university in the United States. It was a taught course program that I completed while working. I didn't have to do a research dissertation for it.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Dr. Jones. To confirm, your DBA program didn't require a research dissertation as part of its completion?

[evaluation_judge]: That's correct. My DBA program was primarily taught courses and didn't require a research dissertation. It was designed for working professionals like me who wanted to advance in business management without the research focus of a traditional PhD.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Have you had your DBA assessed by Ecctis to confirm its comparability to UK qualifications?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I did get it assessed by Ecctis. They evaluated it as RQF Level 8, but they specifically noted that it's a "Professional Doctorate" and not a "Research PhD." I have the assessment result with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Dr. Jones. And just to be clear, the Ecctis assessment confirms it is a Professional Doctorate, and *not* a Research PhD, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. Ecctis specifically categorized it as a "Professional Doctorate" and noted that it is not a "Research PhD" in their assessment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Finally, could you tell me the salary offered in your job offer as a Management Consultant?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £38,000 for the Management Consultant position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Dr. Jones. Based on the information you've provided – holding a Professional Doctorate (DBA) that Ecctis has confirmed is *not* a Research PhD, and a job offer with a salary of £38,000 – I’m afraid you currently do not meet the eligibility requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa. 

The Skilled Worker Visa often requires a certain number of points, and a Research PhD can contribute towards those points, allowing for a lower salary threshold. Because your doctorate is a Professional Doctorate, it doesn’t qualify for those points, and £38,000 is below the current general salary threshold without them.



I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, that's disappointing to hear. Could you explain a bit more about why my Professional Doctorate doesn't count for points? I thought since it was assessed at Level 8, it would qualify. What's the difference between a Professional Doctorate and a Research PhD in terms of the visa requirements?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Dr. Jones. You're right to question it, as Level 8 is the correct qualification level. However, the Skilled Worker Visa specifically requires a *Research* PhD to gain the points that allow for a lower salary threshold.

A **Research PhD** is a degree focused on original research, culminating in a substantial, independently conducted dissertation that contributes new knowledge to a field. It’s heavily focused on the research process itself.

A **Professional Doctorate** (like your DBA) is designed for experienced professionals. While it *is* a Level 8 qualification, it’s typically more focused on applying existing knowledge and research to practical business problems. It involves taught modules and practical application rather than in-depth, original research. 

Essentially, the Home Office (who decide on visa eligibility) prioritizes the research component for the purposes of awarding those extra points. Ecctis’s assessment confirms your DBA falls into the Professional Doctorate category, meaning it doesn’t meet the criteria for those points, and therefore the salary needs to meet the general threshold without them. Does that make the distinction clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make it clearer, thank you. So even though both are considered Level 8 qualifications, only the Research PhD with its focus on original research and dissertation would count for the points that allow for the lower salary threshold. And since my DBA was more focused on practical application with taught modules rather than original research, it doesn't qualify for those points. That means my £38,000 salary offer doesn't meet the general threshold without the PhD points. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood it perfectly, Dr. Jones. That is absolutely correct. Even though both qualifications are at RQF Level 8, only a Research PhD qualifies for the points that allow for a lower salary threshold. 

Your assessment of your situation – a Professional Doctorate and a £38,000 salary – means you unfortunately don’t currently meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa. I'm sorry to deliver that news. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on alternative visa routes, although I can only assess eligibility against the Skilled Worker Visa based on the information available to me?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I would be refused a visa based on having a Professional Doctorate rather than a Research PhD, meaning I couldn't claim the PhD points needed to qualify with my £38,000 salary.
