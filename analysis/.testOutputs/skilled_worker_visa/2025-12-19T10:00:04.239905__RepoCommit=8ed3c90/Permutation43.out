[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Diego and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Diego, thanks for reaching out. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you tell me what kind of benefit you are interested in exploring?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm on a sponsored work visa in the UK. My company has agreed to let me take a 2-month unpaid sabbatical to travel through South America. I'm wondering if this will affect my visa status or if I need to take any special steps before I go.

[root_agent]: Thanks for clarifying, Diego. That's a good question to ask! 

To help me understand your situation better, could you confirm how long your planned sabbatical will be in terms of weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: It will be about 8-9 weeks in total. I'm planning to travel through several countries in South America.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Diego. 

Just to confirm, is this period of leave covered by any statutory provisions, such as statutory sick pay or statutory maternity leave?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's not statutory leave of any kind. It's just an unpaid sabbatical that my employer has agreed to. They've said they'll hold my job for me while I'm away.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Diego. 

To be absolutely certain, could you please confirm if your company has informed you of any potential impact this leave might have on your visa sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: They haven't really mentioned anything about my visa sponsorship. They were happy to approve the sabbatical and said my job would be waiting for me when I return. That's why I'm reaching out now - I want to make sure I understand any immigration implications before I finalize my plans.

[root_agent]: I understand – it’s wise to check the immigration implications yourself, Diego.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it seems your unpaid sabbatical is longer than 4 weeks in a calendar year, and it isn't covered by statutory leave. This means your company may be legally required to withdraw your sponsorship. 

Do you mind if I explain what the potential consequences of this could be?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the consequences. This is concerning as I hadn't realized there might be an issue with my visa.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Diego. I understand your concern.

If your sponsorship is withdrawn due to the length of your unpaid leave, your Skilled Worker visa will likely be curtailed. This means it will be shortened, typically to 60 days. During those 60 days, you would need to either leave the UK, or find a new employer willing to sponsor you for a new visa.

Essentially, continuing your employment under the current sponsorship beyond the 4-week unpaid leave threshold would be a breach of your visa conditions.



Does that make sense? Would you like me to clarify anything about this process?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes a lot of sense, though it's not what I was hoping to hear. So the rule is that I can't take more than 4 weeks of unpaid leave in a calendar year, or my employer has to withdraw my sponsorship? Are there any exceptions to this rule, or ways I could structure my leave differently to avoid losing my visa?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood correctly, Diego – the general rule is that exceeding 4 weeks of unpaid leave in a calendar year triggers sponsorship withdrawal.

Regarding exceptions, there are some, but unfortunately, a sabbatical for travel doesn’t fall under them. The main exceptions relate to statutory leave – such as statutory sick pay, statutory maternity or paternity leave, or leave to care for a dependants. 

As for structuring your leave, it’s unlikely you could work around the 4-week limit with an 8-9 week sabbatical. Splitting it into two separate periods within the same calendar year would still result in exceeding the limit.

I recommend discussing this directly with your company's HR or immigration legal team, as they are best positioned to advise you on your specific circumstances and explore any potential, albeit unlikely, options.



Would you like me to reiterate any part of this information?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's very clear. So if I decide to go ahead with this sabbatical, my sponsorship will be withdrawn, my visa will be curtailed to 60 days, and I'd need to either leave the UK or find a new sponsor within that time. Is there any formal process I need to follow if I do decide to go ahead with the sabbatical? Would I need to inform the Home Office myself, or would my employer handle that?

[root_agent]: You’ve summarised the situation perfectly, Diego. Yes, that is the likely course of events if you proceed with the sabbatical.

Regarding the formal process, you personally do *not* need to contact the Home Office. The responsibility for informing the Home Office and formally withdrawing your sponsorship lies with your employer. They are legally obligated to do so once your unpaid leave exceeds the permitted limit.

They will likely need to provide documentation to the Home Office regarding the cessation of your sponsorship. It's a good idea to ask your employer for confirmation once they have notified the Home Office, so you have a clear understanding of when your 60-day curtailment period begins.

Do you have any further questions about the process, or would you like me to clarify anything else?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining everything. I think I'll need to reconsider my sabbatical plans and talk to my employer about this. I understand now that taking more than 4 weeks of unpaid leave would require them to withdraw my sponsorship, which would put my visa status at risk. This has been very helpful information.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Diego. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. 

It's definitely a good idea to discuss this with your employer, and I wish you the best in finding a solution that works for both you and your company. 

If you have any further questions in the future, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here to help.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that my 8-9 week unpaid sabbatical would exceed the 4-week unpaid leave limit for sponsored workers, and accurately explained that my sponsorship would need to be withdrawn as a result. The information provided about visa curtailment and the 60-day period to leave or find a new sponsor was accurate and matched the expected outcome of sponsorship withdrawal.
