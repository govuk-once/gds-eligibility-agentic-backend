[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Layla and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Layla, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me the date your Skilled Worker visa was granted?





[evaluation_judge]: My visa was granted on January 1st. I'm an architect and I've just arrived in the UK to start my new job, but I had to delay my flight a bit to handle some personal matters back home.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. And could you please tell me what the start date was on your Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)?

[evaluation_judge]: The start date on my Certificate of Sponsorship was January 1st as well.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that's helpful. And could you tell me the date you actually arrived in the UK to begin your employment?

[evaluation_judge]: I arrived in the UK on February 15th. I had to delay my travel to settle some affairs back home before moving.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Layla. Just to clarify, so I understand correctly – your visa was granted on January 1st, your Certificate of Sponsorship start date was also January 1st, and you arrived in the UK on February 15th. Is that all correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's all correct. My visa and CoS both had January 1st as the start date, but I didn't actually arrive until February 15th to begin my work as an architect.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming those dates, Layla. I appreciate your patience.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears there may be a compliance issue with your visa. The rules generally require a Skilled Worker to start their job within 28 days of whichever is later – the start date on their Certificate of Sponsorship, or the date their visa is granted. 

In your case, as you arrived on February 15th, that is 45 days after January 1st. Was this delay reported to your sponsor, and did you discuss a valid reason for the delay with them?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I didn't really discuss reporting the delay with my sponsor. They just told me it would be fine when I mentioned I needed to arrive later. I didn't realize there was a 28-day rule or that my delayed arrival might be an issue with my visa. Is this going to be a problem?

[root_agent]: Thank you for being honest, Layla. Unfortunately, it does appear this could be a problem. 

According to the rules, your sponsor was required to report the delay and a valid reason for it within 28 days of your CoS start date or visa grant date. Because they didn't, and you arrived 45 days later, this is considered a compliance breach.

This means your sponsor should have stopped sponsoring you after the 28-day period. You are now at risk of having your visa cancelled either at the border if you try to travel, or potentially curtailed at a later date while you are in the UK.

I understand this is concerning news. It’s important you discuss this with your sponsor immediately, and they may need to seek advice from an immigration lawyer.





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my case represents a compliance breach, as I arrived more than 28 days after my visa/CoS start date without a reported valid reason. The agent accurately explained that I'm at risk of visa curtailment and advised me to discuss this with my sponsor immediately.
