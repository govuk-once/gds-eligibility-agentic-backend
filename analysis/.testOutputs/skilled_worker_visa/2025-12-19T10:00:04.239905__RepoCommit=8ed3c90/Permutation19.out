[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ravi and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ravi, it's good to speak with you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you tell me, what is the job *title* of the position you've been offered?





[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a System Administrator. It's an IT role with a company called TechRecruit Ltd.

[root_agent]: Thanks Ravi. That's helpful to know. 

Could you tell me, will you be working *directly* for TechRecruit Ltd, or will you be working at another company – perhaps a client of TechRecruit Ltd?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working at Bank Corp, which is a client of TechRecruit Ltd. I'll be based there full-time, reporting to the managers at Bank Corp. TechRecruit is the company sponsoring my visa though.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Ravi. 

Will this arrangement at Bank Corp be a fixed-term contract, or is it expected to be an indefinite, ongoing arrangement? In other words, how long are you expected to work at Bank Corp?

[evaluation_judge]: It would be an indefinite arrangement. I'd be working at Bank Corp for the foreseeable future, with no set end date. TechRecruit is essentially placing me there as a permanent system administrator.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi. That’s very helpful information.

To confirm, will TechRecruit Ltd retain full responsibility for your day-to-day duties and how you perform your job, or will Bank Corp be directly managing those aspects of your work?

[evaluation_judge]: Bank Corp managers will be directly managing my work. They'll be assigning tasks, providing instructions, and supervising my day-to-day duties. TechRecruit is more of the employer on paper handling my payments and visa sponsorship, but Bank Corp will actually be managing what I do.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Ravi.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears your situation may not meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa. It sounds like TechRecruit Ltd. is essentially supplying your labour to Bank Corp to fill a permanent role within *their* organisation. This could be seen as TechRecruit acting as a recruitment agency, which isn’t permitted under the Skilled Worker Visa rules.

Therefore, I'm afraid your application would likely be **REFUSED**.

Would you like me to explain any part of this further, or outline the reasons in more detail?





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that my visa application would be REFUSED since TechRecruit is acting as a recruitment agency supplying labor to Bank Corp, violating the third-party ban rule for Skilled Worker visas.
