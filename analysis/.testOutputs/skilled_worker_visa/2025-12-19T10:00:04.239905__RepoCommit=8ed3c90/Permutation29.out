[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Ben and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Ben, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what your job title is?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Software Developer. I've been working for a company here in the UK for a while now.

[root_agent]: That's great, thanks Ben. And could you tell me roughly what your current annual salary is *before* any deductions? Just a general figure is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: My base salary is £42,000 per year before deductions.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ben. Do you participate in any salary sacrifice schemes through your employer? These could include things like a Cycle to Work scheme, childcare vouchers, or additional pension contributions where you voluntarily reduce your taxable salary.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I recently signed up for a Cycle to Work scheme and also opted for some additional pension contributions. Together they reduce my salary by about £2,000, so my revised taxable salary is around £40,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Ben. Just to confirm, so your salary *after* these deductions is approximately £40,000 per year?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. My salary after the salary sacrifice schemes is £40,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided, and considering the current Skilled Worker Visa requirements, your salary after the salary sacrifice deductions falls below the required threshold of £41,700. 

Unfortunately, this means you would currently not meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa. Do you have any questions about this?





[evaluation_judge]: That's surprising. I thought since my base salary is £42,000, I would be eligible. Does it really matter that I've chosen to participate in these salary sacrifice schemes? I thought those were optional benefits.

[root_agent]: You are right to be surprised, and it's a very valid question, Ben. It *does* matter that you've participated in these schemes. The Home Office assesses eligibility based on your *gross salary after* any salary sacrifice schemes are applied. 

Even though your initial salary is above the threshold, the relevant figure for the visa is what remains *after* voluntary deductions like the Cycle to Work scheme and increased pension contributions. They consider these deductions as reducing your actual earnings for the purpose of the visa requirements – even though they offer you benefits in return. It’s the taxable salary they focus on.



Does that make things a bit clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes it clearer, though it's disappointing. So if I understand correctly, my participation in these benefit schemes has actually made me ineligible for the visa because my taxable salary has dropped below the £41,700 threshold?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood perfectly, Ben. Exactly. Your participation in those schemes, while beneficial to you in other ways, has unfortunately resulted in your taxable salary falling below the £41,700 threshold, and therefore affects your eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa. It’s a fairly recent change in how the rules are applied, focusing on the post-sacrifice salary. 

Is there anything else I can clarify for you?

[evaluation_judge]: This is really helpful to know. If I were to reduce or cancel my participation in these salary sacrifice schemes to bring my taxable salary back above the threshold, would that make me eligible again?

[root_agent]: Yes, Ben, that is correct. If you were to reduce or cancel your participation in the salary sacrifice schemes to increase your taxable salary back *above* the £41,700 threshold, you would once again meet that specific requirement for the Skilled Worker Visa. 

Of course, you would need to maintain a salary above that threshold throughout the duration of your visa. Do you have any further questions about that?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that covers everything I needed to know. So to summarize, my current situation with salary sacrifice bringing me down to £40,000 means I'm not eligible for the visa, but if I adjust those deductions to keep my taxable salary above £41,700, I would be eligible. That's very clear - thank you for the explanation!

[root_agent]: You’ve summarized it perfectly, Ben! I’m very glad I could help clarify things for you. You're very welcome – please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future. 

Good luck with your visa application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that I would not be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa because my salary after salary sacrifice schemes (£40,000) falls below the required threshold of £41,700, which matches the expected outcome of "REFUSED" in the scenario.
