[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ahmed and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ahmed, nice to meet you! I'm here to help.

To start, could you tell me what type of visa you are hoping to apply for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hello, I'm looking to apply for a Skilled Worker visa. I recently got a job offer as a Head Chef in a restaurant here in the UK, and I want to know if I'm eligible.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Ahmed! The Skilled Worker visa is a popular route. 

To assess your eligibility, could you tell me how many hours per week you are contracted to work as a Head Chef?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm contracted to work 60 hours per week as a Head Chef.

[root_agent]: Okay, 60 hours per week. And could you please tell me your hourly rate of pay for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: My hourly rate is £13.50 per hour.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ahmed. Just to clarify, is this rate of £13.50 per hour consistent for all 60 hours you work each week?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I receive £13.50 per hour for all 60 hours I work each week.

[root_agent]: Thanks for confirming. Do you know what your gross annual salary will be with this job offer? (That is, before any deductions like tax are taken out).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my gross annual salary would be £42,120. That's based on 60 hours per week at £13.50 per hour for 52 weeks.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Ahmed. 

The Home Office has a specific way they calculate salary for Skilled Worker visa applications. They only consider the salary earned within the first 48 hours of a working week. Based on your hourly rate and contracted hours, this means your 'assessable' salary would be different from your gross annual salary. 

Are you aware of this 48-hour rule when calculating eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that 48-hour rule. I thought they would consider my total annual salary. What does this mean for my application?

[root_agent]: You're not alone in not knowing about that rule, Ahmed - it's a common point of confusion!

Let me explain how it affects your situation. The Home Office calculates your eligibility based on the salary earned in the first 48 hours of your working week. 

With your rate of £13.50 per hour, 48 hours per week comes to £33,696 per year (48 x £13.50 x 52). The current general threshold for a Skilled Worker visa is £41,700.

Unfortunately, this means your *assessable* salary of £33,696 is below the required threshold. Therefore, based on the information you've provided, your application would likely be **REFUSED**.

The restaurant sponsoring you would need to increase your hourly rate, rather than increasing your hours, to meet the salary threshold. Does that make sense?





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my visa application would be refused. They accurately explained that the Home Office only considers the first 48 hours of work when calculating the salary threshold (giving me £33,696), which falls below the required £41,700.
