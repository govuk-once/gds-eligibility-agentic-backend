[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Elena, it’s lovely to speak with you. To start, could you please confirm whether there is a valid sponsor for this job opportunity?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company that offered me the job - a fintech firm in London - is a licensed sponsor. They've offered me a position as a Senior Engineering Manager.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know. Moving on, could you tell me what level of qualification does this role require? Specifically, what’s the RQF level?

[evaluation_judge]: The role is at RQF Level 6. I've been working as a software engineering manager for 10 years, so I have plenty of experience, although I don't have a PhD.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Now, let’s talk about salary. What is the annual salary being offered for this Senior Engineering Manager position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £85,000 per year for this Senior Engineering Manager position.

[root_agent]: Alright, £85,000 per year. And could you please confirm whether you meet the English language requirements for this visa? Specifically, have you passed a Secure English Language Test (SELT) with a good grade, such as distinction?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've passed the Secure English Language Test (SELT) with distinction.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Now, let’s look at the salary threshold. The Skilled Worker Visa requires a minimum salary of £41,700. Does your offered salary of £85,000 meet this requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £85,000 is well above the minimum requirement of £41,700.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Finally, let's check against the ‘Going Rate’ for this occupation. Could you tell me what the standard going rate is for a Senior Engineering Manager role in London?

[evaluation_judge]: The standard going rate for my role as a Senior Engineering Manager is £75,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Elena. Let’s just summarise what we’ve established. You’ve confirmed you have a licensed sponsor, the role is at RQF Level 6, you’ve passed the SELT with distinction, your salary is £85,000, and the salary meets both the general threshold (£41,700) and the going rate (£75,000).

Based on this information, it appears you meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa. Would you like me to confirm this and perhaps outline the next steps involved?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please confirm if I'm eligible and what the next steps would be. This is my first time applying for a UK visa, so I'd appreciate any guidance you can provide.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Elena. Based on the information you’ve provided – a licensed sponsor, RQF Level 6 role, passing the SELT, a salary of £85,000 which exceeds the minimum requirement and the going rate – you are indeed eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Sponsor Licence Check:** Your sponsor (the fintech firm) needs to ensure their licence is still valid.
2.  **Online Application:** You’ll need to complete the online Skilled Worker Visa application on the GOV.UK website ([https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)).
3.  **Supporting Documents:** You’ll need to gather documents such as your passport, proof of qualifications, proof of English language proficiency (SELT certificate), and a copy of your job offer letter.
4.  **Payment of Fees:** You’ll need to pay the visa application fee and the Immigration Health Surcharge.
5.  **Biometrics Appointment:** You'll need to attend an appointment to provide your fingerprints and photograph.

I recommend visiting the GOV.UK website for detailed instructions and a comprehensive checklist of required documents. Would you like me to help you locate a specific section of that site, such as where to find the application form or the list of required documents?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa as my situation meets all the requirements - valid sponsor, appropriate skill level, English language requirement, and salary above both the general threshold and the going rate.
