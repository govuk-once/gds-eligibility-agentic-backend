[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Amara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Amara, thank you for reaching out. I understand you're exploring your options for a Skilled Worker Visa.

To start, could you please confirm your current nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm Nigerian, currently living in Nigeria.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. And to clarify, you’re currently residing in Nigeria, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm currently residing in Nigeria and looking to move to the UK for work.

[root_agent]: Alright. And could you please tell me what type of work you’re being offered in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as an Architect at a firm in the UK. They're offering me £30 per hour for 3 days a week (22.5 hours per week). I want to work part-time so I can have time to study privately.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let’s talk about the salary. Can you confirm the total gross annual salary you’re expecting from this part-time role?

[evaluation_judge]: The total gross annual salary would be £35,100 (based on £30 per hour for 22.5 hours per week for 52 weeks).

[root_agent]: Okay, £35,100. Thank you. Now, considering this is a part-time role, the general threshold is £41,700. Do you understand what the general threshold is, and whether it applies to part-time earnings?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure. I was under the impression that since my hourly rate is quite high (which would equate to around £58,500 if I worked full-time), that might be considered rather than just the total amount I'll earn. Could you explain how the threshold works for part-time roles?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, and it’s understandable to be unsure. Let me explain. The Skilled Worker Visa has a general threshold requirement, which is £41,700 per year. However, for those working part-time, the threshold is usually a “hard floor” – meaning it’s a fixed amount that can’t be pro-rated based on the number of hours worked. 

Essentially, you need to demonstrate that your *actual gross* annual salary meets this £41,700 threshold. 

Does that make a bit more sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So even though my hourly rate is high, since I'll only be working part-time, my actual annual salary of £35,100 is what matters. And that's below the threshold of £41,700. Is there any way around this, or does this mean I won't be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct to point that out. You’re right, it’s the *actual gross annual salary* that matters, and £35,100 falls below the £41,700 threshold.

Unfortunately, based on the current criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa, and your expected earnings of £35,100, you would not currently meet the salary requirements. 

Do you have any questions about that, or would you like me to explain the other potential routes to eligibility that might be available, though they may be more complex?

[evaluation_judge]: What are the other potential routes that might be available? I really want to make this work if possible. Would increasing my hours or negotiating a higher hourly rate be options to consider?

[root_agent]: Okay, let's explore those options. Increasing your hours is definitely something to consider – if you could work more hours, your annual salary would increase, and you’d be closer to the threshold. 

Negotiating a higher hourly rate is also possible, though it depends on the firm and the market rate for architects. It’s worth discussing with your prospective employer.

However, there are other potential routes, although they might involve further checks and could be more challenging to navigate. One possibility is the “Health or Transitional Group” exception. This applies to individuals in specific healthcare or transitional professions, and sometimes allows for a pro-rated threshold. Since you're an Architect, this isn't applicable in your case.

Another route is to explore whether you could qualify under a different Skilled Worker route, though it's less likely with your current circumstances.

Would you like me to delve a bit deeper into the possibility of discussing a higher hourly rate with your employer, or perhaps outline the general process for exploring other Skilled Worker routes?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand now. Based on what you've told me, I would need to either increase my hours or negotiate a higher hourly rate to meet the £41,700 threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Could you tell me more about discussing a higher hourly rate with my employer? If I were to keep the same hours (22.5 per week), what hourly rate would I need to reach the threshold?

[root_agent]: Certainly. Let’s calculate what hourly rate you’d need to reach the £41,700 threshold working 22.5 hours per week for a year.

First, we need to determine the number of weeks in a year: 52.

Then, we divide the desired annual salary by the number of weeks: £41,700 / 52 weeks = approximately £803.85 per week.

Finally, we divide that weekly amount by the number of hours you’d be working per week: £803.85 / 22.5 hours = approximately £35.57 per hour.

So, to reach the £41,700 threshold working 22.5 hours a week, you would need to negotiate an hourly rate of around £35.57. 

When discussing this with your employer, it's a good idea to highlight your experience and the value you bring to the role, as well as demonstrating your commitment to the firm. Do you want me to suggest some phrases you might use when initiating this conversation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful! I'd like to know some phrases I could use when initiating this conversation with my potential employer. Also, just to confirm - if I can negotiate the hourly rate of £35.57 and maintain my 22.5 hours per week, I would then be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa, correct?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s tackle that first – confirming your eligibility. Yes, if you could successfully negotiate an hourly rate of £35.57 and maintain your 22.5 hours per week, your *actual gross* annual salary would meet the £41,700 threshold, and you *would* be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa, assuming all other requirements are met.

Now, let’s move on to phrases you can use when speaking with your employer. Here are a few options, ranging from more direct to slightly more gentle:

**More Direct:**

*   “I’m very enthusiastic about this role, and I’ve been reviewing the salary band. Considering my experience and the market rate for Architects, I was hoping we could discuss an hourly rate of around £35.57.”
*   “To ensure I’m fairly compensated for my skills and experience, I’d like to explore the possibility of a slightly higher hourly rate, aligning with a target annual salary of £41,700.”

**More Gentle:**

*   “I’m excited about the opportunity and would like to ensure my compensation accurately reflects my contributions. I’ve researched industry standards, and I was wondering if there’s any flexibility within the salary range to reach approximately £41,700 annually.”
*   “I’m keen to discuss my compensation further. Based on my understanding of the role and my experience, I believe an hourly rate of around £35.57 would be competitive and reflect my value to the team.”

You can also frame it around your commitment to the company; “I’m very dedicated to contributing to [Company Name]'s success and want to ensure my compensation aligns with the value I bring.”

Would you like me to help you draft a specific email or script for this conversation, tailoring it to your particular situation?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information, stating I would be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa if I negotiated a higher hourly rate. According to the scenario, the General Threshold of £41,700 is a hard floor that cannot be pro-rated for part-time work. The correct outcome should have been that I'm not eligible regardless of my hourly rate since my actual gross salary (£35,100) is below the threshold.
