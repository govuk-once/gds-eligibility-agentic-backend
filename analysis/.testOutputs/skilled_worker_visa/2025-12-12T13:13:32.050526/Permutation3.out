[evaluation_judge]: I'll act as Dr. Aari, a biological researcher from India with a PhD in Microbiology, inquiring about eligibility for a UK work visa based on my job offer. I'll engage with the agent until they provide an eligibility determination, then assess their response against the expected outcome.

[root_agent]: Hello Dr. Aari, thank you for reaching out. I understand you’re interested in exploring visa options for your job offer. To start, could you please confirm if you have a valid sponsor who is willing to support your application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a valid sponsor. The pharmaceutical company that has offered me the Senior Lab Technician position has confirmed they will sponsor my visa application.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s excellent news to hear that you have a valid sponsor. Now, to help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me what subject your PhD is in?

[evaluation_judge]: My PhD is in Microbiology. I completed it in India before applying for this position.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Now, let’s talk about the job itself. Can you describe the primary responsibilities of the Senior Lab Technician role you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: As a Senior Lab Technician, I'll be responsible for conducting complex laboratory tests and experiments related to pharmaceutical research, managing lab equipment and inventory, analyzing samples, maintaining detailed records of procedures and results, ensuring compliance with safety protocols, and occasionally training junior technicians. I'll be working with the research team to support drug development projects, primarily focusing on microbial interactions with pharmaceutical compounds.

[root_agent]: That sounds like a very involved and important role. Now, regarding the salary, could you confirm the exact annual salary you’ve been offered for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £34,000 per year for the Senior Lab Technician position.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Let’s move on to the standard going rate for this type of role. Could you tell me what the standard going rate is for a Senior Lab Technician in this field in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand that the standard going rate for this Senior Lab Technician role in the pharmaceutical industry is £38,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Finally, to help me fully assess your eligibility, could you confirm whether you meet the English language requirements for a work visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I meet the English language requirements. I completed my university education with English as the primary language of instruction, and I've also taken the required English proficiency tests that meet the visa standards.

[root_agent]: Great! Thank you for confirming that. Let’s move on to the salary requirements. Does your annual salary of £34,000 meet the lower general threshold of £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my salary offer of £34,000 is above the lower general threshold of £33,400.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And to confirm, is your salary also at least 80% of the standard going rate, which is £30,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £34,000 is above 80% of the standard going rate. Since the standard going rate is £38,000, 80% would be £30,400, and my offer of £34,000 exceeds that amount.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Based on the information you’ve provided – a valid sponsor, a role at the required skill level, a relevant STEM PhD (Microbiology), a salary meeting both the lower general threshold and the discounted going rate – it appears you *are* eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. 

Would you like me to confirm this decision, or would you like me to outline the next steps in the application process?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please confirm the decision and perhaps outline the next steps in the application process. I'm very eager to proceed with this opportunity.

[root_agent]: Certainly! Based on the criteria, I’m pleased to confirm that **AWARDED.** Dr. Aari trades her STEM PhD to meet the lower salary requirements.

Here are the next steps in the Skilled Worker Visa application process:

1.  **Sponsor Certificate:** Your sponsor will need to obtain a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) from UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI). This confirms they are sponsoring you and provides details about your job.
2.  **Tier 2 General Charge Certificate:** Your sponsor will need to pay the Immigration Skills Charge.
3.  **Online Application:** You’ll complete an online visa application form on the UKVI website.
4.  **Supporting Documents:** You’ll need to gather and submit supporting documents, including your passport, degree certificate, proof of English language proficiency, and the CoS.
5.  **Biometrics Appointment:** You’ll need to attend a biometrics appointment to provide fingerprints and a photograph.
6.  **Visa Fee Payment:** You’ll pay the visa application fee.
7.  **Visa Decision:** UKVI will review your application and make a decision.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific step in the process, or perhaps provide some resources for finding further support?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa and provided the "AWARDED" outcome as expected, recognizing that my STEM PhD allows me to qualify with the lower salary requirements.
