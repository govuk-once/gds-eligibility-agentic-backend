[evaluation_judge]: I'll assume the role of Miguel, a registered nurse from the Philippines with a job offer at an NHS Trust, and interact with the agent to determine my visa eligibility.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Miguel! It’s lovely to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and whether you might be eligible for a Health and Care Visa, could you tell me what specific type of nursing you’re registered as?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello! Yes, I'm a registered nurse from the Philippines. I've just received a job offer to work as a Band 5 nurse at an NHS Trust here in the UK. They've offered me a salary of £28,407, which they said is the standard entry rate for Band 5 nurses.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Miguel. That’s really helpful. Just to clarify, you mentioned you've been offered a position as a Band 5 nurse. Could you tell me, what is the name of the NHS Trust you’ve been offered the role with?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position with University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust. They're quite excited for me to join their team, and I'm looking forward to working in the NHS.

[root_agent]: Okay, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust. Thank you. Now, to confirm, you’re a registered nurse specialising in general nursing, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm a registered nurse specializing in general nursing. I completed my nursing qualification in the Philippines and have been working as a nurse there for the past three years.

[root_agent]: Alright, Miguel. Just one more question regarding your role before we move on. Could you describe the type of care you’ll be providing as a Band 5 nurse at University Hospitals Birmingham?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working on one of the general medical wards, providing direct patient care. This includes administering medications, monitoring vital signs, assessing patients' conditions, developing and implementing care plans, and coordinating with the healthcare team. I'll be responsible for a caseload of patients during my shifts, providing comprehensive nursing care and support to patients with various medical conditions.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Miguel. That gives me a really clear picture of your role. Now, let’s move on to the specifics of your salary. Can you confirm the exact salary you’re being offered, including any potential benefits like overtime or shift pay?

[evaluation_judge]: The base salary I've been offered is £28,407, which is the standard entry-level rate for Band 5 nurses in the NHS. The position also includes the standard NHS benefits like pension contributions and sick pay. There's potential for overtime pay when I work additional shifts, and I'll receive enhanced rates for night shifts, weekends, and bank holidays according to the NHS Agenda for Change terms and conditions. But the basic annual salary is £28,407.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So, to be completely clear, your base annual salary is £28,407. Let’s move on to a key eligibility requirement. Do you agree that you are working for a public authority – in this case, the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust – in a Health or Education occupation, specifically as a nurse?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'll be working for University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, which is definitely a public authority as part of the NHS. And I'll be working as a registered nurse, which is a healthcare occupation.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for confirming that, Miguel. Now, let’s assess your salary against the NHS National Pay Scales. Considering you're a Band 5 nurse, can you tell me what the minimum and maximum salary for that band is?

[evaluation_judge]: Based on what my employer told me, the Band 5 nurse salary in the NHS currently ranges from approximately £28,407 at entry level to around £34,581 at the top of the band. The £28,407 they're offering me is the standard starting point for Band 5 nurses in the NHS.

[root_agent]: Okay, Miguel. Thank you for that information. So, your salary of £28,407 falls within the minimum range for a Band 5 nurse. Based on this information, I can confirm that you *are* eligible for the Health and Care Visa.

**AWARDED.** Jobs on National Pay Scales are exempt from the high general salary thresholds. As long as the salary matches the legal band for the role, it is approved.

Do you have any questions about this assessment or anything else related to the visa process?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for the Health and Care Visa. They understood that since I'll be working as a registered nurse for an NHS Trust at the standard Band 5 salary (£28,407), I qualify for the visa despite not meeting the general salary threshold of £41,700, as NHS jobs on National Pay Scales are exempt from this requirement.
