[evaluation_judge]: I understand I need to role-play as Amara, an architect from Nigeria seeking information about UK visa eligibility based on a part-time job offer. I'll start the conversation with the agent now.

Hello, I'm Amara from Nigeria. I'm an architect and I've received a job offer in the UK. The position would be part-time, 3 days a week (22.5 hours) because I also want to study privately. My hourly rate would be £30, which works out to £35,100 per year. I'm wondering if this would be enough for me to qualify for a Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: Okay, Amara. Thank you for telling me about your situation.

To start, could you please confirm what salary threshold you believe is relevant for your Skilled Worker visa application? Are you referring to the £41,700 threshold, or do you think there’s another figure that applies to your case?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe the £41,700 threshold would apply to my case. I've been told that's the general salary threshold for Skilled Worker visas. My hourly rate would be £30, which I've calculated would give me an annual salary of £35,100 based on working 22.5 hours per week. I'm wondering if this would be enough since my hourly rate is quite good, even though I'll be working part-time.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Amara. 

Just to be absolutely clear, you’re stating that your actual gross annual salary for this part-time role is £35,100, calculated from an hourly rate of £30 and 22.5 hours per week. 

Could you tell me, what is your nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My actual gross annual salary would be £35,100, based on the hourly rate of £30 and working 22.5 hours per week. I'm Nigerian.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Amara. 

Now, regarding your Skilled Worker visa eligibility, could you confirm whether you have a degree that is comparable to a UK qualification?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a degree in Architecture from Nigeria that is equivalent to a UK qualification. It's a five-year professional degree that allows me to practice as an architect.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that, Amara.

Let’s move on to a slightly different question. Could you please state your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 34 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Amara.

To help me assess your eligibility, could you confirm the date you received the job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: I received the job offer about two weeks ago, so around the middle of June 2023.

[root_agent]: Okay, Amara. And just to confirm, you’re applying for a Skilled Worker visa, correct?

One final question for now: Do you currently have any visa status that allows you to be in the UK, such as a student visa or another type of work permit?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm applying for a Skilled Worker visa. I don't currently have any visa status in the UK. I'm still in Nigeria and would be applying for the visa from here.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Amara.

Let’s assess your situation. Based on the information you’ve provided – your nationality (Nigeria), your age (34), your degree (equivalent to a UK qualification), your expected annual salary of £35,100, and the fact that you don't currently hold any UK visa status – I need to check if you meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker visa.

Considering the criteria, specifically the General Threshold of £41,700 (Option A), your current salary of £35,100 falls short.  As you’ve correctly stated, your hourly rate is relatively high, but it doesn't bridge the gap to meet the required threshold.

Therefore, I have to advise that, based on the information you’ve given me, you are currently **REFUSED** for a Skilled Worker visa under Option A (Standard). You would need to either increase your salary to at least £41,700, or work more hours, to meet the requirements.

Do you have any questions about this assessment, or would you like me to explain any aspect in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: So even though my hourly rate is good, I still need to meet the full £41,700 threshold? I thought maybe since I'm working part-time, they might pro-rate the threshold requirement. Are there any other options for me, or would I definitely need to increase either my hours or my salary to qualify?

[root_agent]: That’s a very reasonable question, Amara. You’re right to think about the possibility of a pro-rated threshold. However, as I explained before, the General Threshold (£41,700 or £33,400) is typically a hard floor and isn't pro-rated for standard Skilled Worker visas. 

There aren't other readily available options to significantly change your eligibility without altering your employment terms. The Skilled Worker visa route requires meeting the minimum salary threshold, and in your case, the current requirement of £41,700 is not met with your proposed part-time hours and salary.

To answer your question directly: you would definitely need to increase either your salary or your hours to qualify, or potentially explore different visa routes, though those would likely be more complex and require further investigation. 

Would you like me to briefly outline some alternative visa options, or perhaps discuss strategies for increasing your salary?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate it if you could briefly tell me about some alternative visa options. Also, if I were to increase my hours to work full-time at the same hourly rate, would that make me eligible? I'm trying to understand what my best options are.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s explore some alternative visa options and then assess the impact of working full-time.

**Alternative Visa Options (Briefly):**

*   **Global Talent Visa:** If your architecture work is innovative or demonstrates exceptional ability, you might qualify for this visa. It's focused on individuals in fields like tech, science, arts, and digital media. However, it's a competitive visa and requires endorsement from a recognized body.
*   **Graduate Visa:** If you’ve recently completed your degree, you might be eligible for a Graduate Visa, which allows you to stay in the UK for two years to look for work.
*   **Intra-Company Transfer Visa:** If your employer is a multinational company, you might be able to transfer your role to the UK under this visa. This depends on your employer's global mobility policy.

**Working Full-Time:**

Yes, working full-time at your current hourly rate of £30 would absolutely make you eligible for the Skilled Worker visa. Full-time hours equate to a gross annual salary of £60,000, which comfortably surpasses the £41,700 threshold.

**Recommendation:**

Given your situation, the most straightforward path to a Skilled Worker visa would be to either increase your salary substantially to £41,700 or, more realistically, to work full-time at your current hourly rate of £30. 

Would you like me to delve deeper into any of these alternative visa options, or would you like me to explore ways to potentially increase your salary within your current employment situation?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave incorrect information. The expected outcome is that Amara should be REFUSED for the Skilled Worker visa since her actual gross salary of £35,100 doesn't meet the General Threshold of £41,700, which cannot be pro-rated. While the agent correctly determined she was ineligible, they incorrectly stated the going rate can be pro-rated in their initial assessment, which is inconsistent with the criteria provided.
