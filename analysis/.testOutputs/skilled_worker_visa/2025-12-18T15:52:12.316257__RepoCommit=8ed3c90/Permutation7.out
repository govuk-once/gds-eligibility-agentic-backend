[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Kenji from Japan and evaluate the agent's performance on correctly identifying the visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Kenji and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Kenji, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what kind of job you have been offered in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, yes I've been offered a job as a Graphic Designer in the UK. I'm currently living in Japan but the company in the UK wants me to join their team. They are offering me a salary of £30,000 per year. I'm not sure if I can get a visa with this offer or what I need to do next.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Kenji. That's very helpful.

To assess your eligibility further, could you please confirm if the company offering you the role is a licensed sponsor with the UK government? You can usually check this with your employer, or I can provide information on how to find out if needed.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they told me they are a licensed sponsor with the UK government. They mentioned they've sponsored other employees from overseas before, so I think that part is okay. I'm just not sure if my salary offer is enough for the visa requirements.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news that the company is a licensed sponsor, Kenji. That's a very important step!

You are right to consider the salary requirements. To help me understand your situation better, could you please tell me what your highest qualification is? For example, do you have a Bachelor's degree, a Master's degree, or a PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from a university in Tokyo. I've been working as a graphic designer for about 5 years now.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Kenji. That’s good to know. 

Just to be clear, are you a new entrant to the job market, or do you have more than one year of experience in your field?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not a new entrant - as I mentioned, I've been working in this field for about 5 years since graduating from university. I've worked for two different design agencies in Japan during that time.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Kenji.

Based on the information you've provided – a job as a Graphic Designer with a salary of £30,000 per year, a Bachelor's degree, and 5 years of experience – I’m afraid you do not currently meet the salary requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa. 

The current minimum salary threshold for this visa is £33,400 per year, even for those with your experience level. Your offered salary is below this threshold.

I'm very sorry to deliver this news. Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or discuss other potential visa routes, though I must stress a Graphic Designer role is unlikely to qualify for alternatives?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So even though the company is a licensed sponsor, my salary offer isn't enough to qualify for the visa. Could you tell me how much more I would need to be offered to meet the requirements? Would £33,400 be enough, or is there another threshold I need to meet?

[root_agent]: You are correct, Kenji. Even with a licensed sponsor, the salary needs to meet specific thresholds.

£33,400 *would* be enough to meet the absolute minimum salary floor currently in place for the Skilled Worker visa, *provided* you don't meet the criteria for a higher threshold. There *is* a standard threshold of £41,700, but with your experience level, that doesn't apply in your case.

So, to be eligible, your salary offer would need to be at least £33,400 per year. Currently, £30,000 is below that minimum.



Do you want me to explain the salary thresholds in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so I'd need at least £33,400 to qualify. That's helpful to know. I'll need to discuss this with the company to see if they can increase their offer.

Can I also ask - I heard something about a "going rate" for different professions. Is there a specific going rate for graphic designers that I would need to meet as well?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Kenji. I'm glad that information is helpful. It's a good idea to discuss this with the company.

You are correct to ask about the "going rate"! There *is* a going rate for Graphic Designers, and your salary also needs to meet or exceed that. 

Currently, the going rate for a Graphic Designer is £29,000 per year. However, the visa requirements always default to the *higher* of the going rate *or* the general minimum salary threshold. In your case, the general minimum of £33,400 is higher than the going rate.

So, while your current offer is above the going rate, it still falls short of the minimum salary requirement for the visa.



Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes perfect sense, thank you. So my offer exceeds the going rate for my profession (£29,000), but I still need to meet the minimum salary threshold of £33,400 regardless. I'll definitely need to talk to the company about increasing the offer to at least £33,400 if I want to qualify for the Skilled Worker visa.

Is there anything else I should know about the visa requirements that might be relevant to my situation?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood perfectly, Kenji! You’ve grasped the key points regarding the salary requirements.

Regarding other relevant points, it's worth noting that while we’ve discussed salary, the Skilled Worker visa also requires:

*   **A valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS)** – which your company providing sponsorship already confirms.
*   **English Language Proficiency** – you’ll need to demonstrate you meet the required level.
*   **Suitability requirements** – relating to your background and character. 

However, based on our conversation so far, the salary is the primary obstacle to your eligibility at this time.

Given you have a Bachelor's degree, and more than one year of experience, there aren't any specific exemptions or lower thresholds that would apply to your situation regarding the salary.

Would you like me to provide links to the official government website with more details on these other requirements, for your information? (I will not provide them unless you ask, as per the rules).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think the primary issue is definitely the salary. I can meet the English language requirements and I don't have any background concerns, so those shouldn't be problems. Having the links to the official government website would be helpful so I can review all the requirements in detail.

While we're talking about this, if the company does increase their offer to £33,400, would there be any additional steps I need to take before applying for the visa?

[root_agent]: Okay, excellent. I will provide those links at the very end of our conversation, as per the instructions I've been given.

Regarding additional steps if the company increases your offer to £33,400:

Yes, there would be a few. Assuming the salary is increased to at least £33,400, here's what would generally happen:

1.  **Updated Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):** Your employer would need to update your CoS to reflect the new salary. This is crucial for your visa application.
2.  **Visa Application:** You would then be able to proceed with your Skilled Worker visa application online. This involves completing an application form, providing supporting documents (including the CoS, proof of qualifications, proof of English language ability, and proof of funds), and paying the visa fee and Immigration Health Surcharge.
3.  **Biometrics Appointment:** You’ll need to attend an appointment to provide your fingerprints and photograph.
4.  **Visa Decision:** The Home Office will then assess your application and make a decision.

Essentially, the updated CoS is the key trigger that allows you to proceed with the full visa application process.



Do you have any questions about any of these steps?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that covers everything I was wondering about. I understand I'll need an updated CoS with the higher salary, then I can proceed with the application, biometrics, and wait for the decision. I'll talk to the company about increasing the salary to at least £33,400 so I can qualify.

Thank you for all your help explaining the visa requirements and next steps. This has been really informative.

[root_agent]: You are very welcome, Kenji! I'm delighted I could help clarify the requirements and next steps for you. 

I wish you the best of luck in your discussions with the company, and with your visa application should you decide to proceed. 

As promised, here are the links to the official UK government website pages regarding the Skilled Worker visa:

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future.



Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would not qualify for a Skilled Worker visa with my current £30,000 salary offer because it falls below the absolute minimum threshold of £33,400, even though it exceeds the going rate for graphic designers (£29,000). The agent accurately explained the requirements and gave the correct outcome.
