[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Priya and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Priya, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me if you currently hold a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been living in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022. I'm looking to change jobs and want to understand if I'm eligible to stay on this visa route.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear, Priya. Since you've been on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022, and are now looking to change jobs, could you tell me – is your current visa still valid, or has it expired?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my current visa is still valid. I'm just exploring an offer from a different company and want to understand if I can change employers while staying on the Skilled Worker route.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. To clarify, are you planning to apply to *extend* your current visa, or switch to a new Skilled Worker visa with the new employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be switching to a new Skilled Worker visa with the new employer. I've received a job offer from a marketing agency for a Marketing Manager position.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And could you tell me what the salary is for the Marketing Manager position with the new agency?

[evaluation_judge]: The new job has offered me a salary of £32,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Priya. To assess your eligibility further, do you know what the 'going rate' for a Marketing Manager is, according to the Home Office's list of eligible occupations? Don't worry if you don't know offhand, just let me know and I can try to help you find that information.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure what the official 'going rate' is according to the Home Office. I've heard there's been some changes to the salary thresholds recently, but I don't know the specific details for Marketing Manager positions.

[root_agent]: You are right to mention the recent changes, Priya. There are different salary thresholds that might apply to you. For a Marketing Manager role, the standard going rate is currently £42,000 per year, but there's also a lower going rate of £30,000.

Given you’ve been on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022, it's possible you might be eligible for transitional arrangements. To confirm, were you first granted a Skilled Worker visa *before* April 4th, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I was first granted my Skilled Worker visa in 2022, well before April 4th, 2024.

[root_agent]: Great, that confirms you may be eligible for transitional arrangements. This means the salary requirements for your visa switch might be different than the standard rates.

Just to be certain, is this a continuous period of time you have been on the Skilled Worker visa route since 2022 – meaning you haven’t had any breaks in your visa status?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been continuously on the Skilled Worker visa route since 2022 without any breaks in my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Priya. Considering you've been continuously on the Skilled Worker route since before April 4th, 2024, and your new salary is £32,000, it looks like you *do* meet the requirements for the transitional arrangements. 

Specifically, the general threshold would be £29,000, and the relevant going rate would be £30,000. Your offered salary of £32,000 meets both of those thresholds.

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you **are eligible** to switch to a new Skilled Worker visa with the new employer.





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm eligible for the Skilled Worker visa under the transitional arrangements, accurately noting my £32,000 salary exceeds both the transitional general threshold (£29,000) and transitional going rate (£30,000) because I've been on the route continuously since 2022.
