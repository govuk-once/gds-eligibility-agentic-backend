[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Diego and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Diego, I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you tell me, is the reason for your leave related to statutory sick leave or statutory maternity leave?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sick or on maternity leave. I'm looking to take a sabbatical to travel around South America for a couple months. My company has agreed to hold my job for me, but it would be unpaid. I just want to check if this affects my sponsorship visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Diego. 

To understand how this might affect your visa, could you tell me approximately how long, in weeks, would this sabbatical be?

[evaluation_judge]: It would be about 2 months, so around 8 weeks of unpaid leave.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Diego. Just to confirm, your company is agreeing to hold your job, but the leave would be completely unpaid for those 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. They're happy to hold my position for me, but it would be completely unpaid leave for the full 8 weeks.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

Based on the information you've provided, and the rules regarding the Skilled Worker Visa, it appears your sponsorship may be at risk. The rules state that sponsorship can be withdrawn if a worker is absent from work without pay for more than 4 weeks in a calendar year, unless the leave is statutory sick or maternity leave. 

Your proposed leave is 8 weeks, which exceeds that 4-week limit. Do you understand?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. So if I take an 8-week unpaid sabbatical, my sponsorship will be withdrawn? What would happen to my visa status in that case?

[root_agent]: You are correct, Diego. Based on the information available, taking an 8-week unpaid sabbatical would likely lead to your sponsorship being withdrawn.

In that situation, your visa would be curtailed - meaning it would be shortened to 60 days. You would then have 60 days to either leave the UK, or find a new employer willing to sponsor you for a Skilled Worker Visa.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding this?

[evaluation_judge]: That's actually very helpful to know. So even though my employer is willing to hold my job, I'd still lose my sponsorship because of the unpaid leave limit. Is there any way around this? Could I potentially take 4 weeks unpaid and use annual leave for the rest, or would I need to reconsider the length of my trip?

[root_agent]: You've hit on a key point, Diego – even with your employer holding your position, the unpaid leave limit still applies.

And you're absolutely right to think about alternatives! Taking 4 weeks of unpaid leave *and* using your annual leave for the remaining 4 weeks could potentially avoid sponsorship withdrawal. Using annual leave doesn't count towards the 4-week limit for unpaid absence.

However, it’s crucial to confirm with your employer that this arrangement is possible and documented correctly. They would need to accurately record the leave as annual leave, not unpaid leave, for the latter portion of your trip.

Ultimately, you may need to reconsider the length of your trip to ensure your unpaid leave doesn’t exceed 4 weeks, or explore the possibility of utilizing your full annual leave entitlement. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. I think I'll discuss with my employer about using a combination of annual leave and unpaid leave to stay within the 4-week unpaid leave limit. Thank you for explaining the rules about sponsorship withdrawal - you've helped me understand how this could affect my visa status. I appreciate the clarity on this matter.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Diego! I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you. It's good you're planning to discuss options with your employer – proactive communication is key. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best with your travel plans!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my sponsorship would be withdrawn if I took 8 weeks of unpaid leave, as it exceeds the 4-week limit for unpaid absences. They accurately explained that my visa would be curtailed to 60 days, requiring me to leave the UK or find a new sponsor. The information provided matches the expected outcome of sponsorship withdrawal.
