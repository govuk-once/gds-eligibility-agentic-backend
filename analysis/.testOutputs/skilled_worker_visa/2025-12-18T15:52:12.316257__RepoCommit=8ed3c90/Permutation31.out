[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Elena, an American tourist in London who wants to switch from a visitor visa to a Skilled Worker visa after receiving a job offer.

Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Elena, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me what type of visa you are currently in the UK with?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! Thanks for helping me out. I'm currently in the UK on a Standard Visitor visa. I'm an American citizen and I came over to visit some friends in London for a few weeks.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Elena. That's helpful.

Now, have you already accepted a job offer in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have! I actually attended a job interview while I was here visiting my friends, and I just received an amazing job offer as a Graphic Designer at a design agency in London. They're really keen to have me start soon, and I'm wondering if I can just apply for a Skilled Worker visa while I'm still here in London instead of having to fly back to the US first.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic news about the job offer, Elena! Congratulations!

Just to confirm, are you planning to apply for the Skilled Worker visa *while remaining in the UK*, or were you considering returning to the US to apply?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you! I'm really excited about the job opportunity. Yes, I was hoping to apply for the Skilled Worker visa while remaining here in the UK. I'm staying at an Airbnb in London right now, and I'd prefer not to have to book a flight back to the US if I can avoid it. Ideally, I'd just apply from here and start my new job soon. Is that possible?

[root_agent]: I understand you'd prefer to stay in the UK and apply, Elena. 

To clarify, do you know if the job you've been offered meets the requirements for the Skilled Worker visa, such as the skill level and salary threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, from what the company has told me, the job definitely meets all the requirements. It's a full-time Graphic Designer position, which is on the skilled occupation list, and the salary they've offered is well above the minimum threshold for this role - it's around £35,000 annually. The company is also an approved sponsor and they're ready to sponsor my visa. They're just waiting for me to confirm I can proceed with the application process.

[root_agent]: That all sounds very positive regarding the job itself, Elena. Thank you for confirming those details.

To be certain about your eligibility to *apply from within the UK*, could you please confirm again which type of visa you initially entered the UK with? Just want to double-check.

[evaluation_judge]: I entered the UK with a Standard Visitor visa. It's the regular tourist visa that Americans get when visiting the UK for a short stay. I initially came just to visit friends for a few weeks, and that's when this job opportunity came up unexpectedly.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Elena.

Unfortunately, because you are currently in the UK on a Standard Visitor visa, you are generally not eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa from within the UK. Immigration rules state that you would typically need to leave the UK and apply for "Entry Clearance" from your home country – in your case, the United States.





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I cannot switch from a Standard Visitor visa to a Skilled Worker visa from within the UK, which matches the expected outcome. They accurately stated that I would need to return to the USA to file my application as per immigration rules.
