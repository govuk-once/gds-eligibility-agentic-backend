[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Katarina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Katarina, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for certain benefits.

To start, could you tell me what type of job you have been offered?





[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a waitress at a high-end event venue. They're offering me £20 per hour on a zero-hours contract. My employer wrote me a letter saying they expect me to work about 40 hours a week, which would total around £41,600 a year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Katarina. That's helpful.

To clarify, is the number of hours you work each week *guaranteed* by your employer, or could it vary?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the hours aren't guaranteed. It's a zero-hours contract, so technically they don't have to give me any hours at all each week. They said they "expect" me to work 40 hours weekly, but nothing is actually guaranteed in writing.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Katarina. 

To confirm, even though your employer *expects* you to work 40 hours a week, your contract doesn't *guarantee* a minimum number of hours each week or year?





[evaluation_judge]: That's right. My contract doesn't guarantee any minimum number of hours. That's what makes it a zero-hours contract - they can call me in when they need me, but there's no guarantee of how much work I'll get each week. They've said they expect it to be around 40 hours, but there's nothing binding about that.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Katarina.

Based on the information you've provided, and considering the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa, it seems your contract may not meet the necessary criteria. The visa requires a guaranteed minimum salary, and a zero-hours contract doesn't provide that guarantee.

Do you understand what I mean? Would you like me to explain further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please explain more about why my situation doesn't meet the requirements? I thought with the hourly rate being quite good at £20 per hour, and the employer saying I'd likely earn £41,600 a year, that would be enough.

[root_agent]: You're right to think that the hourly rate and potential earnings seem good, Katarina. However, the Skilled Worker Visa has specific rules about how salary is calculated and *guaranteed*.

The Home Office requires a *guaranteed* salary, meaning a set amount of pay the employer is legally obligated to provide each year. Even though your employer *expects* you to earn £41,600 based on 40 hours a week, a zero-hours contract doesn't legally *guarantee* that amount. They could reduce your hours, and therefore your income, without breaching the contract.

Because the salary isn't guaranteed, it doesn't meet the minimum threshold required for the visa, even though the hourly rate itself is above the minimum. It's the guarantee that is key.



Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. So even though the hourly rate is good and they've said they expect me to work full-time hours, because the zero-hours contract doesn't actually guarantee any minimum hours or salary, I don't meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa. I understand why that would be a problem - the Home Office wants certainty that I'll earn enough, not just a possibility. Thank you for explaining.

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Katarina. You're absolutely right - the Home Office needs certainty, and a zero-hours contract doesn't provide that. 

I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. Unfortunately, based on the information you've provided, it appears you would be **REFUSED** a Skilled Worker Visa with this contract.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all I needed to know. It's disappointing, but at least I understand why now. Thanks for your help.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be refused a Skilled Worker Visa because my zero-hours contract doesn't guarantee a minimum salary, even though the hourly rate is good and the employer expects me to work full-time hours.
