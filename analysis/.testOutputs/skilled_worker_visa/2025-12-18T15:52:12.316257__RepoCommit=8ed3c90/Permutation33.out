[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Wei, it's good to speak with you! I can certainly help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, have you previously held any UK visas that allowed you to work?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been working in the UK for the last 3 years on a Global Business Mobility: Graduate Trainee visa. It's coming to an end soon, and I've got a job offer as a Senior Analyst that I'm hoping to take.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. That's helpful.

Just to confirm, is that 3-year period of working in the UK continuous, without any breaks in your visa status?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's been continuous. I came to the UK on the Global Business Mobility visa 3 years ago and I've been working here the whole time without any breaks.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. And could you please confirm your date of birth, or at least confirm whether you are currently under 26 years of age? This is just to understand if the 'New Entrant' discount might apply to your case.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm 25 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming.

You mentioned you have a job offer as a Senior Analyst. Could you please tell me what your annual salary will be in this role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £34,000 per year. The company told me they're offering this based on me qualifying for the New Entrant discount since I'm under 26.

[root_agent]: Thanks for that information. 

Just so I fully understand, are you aware that time spent on a Global Business Mobility visa counts towards the maximum time allowed under the 'New Entrant' rules?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that. I thought being under 26 was the main factor for the New Entrant status. How does that affect my situation?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask! Being under 26 *is* a factor, but it's not the only one. Time spent on a Global Business Mobility visa, as well as previous Tier 2 or Skilled Worker visas, counts towards a 4-year maximum limit for 'New Entrant' applicants.

Since you've already spent 3 years in the UK on the Global Business Mobility visa, you unfortunately have only 1 year remaining of eligibility as a 'New Entrant'. This means you wouldn’t qualify for the full 3 or 5-year visa length with the discounted salary requirements your employer is anticipating.

Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think I understand. So even though I'm under 26, the 3 years I've spent on the Global Business Mobility visa counts against the 4-year "New Entrant" limit. So I would only have 1 year left at the discounted rate. 

Does that mean my application would be refused with this salary? Or could I still get a 1-year visa instead?

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly.

With a salary of £34,000, you *are* relying on the New Entrant discount to meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa. Because you only have 1 year remaining under the New Entrant rules, a 3 or 5-year visa would be refused.

However, you *could* be granted a 1-year visa at that salary. It wouldn't be the longer-term visa you were hoping for, but it's a possibility.

To be clear, the application would likely be refused if submitted requesting a standard 3 or 5-year visa based on the New Entrant discount, given your visa history.



Would you like me to explain anything further about this, or perhaps discuss options with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really helpful information. So if I understand correctly, I have two options: either apply for just a 1-year visa at my current offered salary, or I would need a higher salary that meets the standard Skilled Worker requirements without the New Entrant discount if I want a longer visa. Is that right?

[root_agent]: You've got it exactly right! Those are the two main options. 

To recap:

*   **Option 1: 1-Year Visa:** Accept the visa for 1 year at the current salary of £34,000, utilizing your remaining 'New Entrant' allowance.

*   **Option 2: Longer Visa:** Negotiate a salary that meets the standard Skilled Worker visa salary requirements (without relying on the 'New Entrant' discount) to qualify for a 3 or 5-year visa.



Is there anything else I can help clarify for you at this point? Perhaps you'd like to know how to find the standard salary requirements for your specific job role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would like to know what the standard Skilled Worker salary requirements would be for a Senior Analyst position without the New Entrant discount. That would help me understand how much more I would need to negotiate if I want the longer visa.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker visa has a general salary threshold, and then a specific rate for eligible occupations - which a Senior Analyst role usually falls under.

As of April 4th, 2024, the general threshold is £38,700 per year. However, a Senior Analyst role (SOC code 2424) is on the eligible occupations list, meaning the salary requirement is the *higher* of either £38,700 OR the 'going rate' for the job.

The 'going rate' is determined by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and changes regularly. Currently, the going rate for a Senior Analyst is £43,200 per year.

Therefore, to qualify for a 3 or 5-year Skilled Worker visa *without* relying on the New Entrant discount, your salary would need to be at least **£43,200** per year.



Does that help give you a clearer picture?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's very clear now. So I'd need to negotiate to at least £43,200 per year to qualify for the standard 3 or 5-year visa. That's quite a jump from the £34,000 I've been offered.

This is really helpful information. I'll need to speak with my potential employer about these options - either accepting just a 1-year visa at the current salary or trying to negotiate for the higher salary to get a longer-term visa.

Thank you for explaining all this to me. It's complicated but I understand my situation much better now.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Wei! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It *is* a complicated system, so it's understandable to feel a little overwhelmed.

You've summarized your options perfectly. It's good you're planning to discuss this with your employer - they may be willing to negotiate, or at least understand your position.

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help.

Best of luck with your negotiations and your visa application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be refused for a standard 3 or 5-year visa at £34,000 because my 3 years on a Global Business Mobility visa counts toward my 4-year New Entrant limit. The agent accurately explained that I only have 1 year of New Entrant status remaining and provided correct information about my options.
