[evaluation_judge]: I'll now role-play as Lucas, a software engineer at a cash-poor startup, seeking information about my eligibility for a particular benefit.

Hi, i'm Lucas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Lucas, thanks for reaching out. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you tell me what your proposed job role is?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! I've recently been offered a Senior Developer role at a startup. They're a bit cash-poor at the moment, but they're offering me stock options as part of the package. I'm trying to figure out if I'm eligible for a skilled worker visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: Thanks for that information, Lucas. That's helpful to know.

Could you tell me what your annual cash salary would be with this Senior Developer role? (Please state the amount *before* any deductions like tax).

[evaluation_judge]: The annual cash salary they're offering me is £30,000 before tax. It's lower than market rate, but they're supplementing it with stock options.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lucas. And roughly, what is the annual value of the stock options being offered to you? (An estimated value is fine).

[evaluation_judge]: The stock options they're offering me are valued at about £50,000 per year on a vesting schedule. So they're saying my total compensation package is worth around £80,000 annually, but the cash component is just the £30,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that, Lucas. 

Just to be clear, are you understanding correctly that for the Skilled Worker visa, only your guaranteed salary is considered, and not the potential future value of stock options?

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't entirely sure about that, to be honest. I was hoping the total compensation package would count. Are you saying that the stock options won't be considered as part of my salary for the visa application?

[root_agent]: You are correct to ask, Lucas. Yes, that's exactly right. The Home Office only considers your *guaranteed* salary when assessing eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa. Unearned income, like stock options that haven’t vested and may fluctuate in value, are not counted towards the salary requirement.

Do you know if your role meets the minimum salary threshold of £33,400, or the general threshold of £41,700? (We've already discussed your cash salary is £30,000).

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. My cash salary is £30,000, which is below both those thresholds you mentioned - the £33,400 minimum and the £41,700 general threshold. I guess that's not good news for my visa application then?

[root_agent]: Unfortunately, you are correct, Lucas. Based on the information you've provided, it does appear you do not meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa at this time. Your guaranteed cash salary of £30,000 is below both the minimum and general thresholds.

I understand this isn’t the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to quickly summarise the reasons why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please do summarize the reasons why I don't qualify. I want to make sure I understand correctly before I go back to discuss options with the company.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Lucas. Here’s a summary:

The Skilled Worker visa requires a minimum guaranteed salary. While your total compensation package, including stock options, is valued at £80,000, the Home Office *only* considers your guaranteed cash salary for eligibility. Your guaranteed salary is £30,000. This is below both the minimum salary threshold of £33,400 and the general threshold of £41,700. Therefore, based on the information provided, you do not currently meet the financial requirements for the visa.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that makes it quite clear, thank you. It sounds like I'd need to negotiate a higher base salary with the company if I want to qualify for the visa, with at least £33,400 as the minimum, but ideally above £41,700. I appreciate your help in explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Lucas! You've understood perfectly. Negotiating a higher base salary to meet at least the £33,400 threshold – and ideally above £41,700 – would be the necessary step for visa eligibility. 

I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Good luck with your negotiations!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the information and the good wishes!

✓ The agent correctly explained that I don't qualify for the Skilled Worker visa because my cash salary (£30,000) is below both the minimum threshold (£33,400) and the standard threshold (£41,700), and accurately explained that stock options are not considered as guaranteed salary by the Home Office.
