[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ahmed and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ahmed, nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you tell me what your job title is?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Head Chef. I've received a job offer and I'm trying to figure out if I'd be eligible for a visa.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Ahmed! A Head Chef is a skilled profession. 

Could you tell me how many hours per week your job contract is for?

[evaluation_judge]: My contract is for 60 hours per week.

[root_agent]: Okay, 60 hours per week. And could you please tell me your hourly rate of pay?

[evaluation_judge]: My hourly rate is £13.50 per hour.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ahmed. Just to confirm, is that £13.50 per hour for all 60 hours you work each week?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'd be paid £13.50 per hour for all 60 hours each week.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

Are you aware that when assessing your eligibility, the Home Office calculates salary based on the first 48 hours worked in a week, rather than the full 60?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that. So they only count the first 48 hours of work when calculating my salary for visa purposes? That changes things, doesn't it?

[root_agent]: Yes, you are right to say it changes things. It's an important detail. 

To clarify, based on 48 hours a week at £13.50 per hour, your annual salary for assessment purposes would be £33,696. 

Do you know what the current minimum salary threshold is for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard threshold is around £41,700, but I'm not completely sure. Is my calculated salary sufficient?

[root_agent]: You are right to check, Ahmed – the current standard threshold is £41,700.

Unfortunately, £33,696 is below that threshold. Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, your application would likely be **REFUSED**.

The sponsor (your employer) would need to either increase your hourly rate, or ensure your assessable salary meets the £41,700 threshold when calculated over 48 hours a week.

Would you like me to explain any of this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you explain what my hourly rate would need to be to meet the threshold? And is there any other way I could qualify for the visa with my current offer?

[root_agent]: Certainly. Let's calculate the hourly rate needed.

To meet the £41,700 threshold based on 48 hours per week, we need to calculate the required hourly rate:

£41,700 / (48 hours * 52 weeks) = approximately £16.61 per hour.

So, your hourly rate would need to be at least £16.61 to meet the salary threshold.

Regarding other ways to qualify with your current offer, unfortunately, given the rules for the Skilled Worker Visa, salary is the primary factor. There aren't typically alternative routes to qualify *without* meeting the financial requirement. However, it’s worth noting that certain health and education roles may have different salary thresholds, or be eligible for a “going rate” which is lower than the standard threshold. But as a chef, those exemptions would not apply.

Are you aware if your role falls under any specific occupation codes that might allow for a lower going rate? (Though, as a Head Chef, it is unlikely).

[evaluation_judge]: I don't believe my role falls under any specific occupation codes with a lower going rate. So it seems like I either need to negotiate a higher hourly rate with my employer or look for a different opportunity. Thank you for explaining this clearly. It's disappointing, but better to know now rather than after applying.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ahmed. I'm glad I could help clarify things for you, even if it wasn't the news you were hoping for. You are absolutely right - it's much better to be aware of the situation now.

Negotiating a higher rate or seeking a different opportunity are indeed the best courses of action. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today, perhaps regarding understanding the Skilled Worker Visa requirements further?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I have all the information I need for now. I'll speak with the employer to see if they can increase my hourly rate to meet the threshold. Thank you for your help!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ahmed! I wish you the best of luck in your discussion with your employer. I'm here if you have any further questions in the future. 

Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that my application would be refused because the Home Office only counts the first 48 hours of work when calculating the salary threshold. They accurately calculated my assessable salary (£33,696) and confirmed it falls below the required £41,700 threshold, matching the expected outcome in the scenario.
