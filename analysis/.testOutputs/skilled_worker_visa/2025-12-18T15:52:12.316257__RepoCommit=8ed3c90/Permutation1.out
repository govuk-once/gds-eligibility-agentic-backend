[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Elena, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please confirm your age?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm 35 years old. I'm looking to understand if I qualify for a skilled worker visa in the UK. I've received a job offer in London.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming your age. That’s helpful.

Now, could you please tell me, does the company offering you the job have a valid sponsor license? This means they are approved by the UK government to sponsor workers.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company is a licensed sponsor. It's a fintech firm in London and they've confirmed they have a valid sponsor license to hire international workers.

[root_agent]: Excellent, that's good to know. 

Next, what is the skill level of the job you've been offered? Specifically, does it meet the requirements of RQF Level 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8? (This relates to the level of qualification generally needed to do the job).

[evaluation_judge]: The job is a Senior Engineering Manager position, which I believe is at RQF Level 6. I have 10 years of experience in software engineering and management roles.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Level 6 is great.

Now, have you taken an English language test that is approved by UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI), and do you meet the required standard for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have passed the Secure English Language Test (SELT) with distinction, so I meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic news! Meeting the English language requirements is essential.

Could you please tell me your annual salary for this job offer? (i.e., how much you will be earning per year before tax).

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £85,000 per year for this Senior Engineering Manager position.

[root_agent]: That's a very good salary.

Do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Senior Engineering Manager role, as determined by the UK government? This is the minimum salary that the role generally attracts.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand that the standard going rate for this role is £75,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, excellent. Just to summarise, your offered salary of £85,000 meets both the general threshold of £41,700 *and* exceeds the going rate for your occupation of £75,000.

Based on the information you've provided, you **would be awarded** the Skilled Worker visa. You meet the standard criteria without needing to use the tradeable points system.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming my eligibility! That's really reassuring to know that I meet all the requirements for the Skilled Worker visa. I don't have any other questions at the moment - this is exactly what I needed to understand. I appreciate your help!

✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be awarded the Skilled Worker visa, matching the expected outcome that I meet all standard criteria without needing to trade points.
