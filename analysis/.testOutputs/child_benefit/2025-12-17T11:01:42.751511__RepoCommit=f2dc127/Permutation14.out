[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Sophie, a single mother whose child is temporarily living with his grandmother due to Sophie's surgery recovery.

Hi, i'm Sophie and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit. My son Noah is 6 years old, but he's currently staying with my mother (his grandmother) because I'm recovering from surgery. This arrangement has been going on for about 6 weeks now, and I'm wondering if I'm still eligible for Child Benefit during this time.

[root_agent]: Okay, Sophie, thank you for explaining your situation. It’s good you’re being proactive about this.

To start, I need to understand a little more about where Noah is currently living.

Could you tell me, does the child live with the applicant?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, at the moment Noah isn't actually living with me. He's been staying with my mother - his grandmother - for about 6 weeks now. I had surgery and need time to recover, so she's been taking care of him during this period. It's just a temporary arrangement until I'm well enough to have him back home with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Sophie. That’s really helpful.

Now, I need to ask you about the length of time Noah has been living with your mother. Has the child been living elsewhere for more than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it hasn't been more than 8 weeks. Noah has been staying with my mother for about 6 weeks so far. It's just a temporary arrangement while I recover from my surgery. We're planning for him to come back home to me once I'm well enough to take care of him properly.

[root_agent]: Okay, Sophie, that’s good to know. It sounds like this is a temporary situation, and Noah hasn't been living elsewhere for longer than 8 weeks.

Based on what you’ve told me, you *usually* continue to get Child Benefit for 8 weeks after your child goes to live with someone else, provided no one else claims it.

Do you know if anyone else is claiming Child Benefit for Noah while he’s living with your mother?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my mother isn't claiming Child Benefit for Noah. We both understood this was just a temporary arrangement while I recover from surgery, so she hasn't made any claim for benefits. I'm the only one who has been receiving Child Benefit for him.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sophie. That’s very clear.

So, to summarise: Noah is currently living with your mother, it hasn’t been longer than 8 weeks, and your mother isn’t claiming Child Benefit for him.

Based on this, I believe you are likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit. 

Do you have any other information about your circumstances that you’d like to share, or would you like me to confirm this eligibility further?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that covers everything. Noah is only staying with my mother temporarily while I recover from surgery, it's been about 6 weeks so far, and she hasn't claimed any benefits for him. I just wanted to make sure I'm still eligible to receive the Child Benefit during this time. It sounds like I am eligible to continue receiving it, which is a relief. Thank you for confirming that for me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Sophie! I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. It’s completely understandable to want to be sure about your eligibility, especially during a challenging time.

I’m pleased to confirm that, based on the information you’ve provided, you are likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. I was just worried about my benefits while Noah is temporarily staying with my grandmother. Thank you for your help today.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit because my child has been living elsewhere for less than 8 weeks and no one else has claimed the benefit.
