[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Hannah and engage with the agent about child benefit eligibility for my son who is receiving treatment abroad.

Hi, i'm Hannah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Hannah, it's lovely to speak with you. I’m here to help you with that. To start, could you tell me how many children you have in total?

[evaluation_judge]: I have one son, Oliver. He's 14 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, Oliver is 14 years old, is that correct?  To help me understand your situation fully, could you tell me if Oliver is currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, Oliver isn't living with me right now. He has a rare medical condition and has been sent to a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I'm still here in the UK, but I pay for his incidental costs and visit him when I can.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Hannah. That’s very helpful.  Considering Oliver is receiving treatment abroad, let’s focus on that specifically. Has the child been in hospital for more than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's been in the hospital in the USA for 15 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Now, to clarify further – did the child go abroad specifically for hospital treatment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. Oliver went to the USA specifically for this specialized hospital treatment for his rare condition. He wouldn't be there otherwise.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Hannah. I appreciate you confirming that.  The government’s rules state that if a child is in hospital abroad, and they only went abroad to be in hospital, eligibility for Child Benefit continues (provided the parent is still spending money on them).  

Based on what you’ve told me, it does seem like you might be eligible for Child Benefit.  Is there anything else about your circumstances that you think might be relevant to this assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't think so. I'm still covering his expenses while he's there, and this is just a temporary situation for his medical treatment. I'm still based here in the UK, and I'm his main caretaker. Is there anything else you need to know?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Hannah. Just to be absolutely sure, could you tell me approximately how much money you typically spend on Oliver each month whilst he’s receiving treatment in the USA?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd say I spend around £400-500 a month on Oliver's additional expenses. This includes things like personal items, clothes, some comfort items like books or games, and phone calls. That's on top of my travel costs when I visit, which can vary depending on flight prices. The hospital treatment itself is covered by a special NHS arrangement.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very useful information, Hannah. Thank you for providing those figures. Based on the information you’ve given me – that Oliver is receiving hospital treatment abroad, specifically for that purpose, and that you are spending a significant amount of money on him – it appears you are likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

Do you have any questions for me about the process of applying, or anything else I can clarify for you?

[evaluation_judge]: That's good to hear. I was worried that because he's been gone for more than 12 weeks, I might not be eligible anymore. So I just need to continue with my current Child Benefit claim? I don't need to do anything special to maintain it while he's abroad for treatment?

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible question, Hannah. Yes, generally speaking, you should continue with your current Child Benefit claim. The rules allow for continued eligibility when a child is receiving hospital treatment abroad, as long as you’re meeting the other criteria for eligibility – primarily, that you’re a UK resident and you’re still meeting the income thresholds. 

It’s always a good idea to double-check your circumstances on the government website, but it doesn’t appear there’s a specific process to actively maintain your claim while he’s abroad.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your Child Benefit claim, or anything else at all today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that answers my question. Thank you for your help. It's reassuring to know I can continue to receive the benefit while Oliver is getting his treatment abroad.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Hannah! I’m so glad I could help reassure you. It sounds like a challenging time, but it’s positive to know you can continue to receive Child Benefit support. If anything changes or you have any other questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a lovely day!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, you too!

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit even though my child has been in hospital abroad for more than 12 weeks. They correctly applied the rule that when a child goes abroad specifically for hospital treatment and the parent continues to spend money on them, eligibility continues.
