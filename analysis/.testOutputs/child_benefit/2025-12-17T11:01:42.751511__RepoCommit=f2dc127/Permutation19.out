[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Emma and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello there! I’d be happy to help you figure out if you’re eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you tell me how old is Holly?

[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Holly is 9 years old. I'm separated from my ex-partner, and we're trying to figure out who should be claiming Child Benefit for her.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Holly is 9 years old. 

Just to clarify, are two people responsible for caring for Holly?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Both myself and my ex-partner Pete share responsibility for Holly. I have her for 4 days a week, and Pete has her for 3 days a week. We both buy her clothes and food, and we both take care of her needs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like you and Pete share a lot of responsibility for Holly.

Let’s move on to the next question. Could you tell me, where does Holly primarily live? Does she spend most of her time with either you or your ex-partner?

[evaluation_judge]: Holly spends 4 days a week with me and 3 days a week with Pete. So she does spend slightly more time with me, but we both provide care for her.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s really helpful to know. So Holly spends slightly more time with you – 4 days versus Pete’s 3.

Just to double-check, are you the person who currently pays Holly’s childcare costs, such as for school or clubs?

[evaluation_judge]: We actually both contribute to Holly's expenses. I pay for some of her school clubs, and Pete pays for others. We both buy her clothes and food during the time she's with each of us. We're really trying to share the responsibility as fairly as possible, which is why we're both wondering about the Child Benefit claim.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. It sounds like you’re both actively involved in Holly’s life and expenses. 

Let’s move onto a slightly different question. Could you tell me, does Holly live with either you or Pete most of the time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, as I mentioned, Holly lives with me for 4 days of the week and with Pete for 3 days of the week. So technically she spends more time at my home, but only by one day.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very useful information. So, Holly spends a little more time with you than with Pete.

Considering the information we’ve discussed – that two people share responsibility for her, she spends slightly more time with you, and you’re the one who currently pays for some of her childcare – according to the guidelines, HMRC would generally award Child Benefit to the person who has the child living with them the most often.

Therefore, based on the rules, it appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that sounds right based on what you're saying. So even though Pete and I both care for Holly and contribute to her expenses, because she stays with me 4 days versus his 3 days, I would be the one eligible to receive the Child Benefit. I wasn't sure if that one day difference would matter, but it sounds like it does when HMRC makes their decision.

[root_agent]: That’s perfectly understandable. It’s good to clarify how those rules apply in specific situations. I’m glad we’ve been able to work through this together and that you have a clearer understanding of your eligibility. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding Child Benefit, or perhaps anything else at all?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that clarifies things for me. Pete and I have both submitted claims to HMRC because we couldn't agree on who should claim. So it sounds like HMRC will likely award the benefit to me since Holly stays with me more days of the week. Thank you for your help!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! I’m so glad I could assist you with that. It’s great that we’ve clarified the situation and you now have a better understanding of the process. 

If you have any other questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a wonderful day!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, you too!

✓ The agent correctly determined that in our situation where both parents are responsible but cannot agree, HMRC would award the Child Benefit to the parent who has the child more days (Sue/myself with 4 days versus Pete's 3 days).
