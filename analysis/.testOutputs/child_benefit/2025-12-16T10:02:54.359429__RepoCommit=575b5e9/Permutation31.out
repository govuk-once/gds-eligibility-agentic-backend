[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Sarah, a mother whose daughter Emma (18) has just started university.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you'd be claiming for?


[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Emma is 18 years old. She just turned 18 a few months ago.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sarah. That's helpful to know. 

Is Emma currently in any form of full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she is. Emma has just started her first year of university. She's doing a 3-year Bachelor's degree, but she still lives at home with me and commutes to the university every day.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Sarah.

To clarify, is Emma's education considered "Approved Education" (like A-Levels or NVQ Level 3) or "Advanced Education" (like a University degree or BTEC Higher National)?

[evaluation_judge]: She's doing a Bachelor's degree at university, so that would be Advanced Education.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Sarah. 

Based on the information you’ve provided – that Emma is 18 and undertaking advanced education at university – unfortunately, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit typically stops when a child starts full-time advanced education like a university degree.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. I wasn't sure if I could still claim Child Benefit while she's at university. Thank you for explaining that. No other questions at the moment.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit since my daughter is in Advanced Education (university degree).
