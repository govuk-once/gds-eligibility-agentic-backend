[evaluation_judge]: I'll now adopt the role of Gary, a parent seeking information about benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Gary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Gary, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm here to help you understand which benefits you might be eligible for. 

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm wanting to check about Child Benefit for my son Ben. He's 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. That's helpful to know. 

Ben is 17, so my next question is: is Ben currently in approved education or training?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, Ben left school in June and isn't going to college. He's registered with our local youth careers service and is actively looking for an apprenticeship. He's been meeting with his careers adviser regularly since leaving school.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Gary. That’s very helpful.

Just to confirm, is Ben still within 20 weeks of having left school? (Knowing today’s date would help me confirm, but an approximate answer is fine).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he just left school in June and it's now August, so he's definitely within 20 weeks of leaving education.

[root_agent]: Great, Gary. Thank you for confirming.

Now, are you responsible for Ben financially? In other words, does Ben live with you and do you provide for his needs?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Ben lives with me and I'm fully responsible for him financially. I provide for all his needs.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. And finally, to help me assess eligibility, could you confirm that Ben is not currently in state-funded care?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Ben isn't in state-funded care. He lives with me at home.

[root_agent]: Thank you very much for providing me with all of that information, Gary. 

Based on what you’ve told me, your son Ben may be eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks after he left school. This is because he is 16 or 17, has left education, and is registered with a qualifying careers service and actively seeking an apprenticeship.

Do you have any questions about this, or would you like me to explain anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: That's good to know. Could you just confirm - I'd be eligible to receive Child Benefit for him during this period, right? And what happens after the 20 weeks if he hasn't found an apprenticeship yet?

[root_agent]: You are eligible to receive Child Benefit for Ben during this 20-week period, yes. As long as he remains registered with the careers service and is actively seeking an apprenticeship, you can continue to claim during those 20 weeks from when he left school.

After the 20 weeks, if Ben hasn't started an apprenticeship or returned to full-time education, unfortunately, you will no longer be eligible for Child Benefit. The extension is specifically to support young people during their job search immediately after leaving education.

Would you like me to clarify anything about this, or perhaps discuss other potential benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense, thank you for explaining. I just wanted to make sure I understood correctly. So I can keep claiming for these 20 weeks, and if he starts an apprenticeship during that time, the Child Benefit would continue. But if he doesn't find anything by the end of the 20 weeks, it will stop. That's clear now, thank you.

[root_agent]: You’ve understood perfectly, Gary! You can keep claiming for the 20 weeks, and if Ben starts an apprenticeship *during* that time, the Child Benefit would continue as long as he meets the other eligibility requirements. But if he doesn't find anything by the end of the 20 weeks, it will stop.

I’m glad I could clarify things for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you for your help.

✓ The agent provided the correct outcome, accurately stating that I am eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks while my son is registered with a careers service and looking for an apprenticeship after leaving school. The information matched the expected outcome in the scenario.
