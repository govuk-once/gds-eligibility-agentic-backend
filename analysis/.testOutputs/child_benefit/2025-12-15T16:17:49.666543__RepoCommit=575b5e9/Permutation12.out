[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of a concerned parent looking to understand benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Jessica and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Jessica, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand which benefits you might be eligible for.

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, thanks for helping me. I'm wanting to check about Child Benefit for my son Liam. He's 18 years old and currently studying for his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. It's good to hear Liam is continuing his education. 

To help me understand your situation better, does Liam live with you full-time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he does live with me full-time. I'm a single parent - he's estranged from his father. We've been managing on our own for quite a while now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Jessica. It's helpful to know Liam lives with you full-time and about his relationship with his father.

Is Liam currently receiving any benefits in his own right, such as Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, actually he is. Liam recently started receiving Universal Credit to help with his personal expenses. He doesn't have any other income, and given our circumstances, he was able to claim it in his own right even though he's still in education.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Jessica. 

Just to be absolutely clear, the Universal Credit Liam is receiving is in *his* name, and is for *his* personal expenses, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. The Universal Credit is in Liam's name, not mine. He applied for it himself and it's specifically to help with his personal expenses.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided, Liam receiving Universal Credit in his own right means you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit for him.

Child Benefit stops when a child starts getting Universal Credit (or Employment and Support Allowance) in their own right.

I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with today, or would you like me to explain this further?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so I can't get Child Benefit because Liam is already getting Universal Credit himself. That's disappointing, but I guess it makes sense. Thank you for explaining that to me. I don't think I have any other questions right now.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my son receives Universal Credit in his own right, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
