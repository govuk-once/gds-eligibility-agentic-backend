[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay Raj, let’s see if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

First, could you tell me, is the child in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my son Dev is in full-time education. He's studying for his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, could you tell me how old is the child?

[evaluation_judge]: Dev is 19 right now, but he'll be turning 20 mid-way through his current term.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Just to confirm, is the child under 20?

[evaluation_judge]: Well right now he's 19, but as I mentioned, he'll be turning 20 during this term.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on that, it seems Dev will be 20 before the end of the current term. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. He will be turning 20 before his current term ends.

[root_agent]: Okay, Raj. Thank you for confirming that. Given that Dev will be 20 before the end of his current term, he is no longer eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I thought I might still receive Child Benefit while he finishes his A-levels. Does that mean the benefit stops completely on his 20th birthday?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct. Child Benefit stops completely on the individual’s 20th birthday, even if they are still in approved education. Would you like me to point you to the official government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, just for reference?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful, thank you.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The official guidance can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all I needed to know. Thank you for the information.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Raj! I’m glad I could assist you. Have a good day.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that Dev would not be eligible for Child Benefit once he turns 20, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)." The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops on the 20th birthday even if the child is still in approved education.
