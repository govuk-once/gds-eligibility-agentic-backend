[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay John, thanks for letting me know. Just to confirm, are you under 20 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thanks for confirming that. Now, could you tell me if the education you’re currently undertaking is considered “full-time”?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm attending a local college to re-sit two GCSEs. My course only involves about 6 hours of supervised study per week. The rest of the time I'm mostly just at home playing video games.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify, is the total amount of supervised study for your course more than 12 hours per week?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's only 6 hours per week of supervised study for my GCSE re-sits.

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you are not eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: Why am I not eligible? Is it because of the hours I'm studying?

[root_agent]: That’s a good question. The criteria for Child Benefit states that for it to be approved, the education must average more than 12 hours of supervised study per week. Your course currently involves only 6 hours, which doesn’t meet that requirement.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. So if my course had more than 12 hours per week, I could be eligible?

[root_agent]: Exactly. If your course involved more than 12 hours of supervised study per week, it would meet the criteria for Child Benefit eligibility.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit because my education doesn't qualify as full-time (only 6 hours of supervised study per week instead of the required 12+ hours).
