[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lisa and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Lisa, I understand you’re trying to determine your eligibility for Child Benefit.

To start, could you tell me, is the child living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my son Mark isn't living with me right now. He's been sentenced to a youth custody center.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know.

Just to clarify, is your son currently in custody or prison?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Mark is currently in a youth custody center. He's 15 years old and he's been sentenced to 6 months there.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. And to confirm, has Mark been in the custody center for more than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's been there for 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lisa. Thank you for answering my questions. Based on the information you’ve provided – that Mark is in custody and has been there for over 8 weeks – I must inform you that you are likely no longer eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore since Mark has been in custody for over 8 weeks? Is there anything else I should know about this situation?

[root_agent]: You are correct. Due to Mark being in custody for over 8 weeks, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. 

There is one exception outlined in the guidance, related to children in hospital or care. However, as Mark is in a youth custody center, that doesn’t apply to his situation.

Is there anything else I can help you understand about this, or perhaps direct you to resources that might be helpful?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So once a child has been in custody for more than 8 weeks, the Child Benefit stops. That's good to know. I don't have any other questions right now. Thank you for explaining this to me.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit since my son has been in custody for more than 8 weeks (10 weeks).
