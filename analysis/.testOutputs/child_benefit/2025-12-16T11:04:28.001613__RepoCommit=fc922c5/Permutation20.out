[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Maria, it’s lovely to speak with you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you tell me, are you responsible for Lucia?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. My granddaughter Lucia has been living with me full time since her parents couldn't take care of her anymore. I'm responsible for everything - her food, clothes, school expenses, everything really. She's 14 now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Maria. Just to be clear, as Lucia’s parents aren’t contributing financially and there isn’t a formal arrangement like fostering or a court order, is it correct to say you have an informal arrangement to care for Lucia?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. There's no court order or official fostering arrangement. It's just a family agreement we made when her parents couldn't cope. I've been looking after her and paying for everything, but it's all informal.

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria. Thank you for confirming that. Just one more question for now – does Lucia live with you permanently, or does she spend time living elsewhere as well?

[evaluation_judge]: She lives with me permanently. She's been with me for several years now and my home is her only home. She doesn't split her time between different places.

[root_agent]: Alright, Maria. Thank you for providing all of that information. Based on what you’ve told me – that you’re responsible for Lucia, you have an informal arrangement to care for her, and she lives with you permanently – it does seem like you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: That's good to hear! I've been caring for Lucia for quite some time now, and any financial help would really make a difference. What do I need to do to apply for the Child Benefit?

[root_agent]: That’s wonderful to hear, Maria. I’m glad we’ve established that you might be eligible. To apply for Child Benefit, you’ll need to fill out a form online through the government website. Would you like me to provide you with a link to the application form?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, that would be very helpful. I'm not the best with computers but I'll give it a go. Is there any specific information or documents I'll need to have ready when I fill out the application?

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here’s the link to the online application form: https://www.gov.uk/apply-child-benefit

To help you with the application, it’s useful to have the following information ready:

*   Lucia’s date of birth
*   Your National Insurance number
*   Details of your bank account for payments

Do you think you’d like me to elaborate on any of these points, or would you like me to suggest any resources that might help you with the online application process?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh thank you, that's very clear. I do have my National Insurance number and Lucia's details. I was wondering though - will they need any proof that I'm looking after Lucia since this is an informal arrangement? I don't have any official custody paperwork or anything like that.

[root_agent]: That’s a really important question, Maria. You're right to think about that. As you mentioned, this is an informal arrangement. The guidelines state that you can get Child Benefit if you have an informal arrangement to look after a friend or relative's child, provided the local council isn’t paying for their accommodation.

While formal paperwork isn't always required for informal arrangements, it can strengthen your application. Could you perhaps provide a letter from Lucia’s parents confirming the arrangement and their consent for you to care for her? It doesn’t need to be a formal legal document, but a simple letter would be beneficial. Would you like me to help you draft a template for such a letter?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think I could get her parents to write a letter confirming our arrangement. A template would be really helpful if you could provide one. Also, just to be clear, the local council isn't paying for anything at all - I cover all Lucia's costs myself.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s excellent news about getting a letter from Lucia’s parents. It will definitely help with your application.

Here’s a template you can adapt, Maria:

[Date]

To Whom It May Concern,

I, [Parents’ Full Name], am writing to confirm that our daughter, Lucia [Lucia’s Date of Birth], currently resides with Maria [Maria’s Full Name] at [Maria’s Address]. We have agreed that Maria will care for Lucia and cover all of her expenses, including food, clothing, and school costs. This arrangement is informal and based on our mutual agreement.

We consent to Maria receiving Child Benefit for Lucia.

Sincerely,

[Parents’ Full Name]

[Parents’ Contact Details – Phone Number and/or Email Address]

Would you like me to modify this template in any way, or would you like me to explain anything further about the application process?

[evaluation_judge]: That template looks perfect, thank you. I'll get them to sign something like this. Just to double check - once I have this letter and I apply online with all Lucia's details and my bank information, is there anything else I should know about the process? How long does it usually take to get a decision?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Maria! I’m pleased the template worked for you.

Once you’ve submitted your online application with Lucia’s details, your bank information, and the letter from her parents, here are a few things to keep in mind:

*   **Processing Time:** Child Benefit claims typically take around 4 weeks to process. However, it can sometimes take longer depending on the complexity of the case.
*   **Contacting the DWP:** If you haven't heard anything within 6 weeks, you can contact the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to check on the status of your application.
*   **Information Required:** The DWP may contact you for further information or clarification during the process. It's helpful to keep copies of all documents you’ve submitted.

You can find more detailed information about the Child Benefit application process on the DWP website: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit

Do you have any other questions or concerns about the process at this stage, Maria?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that covers everything I needed to know for now. I'll gather all the information, get that letter from Lucia's parents, and submit the application. Thank you so much for your help and for confirming that I might be eligible for Child Benefit. It will really help with Lucia's expenses.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Maria! I’m so glad I could assist you. I truly hope you are successful in receiving Child Benefit – it sounds like it will make a significant difference for you and Lucia. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything else comes up during the application process. Wishing you all the best!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for Child Benefit as an informal guardian of my granddaughter, matching the expected outcome. They accurately explained that I can receive Child Benefit with an informal arrangement when the local council isn't paying for accommodation.
