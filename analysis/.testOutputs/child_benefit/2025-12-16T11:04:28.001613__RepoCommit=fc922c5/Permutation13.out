[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a person in this situation to test the agent's ability to provide accurate information about benefit eligibility.

[root_agent]: Okay, welcome! It’s great to be talking with you.

To start, could you tell me, are you responsible for Maya?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ali and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Ali, thanks for letting me know.

To help me determine if you might be eligible, could you tell me, do you have any children living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, we have a 4-year-old girl named Maya living with us. My wife Zara and I have been approved as adopters and Maya has been placed with us, though we don't have the final adoption order from the court yet.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Just to be certain, are you currently responsible for Maya’s care and upbringing?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, we are fully responsible for Maya's care and upbringing. She lives with us full-time since being placed with us by the adoption agency.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know.

And just to confirm, you’re not waiting for the final adoption order to begin claiming benefits, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: That's correct. We don't have the final adoption order yet, but Maya is living with us now. We weren't sure if we needed to wait until the adoption was legally finalized before we could claim any benefits for her.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for confirming that.

Based on what you’ve told me – that you are responsible for Maya, she lives with you, and you don't need to wait for the final adoption order – it sounds like you’re likely eligible for Child Benefit.

Would you like me to provide you with some links to the official government information about Child Benefit eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful. Could you please provide those links? And just to be absolutely clear, we can claim Child Benefit now even though the adoption isn't finalized yet?

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here are the links to the official government information about Child Benefit eligibility:

*   Basic Child Benefit Eligibility: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)
*   Child Benefit for children living with someone else: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else)
*   Child Benefit for children in hospital or care: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care)

And yes, you are absolutely correct – you can claim Child Benefit as soon as a child you’re adopting comes to live with you, regardless of whether the final adoption order is in place.

Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit or the adoption process?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! Thank you for confirming we can claim Child Benefit now without waiting for the final adoption order. Could you tell me how we would go about making the claim? Would we need any specific documentation from the adoption agency?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help clarify that for you.

Okay, let’s talk about making the claim. You can apply for Child Benefit online through the government website: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit).

Regarding documentation from the adoption agency, it's generally helpful to have a copy of the placement agreement or any official correspondence confirming the adoption agency’s involvement. While it’s not always strictly required, having it on hand can speed up the process and demonstrate your responsibility for Maya.

You’ll also need information about Maya, such as her date of birth and National Insurance number.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the application process, or perhaps discuss what other documents you might find useful?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for that information. We have the placement agreement from the adoption agency so that should help. Just one more thing - we don't have Maya's National Insurance number. Would she even have one at 4 years old? What other information about her would we need for the application?

[root_agent]: That’s a really important point to check! You’re right, a four-year-old typically wouldn’t have a National Insurance number. They’ll need to be assigned one by HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs).

You can request a National Insurance number for a child through the HMRC website: [https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-national-insurance-number](https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-a-national-insurance-number). It usually takes a few weeks to receive it.

In the meantime, for the Child Benefit application, you’ll still need Maya’s date of birth, and your own National Insurance numbers. You'll also need to provide details about your circumstances, such as your income and any other benefits you receive. They may ask for proof of address.

It’s completely understandable to be a little unsure about this – it's a new process for you. Is there anything else I can clarify regarding the application or the National Insurance number request?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly stated that we are eligible for Child Benefit as soon as the child we're adopting comes to live with us, without having to wait for the final adoption order. This matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."
