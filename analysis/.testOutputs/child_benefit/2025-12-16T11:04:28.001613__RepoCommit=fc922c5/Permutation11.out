[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Karen and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Karen, thank you for reaching out. To help me determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you tell me, is Ryan generally responsible for his own needs and well-being?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Ryan still lives at home with me. I'm responsible for him. He's only just started his apprenticeship and doesn't earn much yet.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Just to confirm, Ryan is only just starting his government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Ryan just left school and has now started his Intermediate Apprenticeship. It's government-funded and here in England.

[root_agent]: Alright. And just to be clear, Ryan currently lives at home with you, and you are responsible for him?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Ryan lives at home with me. I'm still responsible for him financially and for his care even though he's 17.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Given that Ryan has started a government-funded apprenticeship in England, which is a disqualifying event for Child Benefit, it appears you are not eligible for this particular benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I didn't realize that. So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore because Ryan has started his apprenticeship? Will I need to stop my current claim then?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct. Because Ryan has begun a government-funded apprenticeship in England, you will need to stop your Child Benefit claim. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining that to me. I'll make arrangements to stop my claim right away.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Karen! I’m glad I could help. If you have any other questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my son Ryan has started a government-funded apprenticeship in England, which is a disqualifying event. The agent properly advised me to stop my claim, which matches the expected outcome.
