[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of a user based on this scenario.

Hi, i'm Sian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Sian, it's lovely to speak with you. To help me understand if you might be eligible, could you tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sian. And are you currently in education or training?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've just started a Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government. I left school and now I'm doing this apprenticeship in Cardiff.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Just to clarify, is this Foundation Apprenticeship your only source of income currently?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have any income really. The apprenticeship gives me a small training allowance, but that's it. My mum supports me - we live together in Cardiff.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Sian. To confirm, you live with your mother in Cardiff, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I live with my mum in Cardiff.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. Finally, just to be certain, is your mother responsible for your day-to-day care?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she is. She still looks after me and pays for most things.

[root_agent]: Thanks Sian, that's very helpful. Based on the information you've provided – that you are 17, in a Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales, live with your mother in Cardiff who provides your day-to-day care, and have limited income – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes, despite general rules about apprenticeships. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for the information about Child Benefit.

✓ The agent correctly determined I'm eligible for Child Benefit as a 17-year-old on a Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales, accurately identifying the Welsh exception to the apprenticeship rule.
