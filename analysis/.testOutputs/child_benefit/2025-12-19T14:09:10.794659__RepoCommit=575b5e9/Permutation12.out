[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Liam's mother Jessica who's inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Jessica and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Jessica, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: My son Liam is 18 years old. He still lives with me and is studying for his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. And is Liam in approved full-time education? (For example, A-levels are considered approved.)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's in approved full-time education. He's studying for his A-levels at the local sixth form college.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. Does Liam currently receive any benefits in his own right, such as Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he does receive Universal Credit in his own right. He's estranged from his father, and he applied for Universal Credit to help with his personal living costs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Just to be absolutely clear, is the Universal Credit Liam receives specifically for his own living costs, and not as part of a joint claim with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The Universal Credit claim is in his name and it's specifically for his own living costs. It's not part of a joint claim with me - he applied for it himself due to his circumstances.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you've provided, as Liam is 18 years old, in full-time education, and receives Universal Credit in his own right, you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit. 

The rules state that Child Benefit stops when a child starts to receive certain benefits, like Universal Credit, in their own right.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. Thank you for explaining that. I wasn't sure if I could still claim Child Benefit while he's studying, but now I understand that because he receives Universal Credit in his own right, I'm not eligible anymore. That's all I needed to know today, thank you.

✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since my son receives Universal Credit in his own right, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
