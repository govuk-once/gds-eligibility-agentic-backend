[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm David and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello David, it's lovely to speak with you. I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a particular benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?


[evaluation_judge]: My son Jack is 14 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, David. That's helpful to know.

Is Jack currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, Jack was placed in local authority care about 3 months ago, but he comes home to stay with me every weekend. He arrives on Friday evening and leaves on Sunday evening.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, David. So Jack lives with you on weekends, arriving Friday evening and leaving Sunday evening, but lives in local authority care during the week.

Has Jack been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks continuously?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's been in local authority care continuously for about 3 months now, which is more than 8 weeks.

[root_agent]: Thank you, David. Since Jack has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, I need to ask one more question to determine your eligibility.

Does Jack spend at least two nights in a row, or a total of 24 hours a week, at home with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he spends Friday and Saturday nights with me every weekend. So that's two nights in a row each week.

[root_agent]: Thank you, David. Based on the information you've provided, despite Jack being in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, because he spends two nights in a row with you each week, you *are* likely still eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So I can still get Child Benefit even though Jack is in care most of the time? I just want to be sure because I was worried it would stop completely.

[root_agent]: Yes, David, that's correct. You can still receive Child Benefit. The rules state that Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks if a child is in care, *however* there's an exception if the child spends at least two nights in a row, or 24 hours a week, with a parent. Since Jack spends Friday and Saturday nights with you, you meet that exception.

I understand your concern about it stopping completely - it's good you checked! Do you have any other questions about this, or anything else I can clarify?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news and a relief to hear. No, I don't have any other questions. Thank you very much for your help.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, David! I'm glad I could help and that it's a relief to hear. 

If you think of anything else in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit through the exception rule, as Jack spends two consecutive nights (Friday and Saturday) with me each week, despite being in local authority care for more than 8 weeks.
