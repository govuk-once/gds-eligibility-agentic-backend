[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Mo, I'm happy to help! To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you're hoping to claim Child Benefit for?

[evaluation_judge]: My son Zahid is 15 years old. He doesn't live with me though, he lives with his aunt. I send £15 a week to help with his costs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mo. Does anyone else contribute financially towards the cost of looking after Zahid?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my mother - Zahid's grandmother - also sends £15 a week to his aunt to help with his costs.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mo. Just to confirm, does your son's aunt claim any benefits for Zahid herself?

[evaluation_judge]: No, his aunt doesn't claim any benefits for him.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that, Mo. To clarify, you contribute £15 per week, and Zahid’s grandmother contributes £15 per week – is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I send £15 weekly and my mother sends another £15 weekly to my son's aunt to help with his costs.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mo. Based on the information you've provided, it seems you may be eligible for Child Benefit. The combined contributions from yourself and Zahid’s grandmother meet the required amount.

Just to be absolutely sure, are you the biological father of Zahid?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am Zahid's biological father.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you Mo. It sounds like you *are* eligible for Child Benefit for Zahid. Would you like me to explain how to apply?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, could you explain how to apply for the Child Benefit?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Mo. You can apply for Child Benefit online through the government website. You’ll need your National Insurance number, Zahid’s date of birth, and details of anyone who might be eligible to receive the benefit payments (which would be you, as his father). 

You can find the application form here: [https://www.gov.uk/apply-child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/apply-child-benefit)

It usually takes around 8 weeks to receive a decision.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for the information about applying for Child Benefit.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit. They understood that while I individually contribute £15 per week, the combined contributions from me and my mother (£30 per week total) exceed the Child Benefit amount (£26.05), making me eligible.
