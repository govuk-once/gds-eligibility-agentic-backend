[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ali and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ali, it's good to hear from you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 35 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ali. And could you please tell me if you are responsible for any children?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my partner Zara and I have a 4-year-old named Maya living with us. We've been approved as adopters and Maya has been placed with us by the adoption agency, though the final adoption order hasn't been granted by the court yet.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Ali. Just to clarify, is Maya living with you full-time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Maya is living with us full-time. She moved into our home after being placed with us by the adoption agency.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. To confirm, are you and Zara both legally responsible for Maya’s care?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, we are legally responsible for Maya's care. The adoption agency has placed her with us and we're her primary caregivers now, even though the final adoption order hasn't been granted by the court yet.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ali. Given that Maya is living with you full-time and you are responsible for her care as prospective adopters, you are likely eligible for Child Benefit, even before the final adoption order is granted. 

Is Zara also 16 or over?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Zara is 33 years old.

[root_agent]: Great. It sounds like you meet the criteria for Child Benefit. You can claim as soon as any child you’re adopting comes to live with you – you don’t have to wait for the final adoption order.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, Ali?

[evaluation_judge]: So I'm eligible to claim Child Benefit right now for Maya, even though the adoption isn't finalized yet? That's really helpful to know. How do I go about making the claim?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s right! You *can* claim Child Benefit right now for Maya, even though the adoption isn’t finalized. I'm glad I could clarify that for you.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to provide instructions on *how* to make a claim, but you can find all the information on the government website. I recommend searching for "claim child benefit" on gov.uk.



Is there anything else I can help you with regarding eligibility, or any other benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you for confirming that we're eligible for Child Benefit even before the adoption is finalized. We'll look into the application process on the government website. Have a good day!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ali! I'm happy I could help. I wish you and Zara all the best with the adoption process and with Maya. 

Have a good day too!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I am eligible for Child Benefit as soon as the child I'm adopting (Maya) came to live with me, without needing to wait for the final adoption order.
