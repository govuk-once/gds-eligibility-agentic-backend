[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Emily and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Emily, welcome! To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me your date of birth? I need this to check the eligibility criteria.





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 18 years old, I was born on 15th April 2006.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Are you currently in education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've just finished my A-Levels and I've started a Higher National Certificate course at my local college.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Could you tell me whether this Higher National Certificate course is considered an "Approved" course, or an "Advanced" course? Knowing this will help me assess your eligibility.

[evaluation_judge]: It's an Advanced course. It's a BTEC Higher National Certificate, which is a level 4 qualification.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. As your course is an Advanced course (Level 4), unfortunately, this means you are not eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit generally continues only while someone is in non-advanced education, such as A-Levels or below. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So because I'm doing a Higher National Certificate, I'm not eligible for Child Benefit? Is there any other support I might be able to get instead?

[root_agent]: You are correct - because you are undertaking an Advanced course (the Higher National Certificate), you are not eligible for Child Benefit.

While I can only assess Child Benefit eligibility, there are other types of support you *might* be eligible for as a student. However, these are separate from Child Benefit and I don't have information on those. You may want to explore options like Student Finance England (if applicable), bursaries, or other student support available through your college.



Would you like me to double-check anything regarding the Child Benefit eligibility criteria, just to be sure?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's clear. I understand that because I'm doing an advanced course (HNC), I'm not eligible for Child Benefit. Thank you for explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could clarify things for you. If you have any other questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a good day, and best of luck with your HNC course!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit because I am enrolled in an advanced course (HNC), which is above Level 3/A-Level standard education.
