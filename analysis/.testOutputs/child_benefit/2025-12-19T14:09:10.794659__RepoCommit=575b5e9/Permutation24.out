[evaluation_judge]: I'll assume the role of a person seeking benefits information and interact with the agent under test.

Hi, i'm Alice and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Alice, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you tell me if you are claiming for a child, and if so, what is their date of birth?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm claiming for my son Tom. He's 14 years old. I'm not sure if I'm still eligible for benefits as he's been at a residential school for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Alice. It's good to know Tom is 14.

You mentioned Tom is at a residential school. Is this school paid for by the local council?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the local council is paying for the residential school. He's there because he has severe behavioral needs that are better managed in that environment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Alice. Knowing the local council is funding the residential school and that it's due to Tom's behavioral needs is very helpful.

Just to clarify, when did Tom *start* at the residential school? Knowing the exact date isn’t crucial, but roughly how many weeks ago was it? You mentioned ‘about 10 weeks’ – is that accurate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's been about 10 weeks since Tom started at the residential school. The local council arranged it because they felt it would be the best environment for his needs.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Alice. That’s very clear.

Just one more quick question for now: Is Tom living at the residential school full-time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he is living at the residential school full-time. He stays there during the week and on weekends too. It's a complete residential placement because of his behavioral needs.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Alice. This is very helpful.

Based on what you've told me – that Tom is 14, he’s at a residential school funded by the local council due to behavioral needs, and he’s been there for approximately 10 weeks full-time – you are likely still eligible for Child Benefit.

Children in residential accommodation, unlike those in local authority care, remain eligible for Child Benefit for the first 12 weeks. As Tom has only been there for 10 weeks, you should still be eligible at this time.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or perhaps discuss any other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: So if I understand correctly, I'm still eligible for Child Benefit for Tom because he's in residential accommodation rather than local authority care, and the time limit for residential accommodation is 12 weeks? What happens after the 12 weeks are up?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Alice! You are correct – the key difference is that residential accommodation has a 12-week eligibility period, whereas local authority care has an 8-week period for Child Benefit.

After the 12 weeks are up, your Child Benefit payments for Tom will unfortunately stop. This is because the rules state that Child Benefit generally ends when a child is in full-time residential care for more than 12 weeks.

However, you may be able to claim Universal Credit or Child Tax Credit instead. Would you like me to provide some information about those benefits, or would you prefer to focus on Child Benefit for now?

[evaluation_judge]: I appreciate that information. For now, let's focus on the Child Benefit. So I'll continue to receive it until we hit the 12-week mark, which is in about two weeks from now. And then it will stop. That's good to know so I can prepare. Are there any notifications I'll receive when it's about to stop, or do I need to inform them myself about Tom's situation?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Alice. You've summarised the situation perfectly – you'll continue to receive Child Benefit until the 12-week mark, around two weeks from now, and then it will stop. It's good you're planning ahead.

You don’t need to proactively inform them *immediately* when the 12 weeks is up. HMRC (the Child Benefit people) will usually stop the payments automatically once they reach that point. However, they may contact you to confirm Tom's ongoing residential placement. 

It's a good idea to keep a note of when the 12 weeks is up yourself, just in case. Also, if your circumstances change *before* the 12 weeks is up, you should let HMRC know.

Would you like me to provide you with the contact details for HMRC, should you need them?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I'm eligible for Child Benefit because my son is in residential accommodation (not care) and has been there for 10 weeks, which is under the 12-week time limit for residential accommodation.
