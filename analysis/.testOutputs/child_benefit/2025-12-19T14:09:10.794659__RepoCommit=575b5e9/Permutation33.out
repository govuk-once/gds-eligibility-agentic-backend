[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Bella and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Bella, it’s lovely to speak with you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 16 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks Bella. And do you live with either of your parents?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I live with my mother.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Are you currently in full-time non-advanced education, like A-levels, or a similar course?

[evaluation_judge]: I've started a training course to become a travel agent. It's not a standard government apprenticeship though.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Is this training course paid for by an employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's fully paid for by a local travel agency that has employed me.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Just to confirm, are you responsible for any children financially?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm sorry, I think there might be some confusion. I'm the 16-year-old (Bella), not a parent. I live with my mother. I don't have any children of my own.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to clarify, and I apologise for the confusion! That was my mistake. 

Given that you are 16, live with your mother, and your training course is fully paid for by your employer, it appears you might not be eligible for Child Benefit. However, I want to be certain. 

Could you tell me - is the training course you are doing considered an approved course? (Don't worry if you don't know, just let me know and I can explain what that means).

[evaluation_judge]: I don't think I know what an "approved course" means in this context. Could you explain what that means?

[root_agent]: Certainly. An “approved course” for Child Benefit purposes usually refers to courses that qualify for educational support. However, the rules state that if an employer is paying for your training, it generally doesn’t count as an approved course, even if it otherwise would.

Because your travel agency employer is fully funding your training course, you likely wouldn’t be eligible for Child Benefit.

Would you like me to double-check anything or explain why based on the eligibility rules?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please explain why I'm not eligible based on the rules? I'm a bit confused since I'm only 16 and living with my mum.

[root_agent]: Of course. You're right to ask for clarification, and it *is* confusing! Child Benefit is usually paid if you're responsible for a child under 20 who is in approved education.

However, the rules state that if someone is in full-time education, and that education is paid for by their employer, it doesn’t count as ‘approved’ education for Child Benefit purposes.

Because your travel agency is fully paying for your training course, even though you are under 20 and living with your mother, the education doesn't meet the criteria for approved education in this case.

Essentially, the benefit is designed to help with the costs of education, and when an employer covers those costs, you aren’t eligible.



Does that make a little more sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. So because my training course is paid for by my employer, it doesn't count as "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes. Even though I'm 16 and living with my mum, we wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit because of how my training is funded. Thank you for explaining.

[root_agent]: You’ve understood perfectly! You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could explain it clearly. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you'd like to explore if you might be eligible for any other types of benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave me the wrong outcome. The agent described me (the 16-year-old) as not being eligible for Child Benefit because my employer pays for my training. However, Child Benefit is paid to parents/guardians who are responsible for children, not to the children themselves. My mother would be the one applying for Child Benefit, not me. The agent confused who the applicant would be in this scenario.
