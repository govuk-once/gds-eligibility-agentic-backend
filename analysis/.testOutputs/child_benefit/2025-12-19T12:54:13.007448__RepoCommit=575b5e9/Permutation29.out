[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jordan and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Jordan, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently in approved education or training – for example, college, university, or an apprenticeship?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not. I finished my GCSEs last year, but I'm not in college or doing any training program at the moment.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Have you registered with any government-sponsored careers service, the armed forces, or a similar program? This is to see if you might qualify for an extension to Child Benefit beyond age 16.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't registered with any careers service or anything like that. I'm not really doing anything at the moment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so open with me, Jordan. Based on the information you've provided – you are 17 and not currently in approved education or training, nor registered with a relevant careers service – it appears you are unfortunately not currently eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on where you *could* register for a careers service or training program?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit based on my age (17), not being in education or training, and not being registered for the 20-week extension with a careers service.
