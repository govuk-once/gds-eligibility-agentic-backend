[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Hans and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Hans, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me how long you have been looking for work?


[evaluation_judge]: I've been unemployed and looking for work for about 95 days now. I'm claiming Child Benefit at the moment as a Jobseeker. I have Pre-Settled Status in the UK, if that matters.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hans. You mentioned you have Pre-Settled Status. Are you currently receiving any income from work, even part-time?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any work income at all right now. I've been applying for jobs but haven't had any luck yet. I don't have any immediate job offers either.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Hans. Just to confirm, you said you've been looking for work for approximately 95 days and currently have no job offers. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I've been looking for work for about 95 days and unfortunately don't have any job offers at the moment.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. As you are claiming Child Benefit as a Jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status, and you've been looking for work for 95 days without a job offer, it appears your eligibility may have changed. 

I'm not able to give definitive advice, but the rules state that Jobseeker status generally lasts for 91 days. Would you like me to explain this further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this further. I didn't know there was a time limit on my status as a Jobseeker.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The rules state that with Pre-Settled Status, you can generally claim as a Jobseeker for 91 days while looking for work. After that period, unless you have a genuine prospect of work – like a job offer – or other resources, your right to reside for benefit purposes often expires. 

Since you've been looking for work for 95 days and don't currently have a job offer, it unfortunately seems you may no longer meet the eligibility criteria for continued Child Benefit based on Jobseeker status.

I recommend checking the official government website ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)) for the most up-to-date information and considering seeking further advice. Would you like me to clarify anything about this?

[evaluation_judge]: So you're saying I might not be eligible for Child Benefit anymore? That's concerning. What should I do now? Is there any way I can extend my Jobseeker status, or are there other benefits I might be eligible for instead?

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, Hans. It does appear your eligibility for Child Benefit as a Jobseeker may have ended. 

Regarding extending your Jobseeker status, generally, it isn't automatically extended. However, if you have a genuine prospect of work – meaning you’ve been offered a job that you’re likely to start – that could be considered. 

As for other benefits, it depends on your individual circumstances. You might want to explore options like Universal Credit. However, eligibility for Universal Credit also depends on your immigration status and other factors.

I'm designed to help with Child Benefit eligibility specifically, and I'm not qualified to give advice on Universal Credit or other benefits. I strongly recommend visiting the government website ([https://www.gov.uk/benefits](https://www.gov.uk/benefits)) for information on all available benefits and how to apply, or contacting a benefits advisor for personalized guidance. Would you like me to reiterate the link to the Child Benefit eligibility page?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, that would be helpful to have the Child Benefit eligibility link again. So to be clear, because I've been looking for work for more than 91 days and don't have a job offer, I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit based on my Pre-Settled Status as a Jobseeker - is that correct?

[root_agent]: You are correct, Hans. Because you’ve been looking for work for more than 91 days and don’t have a job offer, you are likely no longer eligible for Child Benefit based on your Pre-Settled Status as a Jobseeker, according to the current rules.

Here's the link to the Child Benefit eligibility page again: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)

I understand this isn’t the news you wanted to hear. Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit specifically?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit. They accurately explained that my Jobseeker status expired after 91 days (I've been unemployed for 95 days) and without a job offer, I no longer qualify while on Pre-Settled Status.
