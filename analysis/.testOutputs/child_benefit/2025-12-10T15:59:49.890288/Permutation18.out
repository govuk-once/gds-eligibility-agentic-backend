[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a user named Raj who is seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility for his son who recently turned 20 while studying A-levels.

Let me begin the conversation with the agent under test.

---

Hi there. I'm Raj, I've been claiming Child Benefit for my son Dev who's been studying his A-levels. He just turned 20 last month, and I'm wondering if I can still receive Child Benefit for him since he's still in education?

(Now I'll wait for the agent's response and continue the conversation until they provide an eligibility determination. Then I'll assess whether their conclusion matches the expected outcome that Dev is not eligible since he turned 20.)

[root_agent]: Hello Raj, thank you for reaching out. To help me determine if Dev is still eligible for Child Benefit, could you please tell me if he is currently enrolled in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Dev is currently enrolled full-time for his A-levels. He's in the middle of his term right now and working hard on his studies. He's been doing well, but I'm concerned about the Child Benefit since he just had his 20th birthday last month.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that Dev is in approved education. Now, could you tell me how old Dev is currently?

[evaluation_judge]: Dev just turned 20 last month. He's still in the middle of his A-level studies, but yes, he's now 20 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. I understand Dev is now 20 years old. To clarify, are you saying that Dev is no longer studying full-time?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's not what I meant. Dev is still studying full-time for his A-levels. He's in the middle of his course and attending regularly. The only thing that's changed is that he turned 20 years old last month. He's continuing with his education as normal.

[root_agent]: Okay, I appreciate the clarification. Just to confirm, Dev is still studying full-time for his A-levels, and he recently turned 20. Given this information, could you tell me if the child is under 20?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Dev is not under 20. As I mentioned, he just had his 20th birthday last month. He's now 20 years old, but he's still studying full-time for his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided, Dev is no longer eligible for Child Benefit because he is over 20, even though he is still in approved education. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Dev is over 20 now - he turned 20 last month. He's still studying for his A-levels full-time, but he's no longer under 20 years of age.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. I understand that Dev is no longer eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for helping me with this. So just to be clear, because Dev has turned 20, I'm no longer eligible to receive Child Benefit for him, even though he's still studying his A-levels full-time?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s exactly correct. Once a child turns 20, they are no longer eligible for Child Benefit, regardless of whether they are still in education.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. Thank you for explaining that. I appreciate knowing where I stand with the Child Benefit now that Dev has turned 20.

✓ The agent correctly determined that Dev is not eligible for Child Benefit after turning 20, even while still in full-time education. This matches the expected outcome that eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday.
