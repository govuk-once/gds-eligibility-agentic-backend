[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Mary, thank you for reaching out. I’m happy to help you explore your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you confirm whether you are the primary carer for Chloe?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm Chloe's mum and her primary carer. I have a 6-year-old daughter who's been in hospital for a while now, and I was wondering if I'm still eligible for Child Benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Just to clarify, are you responsible for Chloe?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm fully responsible for Chloe. She's my daughter and I've always been her main caregiver.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is Chloe currently?

[evaluation_judge]: Chloe is 6 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, Chloe is 6 years old. Could you tell me how long Chloe has been in hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: Chloe has been in the hospital for 14 weeks now. It's been really difficult. I visit her every day.

[root_agent]: I understand. And to confirm, are you regularly spending money on Chloe’s upkeep while she’s in hospital, such as on books, pyjamas, or special food?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I spend about £30 a week on things for her - books to keep her entertained, comfortable pajamas, and some special foods that she likes that the hospital doesn't provide.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Just one final question – has Chloe been in hospital for more than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, like I mentioned, she's been in the hospital for 14 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you Mary. Based on your answers, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit, thanks to the exception for parents regularly spending money on a child’s upkeep while they’re in hospital.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's a relief! So despite Chloe being in hospital for 14 weeks, I can still receive the Child Benefit because I'm spending money on her upkeep? I was worried because I heard something about benefits stopping after a certain time in hospital.

[root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. As you’re regularly spending money on Chloe’s upkeep while she’s in hospital, you retain eligibility for Child Benefit beyond the standard 12-week limit. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding this or any other benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining that. It's good to know I can still get the Child Benefit while she's in hospital since I'm still spending money on her care. I don't have any other questions right now. This information has been really helpful.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Mary! I’m glad I could clarify things for you. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for Child Benefit via the exception for parents who regularly spend money on their child's upkeep while in hospital, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (via Exception)."
