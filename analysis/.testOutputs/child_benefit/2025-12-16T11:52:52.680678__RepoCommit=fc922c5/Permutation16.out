[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Hannah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Hannah, it’s good to speak with you. To start, has the child been in hospital for more than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my son Oliver has been in the hospital in the USA for about 15 weeks now. He has a rare condition and was sent to a specialist hospital there for treatment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. To help me understand your situation fully, did the child go abroad specifically for hospital treatment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Oliver was specifically sent to the USA for treatment at a specialist hospital because of his rare condition. I've stayed here in the UK but I pay for his incidental costs and visit him whenever I can.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Based on this information, it seems you may be eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to explain the criteria for that benefit further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain more about the Child Benefit eligibility in my situation. I want to make sure I understand why I'm eligible while my son is receiving treatment abroad.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Let’s look at the Child Benefit criteria. The first question I have is: Has the child been in hospital for more than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, as I mentioned earlier, Oliver has been in the hospital in the USA for 15 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Now, considering Oliver is receiving treatment abroad, did the child go abroad specifically for hospital treatment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he only went to the USA specifically for this hospital treatment. It wasn't for any other reason.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that detail. The guidelines state that if a child is in hospital abroad and only went abroad to be in hospital, eligibility continues – provided the parent is still spending money on them. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm still paying for his incidental costs while he's there, and I visit him when I can, which also involves expenses.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Based on your answers, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit. Do you have any other questions about the benefit or anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome. They correctly identified the international exception rule that applies in my case since my child is abroad specifically for hospital treatment and I am still spending money on him.
