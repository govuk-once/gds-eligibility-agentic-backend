[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Sian, it's lovely to speak with you. To help me understand whether you might be eligible for a benefit, could you tell me your age, please?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And where in the UK do you live?

[evaluation_judge]: I live in Cardiff, Wales, with my mother.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. Are you currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: I've left school and I've started a Foundation Apprenticeship that's funded by the Welsh Government.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Could you tell me a little more about this Foundation Apprenticeship – is it your only activity, or are you doing anything else alongside it, like a part-time job?

[evaluation_judge]: It's my only activity right now. I'm just focusing on this Foundation Apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Is your mother responsible for your day-to-day care?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she is. I still live at home with her.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. Just to confirm, is this Foundation Apprenticeship your main form of training? It's funded by the Welsh Government, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's my main form of training and it's fully funded by the Welsh Government.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided – that you are 17, live in Wales, are completing a Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government, and are primarily cared for by your mother – it sounds like you *are* likely to be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Would you like me to explain why, or would you like me to ask further questions to be absolutely sure?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to understand why I'm eligible, please.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Generally, being an apprentice can stop Child Benefit payments. However, there's an exception for Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales. These are considered "approved training" by the government, meaning you can continue to receive Child Benefit while undertaking one. 

Because you're under 20, living with your mother who provides your care, and doing a Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government, you meet the criteria for continued eligibility. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So even though I'm on an apprenticeship, because it's specifically a Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales, my mother can continue to receive Child Benefit for me?

[root_agent]: Exactly! You've understood perfectly. Even though apprenticeships usually disqualify a young person from receiving Child Benefit, the Welsh Government's Foundation Apprenticeships are an exception to that rule. Your mother can continue to receive Child Benefit for you as long as you continue to meet the other eligibility requirements, such as being in approved education.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit because Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are considered approved training, despite apprenticeships typically disqualifying eligibility.
