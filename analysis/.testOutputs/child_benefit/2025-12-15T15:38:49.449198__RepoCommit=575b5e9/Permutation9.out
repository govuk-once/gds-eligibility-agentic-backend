[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of a UK resident seeking benefits information.

Hi, i'm Lars and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Lars, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm here to help you understand if you might be eligible for certain benefits.

To start, could you please tell me how old your son, Hans, is?





[evaluation_judge]: Hans is 5 years old. I've been taking care of him since we moved to the UK from Germany not long ago.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Lars.

Are you currently responsible for Hans financially and for his care?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am fully responsible for Hans financially and for his care. I'm a single father and he lives with me full time.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Lars. That's helpful.

Do you currently have the right to reside in the UK? Perhaps you have a visa or status granted under the EU Settlement Scheme?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme. I moved here from Germany recently.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lars. And are you currently employed, or are you currently looking for work?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently unemployed but I'm actively looking for work. I've registered as a jobseeker here in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thanks for that information, Lars.

Based on what you've told me so far, it sounds like you *may* be eligible for Child Benefit. However, to be certain, could you confirm if you have comprehensive sickness insurance, or sufficient resources to support yourself and Hans financially?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have comprehensive sickness insurance, and my resources are limited at the moment. That's why I'm actively looking for work and have registered as a jobseeker. I'm really hoping to find employment soon.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so open with me, Lars. 

Based on everything you've told me – that you have Pre-Settled Status, you are responsible for a 5-year-old son, you are currently unemployed but actively seeking work and registered as a jobseeker, and you do not have comprehensive sickness insurance or sufficient resources – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit.



Would you like me to summarise why, or would you prefer to know the next steps for applying?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to understand why I'm eligible, please. I was worried that my Pre-Settled Status might be an issue since I'm not currently working.

[root_agent]: You were right to consider your Pre-Settled Status, Lars, as it's a valid point to check! It’s great you asked.

Essentially, while having Pre-Settled Status *can* sometimes affect eligibility, people with Pre-Settled Status can still claim Child Benefit if they meet certain conditions. Because you are actively seeking work and have registered as a jobseeker, you meet the requirement to have a qualifying right to reside.

This means that despite not currently being employed, your genuine and active search for work allows you to be eligible, especially as you don’t have comprehensive sickness insurance or sufficient resources. The fact that you are financially responsible for your son, Hans, who is of the correct age, also contributes to your eligibility.



Does that explanation make sense, Lars?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Thank you for explaining. I'm relieved to know that being registered as a jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work allows me to be eligible despite having Pre-Settled Status. That's a big weight off my shoulders to know I can get some support for Hans while I'm looking for employment.

[root_agent]: You are very welcome, Lars! I'm genuinely pleased I could help clarify things and relieve some of your worries. It's completely understandable to be concerned about eligibility with changing circumstances.

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you the very best of luck with your job search. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know today. Thank you for your help with understanding my eligibility for Child Benefit. I'll start the application process right away. I appreciate your time and clear explanation.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit based on having Pre-Settled Status, being responsible for my 5-year-old son, and qualifying through my status as a registered jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work.
