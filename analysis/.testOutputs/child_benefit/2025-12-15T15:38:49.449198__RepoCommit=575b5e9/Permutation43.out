[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Callum and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Callum, it's lovely to meet you! To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you tell me how old you are?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old and I live in Glasgow with my dad.

[root_agent]: Thanks! And are you currently in education or training?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I just started a Modern Apprenticeship here in Scotland.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Is this a formally approved training programme?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, which is a formal training programme where I work for an employer and get training at the same time. I get paid while I'm learning.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Generally, in Scotland, Child Benefit isn't payable to someone undertaking an apprenticeship. To confirm, this apprenticeship is *not* part of the Welsh exception to this rule, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. I'm in Scotland, not Wales, so my apprenticeship wouldn't be part of any Welsh exception.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided – being 17 years old and undertaking a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland – it appears you are not eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because of my apprenticeship in Scotland? Is there any other benefit I might be eligible for instead?

[root_agent]: You are correct – your apprenticeship in Scotland means you aren’t currently eligible for Child Benefit. 

While I can only assess eligibility for Child Benefit based on the information I have, there are other benefits available depending on your circumstances. However, assessing those would require questions outside of the scope of Child Benefit eligibility. 

You might find it helpful to explore benefits available to young people on the Gov.uk website: [https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/young-people](https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/young-people)

Would you like me to double-check anything we've discussed regarding Child Benefit before you go?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's fine. I understand that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because I'm doing an apprenticeship in Scotland. Thank you for explaining that to me.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit since I am doing a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, which aligns with the expected outcome.
