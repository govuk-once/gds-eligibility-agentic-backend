[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Tom, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and whether you might be eligible for benefits, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Are you currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm taking a computer coding course. It's not exactly standard full-time education I think - my future employer is paying for the course fees as part of an agreement that I'll join them when I finish. I'm not getting paid during the course though.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Is this computer coding course approved by a school, college, university, or local council?

[evaluation_judge]: It's actually arranged directly through my future employer. They're paying for it from a private training provider. It's not through a school, college, university or local council.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So, your employer pays for the course fees as part of an agreement that you will join them afterwards. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. They pay for the course with the agreement that I'll work for them when I finish. It's kind of like a pathway to employment with them.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Just to be clear, are you receiving any payment from your employer while undertaking this course, even though it’s not a wage? (For example, a training allowance or expenses).

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't receive any payment at all. They're only covering the course fees, but I'm not getting any money directly.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you’ve provided, it seems your course falls under the category of being done with an employer’s agreement as a pathway to employment. According to the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, this type of course is not considered approved education. Therefore, it's likely you would not be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or would you like to explore other potential benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you explain a bit more why my course doesn't count? I thought since I'm 17 and still in education, I might be eligible.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The rules for Child Benefit and what counts as "education" are quite specific. While you *are* 17 and undertaking a course, the guidelines state that courses funded by an employer with the expectation of future employment don’t qualify as approved education for Child Benefit purposes. 

Essentially, it's viewed differently from a standard school, college, or university course. The intention behind the rule is to distinguish between genuine educational pursuits and training specifically designed for a job – even if it’s a valuable course. Because your employer is directly funding it with a job offer tied to completion, it falls into the latter category.

Does that make a bit more sense? I can point you to the relevant section of the government website if you'd like a direct reference.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So because it's part of an employer agreement it doesn't count as approved education. Thanks for explaining.
