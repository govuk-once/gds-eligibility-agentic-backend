[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Bella and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Bella, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for certain benefits, could you please tell me your age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 16 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And do you live with either of your parents?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I live with my mother.

[root_agent]: Great, thanks. Are you currently in full-time education, such as school, college, or an apprenticeship?

[evaluation_judge]: I've just started a training course to become a travel agent. It's not a standard government apprenticeship though - it's a training course fully paid for by the local travel agency that has employed me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, is this training course funded entirely by your employer, the travel agency?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The travel agency is paying for the entire course as part of my employment with them.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Are you responsible for any children financially?

[evaluation_judge]: I think there's a misunderstanding. I'm Bella, I'm 16 years old. I don't have any children - I live with my mother. I'm asking about benefits for myself.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to point that out – my apologies! I got ahead of myself and incorrectly assumed you were enquiring about Child Benefit. 

Let's focus on benefits *you* might be eligible for. Since you are 16 and in education, I was checking for Child Benefit eligibility, but it sounds like that isn’t what you’re looking for. 

Could you tell me which benefit you are interested in finding out about? Or, if you're unsure, could you briefly explain your circumstances and what kind of support you're looking for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm just generally interested in finding out what benefits I might be eligible for as a 16-year-old who has started working and training. I've heard there might be some support available for young people in my situation, but I'm not sure what exactly.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know. As you're working and training, and living with your mother, let's explore if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. Even though you are the one working and training, your mother may be able to claim for you. 

To confirm, is your mother responsible for your day-to-day care?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my mother is responsible for my care - we live together and she takes care of the household.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And to be clear, the training course you're doing is being fully funded by your employer, the travel agency, is that correct? It’s not a government-funded apprenticeship or similar?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The training course is fully funded by the travel agency that employs me. It's not a government-funded apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided – that you are 16, live with your mother who is responsible for your care, and your training course is fully funded by your employer – it appears you would **not** be eligible for Child Benefit. This is because the eligibility criteria state that education counts as “approved” only if it is *not* paid for by an employer.



Is there anything else I can help you with today, or would you like me to explore other potential benefits that might be available to you?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my training is employer-funded, which matches the expected outcome.
