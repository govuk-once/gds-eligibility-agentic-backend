[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sian, it's lovely to speak with you. To help me understand your eligibility, could you please tell me your age?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And where in the UK do you currently live?

[evaluation_judge]: I live in Cardiff, Wales with my mother.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. Are you currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I've left school. I've started a Foundation Apprenticeship that's funded by the Welsh Government.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Could you tell me a little more about this Foundation Apprenticeship – is it your only activity, or are you also working alongside it?

[evaluation_judge]: It's my only activity right now. I'm just focusing on this Foundation Apprenticeship full-time that the Welsh Government is funding.

[root_agent]: That's very helpful, thank you. Is your mother responsible for your care?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I live with my mother and she's responsible for my care.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided – being 17, living in Wales, undertaking a Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government, and being cared for by your mother – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

Just to be absolutely sure, is there anyone else contributing financially to your care, other than your mother?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's just my mother who takes care of me financially. No one else contributes.

[root_agent]: Excellent. It sounds very likely that you are eligible for Child Benefit then. Your Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales is considered approved training for these purposes.

To formally apply, you’ll need to provide details about both yourself and your mother. Would you like me to briefly outline the information you'll need to have ready when you apply?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful. What information will we need to have ready for the application?

[root_agent]: Certainly. You will need both your National Insurance number and your mother’s. You’ll also need your date of birth, and her date of birth, address and bank details. 

It’s also useful to have details of any other income your mother receives, although this doesn’t necessarily affect eligibility, it can influence the amount received.

Does that sound manageable, or would you like me to go over any of that again?

[evaluation_judge]: That sounds manageable. So just to confirm, I am eligible for Child Benefit while doing my Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales?

[root_agent]: Yes, that is correct! Unlike apprenticeships in England, a Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government *is* considered an approved course for Child Benefit eligibility, provided you meet the other criteria which, based on our conversation, you do.

I'm glad we were able to clarify that for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your help!

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit because Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes, unlike apprenticeships in England.
