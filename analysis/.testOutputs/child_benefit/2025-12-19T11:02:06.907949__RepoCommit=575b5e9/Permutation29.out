[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jordan and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Jordan, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently in approved education or training – for example, at college or doing an apprenticeship?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not. I finished my GCSEs last year but I'm not in college or doing any training right now. I'm not really doing anything at the moment.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. To clarify, have you registered with any government-sponsored careers service, or with the armed forces? This would be things like a local careers advisor or a scheme to help you find work.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't registered with any careers service or the armed forces. I haven't really looked into any of that stuff yet.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so open. Just one final question to help me assess eligibility: are you currently living with either of your parents?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I live with my dad, Steve.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided – you are 17, not currently in education or training, haven’t registered with a careers service, and live with your father – it appears you are not currently eligible for Child Benefit. This is because Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 16, unless they are continuing in approved education or training. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on benefits for young people who aren't in education or training?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit based on my age (17), not being in education/training, and not having registered with a careers service or similar program.
