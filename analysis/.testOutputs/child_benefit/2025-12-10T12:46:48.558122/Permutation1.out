[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "Hi there! I'm hoping you can help me understand if I'm eligible for Child Benefit. My name is Sarah, I'm 34 and live in Manchester with my husband Tom (who's 36) and our 8-year-old son Leo. We're both UK nationals. Tom works as a teacher earning \u00a335,000 a year, and I work part-time making about \u00a315,000. I'm wondering if we qualify for Child Benefit payments?", "we_are_done_here": "false"}

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s start with the first question.

Could you please confirm who is responsible for Leo?
