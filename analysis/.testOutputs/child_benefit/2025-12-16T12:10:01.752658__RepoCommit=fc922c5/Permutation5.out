[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mark and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Mark. Thank you for reaching out. To start, could you tell me, are you currently responsible for the care of Lucas?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am responsible for Lucas. I'm divorced from my ex-wife Jenny, and while Lucas lives with her full-time, I contribute £150 per month specifically for his food and clothes.

[root_agent]: Okay, Mark. Thank you for clarifying that. And just to confirm, Lucas is 10 years old, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Lucas is 10 years old.

[root_agent]: Alright. Now, could you tell me, do you currently live with Lucas?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't live with Lucas. As I mentioned, he lives full-time with his ex-wife Jenny since our divorce, but I do provide that monthly financial support of £150 specifically for his needs.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mark. Just one more question for now. Are there any other adults currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucas?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Jenny isn't claiming Child Benefit for Lucas. That's part of why I'm asking about my eligibility to claim it.

[root_agent]: Okay, Mark. Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re responsible for Lucas, he’s 10 years old, you don’t live with him, and no one else is claiming Child Benefit for him – you appear to be eligible. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding your eligibility or the application process?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news. Just to be clear, even though I don't live with Lucas, I'm still eligible because of the financial support I provide, correct? And how much would I be eligible to receive for him?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s correct, Mark. Your financial support for Lucas, exceeding the Child Benefit rate, does indeed qualify you for the benefit, even though he lives with his mother.

The current Child Benefit rate is approximately £113 per month. However, due to your contribution of £150, you would receive the full £113.

Would you like me to explain the application process further, or perhaps direct you to the relevant government website for more detailed information?

[evaluation_judge]: That sounds great. I'd appreciate if you could explain the application process to me. Also, is there anything I should know about who has priority for claiming? If Jenny decides she wants to claim in the future, what happens to my claim?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s go through the application process. You can apply for Child Benefit online through the government website: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit). You’ll need to provide details about yourself and Lucas, including your National Insurance number and Lucas’s date of birth. You’ll also need to declare your income.

Regarding priority, as we discussed, if Jenny were to claim Child Benefit in the future, *she* would have priority as the person Lucas lives with. However, your existing claim would not be automatically cancelled. You could still claim Child Benefit for Lucas, but it’s possible the amount received would be reduced or potentially cease altogether if Jenny’s claim is higher.

Do you want me to elaborate on any specific part of the application process, such as the documentation you might need to provide?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really helpful, thank you. So if Jenny decides to claim in the future, she would have priority since Lucas lives with her, and my claim might be reduced or stopped. I understand. 

For the application process, what kind of documentation would I need to provide to show that I'm contributing financially to Lucas's upkeep? Would I need bank statements showing the transfers to Jenny, or would I need something from her confirming the arrangement?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Mark. To demonstrate your financial contribution, providing bank statements showing the £150 monthly transfers to Jenny would be the most straightforward and compelling evidence. These statements clearly show the regular payments you’re making.

While it wouldn’t hurt to have a written agreement or letter from Jenny confirming the arrangement – perhaps outlining the purpose of the payments – bank statements are generally accepted as sufficient proof. It’s always best to have documentation to support your claim.

Would you like me to provide a link to the government’s guidance on what documentation is required for Child Benefit applications? [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/applying-and-proving-your-entitlement](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/applying-and-proving-your-entitlement)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that link would be helpful. I'll make sure I have my bank statements ready that show the regular payments to Jenny. One last question - if I start receiving Child Benefit, should I continue making the full £150 payment to Jenny, or would it be appropriate to reduce it since I'd be getting £113 specifically for Lucas?

[root_agent]: That’s a smart consideration, Mark. You should continue making the full £150 payment to Jenny. Receiving Child Benefit doesn’t change the agreement you have with her regarding Lucas’s upkeep. The £113 Child Benefit payment is intended to cover basic needs, and the £150 you’re providing ensures Lucas receives the additional support he needs for food and clothing – which goes above and beyond what Child Benefit would cover.

It’s important to maintain the existing arrangement you’ve established.

Is there anything else I can assist you with today regarding your Child Benefit claim?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. I'll keep making the full payment to Jenny as agreed. I think that covers all my questions about eligibility and the process. Thanks for your help with this - it's good to know I can claim Child Benefit to help support Lucas even though he doesn't live with me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Mark! I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. It’s reassuring to know you’ll be able to claim Child Benefit to support Lucas. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a wonderful day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit. They accurately identified that despite not living with my son, I qualify because I contribute financially (£150/month) to his upkeep, which exceeds the Child Benefit amount. They also correctly noted that since the child's mother isn't claiming the benefit, I am eligible to claim.
