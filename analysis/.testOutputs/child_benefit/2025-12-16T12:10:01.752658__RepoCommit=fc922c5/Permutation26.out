[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me, is Mo contributing the full £26.05 amount personally?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I only pay £15 per week. My son Zahid is 15 and lives with his aunt. I send the aunt £15 a week to help with his costs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. To help me determine your eligibility, could you tell me, can contributions from multiple people be combined?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I'm not sure about the rules honestly. As I mentioned, I send £15 per week to my son's aunt for Zahid's care. My mother - Zahid's grandmother - also sends £15 per week to the aunt to help support him. So in total, the aunt receives £30 per week from our family for Zahid. Does that information help?

[root_agent]: That’s very helpful information, thank you. Just to confirm, are you asking about Child Benefit for Zahid?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm wondering if I can claim Child Benefit for my son Zahid, who lives with his aunt. As I mentioned, I send £15 a week to support him, and my mother also sends £15 a week. The aunt doesn't claim the benefit herself. I just want to know if I'm eligible to claim it.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me, is Mo contributing the full £26.05 amount personally?

[evaluation_judge]: No, as I mentioned before, I personally contribute £15 per week for Zahid. My mother contributes another £15 per week, so together we send £30 per week to Zahid's aunt for his care.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail. Just to be completely clear, are you the parent of Zahid?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am Zahid's father. He's 15 years old now and living with his aunt, but I'm still his parent.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me, is Zahid living with his aunt on a regular basis?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Zahid lives with his aunt on a regular basis. That's his permanent home now, but I remain involved in his life and support him financially with the weekly payments I send.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you’ve provided, are you currently employed?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am employed. I work full-time, which is how I'm able to send the £15 per week to support Zahid.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. To help me determine your eligibility, could you tell me, do you have any other dependents?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Zahid is my only child. I don't have any other dependents.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me – that Zahid lives with his aunt, you are his father, you are employed, you contribute £15 per week, and you have no other dependents – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding your eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! I wasn't sure if I would be eligible since Zahid doesn't live with me and I only contribute £15 personally, with my mother contributing the other £15. So just to be clear, even though my personal contribution is only £15, the combined £30 from both me and my mother is enough to qualify me for the Child Benefit? Is there anything specific I need to do to apply?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question! Yes, the combined £30 from you and your mother is sufficient to meet the contribution requirements for Child Benefit under those circumstances. You can apply online through the government website – there’s no need to post an application. Would you like me to reiterate the link to the Child Benefit eligibility criteria, or would you prefer to explore the online application process directly?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to go ahead with the application process directly, if that's possible. Is there anything specific I should mention in the application about the fact that both my mother and I contribute to Zahid's care? And do you know if I'll need to provide any proof of these payments to his aunt?

[root_agent]: That’s perfectly understandable. When you apply online, you’ll need to provide details about all contributors, including your mother. You can simply state that she is also contributing £15 per week towards Zahid’s care. As for proof of payments, the government typically accepts bank statements or direct debit confirmations. You don't need to formally provide proof *to* his aunt, but having those records readily available is a good idea in case they request them. Would you like me to direct you to any specific sections on the application form that relate to contributors?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit since the combined contributions from myself and my mother (£30) exceed the required threshold of £26.05, even though my individual contribution is only £15 per week.
