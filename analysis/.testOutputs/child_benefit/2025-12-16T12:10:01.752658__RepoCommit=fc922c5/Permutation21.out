[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a user seeking benefit information based on this scenario.

Hi, i'm Robert and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Robert, it’s nice to speak with you. To help me assess your eligibility for a benefit, could you tell me, are you responsible for a child?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am responsible for my son Sam who's 10 years old. He lives with me. My ex-wife Tina and I recently divorced, and our daughter Ella lives with her mother.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Since Sam lives with you, and you’re responsible for him, let’s talk about the rates. Who gets the higher “Eldest Child” rate (£26.05)?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure exactly how that works. Since my son Sam lives with me and my daughter Ella lives with her mother, we're both claiming separately for the children who live with us. Sam is my only child in the household - does that affect which rate I would get?

[root_agent]: That’s a really important detail, thank you for explaining. Given that you and your ex-wife are claiming separately for the children, and Sam is the only child living with you, would you agree that you are entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for Sam?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense to me, but I wasn't sure if I'd get the full eldest child rate since we have two children between us, just living in different households. So I would get the full £26.05 rate for Sam even though my ex-wife is also claiming for our daughter separately?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit on a key point – it does indeed make sense. The guidance specifically states that if families split up and children are divided between parents, each parent is entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for the eldest child in their specific household. They don’t have to settle for the lower “additional child” rate for the younger sibling. 

So, to confirm, you are eligible for the full £26.05 Child Benefit rate for Sam?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's good to know! So yes, I would be eligible for the full £26.05 Child Benefit rate for Sam, and I understand that my ex-wife would also be eligible for the same rate for Ella since she's the eldest (and only) child in her household. Thank you for confirming that.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could clarify things for you. It sounds like you’re both eligible for the full Child Benefit rate for your children. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding this benefit or anything else at all?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that both parents are eligible for the full "eldest child" rate of £26.05, matching the expected outcome that both parents receive the higher rate when children are split between households after divorce.
