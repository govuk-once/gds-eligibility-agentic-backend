[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by roleplaying as Tom or Jerry to test the agent's knowledge about Child Benefit backdating rules. I'll engage until the agent provides an eligibility determination, then evaluate if they correctly explain the 3-month backdating limitation.

Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay Tom, I understand. Let’s start with the basics. Was the child eligible for Child Benefit during the past 4 months?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, our baby was born 4 months ago. We're both British citizens living here in the UK, but with everything that comes with having a newborn, we completely forgot to apply for Child Benefit until now. I'm worried we might have lost out on some payments. Can you tell me if we're still eligible and if we can get the money for those first few months?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Tom. It’s completely understandable that things get hectic with a new baby.

To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me: Was the child eligible for Child Benefit during the past 4 months?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, our child has been eligible for Child Benefit since birth. We meet all the requirements - we live in the UK, our baby lives with us, and neither of us earn over £60,000 annually. We just didn't submit the application until now because we were overwhelmed with the new baby. I'm mainly concerned about whether we've missed out on those first few months of payments since we're only applying now, 4 months after the birth.

[root_agent]: Okay, Tom, thank you for providing that detailed information. It’s good to know the child has been eligible all along. 

Now, to address your concern about those first few months, how far back can a new claim go?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure exactly. That's what I was hoping you could tell me. How far back can Child Benefit claims be backdated? Will we be able to receive payments for all 4 months since our baby was born, or have we lost some of that money by not applying sooner?

[root_agent]: Child Benefit can be backdated, but there’s a limit. It can be backdated up to 3 months. 

So, in your case, since you’re applying 4 months after the birth, you wouldn’t receive payments for the first month. You’d be eligible for payments from the second month onwards. 

Does that make sense, Tom?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So we'll get payments backdated for 3 months, but we've unfortunately lost the first month's payment because we applied too late. That's a bit disappointing but at least we'll get most of it. Thank you for explaining that clearly.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Tom. I’m glad I could clarify things for you. It’s understandable to be a little disappointed, but it’s good to know you’ll receive payments for the last three months. 

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your application or Child Benefit today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all I needed to know today. I'll get our application completed right away to avoid losing any more payments. Thanks for your help!

✓ The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit can only be backdated for 3 months, meaning we would lose the first month's payment but still receive the last three months, which matches the expected outcome.
