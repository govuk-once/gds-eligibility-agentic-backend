[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Laura and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s start by gathering some information.

Could you tell me, is the child, Simon, currently in custody or hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my son Simon is currently in a secure psychiatric unit. He's 15 years old and has been detained under the Mental Health Act. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. That’s helpful.

Now, could you tell me which timeline applies – is it approximately 8 weeks or 12 weeks since he entered the secure psychiatric unit?

[evaluation_judge]: He's been in the secure psychiatric unit for about 10 weeks now. The doctors say he needs more time for treatment and observation.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Since the doctors are saying he needs more time for treatment and observation, we’ll consider the 12-week timeframe. 

Based on this, it sounds like Simon *is* potentially eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to explain why, or would you like to move on to a different aspect of his situation?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd appreciate if you could explain why he's eligible, please. I wasn't sure if we'd still get Child Benefit while he's in the psychiatric unit.

[root_agent]: Certainly. According to the guidance I’ve reviewed (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), Child Benefit can continue to be paid while a child is in hospital or residential care, including a secure psychiatric unit. The key factor is that it’s considered medical treatment, and the 12-week rule applies in these circumstances, rather than the 8-week ‘Care’ or ‘Custody’ rules.

Because Simon is receiving treatment in a secure unit under the Mental Health Act, and has been there for approximately 10 weeks, he *is* eligible for Child Benefit for now, up to a maximum of 12 weeks. 

Do you have any questions about this explanation, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so since he's been there for 10 weeks and the limit is 12 weeks, we're still eligible for Child Benefit at this point. What happens if his stay extends beyond 12 weeks? Would we lose eligibility then?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good and important question. Yes, you would likely lose eligibility for Child Benefit if Simon’s stay in the secure psychiatric unit extends beyond 12 weeks.

The guidance states that Child Benefit automatically stops being paid after 12 weeks of medical treatment. Following those 12 weeks, you would need to re-apply based on the usual eligibility criteria (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility).

Is there anything else regarding the potential impact of his stay that you’d like to discuss, or would you like to move on to a different aspect of his circumstances?

[evaluation_judge]: That's really helpful, thank you. So to be clear, we'll continue receiving Child Benefit for the next 2 weeks (until the 12-week mark), and then if he's still in the unit after that, the benefit will stop. Would we need to notify the Child Benefit office about this change when we reach the 12-week point, or does it happen automatically?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit upon a crucial detail! You are absolutely correct. Child Benefit *does* automatically stop being paid after 12 weeks of medical treatment.

You do *not* need to notify the Child Benefit office when the 12-week period ends. The payment will simply cease automatically.

To summarise: you’ll continue receiving Child Benefit for the next two weeks, and then it will stop automatically.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Simon’s Child Benefit eligibility, or would you like to explore a different aspect of his situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for clarifying that. I think I understand the situation now - we're eligible for Child Benefit while Simon is in the psychiatric unit, but only up to the 12-week mark, at which point it will automatically stop. If his situation changes after that, I suppose I should contact the Child Benefit office again. That's all I needed to know about this particular benefit for now.

✓ The agent correctly determined that Child Benefit is eligible until the 12-week mark is reached, which matches the expected outcome. The agent accurately explained that this is because psychiatric units under the Mental Health Act are treated as hospital/residential accommodation with a 12-week rule.
