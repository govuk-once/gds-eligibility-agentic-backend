[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Mark and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Mark. I understand you’d like to explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, and to help me understand your situation, could you tell me – are you currently responsible for Lucas?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am responsible for my son Lucas. He's 10 and lives with my ex-wife Jenny, but I send £150 per month to her specifically for Lucas's food and clothes.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mark. It’s good to know you’re actively contributing to Lucas’s wellbeing. Just to clarify, since Lucas lives with your ex-wife, Jenny, does she currently claim Child Benefit for him?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Jenny doesn't claim Child Benefit for Lucas. That's why I'm wondering if I could claim it instead, since I'm contributing financially to his upkeep.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. Given that Jenny isn’t claiming Child Benefit for Lucas, and you’re making a significant financial contribution – £150 per month – towards his food and clothes, let’s consider the residency rules. To help me assess this, could you tell me – does Lucas live with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Lucas doesn't live with me. He lives full-time with Jenny, my ex-wife. But as I mentioned, I do send £150 every month specifically for Lucas's needs.

[root_agent]: Right, thank you for clarifying. So, Lucas lives with Jenny, and you’re providing financial support. Let’s shift our focus then. Considering your financial contribution and Lucas’s living situation, I want to double-check something. Does anyone else currently claim Child Benefit for Lucas?

[evaluation_judge]: No, nobody is currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucas. Jenny doesn't claim it, and I haven't claimed it either.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s excellent information, Mark. It seems we’ve covered all the key points. Based on what you’ve told me – that you’re responsible for Lucas, he lives with your ex-wife, and no one else is claiming Child Benefit for him – you *are* likely eligible. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss regarding your eligibility or the process of claiming?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! I just want to make sure I understand - so even though Lucas doesn't live with me, I'm still eligible because I contribute financially to his upkeep and no one else is claiming the benefit? Do I need any specific documentation to show the money I send to Jenny for Lucas?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s absolutely correct, Mark. You’re right to want to confirm that. You *are* eligible for Child Benefit even though Lucas doesn’t live with you, primarily because you're taking on significant financial responsibility for him, and no one else is claiming the benefit.

Regarding documentation, the government generally accepts proof of your contribution. While they don’t specifically require a formal agreement, providing evidence of the £150 you send to Jenny each month would strengthen your claim. Bank statements showing the transfer, or perhaps a letter from Jenny confirming the amount and its purpose, would be helpful. It’s always a good idea to have something to demonstrate your financial commitment.

Would you like me to elaborate on what types of documentation might be most useful, or would you like to proceed with exploring how to actually apply for Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd appreciate knowing how to apply for Child Benefit. Should I complete a specific form? And will I need to get something in writing from Jenny confirming that she's not claiming the benefit?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s talk about applying for Child Benefit. Currently, you apply online through the government website – it’s the quickest and easiest way. You can find the application form here: https://www.gov.uk/apply-child-benefit

The application doesn’t require a specific form; it’s a straightforward online process. You’ll need to provide information about yourself, Lucas, and Jenny.

Regarding a letter from Jenny, while not strictly mandatory, it would be very helpful to confirm she isn't claiming Child Benefit. It adds further reassurance to your application. A simple, dated letter confirming this would be sufficient.

Would you like me to guide you through the steps of completing the online application, or would you like me to provide some more details about the information you’ll need to gather before starting the application?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand how to apply now. Thank you for clarifying that I am eligible for Child Benefit even though Lucas doesn't live with me, since I contribute financially to his upkeep and no one else is claiming the benefit. I'll gather my documents and complete the online application. Thanks for your help!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Mark! I’m delighted we could clarify your eligibility and that you’re now equipped to apply. It’s fantastic that you’re taking this step. If you do have any further questions during the application process, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a great day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for Child Benefit despite my son living with my ex-wife, recognizing my significant financial contribution (£150/month) and the fact that no one else is claiming the benefit.
