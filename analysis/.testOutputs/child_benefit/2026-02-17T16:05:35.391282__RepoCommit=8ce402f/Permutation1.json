Based on the information you've provided, **you would be eligible to apply for Child Benefit** for your son.\n\nYou meet all the key eligibility requirements:\n- Your son is 8 years old (under 16)\n- You are responsible for his day-to-day care\n- He lives with you at home\n- You normally live in the UK\n\n**Important points to note:**\n\n- Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, so you and your husband will need to decide which one of you will make the claim.\n\n- If either you or your husband has an individual income over \u00a350,000, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge (a tax charge). However, this doesn't affect your eligibility to claim - you can still claim Child Benefit even with a higher income.\n\nYou can proceed with making an application for Child Benefit for your son."

They have a qualifying child: Their son is 8 years old, which is under 16 years of age, meeting the age requirement.\n\n2. They are responsible for the child: The applicant confirmed they are responsible for their son's day-to-day care (feeding, clothing, and caring for him).\n\n3. The child lives with them: Their son lives at home with them and is not in hospital or care. He attends primary school, which is normal and does not affect eligibility.\n\n4. They normally live in the UK: The applicant confirmed they live in Manchester and are UK nationals.\n\nAll the fundamental eligibility requirements from the gov.uk guidance are satisfied. The applicant (or their husband) should be eligible to claim Child Benefit for their son. Note that only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, so if both parents are responsible, they will need to decide who claims. Additionally, if either parent has an individual income over \u00a350,000, they may be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge, but this does not affect eligibility to claim - it's a separate tax consideration."
