[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "Hello! I'm looking for some information about Child Benefit. My husband and I have a son and I want to know if we're eligible to claim this benefit.", "we_are_done_here": "false"}

[root_agent]: Hello! I’m happy to help you with that.

To start, could you tell me, is the child under 16, or under 20 and in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "Yes, our son Leo is 8 years old and he's in primary school.", "we_are_done_here": "false"}

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

Now, to ensure we’ve covered all the bases, could you tell me, is the applicant responsible for the child?

[evaluation_judge]: {"response": "Yes, I'm responsible for Leo. He lives with us full-time - with me and my husband Tom.", "we_are_done_here": "false"}
