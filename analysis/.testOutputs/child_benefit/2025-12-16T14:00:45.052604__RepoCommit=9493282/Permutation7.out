[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of David who is inquiring about child benefit eligibility for his son who is in care but visits him on weekends.

Hi, i'm David and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello David, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me, is the applicant – that’s you – responsible for Jack?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am responsible for Jack. He's my son. He's currently in local authority care, but he comes home to stay with me every weekend.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. And just to be clear, is Jack of eligible age for Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Jack is 14 years old.

[root_agent]: Alright. Now, I need to check on the length of time Jack has been in care. Has the child been in care for more than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's been in local authority care for about 3 months now, so that's definitely more than 8 weeks.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Finally, could you tell me if Jack spends at least 2 nights in a row or 24 hours a week at your home?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he does. Jack comes to stay with me every weekend. He arrives on Friday evening and stays until Sunday evening, so that's 2 nights in a row each weekend.

[root_agent]: Okay, David. Based on your answers, it seems you might be eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'd appreciate if you could explain why I'm eligible despite Jack being in care.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Because Jack spends at least 2 nights in a row at your home – arriving Friday evening and leaving Sunday evening – you are still entitled to Child Benefit, even though he’s in local authority care. The rules typically stop payments after 8 weeks, but this exception applies in situations like yours. 

Do you have any questions about this or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: That's good to hear. I was worried I might not be eligible since he's been in care for over 8 weeks now. So just to be clear, I can continue receiving Child Benefit as long as he keeps coming home for weekends and stays those two nights in a row?

[root_agent]: That’s correct, David. As long as Jack continues to spend at least two nights in a row at your home each weekend, you should continue to receive Child Benefit payments. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding this or any other benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. I'm relieved that I can continue receiving the benefit. Thank you for clarifying this for me.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for Child Benefit through the exception for children who spend at least 2 nights in a row at home, despite my son being in care for more than 8 weeks.
