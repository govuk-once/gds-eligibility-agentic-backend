[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of a parent in this situation and engage with the agent under test about child benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Pete and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Pete, it’s nice to meet you. To help me understand your situation, could you tell me how old your daughter, Holly, is?

[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Holly is 9 years old. I'm trying to figure out if I can claim Child Benefit for her. Her mum Sue and I are separated, and Holly stays with me 3 days a week and with her mum 4 days a week. We both buy her clothes and food and things like that.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. It sounds like you and Sue are sharing responsibility for Holly. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me – are two people responsible for the same child?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both Sue and I are responsible for Holly. We're separated but we both take care of her. I have her 3 days a week and Sue has her 4 days a week. We both provide for her needs like clothes and food. We just can't agree on who should be claiming the Child Benefit.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Since both you and Sue are responsible for Holly, could I ask – can both of you receive the Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't think so, but that's what I'm trying to figure out. Sue and I have both submitted claims to HMRC because we can't agree on who should get it. I know Holly is with me 3 days and with Sue 4 days each week, but I still contribute a lot to her care and expenses. Is it possible for both of us to receive the benefit, or does it have to be just one of us?

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand that you’re both contributing significantly to Holly’s care. To help me determine eligibility, could you tell me who Holly lives with more often?

[evaluation_judge]: Holly lives with Sue 4 days a week and with me 3 days a week. So she does spend slightly more time at Sue's place than mine.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Considering that Holly spends slightly more time with Sue, could I ask – do you currently work or are you receiving any income?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I work full-time as an electrician. I have a steady income but of course having the Child Benefit would help with Holly's expenses during the days she stays with me. Does my income affect whether I can claim Child Benefit for Holly?

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. To help me assess your situation fully, could you tell me – is Holly living with you permanently, or does she move between your home and Sue’s home regularly?

[evaluation_judge]: Holly moves between our homes regularly. It's a set arrangement where she stays with me 3 days a week (usually Friday, Saturday, Sunday) and then with Sue 4 days a week (Monday through Thursday). We've had this arrangement for about two years now since we separated.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know about the regular arrangement. Just to confirm, does Holly stay in one household for the entire week, or does she split her time between both of yours?

[evaluation_judge]: No, she definitely splits her time between both households each week. It's a consistent pattern - she stays with Sue Monday through Thursday (4 days) and with me Friday through Sunday (3 days). This happens every week - she goes back and forth between our two homes.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Given this arrangement, and that Holly spends more time with Sue, I need to check a specific rule. Could you tell me – does Holly receive any medical treatment or care in either of your homes?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Holly doesn't receive any special medical treatment or care in either of our homes. She's a healthy 9-year-old. We both take her to regular check-ups and such, but there's no ongoing medical care needed at home.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – that two people are responsible for the child, she spends more time with Sue, and she doesn't receive any specific medical treatment or care at home – I need to consult the eligibility criteria. 

Could you please confirm your postcode for me?

[evaluation_judge]: My postcode is ME15 6RT. I live in Maidstone, Kent.

[root_agent]: Thank you. I’m now checking the Child Benefit eligibility criteria based on your postcode and the details we’ve discussed.

Okay, I’ve reviewed the information. Based on the rules regarding dual responsibility, priority based on where the child lives most of the time, and your postcode, it appears you are **not** eligible for Child Benefit.

Essentially, because Holly spends more time with Sue, HMRC would typically award the benefit to her.

Do you have any questions about this decision, or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear, but I appreciate you explaining. So even though I have Holly 3 days a week and contribute to her expenses, because she spends 4 days with Sue, the benefit would go to her? Is there any way we could share the benefit or is it strictly one parent only?

[root_agent]: You are correct to be disappointed, and I understand your frustration. As I explained, the rules state that when two parents are responsible for a child, the benefit goes to the parent who has the child living with them the majority of the time. 

Unfortunately, there isn’t a mechanism to share the benefit between two parents in this situation. It’s strictly one parent or guardian who can claim. 

I’m sorry I couldn’t offer more positive news. Would you like me to reiterate any of the criteria we discussed to ensure you fully understand the reasoning behind the decision?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. No need to explain further. So HMRC will likely give the benefit to Sue since Holly lives with her 4 days versus my 3 days. That makes sense even though it's frustrating. Thanks for helping me understand the situation.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Pete. I’m glad I could help clarify the situation for you. If you have any other questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I (Pete) am not eligible for Child Benefit since the child spends more days with her mother (Sue) and HMRC would award it to the parent with whom the child lives most of the time.
