[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you test the agent by playing the role of someone seeking information about their child benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Lisa and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Lisa, it’s good to speak with you. I understand you’re looking into your child benefit eligibility. To start, could you tell me, is the child living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's not living with me at the moment. My son Mark is 15 and he's been sentenced to a youth custody center for 6 months now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Lisa. I understand Mark is 15 and currently in a youth custody center for 6 months, and that he’s been detained for 10 weeks.

Just to be clear, is Mark currently in custody or prison?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he is currently in a youth custody center. He's been there for 10 weeks now. I was receiving Child Benefit for him before this happened, and I'm wondering if I'm still eligible.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that Mark is in a youth custody center. I want to check on something specifically related to the time he’s been there. Has Mark been in custody for more than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he has been in custody for 10 weeks now. That's why I'm asking about the Child Benefit - I want to know if I'm still eligible to receive it.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Mark has been in custody for 10 weeks, which is indeed longer than 8 weeks.

To help me determine your eligibility, could you confirm whether the child is living with the applicant?

[evaluation_judge]: No, as I mentioned earlier, Mark is not living with me right now. He's been in the youth custody center for the past 10 weeks as part of his 6-month sentence.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that the child is not living with you. I appreciate your patience as we go through this.

Just one more question to help me assess the situation – is the child currently in hospital or care?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's not in hospital or care - he's specifically in a youth custody center because he was sentenced there. He's been there for 10 weeks out of his 6-month sentence.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that Mark is in a youth custody center due to a sentence and isn’t currently in hospital or care.

Based on the information you’ve provided, I’ve determined that you are likely not eligible for Child Benefit at this time. As per the rules, Child Benefit generally stops being paid after 8 weeks of a child being in custody.

Do you have any questions about this decision, or would you like me to explain the criteria in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit since my son has been in custody for more than 8 weeks (10 weeks), which exceeds the 8-week limit for continued eligibility.
