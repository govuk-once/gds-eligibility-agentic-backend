[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Rashid and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. To start, could you tell me if Rashid is currently in approved education – for example, is he still studying?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently in full-time education. I'm doing my A-Levels at the moment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now, I’d like to ask, is Rashid married or in a civil partnership?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I recently got married to my girlfriend. She's also 17 and she's moved into my parents' house where I live.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. And to help me assess eligibility fully, could you tell me if Rashid lives with you and relies on you for support?

[evaluation_judge]: Sorry, I think there's a bit of confusion. I am Rashid. I live with my parents and yes, I rely on them for support. My father wants to know if he can continue claiming Child Benefit for me.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Just to be certain, are you saying that Rashid lives with his parents and they provide for him?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm Rashid, I live with my parents, and they provide for me. My wife has also moved into my parents' house with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Given this situation, I’d like to ask: does your father financially support your wife as well?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my father doesn't financially support my wife. She gets some support from her own parents.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me – that Rashid is in full-time education, married, lives with his parents who provide for him, and his father doesn’t support his wife – it appears he may be eligible for Child Benefit under a specific exception. Would you like me to explain the exception in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the exception in more detail. I'd like to know if my father can continue claiming Child Benefit for me.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Normally, if a child is married or in a civil partnership, they cannot claim Child Benefit. However, there’s an exception that applies if they live with the person claiming and rely on them for support, *and* the claimant isn’t financially supporting their spouse. Because your father is providing for you both, and doesn’t support your wife, he may be eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit for you.

Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit confused because you said two different things. First you said there's an exception if my father isn't financially supporting my wife (which he isn't), but then you said "because your father is providing for you both" which implies he is supporting my wife. To be clear, my father supports me, but not my wife - she gets support from her own parents. Can my father continue to claim Child Benefit for me in this situation?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to point that out - my apologies for the confusion. Thank you for clarifying.

Let’s go back to the core of the exception. It applies when the child lives with the claimant and relies on them for support, *and* the claimant isn’t financially supporting their spouse. Since your father supports *you*, and your wife receives support from her own parents, the exception *does* apply.

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, Rashid *is* likely eligible for Child Benefit.

Would you like me to confirm that, or would you like me to explain any part of this more clearly?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming. So my father can continue to claim Child Benefit for me even though I'm married, because I live with him, he supports me, and he doesn't financially support my wife. That's good news.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help clarify things and that the news is positive for your father. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for the information.

✓ The agent correctly determined that Rashid's father is eligible to claim Child Benefit via the exception for married children who live with and depend on the claimant, while the spouse is not being financially supported by the claimant.
