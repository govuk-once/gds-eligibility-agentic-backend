[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me how old your child is?

[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Emma is 18 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And is Emma currently in education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she's just started a 3-year Bachelor's degree at university. She still lives at home with me and commutes to the university daily.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, would you describe this education as "approved education" (like A-Levels or NVQ Level 3) or “advanced education” (like a university degree)?

[evaluation_judge]: It's advanced education - she's doing a Bachelor's degree at university.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Unfortunately, as Emma is now undertaking advanced education – a university degree – she is no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit typically stops when a child starts advanced education. I hope this information is helpful. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Is there any other benefit I might be eligible for since she's still living at home with me?

[root_agent]: That's a good question. However, my current knowledge is limited to assessing eligibility for Child Benefit. I'm not equipped to advise on other benefits you might be eligible for. 

You could explore the benefits available on the government website: https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits.

Would you like me to reiterate the Child Benefit eligibility criteria for clarity?

[evaluation_judge]: No thank you, that's fine. I understand now that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since Emma is in advanced education at university. Thank you for your help.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah. I'm glad I could clarify things for you. If you have any other questions in the future, feel free to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter is in advanced education (university degree), which matches the expected outcome in the prompt.
