[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Alice and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Alice, it’s good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and whether you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me if you are responsible for a child under 16?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a son named Tom who is 14 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Alice. Is Tom currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's not living with me right now. He has severe behavioral needs and has been placed in a residential school. The local council is paying for it, and he's been there for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Alice. Just to clarify, is this residential school providing care specifically because of Tom’s behavioral needs, or is it more focused on his education?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a residential school that specializes in children with behavioral needs like Tom's. So while he's getting education there, he's also receiving care for his behavioral needs. The local council agreed to fund his placement because of these specific needs.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Alice. Is the residential school a place where Tom is in "Care" arranged by a local authority, or is it "Residential Accommodation" specifically funded due to his behavioral needs? Knowing this will help me understand the rules that apply.

[evaluation_judge]: It's "Residential Accommodation" that's being funded by the local council specifically due to his behavioral needs. He's not in local authority care or foster care - he's in a specialized residential school setting.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Alice. Just so I have a clear understanding, could you confirm how many full weeks Tom has been at the residential school?

[evaluation_judge]: He's been there for 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Alice. Knowing this information is very helpful. Do you receive Child Benefit for Tom currently?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do still receive Child Benefit for Tom.

[root_agent]: Okay, Alice. Based on the information you've provided, as Tom is in Residential Accommodation due to his behavioral needs and has been there for 10 weeks – which is under the 12-week limit – you are currently still eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding Child Benefit or any other potential benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: So you're saying I'm still eligible for Child Benefit because Tom has been in the residential school for less than 12 weeks? What happens after the 12 weeks - will I lose eligibility then?

[root_agent]: You are exactly right, Alice. You are still eligible because Tom has been in the residential school for less than 12 weeks.

Regarding what happens after 12 weeks – yes, unfortunately, your eligibility for Child Benefit would likely stop once he’s been there for a full 12 weeks. The rules state that Child Benefit stops when a child is in residential care for more than 12 weeks. However, if his circumstances change before then, or if the local authority begins to arrange care for him, that could affect things, so it's worth keeping me updated.

Would you like me to explain anything further about the 12-week rule, or are you happy with this explanation?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that explanation is very clear. So I have about 2 more weeks of eligibility and then the Child Benefit will stop. I appreciate you explaining this to me. I don't have any other questions about this right now.

✓ The agent correctly informed me that I am eligible for Child Benefit as my son has been in residential accommodation for 10 weeks, which is under the 12-week limit.
