[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Raj, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me the age of the child you are claiming for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm claiming for my son Dev. He's currently 19 years old and is in full-time education studying for his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Raj. That's helpful. Is Dev currently in approved full-time education? (For example, is he taking A-levels at a school or college?)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Dev is studying for his A-levels at the local college. He's in full-time education there.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. Just to confirm, has Dev turned 20 yet?

[evaluation_judge]: No, not yet. He will be turning 20 in the middle of his current term though.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Raj. Just so I have a clear understanding, when Dev turns 20, will he still be *continuing* the same full-time education course (his A-levels)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he'll still be continuing with the same A-level course when he turns 20. He's due to finish the course at the end of the academic year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Raj. Based on the information you've provided, it sounds like you currently *are* eligible for Child Benefit. However, eligibility will cease on Dev's 20th birthday, even though he is still in full-time education. 

Do you have any other questions about this, or would you like me to explain this further?

[evaluation_judge]: So you're saying I'll receive Child Benefit up until Dev's 20th birthday, but then it will stop? Even though he's still studying the same A-level course?

[root_agent]: You are exactly right, Raj. That’s correct. You will receive Child Benefit up until Dev’s 20th birthday. Even though he’s still studying the same A-level course, Child Benefit eligibility ends on their 20th birthday, regardless of whether they are still in education. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining that to me.

✓ The agent correctly explained that my son is currently eligible for Child Benefit but will no longer be eligible once he turns 20, even though he'll still be studying. This matches the expected outcome.
