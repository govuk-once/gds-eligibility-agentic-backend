[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Liam's mother Jessica to test the agent's understanding of Child Benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Jessica and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Jessica, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm asking about my son Liam, who's 18 years old. He lives with me and is currently studying for his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Jessica. That's helpful.

Is Liam currently receiving any benefits in his own right, such as Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Liam is currently receiving Universal Credit. He's estranged from his father and doesn't have any income of his own, so he was able to claim Universal Credit to help with his personal living costs while he's studying.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Jessica. 

Just to be clear, is Liam studying an approved course of education? (For example, A-levels are an approved course).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's studying for his A-levels. It's an approved course of education at the local sixth form college.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Jessica.

Based on the information you've provided – Liam being 18, receiving Universal Credit, and studying for his A-levels – unfortunately, you are not eligible to receive Child Benefit for him. This is because Child Benefit stops when a child starts receiving Universal Credit in their own right.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. I wasn't aware that him getting Universal Credit would affect my Child Benefit. That clarifies things for me. I don't have any other questions right now, thank you.

✓ The agent correctly identified that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because my son receives Universal Credit in his own right, which matches the expected outcome provided in the scenario.
