[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a person named Kevin who is trying to determine his benefit eligibility regarding his child support situation.

Hi, i'm Kevin and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Kevin, it’s lovely to speak with you. I’m happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are enquiring about?





[evaluation_judge]: I have a daughter named Sarah who's 12 years old. I don't live with her, but I do support her financially.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Kevin. That's helpful.

You mentioned you don't live with Sarah. Do you contribute financially towards the costs of raising Sarah on a regular basis?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do contribute financially. I don't pay weekly maintenance, but every 4 weeks I buy a large bulk order of groceries and clothes for Sarah that costs around £120, and I deliver these directly to her mother's home.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Kevin. That’s good to know.

Just to confirm, this £120 worth of groceries and clothes is for Sarah’s use, and you provide this every four weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. Every four weeks I spend £120 on groceries and clothes specifically for Sarah, and I deliver them directly to her mother's house for Sarah's use.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Kevin. 

Do you receive any other benefits for Sarah, or is this the only financial support you provide?

[evaluation_judge]: This is the only financial support I provide. I don't receive any other benefits for Sarah.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Kevin. 

To be clear, are you currently responsible for any other children?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Sarah is my only child. I don't have any other children I'm responsible for.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Kevin. That’s helpful to know.

Finally, are you employed, or do you have any other sources of income? I only need to know this to assess eligibility, and it won’t affect any current benefits you may receive.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am employed. I work full-time at a local manufacturing company. That's my main source of income.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Kevin.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that you are employed, you do not live with your 12-year-old daughter Sarah, and you contribute £120 every four weeks towards her expenses – it appears you *may* be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To be absolutely certain, could you confirm your National Insurance number? Please be assured this information is kept confidential and is only used to verify your eligibility.

[evaluation_judge]: I don't actually have my National Insurance number with me right now. But I'm just trying to find out if I'm eligible for Child Benefit based on my situation with Sarah. Can you tell me if I would qualify given the support I provide?

[root_agent]: You are right to ask, Kevin. My apologies for jumping ahead and requesting your National Insurance number – I should have focused on confirming eligibility first.

Based on the information you’ve given me – that you contribute £120 every four weeks towards Sarah’s expenses – it does appear you meet the criteria to be considered eligible for Child Benefit, even though you don’t live with her and don’t pay weekly maintenance. This is because your contributions meet or exceed the weekly equivalent of the Child Benefit amount.

However, please be aware that final eligibility is determined by HMRC, and they may request further information. Would you like me to summarise the key points of your situation to help you when applying?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm eligible for Child Benefit based on my lump sum contributions of £120 every 4 weeks, which exceed the weekly threshold of £26.05.
