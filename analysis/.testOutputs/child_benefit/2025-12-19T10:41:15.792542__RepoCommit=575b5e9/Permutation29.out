[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jordan and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Jordan, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks Jordan. Are you currently in approved education or training? By 'approved education' we mean things like A-Levels, or a similar course.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not. I finished my GCSEs last year but I'm not in college or any training program right now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Have you registered with any government-sponsored careers service, or the armed forces, or started an apprenticeship or traineeship? This helps some 16 and 17 year olds continue to receive Child Benefit for longer.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't registered with any careers service or the armed forces. I'm not in an apprenticeship or traineeship either.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Jordan. Just to clarify, are you currently living with your father, Steve?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I live with my dad, Steve.

[root_agent]: Okay, thanks Jordan. Based on the information you've provided, as you are 17, not in approved education or training, and haven’t registered with a careers service or the armed forces, it seems you are not currently eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit. They accurately assessed that at 17, not in education or training, and without registering with careers services, I don't qualify, which matches the expected outcome.
