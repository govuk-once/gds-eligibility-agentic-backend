[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Robert and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Robert, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me - do you have any children?


[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a son named Sam who's 10 years old. He lives with me. I also have a daughter Ella who's 8, but she lives with my ex-wife Tina since we divorced recently.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Robert. Just to clarify, are you currently responsible for Sam's care and upbringing?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am fully responsible for Sam's care and upbringing since he lives with me full-time after the divorce. Tina is responsible for our daughter Ella.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's very helpful to know. Robert, are you currently receiving any benefits for Sam?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not receiving any benefits for Sam at the moment. That's why I wanted to check what I might be eligible for now that our family situation has changed.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Knowing that you aren't currently receiving benefits for Sam is useful. Robert, do you know if Tina is claiming Child Benefit for Ella?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe Tina is claiming Child Benefit for Ella. We're both making separate claims since the children live in different households after our divorce.

[root_agent]: Thanks for confirming that, Robert. Just to be clear, are *you* applying for Child Benefit specifically, or were you thinking about another benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm looking specifically into Child Benefit since I'm now Sam's primary caregiver after the divorce. I want to make sure I'm getting the right support for him.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. Robert, do you have a National Insurance number?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a National Insurance number.

[root_agent]: Great. And just to confirm, Robert, is Sam currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Sam is 10 years old and attending primary school full-time.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Robert. Finally, to help me assess your eligibility, what is your date of birth? You can just give me the day, month and year.

[evaluation_judge]: I was born on June 14, 1983.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Robert. Based on what you’ve told me – that you are responsible for Sam, he is 10 years old, in full-time education, and you have a National Insurance number – you are likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

Furthermore, because you and Tina have separated and each have one child living with you, you are both entitled to receive the higher rate of Child Benefit (£26.05 per week) for your eldest child in your respective households.

Would you like me to explain this further, or perhaps tell you where you can begin the application process?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! So I'll be getting the higher rate of £26.05 per week for Sam even though he's our second child? I just want to make sure I understand correctly since Ella is technically our eldest. But it sounds like since Sam is now the only child in my household, I get the higher rate. Is that right?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood perfectly, Robert! That is absolutely correct. Even though Ella is the eldest child overall, because of your separated family situation and Sam being the eldest child *in your household*, you are entitled to the higher rate of £26.05 per week for Sam.

The rules allow each parent to claim the full higher rate for the eldest child living with them when a family splits up. It doesn’t matter that Ella is older; it’s about which child is the eldest *in each individual household*.



Are you happy with this explanation, or would you like me to go over anything again?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very clear, thank you! So Tina will also get the higher rate for Ella, and I'll get the higher rate for Sam. That seems fair since we're both taking care of one child each. I think I understand everything now - I'll go ahead with the application process for Child Benefit. Thanks for your help!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Robert! I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. Yes, that’s exactly right – Tina will also receive the higher rate for Ella. It’s good to hear you feel confident moving forward with the application. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Good luck with your application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that I would be eligible for Child Benefit at the higher rate of £26.05 per week for Sam, even though he's not the eldest child overall, because he is the only/eldest child in my household. The agent also correctly confirmed that Tina would receive the higher rate for Ella, matching the expected outcome that both parents are eligible for the higher rate.
