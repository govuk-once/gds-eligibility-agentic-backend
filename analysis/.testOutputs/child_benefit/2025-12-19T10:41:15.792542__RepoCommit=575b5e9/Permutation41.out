[evaluation_judge]: I'll assume the role of a UK resident looking for benefit information and engage with the agent under test.

Hi, i'm Martin and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Martin, it's good to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, are you currently claiming Child Benefit for any children?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm claiming for my two children, Ben who's 10 and Jerry who's 8. They live with my ex-partner, and I contribute £40 per week towards their care.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Martin. 

Just to clarify, is the £40 per week you contribute specifically towards the costs of supporting Ben and Jerry, or is it a more general contribution?

[evaluation_judge]: It's specifically for supporting Ben and Jerry - I send that money to my ex-partner each week to help with their costs.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know. 

Do you have a formal, written agreement with your ex-partner detailing how the £40 per week is allocated between Ben and Jerry? For example, does it specify an amount for each child?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a formal written agreement. I just transfer £40 each week to help with both kids. There's no specific allocation between them.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Currently, how does HMRC treat your £40 weekly contribution towards Ben and Jerry's care? Do you know if they currently split it equally – so £20 for each child?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not actually sure how HMRC is currently treating my contribution. I assumed it would be split equally, but I don't know if that's how they're handling it. I'm trying to understand if I qualify for Child Benefit based on my contributions.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It's good you're checking.

To help me understand your situation better, are you currently *receiving* any Child Benefit payments for Ben and Jerry?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not currently receiving any Child Benefit payments for them. My ex-partner gets the Child Benefit, but I'm trying to understand if I could qualify based on my financial contributions.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Martin. So your ex-partner is currently claiming Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry.

To assess if you might be eligible, could you confirm if your ex-partner has informed HMRC about your financial contributions towards Ben and Jerry’s care?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure if my ex-partner has informed HMRC about my contributions. We don't really discuss those administrative details. I just make the payments to help support the kids.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's understandable.

Given that you contribute £40 per week, and HMRC may assume an equal split of that contribution, do you know roughly how much Child Benefit your ex-partner receives for each child per week? (The full amount for a first child is currently £26.05 and for a second child is £17.25). It doesn’t need to be exact – an estimate is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe my ex-partner gets the standard amounts - so that would be £26.05 for Ben as the eldest and £17.25 for Jerry. So £43.30 in total per week.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Martin. That's very helpful.

Based on the information you've provided, and if HMRC are applying an equal split to your £40 contribution, it appears you wouldn't currently meet the requirements to claim Child Benefit for Ben, as your contribution (£20) is less than the full amount of Child Benefit (£26.05). However, your contribution *would* cover the full amount of Child Benefit for Jerry (£17.25).

Would you be interested in exploring the possibility of requesting HMRC to consider an unequal split of your contribution – allocating a larger portion to Ben, and a smaller portion to Jerry? This is something you can ask them to do.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would definitely be interested in that! How would requesting an unequal split work? Could I ask them to allocate £26.05 to Ben and the remaining £13.95 to Jerry?

[root_agent]: Yes, you can absolutely ask them to do that, Martin! It's called requesting an unequal split of your contribution.

Essentially, you would need to contact HMRC and explain that you contribute £40 per week, and you would like them to allocate £26.05 to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry. Providing evidence of your payments, like bank statements, can be helpful.

If HMRC agree to this unequal split, it would mean you would meet the financial requirements to receive Child Benefit for Ben, and Jerry would still be covered by your remaining contribution.

Would you like me to explain how to contact HMRC to make this request?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please! I would appreciate knowing how to contact HMRC to request this unequal split. That sounds like it would really help my situation.

[root_agent]: Certainly! The best way to request an unequal split is to contact HMRC’s Family Capital Gains Unit. You can do this by writing to them at:

HMRC
Family Capital Gains Unit
PO Box 1
Bootle
Merseyside
L69 9BB

When you write to them, be sure to include:

*   Your National Insurance number
*   Your ex-partner’s National Insurance number (if known)
*   The children’s names and dates of birth
*   The amount you contribute each week (£40)
*   Your requested split (£26.05 for Ben and £13.95 for Jerry)
*   Evidence of your payments (e.g., bank statements)

It’s also a good idea to include a covering letter explaining your situation clearly.

Please be aware that HMRC will review your request and may ask for further information. It can take some time for them to process your request, so please be patient.



Is there anything else I can help you with today, Martin?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very clear, thank you. I'll write to them with all those details and request the split as you've described. Just to confirm - if they approve this unequal split, would I be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Ben but not for Jerry? Or would I get something for both?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Martin! I'm glad I could help clarify things.

If HMRC approves the unequal split as you requested – £26.05 to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry – you would be eligible to receive the full rate of Child Benefit for Ben. However, as your contribution of £13.95 wouldn’t cover the full amount of Child Benefit for Jerry (£17.25), you wouldn’t be eligible to claim for Jerry directly. Your ex-partner would continue to receive the Child Benefit for Jerry, as they are already claiming it.

Essentially, requesting the unequal split allows you to claim for Ben, where previously you couldn’t, while Jerry’s claim continues through your ex-partner.



Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So I'll be eligible for the full rate for Ben, and my ex-partner will continue receiving the benefit for Jerry. I appreciate your help in explaining all of this. I'll go ahead and write to HMRC with all the information you suggested.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Martin! I'm delighted I could help you understand your situation and the options available to you. 

I wish you the best of luck with your request to HMRC. If you have any further questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.

Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent gave the correct outcome: eligible for Child Benefit for Ben (full rate) but not eligible for Jerry by requesting an unequal split of the £40 contribution (£26.05 for Ben and £13.95 for Jerry). The agent properly explained the exception request process and accurately described how this would save one claim.
