[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Raj, a 50-year-old parent trying to understand if he's still eligible for Child Benefit for his son Dev who recently turned 20 while studying A-levels. I'll interact with the benefits agent until I receive an eligibility determination, then assess whether their conclusion matches the expected outcome (that Raj is not eligible once Dev turned 20).

Let me start the conversation as Raj:

Hello there. I've been receiving Child Benefit for my son Dev who's studying for his A-levels. He just turned 20 years old last month, but he's still in the middle of his course. I'm wondering if I can still receive Child Benefit for him?

[root_agent]: Hello Raj, thank you for reaching out. I understand you’re concerned about continuing to receive Child Benefit for your son Dev, now that he’s turned 20.

To start, could you tell me, is the child currently in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my son Dev is still studying full-time for his A-levels. He's been in the same course since before his birthday. He's working hard to complete his studies, but I wasn't sure if his recent birthday affects the benefit payments I receive for him.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that.

Now, could you tell me, is the child under 20?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he isn't under 20 anymore. Dev just turned 20 last month. He was 19 when he started this term, but his birthday was a few weeks ago.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Raj.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that Dev is currently in approved education and is now 20 years old – I must confirm that you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Once a child turns 20, they are no longer eligible, even if they are still completing their course.

Do you have any other questions about this, or would you like me to explain anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. So even though Dev is still studying his A-levels, the Child Benefit stops once he turned 20, regardless of him being in the middle of his course. That's helpful to know, though a bit disappointing. 

When would the payment officially stop? Would it be from his birthday, or is there a grace period?

[root_agent]: That’s completely understandable, Raj. It can be disappointing to learn about changes to benefits.

The payment would officially stop from the date he turned 20. There isn't a grace period – the eligibility ceases on his birthday.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining that the Child Benefit stops exactly on Dev's 20th birthday with no grace period. I'll adjust my finances accordingly.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Raj. I’m glad I could clarify that for you. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: I'll now evaluate the agent's performance based on the conversation:

The agent correctly determined that I (as Raj) am not eligible for Child Benefit for my son Dev. The agent clearly explained that:
1. Once a child turns 20, they are no longer eligible for Child Benefit
2. This applies even if the child is still in approved education
3. The benefit ceases exactly on the 20th birthday with no grace period

This determination perfectly matches the expected outcome from the scenario: "Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)."

The agent asked appropriate clarifying questions about education status and age before making the determination, and provided clear explanations about why the eligibility ends and when the payments would stop.
