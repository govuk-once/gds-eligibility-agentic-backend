[evaluation_judge]: I'll help evaluate the agent by role-playing as either Sarah or Tom seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll engage in dialogue until the agent provides an eligibility outcome, then assess whether their conclusion matches the expected "Eligible" outcome.

[root_agent]: Hello there. I understand you’re interested in finding out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you tell me, is the person you’re claiming for responsible for the child?
