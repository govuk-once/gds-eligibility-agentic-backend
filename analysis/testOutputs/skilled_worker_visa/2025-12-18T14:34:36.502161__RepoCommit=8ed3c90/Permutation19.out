[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ravi and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ravi, nice to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in finding out if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. I've been offered a job as a System Administrator with TechRecruit Ltd, a consultancy in the UK. They're offering me £50,000 per year, which I believe meets the salary threshold. I'm currently living in India and working in IT.

[root_agent]: That's great, Ravi! The Skilled Worker visa is a common route for IT professionals. £50,000 is a good starting point, and your IT background is relevant.

To assess your eligibility further, could you tell me where you will be working most of the time – will you be based at TechRecruit Ltd offices, or directly at a client's site?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working 100% of the time at Bank Corp, which is a client of TechRecruit Ltd. I'll be reporting directly to the managers at Bank Corp. It seems like this would be an indefinite arrangement - TechRecruit has placed me there specifically to work as their System Administrator.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Ravi. That's helpful to know.

Just to be clear, will TechRecruit Ltd be directly responsible for your day-to-day tasks and overall management, or will Bank Corp be managing your work and providing direction on a regular basis?

[evaluation_judge]: Bank Corp managers will be managing my work and providing direction on a daily basis. I'll be reporting to them directly and taking my instructions from them, not from TechRecruit. TechRecruit is basically placing me with Bank Corp as their System Administrator on a long-term basis.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Ravi. 

One final question for now: would you say TechRecruit Ltd needs *you* to fill a permanent, routine position within *their* company, or are they providing your skills to Bank Corp to fill a need *within Bank Corp*?

[evaluation_judge]: TechRecruit is providing my skills to Bank Corp to fill a need within Bank Corp. There isn't actually a position for me within TechRecruit itself - they're essentially placing me to work as a System Administrator at Bank Corp to fill Bank Corp's need for that role. I'd be working fully integrated into Bank Corp's team.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so thorough, Ravi. Based on the information you’ve provided, and considering the rules around the Skilled Worker visa regarding third-party arrangements, it appears your application would likely be **REFUSED**.

The issue is that TechRecruit Ltd seems to be acting as a recruitment agency, supplying your labour to Bank Corp to fill a routine, permanent position within their organisation. The Skilled Worker visa requires the sponsor (TechRecruit Ltd) to have a genuine need for the role themselves, and to retain full responsibility for your duties – which, in this case, is Bank Corp.



I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain any part of this further?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you please explain why this isn't allowed? I thought many IT consultancies sponsor workers who then work at client sites. What's the difference in my situation?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask, Ravi – it's a valid question, and many IT consultancies *do* sponsor workers for client sites. The key difference lies in *how* the consultancy uses your skills and who ultimately controls your work.

The Home Office is concerned with preventing companies from essentially outsourcing their recruitment by using the Skilled Worker visa. They want to ensure the sponsoring company genuinely *needs* the role filled within *their own* organisation.

In a legitimate scenario, the consultancy would assign you to various client projects, using your skills to deliver services *to* those clients, but you would still be working on projects *directed by* TechRecruit Ltd. TechRecruit would be responsible for your training, performance reviews, and overall career development. They'd be using your skills to fulfil contracts *they* have secured.

In your case, it sounds like you’re essentially becoming a System Administrator *for* Bank Corp, fully integrated into their team, taking direction from their managers, and filling a long-term need within *their* organization. TechRecruit is simply the intermediary placing you there. This is considered “filling a routine permanent position” at the client's organisation, and is prohibited under the rules.

Essentially, the Home Office wants to avoid a situation where the sponsor isn’t the end-user of the skills, but merely a supplier of labour. Does that make the distinction clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes much more sense now. So if TechRecruit was actually using my skills to deliver services to Bank Corp, while remaining responsible for my work, performance reviews, and career development, it would be different. But because I'd essentially be working as if I were a Bank Corp employee, just paid by TechRecruit, that's not allowed under the visa rules.

It's disappointing to hear I wouldn't be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa in this situation. Are there any alternatives I could consider, or would TechRecruit need to change the employment structure completely?

[root_agent]: You've perfectly understood the nuance, Ravi – that's exactly right. If TechRecruit were actively *using* your skills as part of their service offering to Bank Corp, while retaining control over your employment, the situation would be different.

Regarding alternatives, unfortunately, the Skilled Worker visa is quite specific. Without a genuine role within TechRecruit Ltd itself, or a restructuring of the arrangement to align with the visa rules (as we've discussed), it would be difficult to qualify under this route.

TechRecruit would need to fundamentally change the employment structure. They would need to demonstrate that they have a genuine need for a System Administrator to work *for them*, even if that work involves delivering services *to* Bank Corp. They'd need to take on full responsibility for your day-to-day tasks, performance management, and career progression.

Another option, depending on your circumstances, might be to explore other visa routes, but these usually have different eligibility criteria. For example, if you have a high level of skill and experience, you might investigate the Global Talent visa. However, these are generally suited to leaders or potential leaders in specific fields.

I recommend consulting with an immigration lawyer to explore all possible options tailored to your individual situation. They can provide expert advice and assess your specific profile. Would you like me to provide information about finding a qualified immigration advisor (I can't *recommend* one, but can point you to resources)?

[evaluation_judge]: That would be very helpful. Yes, please let me know how I can find a qualified immigration advisor. I'll need to discuss this with TechRecruit and see if they're willing to restructure the role to comply with the visa requirements, or perhaps look for other opportunities. I appreciate your clear explanation of why this particular arrangement wouldn't work.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ravi. I'm glad I could clarify the situation for you.

Here are some resources for finding a qualified immigration advisor in the UK:

*   **Office of Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC):** [https://www.oisc.gov.uk/](https://www.oisc.gov.uk/) - This is the main regulatory body for immigration advisors in the UK. You can search their register to find advisors who are regulated and have demonstrated competence.
*   **Law Society:** [https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/) - You can find solicitors specializing in immigration law through the Law Society's website.
*   **Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA):** [https://ilpa.org.uk/](https://ilpa.org.uk/) - ILPA is a professional association of immigration lawyers and advisors. Their website has a directory of members.

**Important Note:** Always check that any advisor you choose is properly regulated by the OISC or is a qualified solicitor.

I wish you the best of luck in discussing this with TechRecruit and exploring your options. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions, though I'm limited to information regarding the Skilled Worker visa and related regulations.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for all this information. I'll definitely look into these resources and speak with a qualified immigration advisor. I appreciate your help in explaining the Skilled Worker visa requirements and why my specific situation doesn't meet them. This gives me a clear direction on what to discuss with TechRecruit and what other options I might need to explore.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Ravi! I'm genuinely pleased I could help. 

It sounds like you have a good understanding of the situation now, and a clear plan for moving forward. I wish you all the best in your discussions with TechRecruit and with finding the right immigration advice.

If you have any other questions in the future, feel free to reach out, though as I mentioned, my expertise is focused on the Skilled Worker visa and related regulations. 

Good luck with everything!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa because TechRecruit Ltd is acting as a recruitment agency supplying labor to Bank Corp, which violates the third-party ban rule. The agent accurately identified that this arrangement is not genuine employment by the sponsor and would be refused, matching the expected outcome.
