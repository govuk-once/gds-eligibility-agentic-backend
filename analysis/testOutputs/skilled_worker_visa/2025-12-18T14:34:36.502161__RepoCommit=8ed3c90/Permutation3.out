[evaluation_judge]: I'll engage with the agent as Dr. Aari who's trying to understand her Skilled Worker visa eligibility.

[root_agent]: Hello! I'm here to help you understand if you might be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa. 

To start, could you please confirm your age?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Aari and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Aari! It's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa.

To begin, could you please tell me what your profession is?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a biological researcher with a PhD in Microbiology. I've been offered a Senior Lab Technician position at a pharmaceutical company here in the UK.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Aari! A background in Microbiology sounds very relevant.

Could you please tell me what your offered salary is for the Senior Lab Technician position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £34,000 per year for this position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Aari. That's helpful to know. 

Do you know what the standard going rate is for a Senior Lab Technician, according to your employer or publicly available data? It’s okay if you don’t have the exact figure immediately, an approximate amount is fine.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand the standard going rate for this role is about £38,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Aari. That's very useful information. 

Just to confirm, you have a PhD in Microbiology – is that correct? And would you say your PhD is in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) field?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I have a PhD in Microbiology, which is definitely a STEM field since it's within biological sciences.

[root_agent]: Excellent! And just to be absolutely certain, do you meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa? (For example, through a recognised test or having completed a degree taught in English).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I meet the English language requirements. My PhD was completed at a university where all instruction was in English.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic, Aari. One final question for now – do you have a license sponsor who is willing to support your visa application? In other words, is the pharmaceutical company offering you the role an approved sponsor with the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the pharmaceutical company that's offering me the position is an approved sponsor with the Home Office.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! Thank you for providing all of this information, Aari. 

Based on what you've told me – having a STEM PhD, a salary of £34,000, a going rate of £38,000, meeting the English language requirements, and having an approved sponsor – it appears you **would be awarded** the Skilled Worker Visa under the criteria for those with a STEM PhD.

Your salary meets both the £33,400 lower general threshold *and* is at least 80% of the standard going rate (£30,400).



Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the Skilled Worker Visa, or any other questions you may have?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news to hear! I was hoping I would be eligible with my qualifications. Just to confirm, does my PhD in Microbiology being relevant to the lab technician role play an important part in this decision? I want to make sure I understand all the factors that help my application.

[root_agent]: You're very right to ask for clarification, Aari! Yes, the relevance of your PhD in Microbiology to the Senior Lab Technician role *is* an important factor. 

The guidelines state that the PhD needs to be in a relevant STEM subject. Your PhD directly relates to the biological sciences involved in a pharmaceutical lab, making it a relevant qualification for the position. It strengthens your application by demonstrating a high level of expertise in a field pertinent to the job.

Essentially, your PhD allows you to qualify for the visa even with a slightly lower salary than might otherwise be required, because of the value of that advanced qualification. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense! I'm glad to know that my PhD is considered valuable and relevant to the role. This gives me confidence in my application. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly about how my educational background affects the salary requirements. I feel much more prepared now!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Aari! I'm so glad I could help clarify things and give you confidence in your application. 

It sounds like you've got a strong case. If you have any further questions down the line, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best with your visa application and your new role at the pharmaceutical company!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for your help! I really appreciate all the information and guidance you've provided.

✓ The agent correctly identified that I would be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa as my salary of £34,000 exceeds both the lower general threshold of £33,400 and 80% of the going rate (£30,400), and I have a relevant STEM PhD.
