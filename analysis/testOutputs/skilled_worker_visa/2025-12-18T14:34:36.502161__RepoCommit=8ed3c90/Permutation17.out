[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Yuki in this scenario.

Hi, i'm Yuki and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Yuki, nice to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you please confirm if your current Skilled Worker visa is still valid?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my Skilled Worker visa is still valid. I'm currently working full-time as a Graphic Designer and my employer is sponsoring my visa. I'm actually interested in taking on a small weekend job as a bartender for about 10 hours a week to earn some extra money, but I'm not sure if that's allowed under my visa conditions.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear your visa is valid! Thanks for explaining the situation. To clarify, would this bartending job be in the same occupation code as your current role as a Graphic Designer?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it wouldn't be in the same occupation code. My main job is as a Graphic Designer, but this bartending position would be completely different. It's just at a local pub near where I live, and I'd only be working there on weekends for about 10 hours total per week. I thought since it's just part-time, it might be allowed.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. And just to be certain, is bartending currently listed on the UK government's Immigration Salary List (shortage occupation list)?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't believe bartending is on the Immigration Salary List. It's just a regular part-time job at a local pub. I was hoping I could take it on since it's only for 10 hours a week and wouldn't interfere with my main job as a Graphic Designer. I'm just trying to earn a bit of extra money on the weekends.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Yuki. Based on what you've told me – your main job is as a Graphic Designer, the second job would be as a Bartender, it's not the same occupation code, and bartending isn't on the Immigration Salary List – unfortunately, taking this second job would not be permitted under the conditions of your Skilled Worker visa. It's important to only undertake additional work that either falls within the same occupation code as your sponsored role or is on the shortage occupation list, and even then, it must be no more than 20 hours per week.



I understand you were hoping to earn some extra money, but working as a bartender in this situation would be considered illegal work.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing to hear but I appreciate you explaining it clearly. So even though it's only 10 hours a week, I can't take a bartending job because it's not in the same occupation code as my Graphic Designer position and it's not on the shortage list. 

If I wanted to earn extra money, would it be allowed for me to take on some freelance graphic design work instead? Would that be permitted since it's the same occupation as my main job?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Yuki! I'm glad I could clarify.

And yes, you are absolutely right to ask about freelance graphic design work! Taking on freelance work *as a Graphic Designer* would be permitted, as it falls within the same occupation code as your sponsored role. As long as you continue to meet the conditions of your visa - including not working more than 20 hours a week in total (including your main job and the freelance work) - it should be permissible.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome by stating that working as a bartender would be illegal under my Skilled Worker visa conditions, as it's not in the same occupation code as my main job and not on the shortage occupation list. The agent also correctly explained that freelance graphic design work would be permitted since it's in the same occupation code.
