[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you test the agent by playing the role of Lina seeking information about visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Lina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lina, it’s lovely to meet you! I'm root_agent, and I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what your job title is?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, nice to meet you as well. I'm a hospitality expert and I've been offered a job as a Construction Labourer in the UK. I'm trying to understand if I would be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with this position.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Lina! Thank you for telling me you've been offered a job as a Construction Labourer.

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you please confirm the specific code for your job offer? You should find this on the job advert or in your offer letter – it’s a four-digit number.

[evaluation_judge]: The job code I was given is 9120, which is for Elementary construction occupations. The company offering the position says they're a licensed sponsor, if that helps.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing the job code, Lina. It's helpful to know the company is a licensed sponsor too.

To continue assessing your eligibility, could you please confirm the salary you will be receiving for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary offered is £45,000 per year. It's quite generous compared to what I was expecting for this type of work.

[root_agent]: That *is* a generous salary, Lina! Thank you for sharing that information.

Now, to determine if this role meets all the requirements for a Skilled Worker visa, could you tell me – do you know what RQF level this job is? (RQF stands for Regulated Qualifications Framework – it’s a system that sets skill levels for jobs.) Don’t worry if you don’t know offhand, just let me know and I can try to help you find out.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure about the RQF level for this job. I know it's a construction labourer role, so I don't think it requires advanced qualifications. Could you help me find out what RQF level this job would be at?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Lina. I can help with that. 

Based on the job code you provided – 9120 for Elementary construction occupations – this role is typically considered to be at RQF Level 1 or 2. 

To be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa, the job needs to be at RQF Level 3 or above. Therefore, unfortunately, this role does not meet that requirement.



I'm very sorry to deliver that news. Based on the information you've provided, your application for a Skilled Worker visa would be **REFUSED**. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, that's disappointing to hear. So even though the salary is quite high at £45,000 and the company is a licensed sponsor, I still can't get a Skilled Worker visa just because the job is classified at RQF Level 1 or 2?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to clarify, Lina. That's exactly the situation. 

Even with a high salary of £45,000 and a licensed sponsor, the job *must* be at RQF Level 3 or above to be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. The skill level is a fundamental requirement, and unfortunately, a lower-skilled job doesn't qualify, regardless of the salary offered.

I understand this is disappointing. Would you like me to explain the RQF levels in a bit more detail, or perhaps discuss other potential visa routes (though I can only advise on the Skilled Worker visa based on the information I have access to)?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for a Skilled Worker visa because the job (Construction Labourer with code 9120) is at RQF Level 1-2, which is below the required RQF Level 3, regardless of the high salary and licensed sponsor.
