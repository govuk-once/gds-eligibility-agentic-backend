[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Priya and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Priya, nice to meet you! I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant. To best understand your eligibility, could you please tell me if you currently hold a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do. I've been on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022. I'm currently working as a Marketing Manager.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know, thank you. 

Are you looking to *extend* your current visa, or *change* to a new employer while remaining on the Skilled Worker route?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm looking to change to a new employer. I've received an offer from a new marketing agency as a Marketing Manager, but I want to make sure I can still keep my Skilled Worker visa status.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. And approximately what salary are they offering you with this new role? Please give me the annual salary amount.

[evaluation_judge]: The new agency has offered me £32,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Do you know what the going rate is for a Marketing Manager role is, according to the government’s list of eligible occupations? There are usually two figures listed - one based on the 25th percentile and another on the 50th percentile. If you know both, that would be great, but even one would be helpful.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate (50th percentile) is around £42,000, and the lower going rate (25th percentile) is about £30,000. That's why I'm concerned about whether my offer of £32,000 is enough for the Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: That’s very helpful to know, thank you. Just to confirm, you've held your Skilled Worker visa continuously since 2022, is that correct? And to clarify, this has been *before* April 4th, 2024?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I've held my Skilled Worker visa continuously since 2022, so definitely before April 4th, 2024.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you *are* eligible to benefit from transitional arrangements. 

Because you held a Skilled Worker visa before April 4th, 2024, and are changing employers, the salary requirements for your visa extension are different. The general threshold is £29,000, and the going rate is based on the 25th percentile.

Your offered salary of £32,000 meets both of these requirements. Therefore, based on what you've told me, you **are likely eligible** to continue on the Skilled Worker visa with your new employer.





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for the transitional arrangements since I held a Skilled Worker visa since 2022 (before April 4, 2024), and that my £32,000 salary meets both the transitional general threshold (£29,000) and the transitional going rate (£30,000).
