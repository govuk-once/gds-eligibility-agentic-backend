[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Elena, it's good to speak with you. I understand you're exploring your eligibility for a benefit. To start, could you please confirm your age? This helps me understand which rules apply to your situation.





[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm 35 years old. I'm looking to understand if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa in the UK. I've received a job offer as a Senior Engineering Manager at a fintech company in London.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your age, Elena. That's helpful. 

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you please tell me, does the company offering you the job have a valid sponsor license?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company is a licensed sponsor. They have their sponsor license in place and are able to issue certificates of sponsorship.

[root_agent]: That's excellent news, Elena. Knowing they have a sponsor license is a key requirement. 

Next, could you tell me what the skill level of the job is, according to the UK government’s Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes? Specifically, what RQF level does it fall under?

[evaluation_judge]: The job is at RQF Level 6. It's a Senior Engineering Manager role that requires significant experience and qualifications in software engineering.

[root_agent]: Great, RQF level 6 meets the requirement.

Now, could you please confirm that you meet the English language requirements for the visa? Have you taken a Secure English Language Test (SELT) and achieved the necessary score?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've passed the Secure English Language Test (SELT) with distinction. My English language proficiency meets the requirements for the visa.

[root_agent]: That's fantastic, Elena! Meeting the English language requirements is another important step.

Let's move on to your salary. What is the annual salary offered to you in this role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £85,000 per year for the Senior Engineering Manager position.

[root_agent]: That's a very good salary, Elena. To continue assessing your eligibility, do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Senior Engineering Manager role, as determined by the UK government?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the standard going rate for my role as a Senior Engineering Manager is £75,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Elena. Based on everything you've told me so far, it appears you meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker visa under the standard route. 

Your salary of £85,000 is above both the general threshold of £41,700 *and* the going rate of £75,000 for your occupation. 

Therefore, based on the information provided, it looks like you would be **AWARDED** the visa. Would you like me to summarise the reasons why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'd appreciate a summary of the reasons why I'd be awarded the visa.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Elena. Here's a summary of why you appear to be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa based on the information you've provided:

* **Valid Sponsor:** You have a job offer from a company with a valid sponsor license.
* **Skill Level:** The job role of Senior Engineering Manager is at RQF level 6, which meets the required skill level.
* **English Language Proficiency:** You have passed the Secure English Language Test (SELT) with distinction, demonstrating you meet the English language requirements.
* **Salary - General Threshold:** Your offered salary of £85,000 exceeds the general threshold of £41,700.
* **Salary - Going Rate:** Your offered salary of £85,000 is above the 'going rate' of £75,000 for a Senior Engineering Manager role.

Because you meet both the salary thresholds, you are eligible under the standard route and do not need to rely on a points-based system.



Please remember this is based on the information *you* have provided, and this assessment is not a guarantee of a visa being granted. It is always best to consult the official government guidance and potentially seek legal advice for your specific circumstances.



Do you have any other questions for me today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's very clear. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your help in understanding my eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa.

✓ The agent correctly identified that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker visa under the standard route. They accurately explained that my salary (£85,000) exceeds both the general threshold (£41,700) and the going rate (£75,000), which matches the expected outcome of "AWARDED" from the scenario.
