[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Banu and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Dr. Banu. Thank you for speaking with me today.

To start, could you tell me, do you have a document that confirms you hold a PhD qualification?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have my PhD in Chemistry that I received from a university in Turkey. I have the certificate and transcripts with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. To help me understand your situation fully, could you tell me, has your PhD been verified by Ecctis?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I submitted my PhD for verification by Ecctis, but the results weren't what I expected. They said my qualification is "comparable to RQF Level 7 (Master's)" but not at a doctoral standard. I was quite surprised because I completed a full doctoral program.

[root_agent]: I understand. Thank you for clarifying that.  Considering the Ecctis verification indicates your qualification is at a Master's level, and not a doctoral standard, would you agree that it doesn't meet the criteria for Tradeable Points under the Skilled Worker Visa route?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure I understand. I thought since I have a PhD certificate, I would qualify for the points. Does this Ecctis verification result mean I don't qualify for the PhD points? I have a job offer as a Senior Chemist with a salary of £35,000, and I was counting on getting the STEM PhD discount.

[root_agent]: You’re right to be concerned about that. Let’s take a step back. To clarify, you have a PhD certificate, but the Ecctis verification determined it’s equivalent to a Master’s level qualification, not a doctoral one. 

Could you tell me, what country did you obtain your PhD from?

[evaluation_judge]: I obtained my PhD from a small private university in Turkey. I completed all the requirements including my dissertation and defense. I'm confused why Ecctis would rate it as only Master's level.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information.  Considering you obtained your PhD from a private, unaccredited university in Turkey, and Ecctis has verified it’s comparable to a Master’s level qualification, does your university have any accreditation from a recognized body, even if it’s not UK-based?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure about the accreditation status. It's a smaller private institution, and I know it's recognized in Turkey, but I don't think it has international accreditation. Does that matter for the visa process?

[root_agent]: That’s helpful to know. Given that the Ecctis verification confirmed the qualification is at a Master’s level and doesn’t meet the requirements for Tradeable Points under the Skilled Worker Visa, and the university lacks international accreditation, could you confirm that you’re relying on the STEM PhD salary discount based on your PhD qualification?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. My job offer is for £35,000 as a Senior Chemist, and I was counting on using the STEM PhD discount for the salary requirement. I thought having a PhD certificate would be enough. Is there a problem with this plan?

[root_agent]: Yes, unfortunately, there is a problem with your plan. Because Ecctis didn't verify your PhD as a UK PhD equivalent, you won’t be eligible for the Tradeable Points needed to access the STEM PhD salary discount. 

Based on the information you’ve provided, it seems your application for the Skilled Worker Visa would require the full salary (£41,700+). 

Therefore, considering the current situation, I must conclude that you are not eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa at this time.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So you're saying my application would be refused because I can't use the PhD points since my qualification was only assessed as Master's level by Ecctis? And my salary of £35,000 is below the required threshold without that discount?

[root_agent]: That’s exactly correct, Dr. Banu. My assessment is that your application would be refused due to the Ecctis verification result – your PhD wasn’t recognized as a UK doctoral standard – and consequently, you wouldn't be able to utilize the STEM PhD salary discount to meet the salary requirements. 

Would you like me to summarise the key reasons for this decision?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please summarize the reasons for this decision and if there's anything I could do to change the situation.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here’s a summary of the reasons for the decision:

1.  **Ecctis Verification:** Ecctis assessed your PhD from the university in Turkey and determined it’s equivalent to a Master’s level qualification, not a doctoral degree.
2.  **Lack of UK Recognition:** This means it doesn’t meet the criteria for Tradeable Points required for the Skilled Worker Visa.
3.  **Salary Requirement:** Without the Tradeable Points and the associated STEM PhD salary discount, your current salary of £35,000 falls below the threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Regarding what you could do to change the situation, unfortunately, the primary issue is the Ecctis verification. To have your qualification re-evaluated as a doctoral degree, you would need to obtain accreditation from an Ecctis-recognised body. However, this is a complex process and may not be possible given the nature of your university. 

Do you have any questions about this summary, or would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be refused for a Skilled Worker visa because my PhD was verified by Ecctis as only equivalent to a Master's degree (not doctoral level), meaning I cannot claim the STEM PhD salary discount, and my £35,000 salary is below the required threshold.
