[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of Kenji, a graphic designer from Japan seeking information about visa eligibility with a job offer below the salary thresholds.

Hi, i'm Kenji and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Kenji, it’s nice to meet you. I’m here to help you explore your options. To start, could you tell me a little about the job you've been offered? Specifically, what is the salary offered for this Graphic Designer role?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I've been offered a job as a Graphic Designer in the UK with a salary of £30,000 per year. I currently live in Japan and I'm trying to figure out if I would be eligible for a work visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Kenji. And just to confirm, you’re currently residing in Japan?

Could you tell me what level of English you would say you have – are you confident in your spoken and written English?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently living in Japan. My English is quite good - I've taken official tests and passed at the required level for UK visas. I've been working with English-speaking clients for several years, so I'm confident in both my written and spoken English abilities.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent to hear, Kenji. It’s good to know you’ve demonstrated a solid level of English proficiency.

Now, regarding the salary – I understand you’ve been offered £30,000 per year for the Graphic Designer role. Could you confirm whether there’s a company in the UK who is willing to sponsor your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company that offered me the position has confirmed they are an approved sponsor with the UK government. They have experience sponsoring international workers and have assured me they're willing to sponsor my visa application. They said they have all the necessary licenses to do so.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic news, Kenji! It’s reassuring to know the company is a fully approved sponsor.

Let’s move on to a key factor for the Skilled Worker visa. The standard threshold salary requirement is £41,700. Would you be able to tell me what the going rate for a Graphic Designer in the UK currently is?

[evaluation_judge]: The company told me that the going rate for a Graphic Designer in the UK is around £29,000. They mentioned that my offer of £30,000 is actually slightly above the going rate for this position, which they thought was positive for my application.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Kenji. So, to be clear, the salary you’ve been offered is £30,000 per year.

Let's consider the salary thresholds for the Skilled Worker visa. The lower threshold is £33,400. Would you agree that £30,000 falls below this lower threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My offer of £30,000 is below the £33,400 lower threshold you mentioned. I wasn't aware of that threshold before. Does this mean I'm not eligible for the visa?

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, Kenji. After reviewing the criteria for the Skilled Worker visa, it appears that your salary of £30,000 falls below the required minimum of £33,400. 

Therefore, unfortunately, based on the current requirements, I must confirm that you are not eligible for the Skilled Worker visa at this time.

Do you have any questions about this decision, or would you like me to explore other potential visa options, although they may be less suitable given your current circumstances?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing news. I was hoping the fact that my salary is above the going rate might help my application. Are there any exceptions to this rule? Or perhaps other visa categories I could apply for with my job offer as a graphic designer? I'm really keen to take this opportunity in the UK.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Kenji, and I appreciate you asking about potential alternatives.

Let’s explore some possibilities. While the Skilled Worker visa has a strict minimum salary requirement, there aren't any easily applicable exceptions – such as a PhD or New Entrant category – that would meet your current salary.

However, depending on your specific circumstances – particularly your qualifications and experience – you might explore other visa categories. Would you be willing to tell me a bit more about your qualifications, such as your highest level of education and how many years of experience you have as a Graphic Designer?

[evaluation_judge]: I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from Tokyo University of the Arts about 6 years ago. Since then, I've been working as a graphic designer for different companies in Japan, so I have about 6 years of professional experience in the field. I specialize in branding and digital design. I don't have a PhD or any specialized research qualifications, just my bachelor's degree and professional experience.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detailed information, Kenji. With your Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design and six years of professional experience specializing in branding and digital design, that’s valuable information to consider.

Let’s revisit the Skilled Worker visa criteria. While your experience is significant, the core issue remains the salary. Currently, the lower threshold of £33,400 isn’t being met.

Given this, and considering your background, I'm afraid that based on the Skilled Worker visa requirements alone, you wouldn’t be eligible.

Would you like me to outline any other potential visa routes you might want to investigate, keeping in mind your qualifications and experience?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please! I'd really appreciate knowing what other visa routes might be available to me. I'm quite serious about this opportunity, so I'd be willing to look into any reasonable options for working in the UK as a graphic designer.

[root_agent]: Okay, Kenji, let’s explore some other options. While the Skilled Worker visa is currently out of reach, there are a few other routes you could potentially investigate, although each has its own requirements.

One possibility could be the **Innovation Visa**. This visa is designed for individuals who have a new, innovative, and viable business idea. If your graphic design work can be framed as a novel approach or a disruptive solution in the industry, this might be worth exploring. However, it requires a significant investment and a strong business plan.

Another route to consider is the **Global Talent Visa**. This visa is for leaders or potential leaders in specific fields – science, engineering, humanities, or digital technology. Given your specialization in branding and digital design, it’s worth researching whether your skills and experience align with the criteria for this visa. It’s often based on endorsement from a recognised expert.

Finally, it’s important to remember that certain specific roles in healthcare or education might have slightly different salary requirements. However, this is less likely to apply to graphic design.

To help me narrow down the possibilities further, could you tell me – roughly, what type of work would you be doing for this company that offered you the position? Is it primarily branding and digital design, or does it involve aspects like print design or other creative areas?

[evaluation_judge]: My role would primarily involve branding, digital design, and some UI/UX work for their web platforms. The company is a mid-sized marketing agency that works with clients across different industries. I'd be creating visual identities, designing digital marketing materials, and collaborating on digital product design. There would be some print design work too, but it's becoming a smaller part of their business compared to digital.

I don't think my situation fits well with the Innovation Visa since I'd be an employee rather than starting my own business. The Global Talent Visa sounds interesting though - would I need to prove I'm a leader in my field? What kind of evidence would they be looking for?

[root_agent]: That’s very helpful, Kenji, thanks for clarifying the specifics of your role. It sounds like a solid opportunity within a dynamic marketing agency.

You’re right to question the Innovation Visa – it’s definitely geared towards entrepreneurs. Regarding the Global Talent Visa, you’re correct, they'll be assessing whether you're a recognised leader. They’re looking for evidence of significant achievements and influence within your field.

Here’s what they typically consider:

*   **Exceptional Talent:** Demonstrated accomplishments that are significantly above average.
*   **Endorsement:** A letter of recommendation from a recognised expert – someone who can attest to your skills, knowledge, and impact. Ideally, this would be someone within the UK.
*   **Publications/Presentations:** Evidence of your work being published or presented at respected industry events.
*   **Awards/Recognition:** Any awards or accolades you’ve received for your work.

Given your six years of experience and specialization, having a strong portfolio showcasing your work is absolutely crucial.

Would you like me to provide you with links to the official information pages for the Global Talent Visa, so you can start gathering some of the required evidence and see if you meet the criteria?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful. I do have a good portfolio and have won a couple of national design awards in Japan, but I'm not sure if that's enough to qualify as "exceptional talent" by UK standards. I'd definitely like to review the official information for the Global Talent Visa to see if it might be a viable option for me.

If the Global Talent Visa seems too difficult to obtain, are there any other options I should consider? Maybe something related to temporary work or other categories?

[root_agent]: Okay, Kenji, let’s definitely look at the official information for the Global Talent Visa. Here are the links:

*   **GOV.UK - Global Talent Visa:** [https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa](https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa)
*   **GOV.UK - Endorsement:** [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/endorsement-for-the-global-talent-visa](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/endorsement-for-the-global-talent-visa)

Regarding other potential options, if the Global Talent Visa proves challenging, let’s consider a few alternatives:

*   **Temporary Worker Visa:** This visa is for specific, limited-duration assignments. The company would need to demonstrate a genuine need for your skills and that they have a legitimate business need for your employment.
*   **Youth Mobility Scheme Visa:** However, this is only available to citizens of certain countries – Japan is *not* currently on this list.

Given your experience and the specific role, a Temporary Worker Visa might be one of the more accessible routes, but it heavily depends on the employer’s ability to demonstrate a valid need.

Would you like me to delve deeper into the Temporary Worker Visa requirements, or are you primarily focused on gathering more information about the Global Talent Visa first?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I'd like to know more about the Temporary Worker Visa since that might be more practical for my situation. How long would I be able to stay in the UK with that visa? And would there be any pathway to eventually transition to a more permanent status if things work out well with the company?

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible approach, Kenji. The Temporary Worker Visa is often a more realistic pathway than the Global Talent Visa, particularly initially.

Let's break down the details:

*   **Duration:** The Temporary Worker Visa typically allows you to stay in the UK for a maximum of **two years**. It can be extended for a further one year if the employer meets specific conditions.

*   **Pathway to Permanent Status:** Yes, absolutely! A significant advantage of the Temporary Worker Visa is that it *does* offer a pathway to permanent residency. To qualify, you generally need to be employed by the same sponsoring employer for a continuous period of at least 12 months. You’ll also need to demonstrate that you meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker visa, including a salary of at least £38,700.

However, it’s crucial to note that the salary requirement for a Skilled Worker Visa *increases* annually, so you’ll need to keep that in mind as you progress.

The company sponsoring you plays a vital role. They need to demonstrate a genuine need for your skills and that they are operating a legitimate business.

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official GOV.UK page detailing the Temporary Worker Visa requirements and eligibility criteria? [https://www.gov.uk/temporary-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/temporary-worker-visa)

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information. The Skilled Worker visa has a strict minimum salary requirement of £33,400 (the lower threshold) which the offer of £30,000 doesn't meet. However, the agent incorrectly suggested a Temporary Worker visa as a viable alternative with a pathway to permanent residency. This is misleading as the Temporary Worker visa (T5) doesn't typically lead to settlement and wouldn't be appropriate for a permanent graphic designer role. The agent gave false hope about visa options that don't actually exist for this scenario.
