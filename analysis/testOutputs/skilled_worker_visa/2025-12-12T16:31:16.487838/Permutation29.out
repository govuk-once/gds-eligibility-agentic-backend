[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ben and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Ben, it’s nice to meet you! To help me understand your situation and whether you might be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you tell me what your gross annual salary is before any deductions?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm a Software Developer with a gross annual salary of £42,000. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa. I recently signed up for a "Cycle to Work" scheme and made some additional pension contributions through salary sacrifice, which reduces my taxable salary to £40,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Ben. Just to be absolutely sure I have everything correct, could you confirm that your gross annual salary before any deductions is £42,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my gross annual salary before any deductions is £42,000.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Now, you mentioned you’ve signed up for a Cycle to Work scheme and made salary sacrifice contributions. Could you tell me roughly how much you’re sacrificing each year through these schemes?

[evaluation_judge]: Through the Cycle to Work scheme and my additional pension contributions combined, I'm sacrificing about £2,000 per year, which brings my taxable salary down to around £40,000.

[root_agent]: Alright, Ben. Thank you for providing that information. Let me quickly check something. Considering your salary after these deductions, does your revised taxable salary of £40,000 meet the eligibility threshold of £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe so, since £40,000 is higher than £33,400. I just wasn't sure about how these salary sacrifice schemes affect visa eligibility, since my original salary is £42,000 but with these deductions it's £40,000. So I meet the threshold either way?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to be cautious, Ben. Let’s confirm this precisely. The Home Office assesses the salary *after* salary sacrifice schemes. So, we need to look at the £40,000 you quoted. 

Based on the information you’ve given me, it appears your revised taxable salary of £40,000 *does* meet the threshold. However, I need to double-check the exact criteria to ensure complete accuracy. 

Could you please confirm that the £2,000 you’re sacrificing is a consistent amount each year and that there are no other salary sacrifice schemes you participate in?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the £2,000 I'm sacrificing is a consistent amount each year through the Cycle to Work scheme and the additional pension contributions. I don't participate in any other salary sacrifice schemes.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ben. That’s excellent to confirm. 

I’ve reviewed the Skilled Worker Visa criteria, and it appears that, with a revised taxable salary of £40,000 after your salary sacrifice contributions, you *do* meet the threshold of £33,400. 

However, please remember that this assessment is based solely on the information you’ve provided. It’s always advisable to consult the official Home Office guidance for the most up-to-date details.

Would you like me to summarise the key points regarding salary sacrifice and the Skilled Worker Visa for you, or is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So I definitely meet the threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa even with my salary sacrifice? That's good news. Could you summarize the key points about salary sacrifice and how it impacts the Skilled Worker Visa? I just want to be completely sure I understand correctly.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ben. Let’s summarise the key points regarding salary sacrifice and the Skilled Worker Visa:

*   **Taxable Salary Calculation:** The Home Office assesses your eligibility based on your *taxable* salary, not your gross salary.
*   **Salary Sacrifice Impact:** Salary sacrifice schemes (like Cycle to Work or pension contributions) reduce your taxable income.
*   **Threshold Requirement:** The Skilled Worker Visa requires your taxable salary to be at or above £33,400 (as of the latest information).
*   **Importance of Deduction:** It's *crucial* to accurately track and report any salary sacrifice deductions to ensure your taxable salary is calculated correctly.
*   **Potential Breach:** If you underestimate or fail to declare salary sacrifice deductions, your sponsorship could be at risk, even if you initially met the threshold – and your employer could face penalties.

Do you feel that summary clarifies the relationship between salary sacrifice and the Skilled Worker Visa for you? Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly stated I meet the eligibility requirements. The expected outcome was REFUSED because my salary after sacrifice (£40,000) falls below the required threshold of £41,700, not £33,400 as the agent incorrectly stated.
