[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Omar, a nephew of a restaurant owner in London who has received a suspicious job offer that would likely fail the "Genuine Vacancy" test.

Hi, i'm Omar and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, Omar, thanks for reaching out. Let’s start with a basic question to get a better understanding of your situation. Could you tell me a little bit about your experience working in a managerial role before this offer?

[evaluation_judge]: I have some experience working in my uncle's restaurant back home as a server for about two years, but I haven't really worked in a managerial position before. My uncle here in London says he can teach me everything I need to know about managing his restaurant. He says I'm a fast learner and it wouldn't be a problem.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Omar. That’s helpful context. Let’s delve a bit deeper into this job offer itself. Could you describe the specific responsibilities associated with this Restaurant Manager role, beyond just “general oversight”?  What would a typical day look like for you in this position?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, my uncle said I'd be overseeing the staff, making sure everything runs smoothly in the restaurant, and handling some administrative work. I'm not exactly sure about the day-to-day responsibilities, to be honest. He mentioned I would help with scheduling, ordering supplies, and maybe greeting customers. The restaurant is quite small - only has about 10 seats - so I imagine it wouldn't be too complicated to manage. My uncle said we could figure out the specifics once I start the position.

[root_agent]: Okay, Omar, thanks for clarifying. Considering the restaurant’s size – just 10 seats – and the vague nature of the responsibilities, let’s talk about the existing manager. Is there already a manager currently employed at the restaurant, as you mentioned?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, there is already a manager working there. He's been with my uncle for about three years now. I think my uncle mentioned something about him staying on but we would share the management responsibilities, or maybe he would move to another position. It's not completely clear to me how we'd divide the work, to be honest.

[root_agent]: I understand. It sounds like there’s some ambiguity around the management structure. Let’s shift gears slightly. Could you tell me a little more about your uncle’s restaurant? Specifically, what type of cuisine does it serve, and how established is it in the London area?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a small family-style Middle Eastern restaurant that my uncle opened about 5 years ago. They serve traditional dishes like shawarma, falafel, hummus, and other Middle Eastern favorites. It's in a decent location in East London, but it's not particularly famous or anything. It has regular local customers but it's quite small with just those 10 seats I mentioned. My uncle says it's doing okay financially but I don't know the specific details about that.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Omar. That’s really useful information. Now, shifting back to the job offer itself – the salary of £45,000. You mentioned that’s what you’ve been offered. Looking at the Skilled Worker Visa criteria, does that salary feel like a typical and appropriate level for a Restaurant Manager role in London, considering the restaurant’s size and the experience you’ve described?

[evaluation_judge]: To be honest, I was quite surprised by the salary offer. £45,000 seems very generous for a small restaurant with only 10 seats, especially since I don't have managerial experience. My uncle said he wants to pay me well because I'm family and he knows I'll work hard. When I asked if this was the standard salary for restaurant managers, he just said that's what he's offering me. I'm not really familiar with typical restaurant manager salaries in London, but this does seem high compared to what I've heard others make in similar positions.

[root_agent]: Okay, Omar, thank you for clarifying that. Given the limited experience you’ve had in a managerial role, the relatively small size of the restaurant, and the fact that the salary seems considerably higher than average for similar positions in London, let’s address the “Genuine Vacancy” test. Do you believe this job offer was created primarily to facilitate your entry into the UK, rather than being a genuinely available position for a qualified Restaurant Manager?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, my uncle did mention that he really wants me to come to the UK and join the family business. He told me that this would be the easiest way for me to get a visa to come over. When I asked about the high salary and whether the restaurant could support it, he said not to worry about that and that family takes care of family.

I guess when you put it that way, it does seem like he might have created this position specifically for me rather than having a genuine need for another manager, especially since there's already someone doing that job. I was just excited about the opportunity to move to London and didn't question it too much.

[root_agent]: Thank you for your honest reflection, Omar. Based on our conversation, it appears there are significant concerns regarding the “Genuine Vacancy” test. The combination of the high salary, existing manager, vague job description, and your uncle’s emphasis on the relationship aspect raises serious questions about whether this role is truly a genuine opportunity for a qualified Restaurant Manager.

Considering these factors, I’m afraid I must conclude that this application is unlikely to be successful under the Skilled Worker Visa criteria. We’ve identified a substantial risk that the position was created primarily to facilitate your entry into the UK.

Do you understand this assessment, Omar?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. So you're saying that even though the salary meets the threshold and the job title is on the skilled worker list, the application would likely be refused because the Home Office would see it's not a genuine vacancy? That's disappointing to hear, but I suppose it makes sense. My uncle probably should have been more straightforward with me about how these things work. Is there any legitimate way I could work for my uncle's restaurant in the future, or is that not really possible?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Omar. It’s certainly a frustrating outcome. You're right to point out that a more transparent discussion with your uncle would have been beneficial.

Regarding working for your uncle’s restaurant in the future, it’s possible, but it would require a different approach. To qualify for a Skilled Worker Visa, the role needs to be genuinely advertised and filled by a qualified candidate. If your uncle was willing to hire a UK resident or someone already holding a visa for a suitable role – perhaps a role that doesn't require sponsorship – that would be a pathway. 

Alternatively, you could explore opportunities within the restaurant that don't require sponsorship, such as a more junior role like a supervisor or assistant manager, once you gain relevant experience in the UK.

Would you like me to explore any of these potential pathways in more detail, or perhaps help you consider other options for working in the UK that don’t involve sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that would be helpful, yes. What other visa options might work for someone in my situation who wants to work in the UK? I'm open to different pathways that don't involve my uncle trying to sponsor me for a position that doesn't really exist.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s explore some alternative visa options that might be suitable for your situation, Omar.

Here are a few possibilities to consider:

*   **Youth Mobility Scheme Visa:** If you're under 30 and a citizen of a participating country, this visa allows you to live and work in the UK for up to two years. However, it’s only available to citizens of specific nations.

*   **Temporary Worker Visa - Specific Occupational Shortage List:** The UK government maintains a list of occupations facing shortages. If your skills align with a role on this list, you might be eligible for a visa. This would require a licensed sponsor to offer you a job.

*   **Global Talent Visa:** This visa is for leaders or potential leaders in fields like science, humanities, engineering, arts, and digital technology. It’s based on endorsement from a recognized body.

*   **Skilled Worker Visa (with a different employer):**  You could look for a genuinely advertised position through a UK-based company that is willing to sponsor you. This would require a different employer than your uncle’s restaurant.

To help me narrow down the best options for you, could you tell me:

1.  What is your age?
2.  What are your specific skills and qualifications (beyond your experience in the restaurant)?
3.  Are you a citizen of a country that participates in the Youth Mobility Scheme?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 27 years old. I have a bachelor's degree in business administration from my home country, and as I mentioned, about two years of experience working in my uncle's restaurant back home as a server. I'm from Egypt, so I don't think that's part of the Youth Mobility Scheme. I also speak Arabic, English, and a bit of French.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that additional information, Omar. Given your age, qualifications in business administration, and your language skills – particularly Arabic – let’s focus on a few of the most promising options.

Considering your background, the **Temporary Worker Visa - Specific Occupational Shortage List** is potentially worth investigating. The key will be identifying if your skillset aligns with any occupations currently on that list. It’s worth researching which sectors are experiencing shortages in the UK. You might also consider exploring roles within the hospitality sector in areas where there’s a demonstrable need for skilled workers.

The **Global Talent Visa** could also be a possibility, particularly if you can secure endorsement from a recognized body for your business administration skills. It would require demonstrating exceptional talent and potential within your field.

Finally, continuing to actively search for a **Skilled Worker Visa** with a different employer that’s willing to sponsor you remains a viable route, though it might require more patience and persistence.

To help you prioritize your efforts, would you like me to provide you with links to resources that detail the Specific Occupational Shortage List and information on the Global Talent Visa criteria?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate those resources about the Shortage List and Global Talent Visa. Also, do you think my business administration degree could help me qualify for a Skilled Worker Visa with a different company? Would I need to gain more experience first, or could I potentially find an entry-level business role that would sponsor me?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Omar. Let’s get you those resources.

Here are the links you requested:

*   **Specific Occupational Shortage List:** [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-shortage-occupation-list](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-shortage-occupation-list)

*   **Global Talent Visa Information:** [https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa](https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa)

Now, regarding your business administration degree and potential for a Skilled Worker Visa:

Yes, your degree absolutely *can* help you qualify! The Skilled Worker Visa focuses on meeting specific skill requirements – your degree provides a foundation for that. However, it's true that demonstrating relevant *experience* is crucial.

You've correctly identified the possibility of finding an entry-level business role that would sponsor you. While a degree is a strong advantage, some employers might still prefer candidates with a bit more practical experience, particularly in the UK.

Here's a breakdown of what you could do:

*   **Target Companies:** Research UK-based companies in industries you're interested in (e.g., marketing, finance, operations) that are known to sponsor Skilled Worker Visas.
*   **Highlight Transferable Skills:** When applying for jobs, emphasize how your degree and restaurant experience have equipped you with skills like problem-solving, communication, and customer service – skills highly valued in the UK business world.
*   **Consider Internships/Volunteering:** If possible, gaining some short-term experience in the UK through an internship or volunteer role could strengthen your application.

Would you like me to help you with any of these steps – for example, by suggesting resources for finding companies that sponsor Skilled Worker Visas or offering advice on tailoring your CV to highlight transferable skills?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave incorrect guidance. The original scenario clearly states this should be a Skilled Worker Visa refusal case due to failing the "Genuine Vacancy" test. While the agent correctly identified that the job offer would fail this test, they incorrectly proceeded to suggest numerous alternative visa options and resources. The expected outcome was simply that the application would be REFUSED for failing the genuine vacancy test, not to provide alternative pathways.
