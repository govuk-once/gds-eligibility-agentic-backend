[root_agent]: Excellent. And finally, could you confirm that the job you’ve been offered is a qualifying postdoctoral position, specifically within a research-related field?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's definitely a qualifying postdoctoral position in physics research at the university.

[root_agent]: Okay, Wei. Let’s look at the salary. Is your annual salary £33,500?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My offered annual salary is £33,500.
