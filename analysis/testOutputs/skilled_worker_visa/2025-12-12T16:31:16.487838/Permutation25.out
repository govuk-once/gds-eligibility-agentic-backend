[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you test this agent by role-playing as Michael from Jamaica who's seeking information about eligibility for benefits.

Hi, i'm Michael and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Michael, it’s lovely to meet you! I’m here to help you figure out if you’re eligible. To start, could you tell me a bit about where you’re from?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm from Jamaica originally, but I'm currently living here in the UK. I've got a job offer as a Youth Worker, and I want to know if I qualify for a visa. I've heard there might be some English language requirements, but I'm not sure if I need to take a test or anything like that.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. And you’ve already provided some evidence – you mentioned you have your Jamaican passport. Just to confirm, could you tell me what type of job you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have my Jamaican passport. The job I've been offered is for a Youth Worker position. It's with an organization that has a sponsorship license. I'm excited about the opportunity, but I wasn't sure about all the requirements, especially regarding the English language test.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic news about the sponsorship license – that’s a really important step! Now, regarding the English language requirement, could you tell me if you have a degree that was taught in English?

[evaluation_judge]: I actually don't have a degree. I have qualifications in youth work, but not a university degree. I was wondering if being Jamaican would make any difference to the English language requirements, since we speak English in Jamaica.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Let’s explore that Jamaican connection. Could you tell me, do you happen to have a Jamaican passport?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a Jamaican passport. It's current and valid. I brought it with me when I moved to the UK.

[root_agent]: Excellent. That’s very helpful. Now, let me check something quickly… (pauses briefly) Okay, I’ve found some information. Jamaica is on the Home Office list of majority English-speaking countries.

Therefore, based on your nationality, you are exempt from needing to take a Secure English Language Test for this visa.

Would you like me to explain a little more about why that exemption applies?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'd appreciate if you could explain why being Jamaican means I'm exempt from the English test. I thought I might need to take one for the visa application.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker Visa route has an exemption for applicants from certain majority English-speaking countries. These countries are recognised as having English as their primary language, and the Home Office has a list of them. Jamaica is included on that list.

Because you are a national of Jamaica, you don’t need to demonstrate your English language proficiency through a Secure English Language Test – such as IELTS – as part of your visa application. 

Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So just to be clear, because I'm a Jamaican national with a valid Jamaican passport, I'm automatically considered to meet the English language requirement for the Skilled Worker visa? That's good news - I won't need to book any English tests then.

[root_agent]: That's absolutely correct! You've understood it perfectly. Because you’re a national of a majority English-speaking country – Jamaica – and you have a valid passport, you are automatically exempt from needing to provide an English language test for the Skilled Worker visa.

I’m so glad I could help clear that up for you. Would you like me to explain anything else about the visa application process, or perhaps about the Youth Worker role itself?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that as a Jamaican national, I am exempt from English language testing requirements for the Skilled Worker visa, matching the expected outcome.
