[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you test the agent in the role of someone seeking benefits information. I'll act as Tariq, who has been in the UK on visas for several years and is looking into a new skilled worker visa application.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s start.

Hello Tariq, thank you for speaking with me today. I understand you’re looking into applying for a Skilled Worker Visa. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me, what type of visa have you held in the UK previously?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Tariq and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

I've been offered a job as a Junior Data Analyst in the UK with a salary of £34,000. My employer wants to sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa for 2 years. I previously spent 3 years on a PhD Student visa and then 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa which I'm currently on. I'm wondering if I qualify for the New Entrant discount on the salary requirements.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing me with that information, Tariq. That’s very helpful.

Just to clarify, you’ve spent 3 years on a PhD Student Visa and 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa – is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I spent 3 years completing my PhD on a Student visa, and then I've been on a Graduate visa for the past 3 years and 6 months. My current Graduate visa will be expiring soon, which is why I'm looking at this Skilled Worker visa option with the new job offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

Let’s talk about the New Entrant discount. Do you understand that this discount is only available for a maximum combined total of 4 years, including time spent on Student/Graduate visas?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that 4-year limit. I thought the New Entrant discount was just about the salary threshold. Can you explain more about how this works with my previous visas? Does my time on the Student visa and Graduate visa count toward this 4-year limit?

[root_agent]: Absolutely, let’s clarify that. Thank you for asking – it’s important to get this right.

You’re correct to think the salary threshold was the main consideration, but there’s an additional limit on the “time spent” that counts towards the New Entrant discount. 

My understanding is that time spent on a *Student* visa generally doesn't count towards this 4-year limit. However, time spent on a *Graduate* visa *does* count.

Given that you’ve been on a Graduate visa for 3 years and 6 months, could you confirm if that’s entirely accurate based on your understanding of your visa details?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's accurate. I've been on my Graduate visa for 3 years and 6 months now. I didn't realize that the Graduate visa time counted toward this New Entrant limit, but the Student visa time didn't. So what does this mean for my application? Will I still qualify for the New Entrant discount with my job offer of £34,000?

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that detail, Tariq.

Let’s break this down. Because you’ve spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa, that adds to the time you’ve spent in the UK. This means you’ve already used a significant portion of the 4-year limit for the New Entrant discount.

Based on the information you’ve provided – 3 years on a Student visa and 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa – it appears you've already used 4 years of time. Therefore, you wouldn't be eligible for the New Entrant discount.

Would you like me to explain what your options might be if you were to apply for the visa without the discount?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would like to know what options I have. So if I understand correctly, I can't apply using the New Entrant discount because I've already used up the time allocation with my Graduate visa. What would the salary requirement be without the discount? And is there any other way I could qualify with my current salary offer of £34,000?

[root_agent]: You’ve got it exactly right. You won’t be able to apply using the New Entrant discount given your previous visa history.

Let’s look at the salary requirements without the discount. According to the Skilled Worker visa rules, the minimum salary for a Junior Data Analyst is £33,400. Your job offer of £34,000 meets that threshold.

However, because you aren’t eligible for the New Entrant discount, you'll be required to meet the full salary requirement of £33,400.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding your visa options, Tariq?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit confused now. If the full salary requirement is £33,400 and my job offer is £34,000, then it sounds like I do meet the requirement even without the New Entrant discount. Is that correct? Would I be able to apply for the 2-year Skilled Worker visa with my current job offer?

[root_agent]: You're right to be a bit confused, Tariq – let’s clear that up.

You’ve correctly identified that your job offer of £34,000 *does* meet the minimum salary requirement of £33,400. However, because you are not eligible for the New Entrant discount, you *must* use the full £33,400 salary for the visa application.

Therefore, while your offer meets the minimum, it’s not the *discounted* salary that would be used.

So, to answer your question directly: Yes, you would be able to apply for a 2-year Skilled Worker visa with your current job offer of £34,000, but you’ll be applying under the standard salary requirements, not utilizing the New Entrant discount.

Does that make more sense now?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes much more sense now. So I can still apply for the 2-year Skilled Worker visa with my £34,000 salary offer, but I'll be applying under the standard requirements rather than the New Entrant discount. That's good news that I can still proceed with the application. 

Is there anything else I should be aware of regarding my application or any other requirements I need to meet?

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news, Tariq – I’m glad we’ve clarified things.

Yes, there are a few other important things to be aware of. Beyond meeting the minimum salary and being eligible for the standard Skilled Worker visa route, you’ll need to provide evidence of your qualifications, a genuine job offer, and sponsorship from your employer. They’ll also need to demonstrate that they are a licensed sponsor.

Additionally, you’ll need to pass a skills assessment to confirm you meet the required English language proficiency and occupational qualifications for a Junior Data Analyst. 

Would you like me to point you towards any specific resources on the UK Visas and Immigration website that detail these requirements in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information. The agent misunderstood that since Tariq has spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa (which counts toward the 4-year New Entrant limit), he would not be eligible for the full 2-year visa as a New Entrant. Instead, the agent incorrectly told Tariq he could still apply for the full 2-year visa with his current salary when this would exceed the 4-year maximum New Entrant time limit.
