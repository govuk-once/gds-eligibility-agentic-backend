[evaluation_judge]: I'll help evaluate the agent by role-playing as Tom, a banker whose salary has been reduced below the visa threshold.

Hi, i'm Tom and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Tom, it’s good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and determine if you might be eligible for something, could you tell me what kind of work you do currently?

[evaluation_judge]: I work as a banker. I've been with a UK bank for about 2 years now on a sponsored visa. They brought me in from overseas.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And to confirm, you’re currently earning a salary of £50,000 as a banker, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, that's actually what I wanted to talk about. I was initially earning £50,000 when I got my visa, but our bank just announced a 20% salary reduction for everyone due to an economic downturn. So my salary is going to be reduced to £40,000 next month. I'm worried about how this affects my visa status since I'm sponsored.

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, Tom. That’s definitely a worrying situation. Let’s explore this further. Just to be clear, this salary reduction happened *after* your visa was granted, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I was granted my visa about 2 years ago when I was initially hired at £50,000. This salary reduction is just being announced now due to the economic downturn the bank is facing.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Tom. It’s important to have that detail. Now, could you tell me, what type of visa did you initially receive – was it a Skilled Worker visa, or perhaps another type of work visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a Skilled Worker visa. The bank sponsored me as they needed someone with my specific expertise.

[root_agent]: Okay, a Skilled Worker visa. And to confirm, the Skilled Worker visa threshold is currently £41,700, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe so, yes. That sounds right from what I remember when my visa was processed.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tom. Just one more quick question before we discuss the implications: Is your employer currently maintaining your salary at £41,700 or above, or has it already dropped below that amount with the reduction?

[evaluation_judge]: The reduction hasn't taken effect yet, but when it does next month, my salary will drop to £40,000, which is below the £41,700 threshold.

[root_agent]: Okay, Tom. Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you hold a Skilled Worker visa, were initially sponsored at £50,000, and your salary will be reduced to £40,000 next month, falling below the £41,700 threshold – **Sponsorship Termination** is likely to occur. 

The Home Office requires that your salary remains above the minimum threshold for your visa category after it’s granted.  Your employer will need to either maintain your salary at £41,700 or end your sponsorship. 

Do you want me to elaborate on the options available to your employer, or would you like to discuss what steps you might want to take?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you please explain what options my employer might have and what steps I should take? This is quite worrying for me.

[root_agent]: I understand this is worrying, Tom. Let’s go through the options.

Your employer has two main options:

1.  **Maintain Salary:** They could choose to maintain your salary at £41,700 or above. This would allow them to continue sponsoring you under your Skilled Worker visa.

2.  **Sponsorship Termination:** If they cannot or choose not to maintain your salary, they would need to terminate your sponsorship. This would likely mean you would need to apply for a new visa.

**Regarding what you should do:**

*   **Speak to your HR department immediately:** Discuss the situation and the potential outcomes with your Human Resources department. They will be able to advise on the best course of action for the company.
*   **Understand the timeline:** Be aware that sponsorship termination typically happens within 31 days of the salary reduction taking effect.
*   **Start exploring visa options (if termination is likely):** If termination is a possibility, begin researching alternative visa options that you might be eligible for.

Would you like me to delve deeper into any of these points, such as the process for visa renewal if sponsorship is terminated, or perhaps discuss the potential implications for your employment?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining. I think I'll need to speak with our HR department right away to see if they're aware of this issue. One last question - if my sponsorship is terminated, how much time would I have to either find another sponsor or leave the UK?

[root_agent]: Okay, Tom. That's a very important question.

If your Skilled Worker sponsorship is terminated, you generally have **60 days** from the date of termination to leave the UK. Within that 60-day period, you *can* attempt to find a new sponsor. However, securing a new sponsorship isn’t guaranteed and can be a lengthy process.

It's important to note that this 60-day period starts from the date your employer formally notifies the Home Office of the termination.

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official guidance from the Home Office on what happens after sponsorship termination? [https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-a-worker/what-happens-if-sponsorship-is-terminated](https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-a-worker/what-happens-if-sponsorship-is-terminated)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that link would be helpful. I appreciate all the information you've provided. I'll definitely speak to HR first thing tomorrow to see what can be done about this situation. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Tom. I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. I wish you the best of luck in discussing this with your HR department and navigating the situation. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that my sponsorship would need to be terminated if my salary dropped below the £41,700 threshold (to £40,000). They accurately explained that the employer must either maintain my salary at the threshold or end the sponsorship, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
