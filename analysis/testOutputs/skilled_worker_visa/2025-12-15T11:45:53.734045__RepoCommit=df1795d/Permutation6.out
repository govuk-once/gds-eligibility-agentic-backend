[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Wei, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about your current occupation?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a physicist from China, and I've been offered a Postdoctoral Researcher position at a university in the UK. I'm trying to understand if I would qualify for a work visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And to confirm, this is a postdoctoral position, correct? Could you tell me the occupation code for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a Postdoctoral Researcher position. The occupation code is 2114, which I believe is for Physics professionals.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And could you tell me what salary you’ve been offered for this position, per year?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £33,500 per year for this postdoctoral researcher position.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And could you tell me what the standard going rate is for this type of role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand the standard going rate for this role is £46,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Alright. Just to clarify, is there a valid sponsor, such as an employer, who is willing to support your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the university that offered me the position is a valid sponsor. They are willing to support my visa application.

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear. Now, regarding your English language skills, do you hold any official certifications demonstrating your proficiency?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have passed the IELTS test at the required level for visa applications.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Finally, could you confirm that this specific postdoctoral position – occupation code 2114 – falls under the category of qualifying postdoctoral roles as defined by the Skilled Worker visa route?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand that occupation code 2114 for Physics professionals falls under the qualifying postdoctoral roles for the Skilled Worker visa route.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Wei. Based on this information – a qualifying postdoctoral position (code 2114), a salary of £33,500, a sponsoring employer, and demonstrated English language proficiency – you appear to meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker visa. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspects of the visa process?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you confirm whether my salary offer meets all the necessary requirements? I've heard there are specific thresholds for the Skilled Worker visa. Does my £33,500 salary qualify me?

[root_agent]: Let’s look at that. The Skilled Worker visa requires a salary that meets a lower general threshold of £33,400. Your salary of £33,500 meets this threshold. Furthermore, the standard going rate for a role like yours is £46,000, which is 70% of that figure.  Your salary of £33,500 is above 70% of the standard going rate. 

Therefore, based on these criteria, you qualify for the discount specifically designed for scientific research roles.

**AWARDED.**

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the clarification. So my salary of £33,500 meets both the general threshold of £33,400 and is above 70% of the standard going rate (which would be £32,200). That's really helpful to know that I qualify for the visa under the scientific research roles discount.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker visa. They accurately stated that my salary exceeds both the lower general threshold (£33,400) and 70% of the going rate (£32,200), meeting the requirements for the postdoctoral position discount.
