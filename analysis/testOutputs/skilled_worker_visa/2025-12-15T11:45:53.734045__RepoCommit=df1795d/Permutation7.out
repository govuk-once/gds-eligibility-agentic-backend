[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Kenji in this scenario to test the agent's understanding of UK skilled worker visa salary thresholds.

Hi, i'm Kenji and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Kenji, it’s nice to meet you. To help me understand your situation and see if you might be eligible, could you tell me what kind of work you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello there! I work as a graphic designer, and I recently received a job offer from a company in the UK. I'm from Japan and I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a work visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And could you tell me what salary the company is offering you for this graphic designer role?

[evaluation_judge]: They're offering me £30,000 per year for the graphic designer position. It's a full-time role with a company based in London.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Kenji. Just one more question for now – do you currently live in the UK, or are you planning to move from overseas?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently living in Japan, and I would be moving to the UK if I accept this job offer. I've never lived in the UK before.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me what qualifications you have that relate to graphic design?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a bachelor's degree in Graphic Design from a university in Tokyo, and I've been working as a professional graphic designer for about 5 years now. I also have several industry certifications in design software like Adobe Creative Suite.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent, Kenji. Now, regarding the salary – the Skilled Worker visa has minimum salary requirements. Could you confirm the exact salary you’re being offered, including any potential bonuses or overtime?

[evaluation_judge]: The base salary is £30,000 per year. There are no guaranteed bonuses included in my contract, though they mentioned potential performance bonuses after my first year. But those aren't guaranteed, so I understand the official offer is just the £30,000 base salary.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Kenji. I need to check a specific requirement for the Skilled Worker visa. Would you mind if I ask you about your English language skills?

[evaluation_judge]: My English language skills are quite good. I've taken the IELTS test and scored above the requirements for the visa. I use English regularly in my current job when working with international clients, so I'm confident my English skills meet the requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to hear. Just one more quick question before I assess your eligibility. Could you tell me, do you have a job offer from a UK-based sponsor who is willing to sponsor you for a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company that's offering me the job is based in the UK and they've confirmed they're a licensed sponsor for the Skilled Worker visa. They've already mentioned they're willing to sponsor me for this role and handle the necessary paperwork for my application.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Kenji. I’ve checked the requirements for the Skilled Worker visa, considering your salary of £30,000, your qualifications, and the fact that the company is a licensed sponsor.

Unfortunately, based on the current criteria, your salary falls below the minimum required threshold. The standard threshold is £41,700, and the lower threshold is £33,400. As you’re moving from overseas, you need to meet at least the lower threshold.

**REFUSED.**

I’m sorry I don’t have better news for you at this time.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that my application would be refused because my offered salary of £30,000 is below the absolute minimum salary floor of £33,400 for the Skilled Worker visa route, regardless of other qualifications.
