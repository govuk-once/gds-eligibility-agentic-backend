[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Julian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Julian, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your eligibility, could you please tell me what kind of visa you are applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm interested in applying for a UK work visa. I've received a job offer as a Sales Director from a UK company, and I'm trying to figure out if I qualify.

[root_agent]: That's great! The most common work visa is the Skilled Worker Visa. Is that the visa you are applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm applying for the Skilled Worker Visa. I've been offered a Sales Director position with a UK company, and I want to make sure my salary meets the requirements.

[root_agent]: Excellent. To assess if your salary meets the requirements, could you please tell me your annual salary as stated in your job offer? Please state the figures as clearly as possible, for example, "£X base salary + £Y bonus".

[evaluation_judge]: Sure. My job offer includes £35,000 base salary, plus £20,000 guaranteed commission, and £10,000 performance bonus. So the total package is £65,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Julian. Just to clarify, is the £20,000 commission a fixed amount guaranteed by your contract, or is it dependent on your sales performance?

[evaluation_judge]: The £20,000 commission is mentioned as "guaranteed" in my contract, but it's still labeled as commission rather than basic pay. My understanding is that it's a target earning they're promising, though it is tied to my sales role. The £10,000 bonus is definitely performance-based.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Julian. To confirm, the £35,000 is your guaranteed *basic* salary, and the remaining amounts are categorized as commission and bonus, even if the commission is described as "guaranteed"?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The £35,000 is my guaranteed basic salary. The remaining amounts are categorized specifically as commission and bonus on my offer letter, even though they described the commission portion as "guaranteed."

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Do you know if the company you are working for is a licensed Sponsor with the Home Office? You can usually find this information on the company's website, or they can tell you directly.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company is a licensed Sponsor with the Home Office. They confirmed this when they offered me the position.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear. Considering the information you've provided, the Home Office will likely assess your salary based on the £35,000 basic salary alone. Unfortunately, as the current standard threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa is £41,700, and only the basic salary counts towards this, your application would likely be **refused** based on salary. 

Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please do explain in more detail. I'm confused because I thought my total package of £65,000 would be enough to qualify. Why doesn't the guaranteed commission count?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Skilled Worker Visa rules are very specific about what counts towards the salary threshold. While your total package of £65,000 looks attractive, the Home Office only considers the **guaranteed basic gross pay** when assessing eligibility. 

Allowances, bonuses, and even *guaranteed* commission are generally not included in this calculation, or are heavily scrutinized if not strictly defined as 'basic pay'. This is because these additional earnings are often variable or dependent on performance, and the Home Office wants to ensure applicants have a stable, guaranteed income.

Even though your commission is described as “guaranteed”, because it is still categorized as “commission” and not “basic salary” on your offer letter, it is unlikely to be accepted towards meeting the £41,700 threshold. The £10,000 performance bonus is also excluded as it is explicitly performance-based.

Therefore, only the £35,000 basic salary is considered, which falls below the required threshold. Does that make the situation clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, thank you for explaining that so clearly. I understand now that only my basic salary of £35,000 counts, not the commission or bonus, even if some of it is guaranteed. Since that's below the £41,700 threshold, my application would likely be refused. 

Is there anything I could do to improve my chances? Perhaps negotiate with the employer to restructure the offer with a higher basic salary?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Julian. I'm glad I could clarify things for you.

You are absolutely right – negotiating a higher basic salary with your employer would be the most direct way to improve your chances. If they could increase your basic salary to at least £41,700, you would then meet the threshold. 

Alternatively, you could explore if your role qualifies for a lower salary threshold due to being on the Immigration Skills Shortage List, or if you meet the “New Entrant” criteria (recent graduates). However, these options have their own specific criteria that would need to be met.

Would you like me to provide you with information on the Immigration Skills Shortage List or the New Entrant criteria, or would you prefer to focus on discussing how to approach a salary negotiation with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I think focusing on the salary negotiation would be most helpful for me right now. Could you give me some advice on how I might approach this conversation with my potential employer? I'd like to explain the visa requirements to them and see if they'd be willing to restructure the offer to increase the basic salary.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here's some advice on approaching a salary negotiation with your potential employer, keeping the visa requirements in mind:

1. **Be Prepared:** Before the conversation, re-familiarize yourself with the Skilled Worker Visa salary requirements. Having the information readily available will strengthen your case.

2. **Schedule a Dedicated Time:** Don’t try to squeeze this into a casual conversation. Request a specific meeting to discuss your compensation package.

3. **Express Enthusiasm & Commitment:** Start by reaffirming your excitement about the role and your commitment to the company. This demonstrates you're not just focused on the money.

4. **Explain the Visa Situation Clearly:** Explain that you've been reviewing the Skilled Worker Visa requirements, and you've learned that only the guaranteed basic salary is considered for the threshold. Be polite and frame it as a logistical issue, not a demand. You could say something like: "I'm very excited about this opportunity, and I’m currently reviewing the visa requirements. I’ve discovered that for the Skilled Worker Visa, only the guaranteed basic salary counts towards the minimum threshold, and currently, mine is below that level."

5. **Present a Solution:** Directly ask if they would be willing to restructure the offer to increase the basic salary to at least £41,700. Be prepared to explain why this is important for your ability to secure the visa and join the company.

6. **Be Flexible and Open to Discussion:** They may not be able to offer a full £41,700 increase immediately. Be open to discussing alternative solutions, but remember your goal.

7. **Be Professional:** Even if the negotiation doesn’t go as planned, remain professional and courteous.



Would you like me to help you draft a short email requesting this meeting, or perhaps some example phrases you could use during the conversation?

[evaluation_judge]: That advice is really helpful, thank you. Yes, I would appreciate some example phrases I could use during the conversation to make my case effectively.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! Here are a few example phrases you can adapt for your conversation:

**When explaining the situation:**

*   "I've been researching the Skilled Worker Visa requirements, and I've learned that the Home Office focuses on the guaranteed basic salary when assessing eligibility."
*   "To ensure a smooth visa application process, it seems a basic salary of at least £41,700 is necessary."
*   "I understand the current package is very competitive, and I’m incredibly grateful for the offer. However, due to the visa requirements, I wanted to discuss the possibility of adjusting the basic salary portion."

**When requesting a change:**

*   "Would the company be open to restructuring the offer to increase the base salary to £41,700?"
*   “I was wondering if there’s any flexibility to adjust the basic salary component of the offer to meet the visa requirements?”
*   "I'm confident I can deliver significant value to the team, and securing the visa is a crucial step in making that happen. Would you be willing to consider a slightly higher basic salary to facilitate that?"

**If they express concerns about increasing the base salary:**

*   "I understand budget constraints, and I’m open to discussing potential solutions to make this work."
*   "Perhaps we could explore reallocating a portion of the guaranteed commission to increase the basic salary." (Use this cautiously, as it may not be possible).

**Closing the conversation:**

*   “Thank you for taking the time to discuss this with me. I really appreciate you considering my request.”
*   “I’m very enthusiastic about the role, and I’m hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us.”



Remember to deliver these phrases with a polite and professional tone. Good luck with your conversation, Julian! Let me know if you’d like me to refine any of these phrases or provide additional support.

[evaluation_judge]: These are fantastic, thank you for your detailed advice and the example phrases. They'll be really helpful in framing my conversation with the employer. I appreciate your clear explanation of the visa requirements and confirmation that my current offer wouldn't meet the threshold. You've given me a good path forward to try to resolve this issue.

[root_agent]: You are very welcome, Julian! I’m genuinely pleased I could help. I wish you the very best of luck with your conversation with your potential employer. I hope they are receptive to your request. 

If you have any further questions or need assistance in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’m here to help in any way I can.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be refused because only the basic salary of £35,000 counts toward the threshold, not the commission or bonuses, even if guaranteed. This matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
