[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by role-playing as Wei, a physicist from China seeking information about eligibility for a work visa in the UK.

Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Wei, welcome! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you please tell me, do you have a job offer from a UK employer who is a licensed sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer from a university in the UK. They've offered me a Postdoctoral Researcher position in Physics. They told me they are a licensed sponsor.

[root_agent]: That's excellent to hear, Wei.

Next, is this job at a skill level of RQF level 3 or above? (This generally means a degree or equivalent).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a postdoctoral research position in Physics, which requires my PhD. I believe this would be above RQF level 3 since it requires doctorate-level qualifications.

[root_agent]: Great, that confirms the required skill level.

Do you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa? Namely, can you demonstrate you can read, write, speak and understand English to the required level?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I can demonstrate English language proficiency. I completed my PhD thesis in English and have published research papers in English-language journals. I'm also prepared to take an English language test if needed for the application.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Wei. 

Now, your job offer is for a Postdoctoral Researcher position, correct? And is the occupation code for this role 2111 or 2114?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my job offer is for a Postdoctoral Researcher position in Physics. The occupation code is 2114 - Physical Scientists.

[root_agent]: Excellent. That occupation code *does* qualify for a specific concession.

What is the annual salary offered to you in this position? Please state the amount in pounds.

[evaluation_judge]: The university has offered me £33,500 per year for this position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Wei. 

Do you know what the standard annual salary range is for a Postdoctoral Researcher (occupation code 2114) in the UK currently? If so, could you tell me what that range is?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for my position is around £46,000 per year. That's what the university mentioned when they made the offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Wei.

Based on the details you've provided, it appears you **qualify** for the Skilled Worker Visa under the discounted going rate criteria for postdoctoral positions in science and higher education! 

Your salary of £33,500 meets both the Lower General Threshold of £33,400 *and* is above 70% of the standard going rate of £46,000 (which is £32,200).



Do you have any other questions about this, or would you like me to summarise the reasons for this assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! Just to confirm, so I'm eligible because my salary meets both requirements - it's above the £33,400 minimum threshold and it's also more than 70% of the standard going rate for my occupation? Is there anything else I need to be aware of for my visa application process?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Wei! Your eligibility is confirmed because your salary of £33,500 meets both the £33,400 minimum threshold *and* exceeds 70% of the £46,000 standard going rate for a physical scientist (occupation code 2114).

Regarding other things to be aware of for your visa application:

While your salary meets the requirements, remember you'll still need to meet all other standard Skilled Worker Visa requirements, such as:

*   Providing a Certificate of Sponsorship from your sponsoring university.
*   Demonstrating sufficient funds to cover your initial living expenses.
*   Paying the visa application fee and Immigration Health Surcharge.

I recommend carefully reviewing the full guidance on the Skilled Worker Visa route on the government website to ensure you have all the necessary documentation and meet all criteria. While I've assessed your eligibility based on the information you've provided, the final decision rests with UK Visas and Immigration.

Do you have any questions about any of those other requirements, or anything else related to your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa under the postdoctoral position discount. They accurately identified that my £33,500 salary meets both the minimum threshold (£33,400) and exceeds 70% of the standard going rate (£32,200).
