[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Fatima, a new recruit from overseas, trying to understand her eligibility for a work visa with a B-rated sponsor.

Hi, i'm Fatima and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Fatima, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To best understand your eligibility, could you please tell me what benefit you are referring to?



Specifically, are you looking into eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! Yes, I am looking into my eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa. I've been offered a job at Logistics Co. in the UK, and they mentioned they will sponsor my visa. I'm currently overseas and this would be my first time working in the UK. I just want to make sure everything is in order before I proceed further with the application.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you've received a job offer, Fatima! To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me – is Logistics Co. currently a licensed sponsor with the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they told me they are a licensed sponsor with UK Visas and Immigration. However, they did mention something about having a B-rating at the moment due to some compliance issues they had in the past. They said they're working to get back to an A-rating soon, but I'm not sure if that affects my application since I'd be a new employee. The HR person said they can still assign me a Certificate of Sponsorship, so I just want to make sure everything will be alright.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Fatima. That's important information about Logistics Co.'s B-rating. Just to confirm, is this the *first* time you would be working in the UK with sponsorship from Logistics Co., or have you previously held a Skilled Worker Visa sponsored by them?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, this would be my first time working in the UK with sponsorship from Logistics Co. I've never worked in the UK before at all actually, so I would be a completely new hire for them. They seem very keen to bring me on board, but I'm worried about this B-rating issue.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Fatima. To be certain, could you please tell me what type of job you've been offered, and what skill level it is (e.g., is it at RQF level 3 or above)?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a logistics operations manager position. From what I understand, it's at RQF level 6. The salary is above the going rate for the position and above the minimum threshold for the Skilled Worker visa. The company said the job meets all the skill requirements for sponsorship.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear the job meets the skill and salary requirements, Fatima.

Given that Logistics Co. currently has a B-rating and you are a new recruit – meaning this would be your first sponsorship with them – unfortunately, they are currently unable to assign you a Certificate of Sponsorship.

Do you understand what I mean? Would you like me to explain why?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit confused. I thought they could sponsor me. Why aren't they able to assign me a Certificate of Sponsorship? Yes, please explain why this is happening.

[root_agent]: You're right to ask for clarification, Fatima. I apologize for any confusion.

A sponsor with a B-rating has had compliance issues identified by UKVI. As a result, they are restricted in who they can sponsor. While they *can* continue to sponsor workers they’ve *already* sponsored (for extensions, for example), they are **not permitted to sponsor new workers** when they have a B-rating. 

Because this would be your first time being sponsored by Logistics Co., you are considered a new worker and they are currently unable to assign you a Certificate of Sponsorship.

Does that make more sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make more sense now. I didn't realize that a B-rating would mean they can't sponsor new workers like me. This is very disappointing news. Do you know how long it might take for them to regain their A-rating so they could sponsor me in the future? Or would you recommend I look for opportunities with different companies that have an A-rating?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Fatima. It is frustrating to hear that after receiving a job offer.

Unfortunately, I don’t have specific information about how long it will take Logistics Co. to regain their A-rating – that depends on their progress in addressing the compliance issues identified by UKVI and subsequent re-audits. I cannot predict a timeframe for that.

Given that you're eager to start working in the UK, I would recommend exploring opportunities with companies that currently hold an A-rating. This would likely be the quickest path to securing a Skilled Worker Visa.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you’d like me to reiterate the key points about the B-rating and sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I understand the situation now. I'll need to speak with Logistics Co. about this and perhaps look for other opportunities with A-rated sponsors. Thank you for explaining this to me - it's saved me from pursuing something that would have been rejected. I appreciate your help.

✓ The agent correctly informed me that as a B-rated sponsor, Logistics Co. cannot assign a Certificate of Sponsorship to me as a new hire, which matches the expected outcome of being unable to assign CoS.
