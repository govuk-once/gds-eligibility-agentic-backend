[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Katarina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Katarina, it's good to speak with you. I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant. To understand your eligibility, could you tell me what type of work you do?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a waitress at a high-end event venue. I was wondering if I'd be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thanks, Katarina. That’s helpful to know. To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you please tell me what type of contract you have with the event venue – for example, is it a fixed-term contract, a permanent contract, or something else?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a zero-hours contract with the venue. They pay me £20 per hour.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. A zero-hours contract is good to know. Approximately how many hours per week do you *expect* to work under this contract?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, my employer said they expect me to work about 40 hours a week. In their offer letter they mentioned that would total to around £41,600 a year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Katarina. To clarify, is the 40 hours a week *guaranteed* in your contract, or is it an expectation of the hours you *might* work?

[evaluation_judge]: It's not guaranteed in my contract. It's just what they expect or hope I'll work. That's the nature of a zero-hours contract - they don't have to give me any minimum number of hours.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so clear, Katarina. Based on the information you’ve provided, it seems your contract doesn’t guarantee a minimum number of hours.

To be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa, the salary needs to be guaranteed. Because your contract is a zero-hours contract, even though the hourly rate is good and the expected annual salary is high, the Home Office wouldn't accept this as meeting the salary requirements.

Therefore, based on this information, it appears you would unfortunately be **REFUSED** a Skilled Worker visa with this current contract. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So even though the hourly rate is good and my employer thinks I'll earn enough, because I'm on a zero-hours contract with no guaranteed minimum hours, I don't qualify for the Skilled Worker visa. That's unfortunate, but I understand. Thank you for explaining.

✓ The agent correctly determined I would be REFUSED a Skilled Worker visa because my zero-hours contract doesn't guarantee any minimum hours, making the salary effectively £0 in guaranteed terms, even though the hourly rate and expected earnings would otherwise be sufficient.
