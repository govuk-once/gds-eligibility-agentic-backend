[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Amara and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Amara, welcome! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for a Skilled Worker visa. I'm an architect from Nigeria and I've received a job offer in the UK. I'm just not sure if I qualify based on my part-time schedule.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Amara. A Skilled Worker visa sounds like a good fit. 

To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me your proposed annual gross salary for this role? (This is your salary *before* any deductions like tax or National Insurance).

[evaluation_judge]: The job is offering me £35,100 per year. I'll be working 3 days a week (22.5 hours) at £30 per hour so I can have time to study privately. If I worked full-time, it would be equivalent to about £58,500 annually.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Amara. That's very helpful.

Do you know if the job offer meets the 'going rate' for an Architect, according to the government's list of eligible occupations? (Don't worry if you don't know offhand, just let me know and I can try to help you find that information later!).

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the going rate for architects is being met because my hourly rate is £30 per hour, which is quite high for the profession. I was told that if I worked full-time at this rate, it would be equivalent to £58,500 per year. I'm just not sure if working part-time affects my eligibility even though the hourly rate meets the requirements.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Amara. It sounds like your hourly rate is competitive.

To confirm, are you aware of the current general salary threshold for a Skilled Worker visa? It's currently £38,700, but can be £41,700 depending on certain factors. Are you aware of those factors?

[evaluation_judge]: I was told that for my profession, the standard Skilled Worker visa salary threshold is £41,700. But I wasn't sure if this amount could be pro-rated since I'll be working part-time. Since my hourly rate is high (equivalent to £58,500 if I worked full-time), I wondered if that would make a difference for my application.

[root_agent]: You're right to ask about pro-rata calculations, Amara, as it can be a complex area.

Just to be absolutely clear, do you understand that the £41,700 threshold is generally an *annual salary* requirement – meaning you need to earn at least that much per year, not just an equivalent hourly rate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand it's an annual salary requirement of £41,700. My concern is that since I'm only working part-time (3 days a week), my actual annual salary will be £35,100, which falls below the threshold. But my hourly rate is equivalent to a full-time salary of £58,500. I wasn't sure if there were exceptions for part-time workers where the threshold could be pro-rated based on hours worked.

[root_agent]: You've explained the situation very clearly, Amara.

Unfortunately, while the hourly rate *can* be pro-rated to demonstrate it meets the 'going rate,' the general salary threshold of £41,700 is usually a hard floor that *cannot* be pro-rated in your situation. Your annual salary of £35,100 is below that threshold, regardless of your hourly rate.



Based on the information you've provided, it appears you unfortunately do not meet the salary requirements for a Skilled Worker visa at this time. Would you like me to explain this further, or discuss other potential options?

[evaluation_judge]: I appreciate the clear explanation. That's disappointing to hear. Yes, I would like to understand what options I might have. Could I perhaps increase my hours to meet the threshold? Or are there any alternative visa routes that might be suitable for my situation?

[root_agent]: You’re welcome, Amara. I understand it's disappointing news. Let's explore your options.

Increasing your hours would certainly be one way to meet the threshold, if that’s feasible with your study plans. To meet the £41,700 threshold, you would need to earn approximately £718.85 per week before tax – or roughly 30 hours a week at your current rate of £30 per hour.

Are you open to discussing increasing your working hours, or would you prefer to explore alternative visa routes first?

[evaluation_judge]: Increasing to 30 hours per week might be possible, but it would significantly cut into my study time. I'd be interested in hearing about alternative visa routes first, if there are any that might suit my situation, and then I can weigh my options.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Amara. Let's look at alternatives.

However, the Skilled Worker visa is generally the most straightforward route for someone with a job offer. Are you eligible for any other type of visa, such as a visa for students? Or, are you currently in the UK on any other type of visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not currently in the UK - I'm still in Nigeria. I'm not planning to formally study at a UK institution, so a student visa wouldn't apply. I simply wanted some time for private self-study alongside my professional work. Are there any other visa categories I might qualify for with my architecture qualifications and job offer?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Amara. That helps narrow things down.

Given your situation – a job offer in the UK as an architect, but wanting time for private study and not enrolling in a formal course – there aren’t any other readily apparent visa routes that would be a better fit than the Skilled Worker visa. Most UK visas require a specific purpose, such as study, work, or family ties, and the Skilled Worker visa is designed for your work offer.

Without meeting the salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa, or pursuing formal study, your options are limited. Would you like me to reiterate the calculation for increasing your hours to meet the threshold, so you can weigh that against the alternatives?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please do tell me again how many hours I'd need to work to meet the threshold. And are there any exceptions at all to the salary threshold? I have heard that some sectors like healthcare have different rules - does architecture have any special considerations?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Amara. 

To meet the £41,700 annual salary threshold, you would need to earn approximately £718.85 per week before tax. At your current rate of £30 per hour, that translates to approximately 23.96 hours per week – essentially, just over 24 hours a week. This is slightly less than the 22.5 hours you initially proposed.

Regarding exceptions, you are right to ask. Certain health and education roles *do* have different rules, and in some cases, the threshold can be reduced. However, unfortunately, architecture is not currently on the list of eligible occupations that qualify for these lower thresholds. You can find the list here: [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skilled-worker-visa-eligible-occupations-and-going-rates](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skilled-worker-visa-eligible-occupations-and-going-rates) (I am unable to provide clickable links, but you can copy and paste this into your browser).

Therefore, as it stands, the standard £41,700 threshold applies to your role as an architect.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So you're saying I would need to increase from 22.5 to about 24 hours per week to meet the threshold? That's actually not as much of an increase as I initially thought. That might be manageable. Is there anything else I should know about the visa requirements before I go back to my employer to discuss adjusting my hours?

[root_agent]: That's right, Amara – an increase of roughly 1.5 hours per week. It’s good to hear that might be manageable!

Yes, there are a few other things to keep in mind regarding the Skilled Worker visa requirements:

*   **Sponsorship:** Your employer must be a licensed sponsor. Do you know if they are? They will need to assign you a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS).
*   **English Language Proficiency:** You’ll need to demonstrate your English language ability, usually by passing an approved English language test.
*   **Financial Requirement:** You’ll need to show you have enough funds to support yourself when you arrive in the UK (currently £1,270).
*   **Criminal Record:** You’ll need to declare any criminal convictions.

It would be worthwhile to review the full guidance on the government website to ensure you and your employer understand all the requirements. Again, here's the link (copy and paste as I can't make it clickable): [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)

I recommend discussing these points with your employer when you discuss increasing your hours. Would you like me to summarise any of these points further?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for this detailed information. I believe my employer is a licensed sponsor as they've sponsored other architects before, but I'll confirm this. My English is proficient as English is widely spoken in Nigeria, but I'll check what tests are accepted. 

The financial requirement shouldn't be a problem, and I have no criminal record. This has been really helpful - I'll speak to my employer about increasing my hours slightly to meet the threshold.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Amara! I’m delighted I could help.

It’s excellent that your employer is likely already a licensed sponsor and that you anticipate meeting the other requirements. Confirming those details will be a great first step.

I wish you the best of luck in your conversation with your employer, and with your Skilled Worker visa application! If you have any further questions down the line, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I do not meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker visa because my part-time salary (£35,100) falls below the required threshold of £41,700, even though my hourly rate is high. They accurately explained that while the going rate can be pro-rated, the general threshold cannot be pro-rated in my situation.
