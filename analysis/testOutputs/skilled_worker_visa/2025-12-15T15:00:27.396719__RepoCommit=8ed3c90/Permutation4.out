[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for certain benefits. 

To start, could you please confirm if you have a job offer in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do. I've been offered a position as a Historical Consultant for a media production company in the UK. I'm an American historian with a PhD in Modern History, and I'm trying to figure out if I qualify for a skilled worker visa.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Sarah! A Historical Consultant role sounds interesting.

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you please tell me what your annual salary would be in this role?

[evaluation_judge]: The company has offered me £35,000 per year for the position. They told me the standard rate for this type of role is around £36,000. I'm hoping it's enough to qualify for the visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Sarah. 

Do you know if the company offering you the position is a licensed sponsor with the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they are a licensed sponsor with the UKVI. They've been very clear about that part of the process.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Sarah.

Now, considering your PhD in Modern History, is the job they are offering you at the required skill level – typically degree level or above?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the job requires my level of expertise. It's definitely a degree-level position, and they specifically wanted someone with a PhD in History since I'll be consulting on historical accuracy for their documentary productions.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And just to confirm, do you meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I meet the English language requirements. As an American, English is my native language, and I've been writing and publishing academic papers in English throughout my career.

[root_agent]: That's perfect, Sarah.

Now, to clarify, your PhD is specifically *in* Modern History, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. My PhD is specifically in Modern History. I completed it at the University of Michigan before working in academia for a few years.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Finally, regarding salary - for a Skilled Worker Visa with a PhD in a non-STEM field, the salary generally needs to be at least £37,500. Does your offered salary of £35,000 meet this threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I wasn't aware of that specific threshold. My offered salary is £35,000, which is below £37,500. The company told me the standard going rate for this role is about £36,000. Does that mean I don't qualify?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Sarah.

Unfortunately, based on the information provided, your application would be **REFUSED**. While the salary of £35,000 is above 90% of the standard going rate of £36,000, it falls below the mandatory £37,500 minimum salary threshold for applicants with a PhD in a non-STEM subject seeking a Skilled Worker Visa. 

You would need a salary of at least £37,500 to qualify under those criteria. I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to clarify any aspect of this decision?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. I was hoping I'd qualify since the salary seemed competitive for the role. Is there any way around this, or would I absolutely need to negotiate a higher salary with the company? Would they need to offer me exactly £37,500 or more?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Sarah. It is frustrating when you meet some criteria but fall short on a specific threshold.

Regarding options, unfortunately, there isn't a way around the £37,500 salary requirement for the Skilled Worker Visa with a non-STEM PhD. You would absolutely need to negotiate a higher salary with the company. 

They would need to offer you **at least** £37,500 - any amount above that would also qualify, but it *must* be £37,500 or more. There aren’t any other avenues to pursue the visa based on your current salary and qualifications.

Would you like me to reiterate any of the requirements, or would you like to explore other potential visa options (although, based on your description, the Skilled Worker Visa appeared to be the most relevant)?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining this clearly. I think I'll try to negotiate with the company to see if they can increase the offer to at least £37,500. That's an increase of £2,500 which doesn't seem unreasonable given the specialized nature of my qualifications.

Are there any other visa categories I might be eligible for as a backup plan in case the salary negotiation doesn't work out?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah. I’m glad I could clarify things for you. Negotiating a £2,500 increase is a reasonable approach, given your PhD and the specialised role. I hope it works out!

As for backup plans, it’s good to be prepared. Based on the information you've provided so far, other visa routes are less likely to be suitable, but here are a couple to briefly consider:

*   **Global Talent Visa:** This is for leaders or potential leaders in specific fields (Science, Humanities, Engineering, Arts and Digital Technology). It’s highly competitive and requires endorsement from a relevant body. As a historian, you *might* qualify if you have a very distinguished career and international recognition. ([https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa](https://www.gov.uk/global-talent-visa))

*   **High Potential Individual (HPI) Visa:** This is for graduates from a list of top global universities. As you already have a PhD, this visa isn’t relevant. ([https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa](https://www.gov.uk/high-potential-individual-visa))

However, both of these are significantly different requirements than the Skilled Worker visa.

It’s important to note that I am only able to provide information based on the details you've shared, and a full assessment by an immigration lawyer would be the most reliable way to determine your eligibility for any visa.

Would you like me to provide any further information on either of those alternative visa options? Or would you prefer to focus on preparing for your salary negotiation?

[evaluation_judge]: I think focusing on the salary negotiation is my best bet at this point. My university isn't on the HPI list, and while I've published in my field, I'm not sure I meet the "exceptional talent" threshold yet for the Global Talent visa.

One last question - if I do manage to negotiate the salary up to £37,500 or higher, is there anything else I should be aware of for the Skilled Worker visa application process?

[root_agent]: That sounds like a sensible plan, Sarah. Focusing on the salary negotiation is definitely the most direct route at this point.

If you *do* successfully negotiate a salary of £37,500 or higher, here are a few key things to be aware of for the Skilled Worker visa application process:

*   **Sponsorship:** Ensure your sponsoring company understands the ongoing sponsor duties they have to fulfill throughout your employment.
*   **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):** The company will need to assign you a CoS, which is a reference number you’ll use in your application. Make sure the salary on the CoS matches the agreed-upon £37,500 or higher.
*   **Skill Level:** Double-check that the job code assigned by the company accurately reflects the skill level of your role (RQF level 6 or above – degree level or equivalent).
*   **Financial Requirement:** You will need to demonstrate you have £1,270 in your bank account for 28 consecutive days, unless your sponsor certifies they will cover your initial living costs.
*   **Documentation:** Gather all required documents, including your PhD certificate, proof of English language proficiency, passport, and the CoS reference number.

The official government website ([https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)) has a comprehensive checklist of required documents and information.

I wish you the very best with your salary negotiation! Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions as you progress through the process.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for all of this information. It's been incredibly helpful. I'll focus on my salary negotiation first and make sure I have all the necessary documentation ready if that works out. I appreciate your detailed guidance!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah! I'm delighted I could help. 

I truly wish you success with your negotiation. Remember to be confident in your value and the expertise your PhD brings to the role.

If you find yourself needing further assistance down the line, please don't hesitate to come back. I’m here to help in any way I can.

Good luck!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be REFUSED due to the salary being below the £37,500 minimum threshold required for non-STEM PhD applications, even though it meets the 90% of going rate requirement. The agent accurately explained I would need a salary increase of at least £2,500 to qualify.
