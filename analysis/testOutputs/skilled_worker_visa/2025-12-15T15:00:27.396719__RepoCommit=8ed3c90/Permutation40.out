[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sophie and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sophie, nice to meet you! I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant.

To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in exploring your eligibility for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a French teacher at a private school here in the UK, and I'm trying to find out if I'm eligible for a UK work visa based on my current salary. I'm from France, so I need to make sure I meet the requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's very helpful, thank you. To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you please tell me your annual gross salary (before taxes)?

[evaluation_judge]: I earn £33,750 per year. I work during term time only, which is 39 weeks per year. If I worked the full 52 weeks, it would be equivalent to £45,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, is your job title specifically "French Teacher," or does it fall under a slightly different occupational code? Knowing the exact job title will help me assess the requirements accurately.





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my job title is "French Teacher" at the private school. I teach French language classes to students.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Do you have a sponsorship certificate from your employer, and if so, what salary level is listed on that certificate? (This is often referred to as the 'going rate' for your role).

[evaluation_judge]: I don't actually have a sponsorship certificate yet. My employer is considering sponsoring me and we're trying to figure out if I would meet the requirements before they go ahead with the application. I'm currently working under a different visa that's expiring soon.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's perfectly understandable. Since you don't have a sponsorship certificate yet, we'll need to consider the standard salary thresholds. 

To confirm, you mentioned your actual annual salary is £33,750 and the full-time equivalent would be £45,000. Are you aware of the current general threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa? It's currently £41,700.





[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't sure about the exact threshold amount. So it's £41,700 currently? That seems quite high. Does it matter that I only work during term time, or is it just based on the total I actually earn?

[root_agent]: You are right to ask about that! It *does* matter that you only work during term time. For term-time workers in the education sector, the salary threshold is based on what you **actually earn** during your working weeks, not the full-time equivalent.

However, the 'going rate' for your specific occupation *can* be pro-rated. But initially, let’s focus on your actual earnings. 

Given your actual annual salary is £33,750, does that meet the £41,700 threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: So if I understand correctly, since my actual earnings are £33,750 and that's below the threshold of £41,700, I wouldn't meet the salary requirements for the visa? Even though if I worked the full year, my salary would be above the threshold?

[root_agent]: Yes, you understand correctly. Based on your actual earnings of £33,750, you do not meet the current general threshold of £41,700 for a Skilled Worker Visa. The full-time equivalent salary isn't considered in this case, as the rules specifically state it's based on what you actually earn for the weeks you work.

Therefore, based on the information provided, your application would likely be **REFUSED** at this time.



Would you like me to explore if there are any other potential routes to eligibility, such as if you held a PhD or were a 'new entrant' to the UK labour market?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly assessed my visa eligibility. While they correctly identified I don't meet the general threshold with my actual salary of £33,750, they contradicted themselves regarding how term-time salaries are treated. They first stated "the salary threshold is based on what you actually earn during your working weeks" but then applied the full annual threshold (£41,700) against my term-time salary without pro-rating the requirement. According to the scenario criteria, while my actual salary must be used (not FTE), the threshold itself should be pro-rated for term-time workers in education.
