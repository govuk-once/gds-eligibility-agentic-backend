[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm James and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi James, it's lovely to meet you! I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant. To get started, could you tell me which benefit you are interested in exploring your eligibility for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm looking to understand if my company can sponsor me for a work visa. I have a PhD in Astrophysics and I've been offered an HR Manager role with a salary of £35,000. I'm wondering if I can get a skilled worker visa with this offer?

[root_agent]: Thank you for the information, James. That's helpful! To start, could you confirm if your company is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office. They told me they have a valid sponsorship license but were unsure about the salary requirements given my PhD qualification.

[root_agent]: That's good to know they have a sponsorship license. Regarding the salary, and considering your PhD, are you aware that the Home Office has specific rules about using a PhD to potentially meet the salary requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I've heard there might be some flexibility in salary requirements for PhD holders, but I'm not entirely sure how it works. The company mentioned that normally they'd need to pay £40,000 for this HR Manager position, but thought my PhD might allow them to offer less. Could you explain how this works?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The Home Office *does* allow a lower salary than the usual 'going rate' for certain PhD holders in STEM subjects. However, the PhD must be relevant to the job you're being sponsored for. 

To clarify, would you say your PhD in Astrophysics is directly relevant to the duties of an HR Manager role?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wouldn't say my PhD in Astrophysics is directly relevant to the HR Manager role. The HR position involves managing people, recruitment, employment policies, and similar human resources functions. My PhD research was focused on black hole physics and stellar evolution. They're completely different fields.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so clear, James. Given that your PhD in Astrophysics isn't directly relevant to the HR Manager role, the Home Office is unlikely to allow the lower salary threshold based on your PhD. 

This means your salary would likely need to meet the standard going rate for an HR Manager, which you mentioned is £40,000.

Do you understand this so far?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. So basically, even though I have a PhD, since it's not relevant to the HR Manager role, I need to meet the standard going rate of £40,000. The £35,000 salary they've offered wouldn't be enough, is that right?

[root_agent]: That is correct, James. Based on the information you've provided, and according to the Skilled Worker Visa requirements, a salary of £35,000 would likely not be sufficient for your visa application, as it falls below the standard going rate for the position and your PhD isn't relevant to the role to justify a lower salary.



Therefore, based on what we've discussed, your application for a Skilled Worker Visa would likely be **REFUSED** at this salary. Would you like me to summarise the key reasons why?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please summarize the key reasons why my application would be refused. That would be helpful.

[root_agent]: Certainly, James. Here’s a summary of why your Skilled Worker Visa application would likely be refused with the current offer:

1. **Irrelevant PhD:** While you hold a PhD, it's in Astrophysics, which the Home Office would likely deem not relevant to the duties of an HR Manager.
2. **Salary Below Going Rate:** Because your PhD isn’t relevant, you cannot utilize the potential salary flexibility offered to PhD holders in relevant STEM fields. This means your salary must meet the standard going rate for the HR Manager position, which is £40,000.
3. **Insufficient Salary:** Your offered salary of £35,000 is below the £40,000 going rate.

Essentially, the Home Office requires the salary to be at the appropriate level *unless* there’s a relevant PhD allowing for a slight reduction – which doesn't apply in your case. 

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or any other aspect of the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be refused. They accurately explained that since my PhD in Astrophysics is not relevant to an HR Manager role, I cannot use the PhD salary discount and must meet the standard going rate of £40,000 rather than the offered £35,000.
