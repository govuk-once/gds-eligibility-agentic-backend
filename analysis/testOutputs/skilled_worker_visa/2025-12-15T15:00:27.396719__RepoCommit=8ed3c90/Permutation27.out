[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Lucas, a software engineer at a startup, inquiring about eligibility for a benefit. I'll engage naturally and then assess whether the agent provides the correct outcome.

Hi, i'm Lucas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Lucas, it's lovely to meet you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you tell me what your job role is?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Software Engineer at a tech startup. I've actually just received a job offer for a Senior Developer position, which is exciting. I'm trying to understand if I'd be eligible for certain benefits with this new role.

[root_agent]: That's fantastic news about the job offer, Lucas! Congratulations. 

To assess your eligibility, could you please tell me what your annual salary will be in this Senior Developer role? Just the guaranteed cash amount, please.

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks! The cash salary they're offering is £30,000 per year. They're also including stock options valued at around £50,000 per year that vest over time, since they're still growing as a company. So the total package is worth about £80,000, but the actual cash component is £30,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Lucas. It's good to know about the stock options, but for the purpose of assessing eligibility, we need to focus on the guaranteed cash salary.

Just to confirm, is the £30,000 the *only* guaranteed income you will receive from this job annually?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The £30,000 is the only guaranteed cash income I'll receive from the job. The rest is in stock options that will vest over time, but that value could change depending on how the company performs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Lucas. 

Could you tell me if you are currently employed in the UK, or are you looking to come to the UK for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, I'm currently living and working in the UK already. This new job offer is also with a UK-based startup.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know. 

Do you know if the job meets the skill level required – that is, is it at a level of RQF level 3 or above? (This generally means A-levels or equivalent).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the Senior Developer role definitely requires a high skill level. It needs specialized knowledge in software development and programming, which is well above RQF level 3. It's a specialized technical position requiring years of experience and knowledge.

[root_agent]: Great, thanks for confirming that.

Finally, are you currently subject to any immigration restrictions or do you have a visa that limits the work you can do?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any immigration restrictions. I'm a UK resident with full working rights here.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Lucas. 

Based on the details you've shared, particularly the annual cash salary of £30,000, I'm afraid you do not currently meet the eligibility requirements. The minimum salary threshold is currently £33,400, and the standard threshold is £41,700. While the total package including stock options is valuable, the Home Office only considers guaranteed salary when assessing eligibility.

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, your application would be **REFUSED**.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that my application would be REFUSED as my guaranteed cash salary of £30,000 falls below both the minimum threshold of £33,400 and the standard threshold of £41,700, properly explaining that stock options are not considered as guaranteed salary by the Home Office.
