[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Pavel from Poland looking for information about visa eligibility. I'll engage with the agent until they provide an eligibility determination, then evaluate whether their conclusion matches the expected outcome.

Hi, i'm Pavel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Pavel, it's lovely to meet you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you please tell me, are you currently located inside or outside of the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently in Warsaw, Poland. I've been offered a job as a mechanic at a garage in the UK, and they've already assigned me a Certificate of Sponsorship from their allocation. I want to make sure everything is in order before I apply for my visa.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you've received a job offer and a Certificate of Sponsorship! 

To clarify, you mentioned the Certificate of Sponsorship came from their *allocation*. Could you tell me whether the Certificate of Sponsorship is a "Defined" CoS or an "Undefined" CoS? The garage should be able to tell you which type it is.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I checked with them earlier and they mentioned it's an "Undefined" CoS. They said they had some spare ones from their annual allocation and thought it would be faster than applying for a new one. They've already given me the reference number to use in my application.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Pavel. That's useful information.

Just to confirm, you are currently in Warsaw, Poland, and the Certificate of Sponsorship you have been assigned is an "Undefined" CoS, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm currently in Warsaw, Poland, and I've been assigned an "Undefined" CoS by the garage that wants to hire me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Pavel. 

Based on the information you’ve provided – that you are currently outside the UK and have been assigned an “Undefined” Certificate of Sponsorship – it appears your visa application would likely be **refused**. 

An "Undefined" CoS can only be used by applicants who are *already* in the UK, while you are applying from Poland. The garage needs to apply for a "Defined" Certificate of Sponsorship specifically for your application as you are applying from outside the UK.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, could you explain a bit more? I'm confused because the garage told me this would speed things up. Will I need to ask them to get a different type of Certificate? What's the difference between "Undefined" and "Defined"?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Pavel. I understand your confusion, and it's good you're asking! It's better to clarify now than to have your application rejected.

Think of it this way: the UK government allocates a certain number of visas to sponsoring companies each year. These are represented by Certificates of Sponsorship. There are two types:

* **Defined CoS:** This is specifically requested *for* an individual applying for a visa from *outside* the UK. It's tied to your specific application and details. The garage has to apply for this specifically *after* you've been identified as a potential employee.

* **Undefined CoS:** These come from the company's annual allocation and are meant for applicants who are *already in* the UK and are switching visa types or extending their stay. They aren’t linked to a specific individual initially.

The garage was trying to be helpful by using one they already had, but unfortunately, because you are applying from Poland, it *needs* to be a Defined CoS. Using an Undefined CoS in your situation will likely lead to your application being rejected as invalid.

Yes, you will need to ask them to apply for a Defined Certificate of Sponsorship for you. It might take a little longer, but it’s essential for a successful visa application.



Does that explanation make things clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's much clearer now. So I'll need to contact the garage and ask them to apply for a Defined Certificate of Sponsorship specifically for me since I'm applying from outside the UK. I wouldn't want my application to be rejected after paying all the fees. How long does it typically take for a company to get a Defined CoS approved?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Pavel. It's very wise to get this sorted out before applying to avoid any wasted fees and disappointment.

Regarding the timeframe for a Defined CoS, it can vary. Generally, the Home Office aims to process CoS applications within **8 working days**, but it can sometimes take longer - up to several weeks, particularly during busy periods. 

It’s best to ask the garage directly, as they will have a better understanding of their own processing times and any potential delays they anticipate. They likely have experience with this process already.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your visa eligibility at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I understand what I need to do now. I'll contact the garage tomorrow to ask them to apply for a Defined CoS for me instead of using the Undefined one they already have. Thank you for helping me avoid a rejected application!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Pavel! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you, and I'm happy to hear you feel more confident about the next steps. 

It was my pleasure assisting you. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.

I wish you all the best with your visa application and your new job as a mechanic in the UK!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be refused because an Undefined CoS cannot be used for an out-of-country application. They accurately explained that I would need a Defined CoS since I am applying from Poland, which matches the expected outcome of refusal stated in the scenario.
