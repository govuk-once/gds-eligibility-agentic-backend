[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Lars from Norway who's looking to check benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Lars and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Lars, welcome! I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant. I can certainly help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you please tell me, do you have a job offer in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do. I've been offered a job as a Specialist Stonemason in the UK. I'm currently living in Norway, but I'm hoping to move to the UK soon for this opportunity.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Lars! 

To assess your eligibility, could you please tell me, does the company offering you the job have a valid Sponsor Licence? In other words, are they approved by the UK government to sponsor workers?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company does have a valid Sponsor Licence. They've been quite clear about that during our discussions.

[root_agent]: Excellent. That's one important requirement met.

Next, Lars, is the skill level of the Specialist Stonemason role at the required level for the visa – which is generally RQF level 3 or above?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the Specialist Stonemason role is at the required skill level. It's a specialized trade that requires significant training and expertise.

[root_agent]: Good to know. Now, Lars, do you meet the English language requirements for the visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. I've been speaking English for many years and have completed the necessary testing to demonstrate my proficiency.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! That's another key requirement checked off the list.

Now, Lars, I understand you are applying for a role as a Specialist Stonemason. Is this role currently listed on the UK's Immigration Salary List?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been told that Specialist Stonemason is on the Immigration Salary List in the UK.

[root_agent]: That's very good news, Lars!

Could you please tell me what your annual salary is for this Specialist Stonemason position?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary offered for the position is £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lars. And do you know what the standard going rate is for a Specialist Stonemason in the UK? (Just the figure is fine).

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for a Specialist Stonemason in the UK is £33,500 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lars, thank you for providing all that information. 

Based on what you've told me: you have a valid sponsor, the job is at the required skill level, you meet the English language requirements, the job is on the Immigration Salary List, your salary of £34,000 meets the £33,400 threshold, and your salary also meets the standard going rate of £33,500.

Therefore, according to the criteria, you would be **AWARDED** eligibility. The Immigration Salary List allows a bypass of the usual £41,700 threshold, provided you are paid at least the standard going rate for your role, which you are.



Do you have any other questions for me, Lars?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! I'm really happy to hear that I'll be eligible. I was a bit worried about the immigration process, so this is very reassuring. I think that covers everything I wanted to know for now. Thank you so much for your help!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Lars! I'm delighted I could provide you with some reassurance. It's understandable to be anxious about the immigration process, but you seem to be in a good position. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. 

Wishing you all the best with your move to the UK and your new role as a Specialist Stonemason!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you very much for your kind wishes. I'm looking forward to starting my new job in the UK. Have a great day!

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for the Skilled Worker visa. They accurately identified that my job being on the Immigration Salary List allows me to bypass the standard £41,700 threshold while still meeting both the lower threshold (£33,400) and the going rate requirement (£33,500). The outcome matches the expected "AWARDED" result.
