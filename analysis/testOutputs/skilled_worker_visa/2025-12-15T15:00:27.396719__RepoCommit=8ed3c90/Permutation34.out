[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of Sarah in this scenario.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you please tell me, is the company you're applying through a licenced sponsor with the Home Office?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my company "Sarah Consulting Ltd" is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office. I'm actually the owner of the company - I own 100% of it and serve as the director. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for a sponsored visa.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear that Sarah Consulting Ltd is a licensed sponsor. Thank you for clarifying that you own 100% of the company and are the director. 

To understand your eligibility further, could you please tell me how you are currently paid by the company - specifically, what portion of your income comes as salary, and what portion comes as dividends (if any)?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I've structured my pay in a tax-efficient way. I take a basic salary of £12,570 per year, which is the personal allowance threshold. Then I take £40,000 in dividends. So my total income is £52,570 annually. I thought this would be enough for visa purposes since my total income is well above the required threshold. Is that going to work for my visa application?

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detailed breakdown of your income, Sarah. It's helpful to understand how you're currently compensated.

To clarify, for visa purposes, does your company deduct income tax and National Insurance contributions from the £12,570 salary through the PAYE system?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the £12,570 is processed through PAYE, so income tax and National Insurance contributions are deducted from that amount, though with it being at the personal allowance level, the tax is minimal. The dividends are taxed separately through my self-assessment tax return. Does that affect my eligibility?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that the £12,570 is processed through PAYE. 

Based on the information you've provided, unfortunately, it doesn't appear you currently meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa. While your total income is above £41,700, only the salary earned through PAYE counts towards that threshold. Dividends do not count. 

Therefore, only the £12,570 currently counts towards meeting the financial requirement. Do you understand this?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I didn't realize that. So you're telling me that even though my total income is over £52,000, only my PAYE salary of £12,570 counts toward the visa requirement? That's disappointing. I thought since I was bringing in enough money overall, it would qualify. Is there any way around this, or would I need to restructure how I pay myself to qualify?

[root_agent]: You've understood correctly, Sarah. Even with a total income exceeding £52,000, only the £12,570 paid through PAYE currently counts towards the visa requirement.

Unfortunately, there isn’t a way around this. To qualify, you would need to restructure your salary to ensure you are paying yourself a minimum of £41,700 *through PAYE* – meaning income tax and National Insurance contributions are deducted from that full amount. You wouldn't be able to rely on dividends to meet the financial threshold.

Would you like me to reiterate any part of this, or perhaps explain the reasoning behind this rule in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, that's quite different from what I expected. So I'd need to increase my PAYE salary to at least £41,700 and pay the full income tax and National Insurance on that amount rather than using dividends. That's going to significantly impact my tax efficiency.

Could you just confirm that this is definitely the case even though I'm the owner of the company? I'm just surprised there's no flexibility given that it's my own business.

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Sarah. Yes, you would need to increase your PAYE salary to at least £41,700 and pay the corresponding income tax and National Insurance.

And you are right to question it - it *does* apply even though you are the owner of the company. The rules specifically state that applicants who are majority shareholders or directors of the sponsoring company must be paid a full PAYE salary to meet the requirements, and dividends do not count towards the threshold. 

There is no flexibility on this point, unfortunately, even if you own 100% of the business. The Home Office applies this rule to ensure genuine employment relationships and prevent potential abuse of the system.



Would you like me to summarise the key points again, just to be absolutely clear?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I understand completely now. I'll need to restructure my compensation to have at least £41,700 coming through as PAYE salary with all the proper tax and National Insurance contributions, regardless of the fact that I own the company. The dividends won't count at all toward this threshold. That's disappointing but clear - thank you for explaining.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah. I'm glad I could clarify the situation for you, even if it wasn't the news you were hoping for. 

It's great that you have a clear understanding of what's required now. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

I wish you all the best with restructuring your compensation and your visa application. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you for your help.

✓ The agent correctly identified that I would not be eligible for the visa with my current pay structure. They accurately explained that only the PAYE salary of £12,570 counts toward the visa requirement, not the dividends, despite my total income exceeding the threshold. The agent correctly stated I would need to restructure my compensation to have at least £41,700 as PAYE salary to qualify.
