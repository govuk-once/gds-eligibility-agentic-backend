[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Yuki and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Yuki, it's lovely to meet you. I understand you're checking your eligibility for something. To start, could you please confirm if your current Skilled Worker visa is still valid?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my Skilled Worker visa is valid. I'm currently working as a Graphic Designer under sponsorship, but I'm wondering if I can take on a weekend job as a bartender for about 10 hours a week to earn some extra money.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear your visa is valid. Thanks for explaining your situation.

To clarify, would the weekend job as a bartender be in the *same* occupation code as your main job as a Graphic Designer?

[evaluation_judge]: No, bartending would be a completely different occupation code than my graphic design work. They're not related fields at all.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

My next question is: is bartending currently listed on the UK government's Immigration Salary List – which details shortage occupations?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't believe bartending is on the Immigration Salary List. As far as I know, it's not considered a shortage occupation in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for checking that. Based on the information you've provided – your visa is valid, the second job isn't in the same occupation code as your primary job, and it isn't on the shortage occupation list – unfortunately, taking on this bartending job would not be permitted under the conditions of your Skilled Worker visa. It would be considered illegal work.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent correctly identified that taking the bartending job would be illegal work, but failed to mention the key condition that I would be permitted to take on freelance Graphic Design work (in the same occupation code) for up to 20 hours per week as specified in the expected outcome.
