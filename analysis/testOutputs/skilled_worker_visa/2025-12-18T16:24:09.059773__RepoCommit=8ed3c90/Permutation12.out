[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Amara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Amara, it's lovely to meet you. I'm root_agent, and I can help you with understanding your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for a Skilled Worker visa for the UK. I have a job offer as an Architect in the UK, and I'm currently living in Nigeria. I've been offered a part-time position where I'd be working 3 days a week (22.5 hours) at £30 per hour. This would give me time to study privately while working. I want to know if I'm eligible for the visa with this arrangement.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Amara. That's very helpful!

To assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa, could you please tell me what your *actual gross annual salary* would be with this part-time position, calculated based on the £30/hour rate and 22.5 hours per week? (Please state the total amount you would earn in a year *before* any deductions.)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the gross annual salary would be £35,100. That's calculated as £30 per hour × 22.5 hours per week × 52 weeks per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Amara. 

Now, are you aware of the current general salary threshold required for a Skilled Worker visa? It's currently £41,700 per year, although there are some exceptions. Do you know if your job role qualifies for a lower threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't aware of the exact threshold. My job role is an Architect. I don't believe it falls under any special exceptions, but I'm not entirely sure. I know my hourly rate is quite high at £30 per hour (which would be equivalent to £58,500 if I worked full-time), but my actual annual salary will be £35,100 due to working part-time.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Amara. You are right to point out your high hourly rate, but unfortunately, the Skilled Worker visa has a general minimum salary threshold that usually applies to the *actual* annual salary earned, not the pro-rated equivalent of a full-time salary. 

Currently, for most roles, the general threshold is £41,700 per year. Given that your actual gross annual salary will be £35,100, it appears you unfortunately do not meet this threshold.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or discuss potential options to explore?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this in more detail. I thought since my hourly rate is high (£30/hour), that would be sufficient. Are there no provisions for part-time workers? I'm confused because if I were working full-time, my salary would be well above the threshold at £58,500. Could you clarify how the rules work for part-time arrangements like mine?

[root_agent]: You’re right to be confused, Amara, and it’s good you’re asking for clarification. The rules *do* allow for the "Going Rate" to be calculated by the hour, and your hourly rate of £30 does indeed meet that. However, the general salary threshold – the £41,700 in your case – is usually a *hard floor* based on your actual annual salary. It's not typically pro-rated, even if your hours are part-time.

Think of it this way: the threshold is designed to ensure Skilled Workers earn a certain amount *annually*, regardless of how many hours they work. While your hourly rate is high, the total amount you earn in a year (£35,100) is below that threshold. 

Essentially, even though a full-time equivalent of your rate would exceed the threshold, the Home Office looks at what you *actually* earn in a year. There aren't provisions to consider the potential full-time equivalent salary for meeting the general threshold in most circumstances.

There are some exceptions to this rule for certain health and transitional roles, but as an Architect, it doesn’t appear those exceptions would apply to your situation.



Does that explanation make things a bit clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make it clearer, though it's disappointing news. So even though my hourly rate would equate to a much higher salary if I worked full-time, I'm still not eligible because my actual annual earnings will be below the threshold of £41,700. 

To confirm my understanding - I would need to either increase my hours or negotiate a higher hourly rate to reach that minimum annual salary of £41,700, is that correct? Are there any other visa options I should be considering with my current job offer?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Amara. You are absolutely correct – to meet the Skilled Worker visa requirements with your current job offer, you would need to either increase your working hours or negotiate a higher hourly rate to ensure your actual annual earnings reach at least £41,700.

Regarding other visa options, with the information I have, exploring alternatives is difficult. The Skilled Worker visa is generally the most appropriate route for someone with a job offer. Other visa routes, such as the Health and Care Worker visa, have specific requirements regarding the job role and employer, which don’t seem to apply here.

Given your circumstances, I recommend focusing on either increasing your salary or hours. You might also want to discuss with your potential employer if a full-time position with the existing hourly rate is a possibility, even for a trial period, to help you meet the visa requirements.

Would you like me to reiterate any part of the Skilled Worker visa criteria, or would you like to explore discussing potential options with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand the situation now. It seems I would need to either work more hours or negotiate a higher rate to meet that £41,700 threshold. I'll need to discuss this with my potential employer to see if we can adjust the arrangement.

Just to be absolutely clear - there's no way for me to qualify for the Skilled Worker visa with my current offer of £35,100 per year, even though my hourly rate is high, correct?

[root_agent]: That is correct, Amara. Based on the information you've provided, there is no way to qualify for the Skilled Worker visa with your current job offer of £35,100 per year, even with the high hourly rate. The annual salary is the determining factor in this instance, and it must meet the £41,700 threshold (unless you fall under a specific eligible exception, which doesn't appear to be the case here).

I'm glad we've been able to clarify the situation for you. It's good you're planning to discuss adjustments with your potential employer. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I'll reach out to my potential employer to discuss possible adjustments to my hours or salary.

✗ The agent provided the correct assessment that I don't meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker visa due to my actual gross salary (£35,100) being below the required threshold (£41,700), despite my high hourly rate. This matches the expected outcome of REFUSED in the scenario.
