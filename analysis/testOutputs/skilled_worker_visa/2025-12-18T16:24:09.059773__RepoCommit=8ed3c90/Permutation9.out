[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Miguel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Miguel, it's good to hear from you! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me what kind of job you have been offered?





[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Band 5 Registered Nurse at an NHS Trust here in the UK. I'm from the Philippines and I'm trying to figure out if I qualify for the Health and Care Visa.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear, Miguel! A Band 5 Registered Nurse at an NHS Trust certainly sounds like a potentially eligible role for the Health and Care Visa.

To confirm, could you please tell me your offered annual salary for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary I've been offered is £28,407, which they told me is the standard entry-level salary for Band 5 nurses in the NHS.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Miguel. £28,407 is helpful to know.

Just to be sure I have all the necessary details, are you currently working *directly* for the NHS Trust, or are you being employed through an agency?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working directly for the NHS Trust. It's a permanent position as a registered nurse at their main hospital.

[root_agent]: Excellent, that’s good to know. Working directly for the NHS Trust is a key part of the Health and Care Visa requirements.

Finally, just to clarify, have you already confirmed that the role of Registered Nurse is on the list of eligible health and social care professions for the Health and Care Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm actually not 100% sure if my role is on the eligible list. I was told that registered nurses are typically eligible, but I wanted to check with you to confirm if my specific situation meets all the requirements.

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible thing to check, Miguel! It’s always best to be certain.

Registered Nurse *is* currently on the eligible occupations list for the Health and Care Visa. So, with that confirmed, and knowing you are directly employed by the NHS Trust as a Band 5 Nurse with a salary of £28,407...

**AWARDED.** Your job meets the criteria for the Health and Care Visa. The standard salary threshold doesn’t apply to eligible health and care roles on the National Pay Scales, and your salary matches the standard Band 5 rate.



Do you have any other questions about the Health and Care Visa, or anything else I can help you with?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I'm eligible for a Health and Care Visa. They recognized that since my job as a Band 5 Nurse at an NHS Trust follows the National Pay Scale (£28,407), I don't need to meet the general threshold of £41,700. The outcome of "AWARDED" matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
