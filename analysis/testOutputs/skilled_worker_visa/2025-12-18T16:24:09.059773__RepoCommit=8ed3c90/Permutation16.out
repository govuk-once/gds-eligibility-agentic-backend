[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to speak with you! I'm root_agent, a helpful assistant. To start, could you tell me what benefit you are hoping to apply for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm looking to see if I'm eligible for a skilled worker visa. My situation is that I have been offered a job as an HR Manager with a UK company at a salary of £35,000 per year. I have a PhD in Astrophysics, and I'm wondering if that helps with my application at all.

[root_agent]: Thanks for clarifying, Sarah. That's very helpful. 

To understand your situation better, could you tell me – do you believe your PhD is directly related to the duties you’ll be performing as an HR Manager?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't think my PhD in Astrophysics is directly related to HR work. I studied things like cosmic radiation and black holes, which doesn't really connect to human resources management. The company is just a regular business consulting firm, not a space or research organization. I just thought having a PhD might help with the visa requirements somehow.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so honest, Sarah. That's very helpful to know. 

Just to confirm, is the typical salary for an HR Manager role in the UK currently around £40,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. From what I understand, the standard going rate for an HR Manager position in the UK is around £40,000. But the company has offered me £35,000, which is £5,000 below that standard rate.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Sarah. 

To clarify, are you aware that having a PhD *can* sometimes allow for a lower salary than the standard going rate for a Skilled Worker Visa, but only under specific circumstances?

[evaluation_judge]: I had heard something about that, which is why I mentioned my PhD. I thought it might help with the visa even though the salary is lower than the standard rate. But I wasn't clear on the exact rules or circumstances where that would apply.

[root_agent]: That's a very good question, Sarah. It's true that a PhD can sometimes be used to offset the salary requirements, but it depends on whether the PhD is relevant to the job.

Given that you've confirmed your PhD in Astrophysics isn't directly related to the duties of an HR Manager role, it's unlikely you would be able to use it to meet the salary requirements for the visa. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So because my PhD in Astrophysics isn't related to HR work, I can't use it to qualify for a lower salary threshold. Which means I would need to meet the standard salary requirement of £40,000 for an HR Manager position to qualify for the skilled worker visa. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Sarah. That is precisely the situation. Because your PhD isn’t relevant to the HR Manager role, it doesn’t allow you to trade the salary down to £35,000 and still meet the visa requirements. You would need to meet the standard going rate of £40,000.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears your application would likely be **REFUSED** at this time. Would you like me to explain any part of this further?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's quite clear. So unless the company increases their salary offer to meet the going rate of £40,000, I wouldn't qualify for the skilled worker visa. Thank you for explaining the requirements to me.

✓ The agent correctly determined that my application would be refused because my PhD in Astrophysics is not relevant to the HR Manager role, meaning I cannot use it to qualify for a lower salary threshold than the standard £40,000 going rate.
