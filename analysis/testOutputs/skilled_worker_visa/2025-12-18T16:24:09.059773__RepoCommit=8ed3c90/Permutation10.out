[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Samuel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Samuel, it's good to speak with you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for different benefits. 

To start, could you tell me the occupation code listed on your job offer? It will be a four-digit number, like 2111.

[evaluation_judge]: I have a job offer as a care assistant with the occupation code 6135. I'm from Ghana, and I've been offered a position as an in-home private carer for a wealthy family here in the UK. The salary they're offering is £45,000, which seems really good. The recruitment agency that arranged this for me says they're a licensed visa sponsor, if that matters.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear about the job offer, Samuel, and £45,000 is a very good salary! The fact the agency is a licensed visa sponsor *does* matter – that’s a good start.

Now, to clarify, is the agency you’re working with registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England? This is important for care worker roles.

[evaluation_judge]: I asked the agency about that actually, and they told me they're not CQC registered. They explained they're just an introduction service that connected me with the family. The family will be my actual employers, though the agency handles the visa sponsorship part. Is that going to be an issue?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Samuel. Yes, unfortunately, that *is* likely to be an issue.

For Skilled Worker Visa applications where the job code is 6135 (Care Worker) or 6136 (Senior Care Worker), the employer – in this case, the family you’ll be working for directly – **must** be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England. 

Because the family employing you aren't CQC registered, your application would likely be refused, even though the agency is a licensed sponsor and the salary is above the threshold.



I'm sorry to deliver that news. Would you like me to explain any of this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. So even though the salary is good and the agency has a sponsorship license, I still can't get the visa because the family isn't CQC registered? Could I ask why that matters? Is there any way around this requirement?

[root_agent]: You're right to be disappointed, Samuel, and it is frustrating when all other aspects seem to be in order. Yes, even with a good salary and a licensed sponsor, the lack of CQC registration is a significant obstacle.

The reason the CQC registration is essential is to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals receiving care. The CQC sets standards for care providers and inspects them to make sure those standards are met. This protects vulnerable individuals from potential exploitation or inadequate care. The government implemented this rule specifically to prevent issues within the care sector.

Unfortunately, there isn't a way around this requirement for a Skilled Worker Visa with occupation code 6135. Private household employment, even with a recruitment agency involved, generally isn’t permitted under this route unless the employer is CQC registered.

I understand this isn't the answer you were hoping for. Perhaps discussing this with the agency might lead them to clarify if they can find you a position with a CQC-registered employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That makes sense even if it's not the news I wanted. So I guess this means my application would definitely be refused because of this CQC registration requirement? I'll have to talk to the agency about finding me a position with a properly registered employer instead. Thank you for explaining everything to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Samuel. And yes, based on the information you’ve provided, it would very likely be refused due to the CQC registration requirement for that specific job code.

It's good you're planning to discuss this with the agency – finding a role with a CQC-registered employer is the best path forward in this situation. 

I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. I wish you the best of luck in your job search!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my visa application would be refused because the employer is not CQC registered, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
