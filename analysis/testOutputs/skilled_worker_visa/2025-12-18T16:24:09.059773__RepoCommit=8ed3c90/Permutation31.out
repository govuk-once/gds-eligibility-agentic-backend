[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on this role and test the agent with this scenario.

Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Elena, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! I'm currently visiting London from the US on a visitor visa. I've been here for about three weeks, and I actually just had a job interview yesterday with a design agency. They offered me a position as a Graphic Designer, and I'm really excited about it! They said they could sponsor me for a Skilled Worker visa, but I'm wondering if I can just apply for that while I'm already here in the UK rather than flying back home to the US. Can I do that?

[root_agent]: That's wonderful news about the job offer, Elena! It's great to hear you're excited. 

To best advise you, could you please confirm what type of visitor visa you are currently holding? Specifically, is it a Standard Visitor visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm on a Standard Visitor visa. I came for a two-month holiday to see some friends here in London. I wasn't actually planning to look for work, but I happened to meet someone at a party who works at this design agency, and they encouraged me to interview. The position sounds perfect for me, and I'd love to avoid the expense and hassle of flying back to the US if I can just apply for the Skilled Worker visa while I'm already here.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Elena. 

Just to be absolutely sure I have all the information, could you tell me how long you've been in the UK on this current visit? You mentioned a two-month holiday – is that still accurate?

[evaluation_judge]: I arrived in the UK about three weeks ago on my Standard Visitor visa. I was planning to stay for a total of two months - that was my original plan for the holiday. But now with this job offer, I'm hoping I can just transition to a Skilled Worker visa without leaving. My Airbnb lease runs for another five weeks, so it would be so convenient if I could just stay here and apply.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that.

To assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa, could you please confirm if the graphic designer role is on the list of eligible occupations for the visa? Don't worry about finding the list yourself, just let me know if you believe the job is eligible, or if you're unsure.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe the Graphic Designer role is eligible for the Skilled Worker visa. The company is a well-established design agency and they've told me they've sponsored other international employees before. They mentioned that the role meets the skill level and salary requirements for sponsorship. They're offering me a good salary that's above the minimum threshold, and they already have a sponsor license. They seemed very confident about being able to sponsor me, so I assume the job is eligible.

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear the job seems to meet the requirements, Elena.

Now, considering you are currently in the UK on a Standard Visitor visa, are you aware of any restrictions on applying for other visas while *inside* the UK on this type of visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not fully aware of the restrictions to be honest. That's why I'm asking about this. I was hoping I could just switch to the Skilled Worker visa while I'm already here. Is that possible, or are there rules against changing from a visitor visa to a work visa without leaving the country? The company wants me to start as soon as possible, and I'd really prefer not to have to fly back to the US just to apply if I don't have to.

[root_agent]: You're right to ask, Elena, as there are specific rules regarding this situation.

Unfortunately, generally you **cannot** switch to the Skilled Worker visa from within the UK while holding a Standard Visitor visa. You would need to leave the UK and apply for "Entry Clearance" from the US (or a country where you have residency) to complete the application process.



Essentially, immigration rules prevent this type of switch from a visitor visa. I understand this isn’t the news you were hoping for, and it’s frustrating to have to potentially travel back to the US.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's disappointing. I was really hoping to avoid the extra travel. So there's no way around this? I definitely need to leave the UK and apply from the US? Is this a strict rule, or are there any exceptions I might qualify for?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Elena. It is a strict rule, and unfortunately, there aren’t exceptions to this rule for switching *from* a Standard Visitor visa *to* a Skilled Worker visa while already in the UK. 

The rules specifically state you generally can't switch from "Visitor" status to a work visa while inside the country. Applying from the US (or a country where you have residency) is the required process in your situation.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's unfortunate but I appreciate the clear information. So my only option is to return to the US and apply from there. How long does the application process usually take once I'm back home? I'm worried about keeping the employer waiting too long.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Elena. I'm glad I could provide clarity, even if it wasn't the answer you hoped for.

Regarding processing times, it's difficult to give a precise timeframe as it can vary. However, currently, the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) aims to process Skilled Worker visa applications submitted *outside* the UK within 15 working days. However, it can sometimes take longer, and it's wise to allow for potential delays.

It’s best to encourage your employer to understand this timeline. You can find more information about current processing times on the UKVI website, although, as I'm unable to provide links, I recommend searching "UK Skilled Worker visa processing times" on a search engine. Would you like me to ask you any further questions to help with your understanding of the process?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining the timeline. That's helpful to know about the 15 working days target, though I'll definitely keep in mind it could take longer. I'll talk to the employer about this timeline and make arrangements to fly back to the US. I appreciate you being straightforward about the rules. I think I have a clear understanding now of what I need to do. I'll look up more details about the application process on the UKVI website once I'm planning my return.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Elena! I'm so glad I could help clarify things for you. 

I wish you all the best with your application and your new role as a Graphic Designer. It sounds like a fantastic opportunity. Please don't hesitate to reach out if any further questions come to mind in the future. Safe travels when you return to the US!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for your help and good wishes! I'll start making arrangements for my return to the US to apply properly. Have a good day!

✓ The agent correctly informed me that as someone on a Standard Visitor visa, I cannot switch to a Skilled Worker visa from within the UK and must return to my home country (USA) to apply. This matches the expected outcome that switching from a visitor visa is not permitted and the application would be invalid/refused if attempted in-country.
