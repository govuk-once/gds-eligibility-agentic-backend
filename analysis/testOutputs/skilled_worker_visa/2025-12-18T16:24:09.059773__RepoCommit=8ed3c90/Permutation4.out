[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's nice to meet you! To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me if you have a job offer with a licenced sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer with a licensed sponsor. I'm an American historian with a PhD in Modern History, and I've received an offer to work as a Historical Consultant for a media production company in the UK. They're offering me £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you have a job offer! To clarify, is this job at a skill level of RQF level 3 or above? This generally means a job at the level of a UK bachelor's degree or equivalent.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the role is definitely at that skill level. It requires my PhD in Modern History for the work as a Historical Consultant. They specifically wanted someone with advanced academic credentials in history to ensure historical accuracy in their productions.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And to confirm, do you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. English is my native language as I'm American.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Now, as you have a PhD, could you please confirm that your PhD is a recognised qualification? Specifically, is it equivalent to a UK PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my PhD in Modern History is from an accredited American university and is recognized as equivalent to a UK PhD. I completed it about two years ago at the University of Chicago.

[root_agent]: Wonderful. Now, regarding your salary, the job offer is for £35,000 per year, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The job offer is for £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Do you know what the standard going rate is for the role of Historical Consultant, according to the government’s occupational salary list?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for my role is about £36,000 per year, according to what my potential employer told me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on the details you've provided, it appears your salary of £35,000 does meet the requirement of being at least 90% of the going rate (90% of £36,000 is £32,400). However, for applicants with a PhD in a non-STEM subject, there's a specific minimum salary threshold of £37,500.

Unfortunately, as your offered salary is below this £37,500 threshold, your application would be **REFUSED** under the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa based on having a PhD in a non-STEM field. 

Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'm confused because I thought having a PhD would make things easier, not more difficult. Could you explain why my application would be refused even though my salary is above 90% of the going rate?

[root_agent]: You're right to feel confused, it can be a bit complex! Having a PhD *can* make things easier, and the 90% of going rate is a pathway for some applicants. However, for PhDs in subjects that aren't Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (non-STEM), the rules are a little different.

The government has set a higher salary threshold – £37,500 – specifically for non-STEM PhD holders. This means even if you meet the 90% of going rate, your salary *must also* be at least £37,500 to qualify. 

Think of it as two hurdles: you need to clear both. You've cleared the 90% hurdle, but unfortunately, your salary doesn't quite reach the £37,500 hurdle. 

This higher threshold is in place to ensure that those with advanced degrees in non-STEM fields are still earning a competitive salary that reflects their qualifications and experience.

In your case, your salary of £35,000 is above 90% of the going rate (£32,400), but it’s £2,500 below the required £37,500. Therefore, the application would be refused. Does that explanation make more sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes more sense now. So if I understand correctly, I need to meet both requirements - the 90% of the going rate AND the minimum £37,500 threshold for non-STEM PhD holders. Since my offer is only £35,000, I'm £2,500 short of qualifying, even though I'm above the 90% going rate threshold. Is there anything I could do to make this work, or would I need to negotiate a higher salary with the employer?

[root_agent]: You understand perfectly! You’ve accurately summarised the situation.

The most direct route to qualifying would be to negotiate a higher salary with your employer. If they were able to increase your salary to £37,500 or above, you would then meet both the requirements and be eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa under the PhD route.

Alternatively, you could explore if the role qualifies under the *general* Skilled Worker Visa salary requirements (which are lower than the PhD threshold - currently £33,700, but rising to £38,700 in April 2024). However, as you have a PhD, your application will automatically be assessed against the higher PhD criteria.

Negotiating a higher salary is the most straightforward approach in your scenario. Would you like me to provide any information about resources for salary negotiation, or explain the general Skilled Worker Visa requirements in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I'll need to talk to the employer about increasing the salary offer. Is there anything specific I should mention to them about these requirements? And is there a timeline I should be aware of for when these rules might change?

[root_agent]: That's a good plan! When you speak with your employer, it would be helpful to explain that the Skilled Worker Visa has specific salary requirements for applicants with PhDs in non-STEM fields. Specifically, you should mention:

*   **The £37,500 threshold:** Emphasize that even though your salary is above 90% of the going rate, it needs to be *at least* £37,500 to meet the Home Office requirements.
*   **The benefit to them:** Explain that increasing your salary to meet this threshold will allow them to successfully sponsor you, avoiding potential delays or complications with the visa application.
*   **Referencing the Gov.uk website:** You can gently mention you’ve reviewed the official guidance on the [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa) website, which outlines these criteria. (Although I wasn't permitted to directly *provide* the link before, you can access it yourself.)

Regarding timeline changes, there are some important dates to be aware of:

*   **April 4th, 2024:** The general salary threshold for the Skilled Worker visa will increase to **£38,700**.
*   **The PhD minimum salary threshold is also expected to increase alongside this change.** While the exact amount isn't yet confirmed, it's likely to rise above the current £37,500.

Therefore, it's advisable to resolve this salary issue relatively soon to avoid further complications due to upcoming changes.



Do you think this information will be helpful for your conversation with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, this information is very helpful, thank you! I'll definitely explain the specific £37,500 threshold to my employer and mention how this relates to the PhD requirements. I'll try to get this resolved soon, especially with those April changes coming up. It sounds like if we wait too long, the required amount might increase even further.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. You're absolutely right to be mindful of the April changes – acting sooner rather than later is a sensible approach. 

I wish you the best of luck with your negotiation! If you have any further questions down the line, or if anything changes, feel free to reach out. I'm here to assist you if I can.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for your help and advice! I'll get in touch with my potential employer right away to discuss the salary issue.

✗ The agent gave incorrect information. The agent correctly identified that the application would be refused due to not meeting the £37,500 threshold for non-STEM PhDs, but incorrectly stated that the standard going rate is £36,000 and 90% is £32,400 without verifying this information. They simply accepted my statement about the going rate rather than confirming the accurate information themselves.
