[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Liam, nice to meet you! I'm here to help assess your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please confirm your age?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, I'm 23 years old. I recently graduated from university here in the UK with my Bachelor's degree. I was studying on a Student Visa.

[root_agent]: Thanks for confirming, Liam. That's helpful to know!

Could you please tell me what type of job you have been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Junior Financial Analyst. The company is offering me a salary of £35,000 per year. I'm hoping to switch from my Student Visa to something that would allow me to work here.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that’s good to know. 

To clarify, do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Junior Financial Analyst role, according to government guidelines? (Don't worry if you don't know exactly, just an approximate figure is fine.)

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for this role is around £42,000 per year, at least that's what I've been told. I know my offer is less than that at £35,000, which is why I'm concerned about whether I qualify for a work visa.

[root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know, £42,000 is a useful figure. 

Just to confirm, is the company offering you the job a licensed sponsor with the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they confirmed they are a licensed sponsor with the Home Office. They said they can sponsor my visa if I'm eligible.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent news!

Finally, was your Bachelor’s degree taught in English?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my Bachelor's degree was taught entirely in English here in the UK. I completed all my coursework and exams in English.

[root_agent]: Great! Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you **are eligible** for a Skilled Worker Visa as a New Entrant.

Here’s why: You are under 26, recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree while on a Student Visa, and your offered salary of £35,000 meets both the £33,400 lower general threshold *and* is at least 70% of the going rate (£29,400). 

*Note: Time spent on this visa will count toward the 4-year maximum for New Entrants.*



Do you have any other questions about this, or would you like me to clarify anything?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! So just to confirm, I'll be able to switch from my Student Visa to a Skilled Worker Visa with this job offer? And you mentioned something about a 4-year maximum - what happens after those 4 years?

[root_agent]: You're welcome! Yes, based on the information you've provided, you should be able to switch from your Student Visa to a Skilled Worker Visa with this job offer.

Regarding the 4-year maximum: The "New Entrant" route allows a lower salary threshold initially. However, the time you spend on the Skilled Worker Visa *under* this New Entrant provision counts towards a maximum of 4 years. After those 4 years, you would generally need to meet the full Skilled Worker Visa salary requirements (currently £38,700, but this is subject to change) to extend your visa further, unless another exception applies.

Essentially, it’s a temporary allowance to help recent graduates start their careers in the UK. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So I'll have 4 years to progress in my career and hopefully reach a salary level that meets the full requirements by the time I need to extend. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa as a New Entrant. They accurately explained that my £35,000 salary meets both the lower threshold (£33,400) and exceeds 70% of the going rate (£29,400), and they properly noted the 4-year maximum limitation for the New Entrant provision.
