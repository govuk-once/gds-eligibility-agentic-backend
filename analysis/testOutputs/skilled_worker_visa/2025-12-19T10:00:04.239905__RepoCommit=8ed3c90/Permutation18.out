[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Julian and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Julian, it's good to speak with you. I'm here to help determine your eligibility for certain benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me what kind of job you have been offered in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a Sales Director position with a company in the UK. They're offering me a package of £65,000 total - that's a base salary of £35,000, plus £20,000 in guaranteed commission and a £10,000 performance bonus. I'm currently living in Argentina, and I'm trying to understand if I qualify for a work visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Julian. That's very helpful.

To clarify, when you say the £20,000 commission is "guaranteed", is this stated as a fixed amount in your contract, regardless of sales performance, or is it based on achieving certain targets?





[evaluation_judge]: In the contract, the £20,000 is described as "guaranteed commission" that I'll receive quarterly throughout the year regardless of performance. It's separate from my base salary of £35,000. The additional £10,000 performance bonus would only come if I hit certain sales targets, so that part isn't guaranteed.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Julian. 

Just to be certain, is the £20,000 "guaranteed commission" described in your contract as part of your basic salary, or is it listed as a separate payment?

[evaluation_judge]: It's definitely listed as a separate payment in the contract. The offer clearly separates the £35,000 as my basic annual salary, and then the £20,000 guaranteed commission is listed separately - it's called "guaranteed commission" in the contract, not part of the basic salary. And then there's the additional £10,000 performance bonus on top of those two components.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details, Julian.

To confirm, do you have a UK company that is a licensed sponsor for the Skilled Worker Visa? In other words, does your potential employer appear on the list of licensed sponsors?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company is a licensed sponsor for the Skilled Worker Visa. They've assured me they're on the official list of sponsors and are able to issue certificates of sponsorship. They've sponsored other international employees before.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Julian.

The current salary threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa is £41,700 per year. Knowing that your base salary is £35,000 and your total package is £65,000, are you aware that only the base salary is considered when assessing eligibility against this threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that. I thought they would count my total guaranteed earnings, including the guaranteed commission. So you're saying they only look at the £35,000 base salary and not the £20,000 guaranteed commission or the performance bonus? That's concerning news for my application.

[root_agent]: You are right to be concerned, Julian. Unfortunately, that is correct. The Home Office assesses eligibility based on the guaranteed basic salary *only*. While your total package is £65,000, and the £20,000 commission is guaranteed, it isn't considered part of your 'basic' salary for visa purposes. Performance bonuses are also not included.

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, and with a base salary of £35,000, it appears you do not currently meet the £41,700 salary threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa.

I must inform you, based on this, your application would likely be **REFUSED**. Would you like me to explain this further?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain more. I'm quite surprised by this. If the commission is guaranteed in my contract, why wouldn't they count it toward the total? Is there any way I could restructure my offer to qualify, or are there any exceptions I might be eligible for?

[root_agent]: You're right to question it, it can be frustrating when a guaranteed payment isn't considered. The Home Office guidance is very specific – they only consider the guaranteed *basic* salary. Even if the commission is contractually guaranteed, it's viewed as a payment contingent on being employed, and therefore isn't considered basic pay. Performance bonuses are even less likely to be accepted, as they depend on achieving targets.

Regarding restructuring your offer, the most effective way to qualify would be to negotiate a higher *base* salary with your employer, bringing it above £41,700. If they are willing to increase your base salary while reducing the guaranteed commission proportionally, that would resolve the issue.

There are some exceptions to the £41,700 threshold, but they generally apply to specific health or education roles, “new entrants” to the labor market (recent graduates), or those with PhD-level qualifications – none of which seem to apply to a Sales Director role. 

Unfortunately, in your current situation with a £35,000 base salary and guaranteed commission paid separately, it's unlikely you’d meet the requirements. Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official government guidance on salary requirements, so you can read the details yourself? (Please note I cannot *provide* a link, but I can tell you where to find it on gov.uk).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful to see the official guidance. This is really disappointing news. I had no idea they wouldn't count guaranteed earnings - especially since the total package is well above the threshold. I'll definitely need to speak with the employer about restructuring the offer to increase the base salary. Is there any specific wording that needs to be in the contract to ensure the salary is considered properly?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Julian. It is a common misunderstanding, and many people are surprised by this rule.

You can find the official guidance on the Skilled Worker visa salary requirements here on the gov.uk website: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/salary-requirements](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/salary-requirements)

Regarding the contract wording, to ensure the salary is considered properly, the increased amount *must* be explicitly stated as your **basic salary**. Avoid any wording that labels it as an "allowance," "commission," "bonus," or "target earning," even if it's a fixed amount. It needs to be clearly defined as the regular payment for the work you perform.

For example, a correct phrasing would be: “Annual basic salary: £41,700 or above.”

If the contract simply states a higher "total package" without specifically detailing a higher basic salary, it is unlikely to be accepted by the Home Office. It's best to have the contract reviewed by an immigration advisor to ensure it meets all the requirements, if possible.

Do you have any other questions I can help you with at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that only the basic salary (£35,000) counts toward the threshold of £41,700, not the guaranteed commission or bonus. The agent accurately concluded that my application would be REFUSED, matching the expected outcome in the scenario.
