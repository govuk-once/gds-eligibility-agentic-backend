[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lukas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lukas, it's nice to meet you! To help me understand your eligibility, could you please tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old. I'm from Estonia and I've been offered a job as a Junior Developer in the UK. The company is offering me £34,000 a year. I'm quite excited about the opportunity but not sure what I need to do to make this happen.

[root_agent]: That's wonderful to hear about the job offer, Lukas! A Junior Developer role with a £34,000 salary sounds excellent. 

As you are 17, do you have the consent of your parents, or legal guardians, regarding your travel and care arrangements if you were to move to the UK? This includes a letter confirming their agreement.





[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have anything like that yet. I didn't know I needed a letter from my parents. They're supportive of me taking this job, but we haven't prepared any formal consent letter. Is that going to be a problem?

[root_agent]: Yes, Lukas, unfortunately that could be a problem. Because you are 17, the Home Office requires explicit written consent from your parents (or legal guardians) regarding your travel and care arrangements in the UK. Without that letter, your application may be refused.

Would you like me to explain a little more about what information should be included in that letter?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. What information needs to be included in the letter? I'll need to ask my parents to prepare it.

[root_agent]: Certainly! The letter from your parents should confirm several things:

* **Consent for Travel:** That they fully consent to you travelling to and living in the UK.
* **Care Arrangements:** Details of who will be responsible for your care and well-being in the UK. This could be the sponsoring employer, a relative, or a designated guardian.
* **Financial Support:** An outline of how your living costs will be covered.
* **Agreement to the Visa Conditions:** That they understand and agree to the conditions of your visa.
* **Contact Information:** Their full contact details so the Home Office can reach them if needed.

It's important the letter is clearly signed and dated by both parents (or your legal guardians) if applicable. Would you like me to clarify any of these points?





[evaluation_judge]: That's very helpful, thank you. I'll need to get my parents to prepare this letter. Would it need to be notarized or officially translated since it would be coming from Estonia? And would I still be eligible for the skilled worker visa once I have this letter, or are there other requirements I should know about?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Lukas! I'm glad I could help.

Regarding notarization and translation – yes, the letter *will* need to be officially translated into English by a certified translator. It’s also a good idea to have it notarized, although the guidance doesn’t explicitly state it’s mandatory, it strengthens the validity of the document.

As for your eligibility *with* the parental consent letter, based on the information you’ve provided so far (your age, job offer as a Junior Developer with a salary of £34,000), you *would* then meet the initial eligibility requirements relating to age and salary for a new entrant on the Skilled Worker visa.

However, there are other requirements. To confirm full eligibility, I need to ask you a further question: Does the job you've been offered meet the skill level required for a Skilled Worker Visa (RQF level 3 or above)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the job is for a Junior Developer position, which I believe is considered a skilled role. The company told me they're authorized to sponsor visas as well. So if I understand correctly, once I get the parental consent letter properly translated, I should be eligible for the visa? Are there any other major requirements I should be aware of?

[root_agent]: That's excellent news about the job being a skilled role and the company being a licensed sponsor, Lukas! 

Yes, *assuming* the parental consent letter is correctly prepared, translated, and (ideally) notarized, you would then meet the key requirements we've discussed so far.

However, there *are* other vital requirements. One important thing is that you will need to demonstrate your English language ability, typically through an approved English language test.

To be sure, could you please confirm whether you have already taken an approved English language test, and if so, what your score was?

[evaluation_judge]: I haven't taken a formal English language test yet. I've been studying English since I was very young and have a good command of the language, as you can probably tell. Which test would I need to take? Is it IELTS or something similar? And what kind of score would I need to achieve?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask, Lukas! While your conversational English is clearly very good, the Home Office requires formal proof of English language ability.

The most common test is IELTS (International English Language Testing System), but there are other approved tests like Pearson PTE Academic and TOEFL iBT. 

For a Skilled Worker visa, the required score depends on your job role. As a Junior Developer, the role generally requires a B1 level of English on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). This typically translates to:

*   **IELTS:** An overall score of 5.5 with a minimum of 5.0 in each component (Listening, Reading, Writing, Speaking).

You can find a full list of approved tests and required scores here: [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prove-your-english-language-ability](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/prove-your-english-language-ability) (I'm unable to provide a clickable link, but you can copy and paste this into your browser.)

Do you think you would be able to meet those requirements with an IELTS test, or would you like me to provide information about other approved tests?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I should be able to meet the IELTS requirements without too much trouble. So to summarize what I need for my application:

1. Parental consent letter (translated and notarized)
2. Take and pass an English language test like IELTS
3. Have a job offer from a licensed sponsor (which I do)
4. The job meets the skill level requirement (which it does)

Are there any other major requirements I'm missing? Like financial requirements or health checks?

[root_agent]: You've summarised that very well, Lukas! Those are the major points we've covered.

You are right to ask about other requirements. Yes, there are a couple more important things:

*   **Financial Requirement:** You need to show you have enough money to support yourself when you arrive in the UK. The exact amount depends on whether you’re staying in London or elsewhere, but it’s currently around £1,270 if you’re staying outside London, and £1,590 if you’re staying in London. You generally show this through bank statements.
*   **Health Surcharge:** You'll need to pay an Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) as part of your application. This gives you access to the National Health Service (NHS). The amount depends on how long your visa is for.
*   **Criminal Record Check:** You may be required to provide a criminal record certificate from Estonia, depending on your circumstances and how long you've lived outside the UK.

It’s also important to ensure all your documents are genuine and accurately translated. 

Would you like me to provide more details on any of these additional requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you tell me more about the criminal record check? I've never had any trouble with the law, but I'm not sure how to get this kind of certificate in Estonia or if there's a specific format it needs to be in for the UK authorities. Also, how long does the visa process typically take once I have all these documents ready?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Lukas. Let's talk about the criminal record check.

Whether you *need* a criminal record certificate depends on how long you’ve lived outside the UK. If you’ve lived outside the UK for 12 months or more, the Home Office usually requests a certificate. Even if you haven’t been in trouble with the law, it’s best to be prepared.

In Estonia, you would apply for a ‘Criminal Background Check’ ( *Karistusregistri väljajälgimine* in Estonian) through the Estonian Police and Border Guard Board (Politsei- ja Piirivalveamet). You can find information on their website: [https://www.politsei.ee/en/services/criminal-background-check/](https://www.politsei.ee/en/services/criminal-background-check/) (Again, I can't provide a clickable link.)

The certificate needs to be officially translated into English. There isn't a specific format, but it must clearly state that you have no criminal record.

Regarding processing times, once you submit your application *with all* the required documents, it usually takes the Home Office around **8 weeks** to make a decision. However, processing times can vary depending on the volume of applications they are receiving, and it can sometimes take longer. It’s best to apply well in advance of your intended start date.

Do you have any other questions about the criminal record check or the visa processing times?

[evaluation_judge]: Thanks for the information. No, I think I understand the process for the criminal record check now. I'll check the Estonian Police website for how to get that.

One last thing - since I'm 17, would I be able to rent an apartment on my own in the UK? Or would I need a specific care arrangement in place as part of those parental consent documents you mentioned?

[root_agent]: That's a very important question, Lukas!

Generally, it can be difficult for someone under 18 to rent an apartment independently in the UK. Most landlords will require a guarantor – someone over 18 who agrees to be legally responsible for the rent if you can't pay.

Because you are 17, your parental consent letter *should* detail your care arrangements. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't rent an apartment, but it needs to be clear who will be responsible for your general welfare and living arrangements. 

For example:

*   **Living with Employer-Provided Accommodation:** The consent letter could state you'll be living in accommodation arranged by your sponsoring employer.
*   **Living with a Designated Guardian:** The letter could confirm you'll be living with a named adult guardian who will be responsible for your care.
*   **Independent Living (with Guarantor):** If you intend to rent independently, the letter should acknowledge this and confirm your parents consent to you doing so, *as well as* confirmation that a suitable guarantor is in place.

The Home Office wants to be assured you have appropriate care and supervision whilst in the UK, especially as you are under 18. So, clarifying this in the parental consent letter is crucial.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to elaborate on any of these scenarios?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense. I'll need to make sure the care arrangements are clearly specified in the parental consent letter. My parents know someone in the UK who might be willing to act as a guarantor and designated guardian, so we'll include those details.

Thank you for all this information. It seems like I'm not eligible for the visa right now without the parental consent letter, but once I get that and the other documents sorted, I should be able to apply successfully. I appreciate your help explaining everything!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Lukas! I'm glad I could help clarify the process for you.

You are absolutely correct. Currently, without the parental consent letter addressing your care arrangements, your application would be **INVALID / REFUSED** due to safeguarding concerns.

However, once you have that letter, along with the other documents we’ve discussed – the English language test results, proof of funds, and the criminal record check (if required) – you should be well-positioned to submit a successful application.

I wish you all the best with gathering the necessary documents and with your future career as a Junior Developer in the UK! If you have any further questions down the line, please don’t hesitate to ask.





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I would be refused a Skilled Worker Visa without parental consent letter due to being 17. They accurately explained all requirements including the need for explicit parental consent with care arrangements as specified in the scenario, and gave the correct expected outcome of "INVALID / REFUSED" on safeguarding grounds.
