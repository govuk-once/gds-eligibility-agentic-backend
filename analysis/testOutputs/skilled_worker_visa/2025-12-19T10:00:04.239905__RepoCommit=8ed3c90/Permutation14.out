[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi John, it's good to speak with you. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 32 years old. I'm currently switching from a dependent visa, and I've received a job offer as a Trainee Chartered Accountant with a salary of £34,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, John. Have you completed your full-time education recently? By recently, I mean within the last six months?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I completed my education several years ago. I'm not a recent student. But I will be working towards my ACCA/ICAEW qualification as part of this trainee chartered accountant position.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, John. To confirm, is the training you'll be undertaking to achieve your ACCA/ICAEW qualification a recognized professional qualification?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's definitely a recognized professional qualification. Both ACCA and ICAEW are highly respected chartered accountancy qualifications in the UK. This role specifically involves working towards becoming a fully qualified chartered accountant through one of these professional bodies.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, John. Finally, do you know what the 'Standard Going Rate' is for a Chartered Accountant in your specific role? This information is usually available online or in the job description.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand the standard going rate for this role would be around £46,000. My offer is £34,000 as I'm still in training.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, John. Based on what you've told me – your age of 32, not being a recent student, pursuing a recognized professional qualification (ACCA/ICAEW) as a Trainee Chartered Accountant, and a salary of £34,000 against a standard going rate of £46,000 – it appears you **qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa with the New Entrant salary discount.** 

Your salary meets the requirement of being at least 70% of the standard going rate (£32,200). The professional qualification allows for this discount despite your age.



Do you have any other questions for me?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! I'm relieved to hear I qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa even though I'm above 26. I was worried my age might be an issue, but it's good to know that working towards my professional accountancy qualification gives me the New Entrant status. The salary requirement was another concern, so I'm glad to hear my £34,000 is above the 70% threshold. Thank you for confirming this - it's very helpful as I prepare for my application.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, John! I'm delighted I could provide you with that reassurance. It's completely understandable to be concerned about the requirements, but you've clearly met the criteria for the New Entrant route. 

I wish you all the best with your Skilled Worker Visa application and your journey to becoming a fully qualified chartered accountant. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa with New Entrant status despite being over 26, because I'm working toward a recognized professional qualification (ACCA/ICAEW). They properly verified that my £34,000 salary exceeds the required 70% threshold of the standard going rate (£32,200), matching the expected outcome of "AWARDED."
