[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of Omar, the nephew of a restaurant owner in London, who is seeking information about eligibility for a visa based on a job offer that may not represent a genuine vacancy.

Hi, i'm Omar and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Omar, it's good to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you tell me what type of visa you are hoping to apply for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. My uncle runs a small restaurant in London and has offered me a job as the restaurant manager. He's willing to sponsor me for a visa to come work for him. I think it's called a Skilled Worker visa? I'm currently living abroad but I'd like to move to the UK for this opportunity.

[root_agent]: Okay, a Skilled Worker visa sounds like the right one. That's good you've identified it! 

To assess your eligibility, could you tell me what your expected annual salary would be for this Restaurant Manager position?

[evaluation_judge]: My uncle has offered me £45,000 per year for the restaurant manager position. He said that would be enough for the visa requirements.

[root_agent]: That's helpful to know, thank you. £45,000 is a good starting point.

Could you briefly describe the main duties and responsibilities of the Restaurant Manager role? Just a general overview would be great.

[evaluation_judge]: Well, my uncle mentioned it would involve general oversight of the restaurant. I'd be responsible for supervising staff, handling some administrative work, managing inventory, and ensuring customer satisfaction. He didn't give me too many specific details beyond general oversight responsibilities. The restaurant is quite small though - I think it only has about 10 seats.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That gives me a better understanding of the role.

Just to clarify, does the restaurant currently *have* a manager in place already?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, actually there is already a manager working there. My uncle mentioned that they would still keep working there in some capacity, but I would be taking over as the main manager. I'm not entirely sure how the responsibilities would be divided between us.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for being upfront about that. It’s good to have a clear picture.

To help me understand the situation a little better, could you tell me how long your uncle’s restaurant has been established and operating?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe he's had the restaurant for about 3 years now. It's a small family-style place in London. Not very big as I mentioned - just around 10 seats. It's been doing okay from what he tells me, but I don't know much about the financial details.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that's useful information.

Now, thinking about the job description itself – was it a very detailed document outlining specific tasks and responsibilities, or was it fairly general, as you mentioned with "general oversight"? Could you describe it a little more?

[evaluation_judge]: To be honest, there wasn't a very detailed job description. When we spoke, my uncle just said it would involve "general oversight" of the restaurant operations. He didn't provide me with a formal document listing specific duties or anything like that. He just said I'd be managing the place, supervising staff, and handling day-to-day operations. It was all quite vague when I think about it.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being honest with me, Omar. That level of detail is helpful.

Finally, just to be clear, is this role being created specifically *because* you are available to fill it, or was there a previously advertised need for a Restaurant Manager that you applied for?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, to be completely honest, my uncle called me a few weeks ago and suggested the idea. He knew I was looking to move to the UK, and he said he could offer me this position as restaurant manager to help me get a visa. The role wasn't advertised anywhere that I know of - it seems like it was created specifically for me. He didn't mention anything about needing another manager before our conversation.

[root_agent]: Thank you for your honesty, Omar. I appreciate you providing me with all of this information.

Based on what you’ve told me about the role – the existing manager, the vague job description, the restaurant size, and the fact the position was created specifically with you in mind – it seems there may be concerns about whether this qualifies as a “genuine vacancy” for the Skilled Worker visa.

The Home Office may scrutinize this application closely to ensure the role isn't simply created to facilitate your visa, and that there is a genuine need for a full-time Restaurant Manager.

While your salary *meets* the requirements, and the job *is* skilled, the genuineness of the vacancy is a crucial part of the assessment. It’s likely further evidence and potentially an interview would be requested to determine this.

Do you have any questions about what I’ve said?





[evaluation_judge]: No, that makes sense. So even though the salary and skill level meet the requirements, the Home Office might reject my application because the job doesn't seem to be a genuine vacancy? That's disappointing, but I understand. Thanks for explaining that to me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Omar. Yes, that's exactly right. Meeting the salary and skill level are important, but they aren't the only factors. A genuine vacancy is essential.

I understand this is disappointing news, but I’m glad I could help clarify the situation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, or any other questions you might have? Perhaps you'd like to explore other visa options, though I'd need information about your skills and qualifications for those.

[evaluation_judge]: I don't think I have any other questions right now. I'll need to reconsider my options. Maybe I should look into different visa categories or discuss with my uncle about a more genuine role if that's possible. Thank you for your help and for being straightforward with me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Omar. That sounds like a sensible plan. It’s always best to be prepared and explore all possibilities. 

I wish you the best of luck with your visa journey and in finding a suitable path forward. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out.





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that despite meeting salary and skill requirements, the application would likely be refused due to failing the "genuine vacancy" test. The agent properly recognized the red flags (small restaurant already having a manager, vague job description, position created specifically for visa purposes) and accurately conveyed that this would be grounds for refusal.
