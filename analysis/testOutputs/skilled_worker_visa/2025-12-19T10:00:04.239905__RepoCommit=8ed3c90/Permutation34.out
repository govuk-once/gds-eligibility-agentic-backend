[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Sarah, who owns a consulting company and is exploring visa sponsorship options.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to speak with you! I can certainly help you explore your eligibility. 

To start, could you please tell me if the company you would like to be sponsored by is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! Yes, my company "Sarah Consulting Ltd" is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office. I'm actually the owner of the company - I own 100% of it, and I'm also the director. I'm trying to understand if I can sponsor myself for a visa.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear that Sarah Consulting Ltd is a licensed sponsor, Sarah! And thank you for clarifying that you are the owner and director.

To better understand your situation, could you please tell me how you currently receive income from the company – is it solely as a salary, or do you receive income in other ways, such as dividends?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I currently pay myself in a tax-efficient way. I take a small PAYE salary of £12,570 per year (which is the personal allowance) and then I take £40,000 in dividends. So in total, I receive £52,570 from my company annually. I set it up this way on the advice of my accountant to minimize my tax burden.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that, Sarah. It's helpful to understand your current income structure.

To confirm, the Skilled Worker visa has a minimum salary requirement. Could you please confirm if your salary *before* tax, and excluding any dividends, meets the current minimum salary threshold of £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see what you're asking. No, my PAYE salary before tax is only £12,570. The rest of my income (£40,000) comes from dividends. So my actual salary is well below the £41,700 threshold. But my total compensation from the company is £52,570 when you include both salary and dividends.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Sarah. 

Just to be absolutely clear, for the purposes of the Skilled Worker visa, only the PAYE salary counts towards the £41,700 minimum salary requirement. Dividends are not considered as part of that calculation. 

Given this information, it appears your application would unfortunately be **refused** at this time. To be eligible, you would need to be paid a PAYE salary of £41,700 or more, and be subject to full income tax and National Insurance contributions on that salary.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or perhaps discuss what changes you might need to make to meet the requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's disappointing. I didn't realize that dividends wouldn't count toward the salary requirement. So even though my total compensation is over £52,000, because only £12,570 of that is PAYE salary, I wouldn't qualify?

If I wanted to make this work, would I need to completely restructure my compensation and pay myself at least £41,700 as PAYE salary instead of taking dividends? That would mean paying a lot more in tax and National Insurance.

[root_agent]: You are exactly right, Sarah. Even though your total compensation exceeds £52,000, only the £12,570 PAYE salary is considered for the Skilled Worker visa's salary requirements. It's a common misunderstanding, as many business owners utilise dividends for tax efficiency.

And yes, if you want to qualify for the visa, you would need to restructure your compensation. You would need to pay yourself a PAYE salary of at least £41,700 *before* tax, and pay the associated income tax and National Insurance contributions on that amount. It would unfortunately mean a higher tax burden compared to your current arrangement.



Would you like me to reiterate any part of this information, or would you like me to move on to discussing other potential options, though I must stress I can only advise on eligibility based on the provided guidance?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. That's quite frustrating since I'd be paying myself from the same pot of money either way, but I see that the visa rules specifically require PAYE salary rather than total compensation.

I'll need to think about whether it makes financial sense for me to restructure my compensation that way and pay the higher taxes, or if there might be other visa options I should consider instead. 

Thank you for being so clear about the requirements. It's helpful to know exactly where I stand.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah. I understand your frustration – it can be a tricky situation. You've summarised it perfectly; the rules specifically require PAYE salary for visa purposes.

I'm glad I could clarify things for you. If you do decide to explore other visa options, or have further questions about the Skilled Worker visa in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. 

I wish you all the best in deciding the best path forward for your situation! Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I would be refused for the visa because only my PAYE salary of £12,570 counts toward the £41,700 minimum requirement, and dividends are not considered. They accurately explained I would need to restructure my compensation to meet the requirements.
