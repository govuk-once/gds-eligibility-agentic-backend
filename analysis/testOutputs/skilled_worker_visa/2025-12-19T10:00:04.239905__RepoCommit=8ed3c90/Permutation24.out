[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Banu and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Banu, welcome! I'm here to help. To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for a Skilled Worker visa to the UK. I have a job offer as a Senior Chemist with a salary of £35,000. I have a PhD in Chemistry from a university in Turkey, and I understand there might be some special considerations for PhDs in STEM fields.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Banu. That's very helpful.

To begin assessing your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you please tell me - does the university that awarded your PhD appear on the UK government's list of recognised higher education institutions? You can find that list here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-recognised-higher-education-providers



(Please note: I am unable to directly access the linked page, so I need you to tell me if your university is listed.)

[evaluation_judge]: No, my university isn't on that list. It's a small private university in Turkey. I did complete my doctoral studies there, but I understand it may not be automatically recognized.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Banu. Since your university isn't on the list of recognised higher education providers, did you have your PhD assessed by Ecctis to determine its comparability to a UK PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I did have my PhD assessed by Ecctis. They completed the review recently, but unfortunately the result was that my qualification is "comparable to RQF Level 7 (Master's)" rather than being equivalent to a UK doctoral standard.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Banu. That’s important to know.

Given that Ecctis has determined your PhD is comparable to a Master’s level qualification, and not a UK doctoral standard, are you aware that you would need to meet the minimum salary requirement of £41,700 for a Skilled Worker visa, rather than being eligible for the salary discount associated with holding a PhD in a STEM field?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I didn't realize that. I thought that having a PhD from my country would be enough for the salary discount. My employer is only offering £35,000, which they told me would be sufficient with the PhD discount. If the minimum salary is £41,700 without the discount, does this mean I wouldn't qualify for the Skilled Worker visa?

[root_agent]: You are right to ask for clarification, Banu. Unfortunately, that is correct.

Because Ecctis verification didn't confirm your PhD as equivalent to a UK PhD, you don't qualify for the salary discount. As your job offer is for £35,000, which is below the minimum salary requirement of £41,700 without the discount, you would not currently meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker visa.



I'm very sorry to deliver this news. Would you like me to clarify anything further about the requirements?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing to hear. So even though I have a document that says "PhD" from my university, since Ecctis has only rated it as equivalent to a Master's level qualification in the UK, I can't use the PhD salary discount. And without that discount, my £35,000 salary offer is too low to qualify for the visa.

Could you confirm that there are no other options for me with this current job offer? Would I need to ask my employer to increase the salary to at least £41,700?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Banu. You are correct - even with a document stating "PhD," the Ecctis assessment is key, and its finding means you don't qualify for the PhD salary discount. And without that discount, the £35,000 salary is below the necessary threshold.

Regarding other options with your current job offer, unfortunately, no, there aren't any. The Skilled Worker visa requirements are quite specific regarding salary and qualifications. 

To be eligible, you would need to either:

1.  **Negotiate a salary increase with your employer to at least £41,700.**
2.  **Find a job offer that meets both the required skill level *and* the minimum salary threshold of £41,700.**



I understand this isn’t the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with, or would you like me to explain any aspect of the Skilled Worker visa requirements in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very clear, thank you. It seems my only option is to go back to my potential employer and see if they can increase the salary offer to meet the minimum threshold of £41,700. I appreciate your explanation of why my PhD doesn't qualify me for the salary discount despite having completed doctoral studies. This helps me understand the situation better before I speak with my employer.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Banu. I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you. 

It sounds like you have a good plan to discuss this with your employer. I wish you the best of luck in those negotiations! If you have any further questions down the line, or if your employer *is* able to increase the salary and you'd like me to review your eligibility again, please don't hesitate to reach out.



Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that covers everything I needed to know for now. Thank you for your help and advice. I'll talk to my employer about the salary situation.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Banu! I'm happy I could help. 

I wish you all the best with your conversation with your employer and with your visa application process. If you need anything in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.



Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was ineligible for the Skilled Worker visa because my PhD was assessed by Ecctis as equivalent to a Master's level (not doctoral), meaning I couldn't use the PhD salary discount for STEM fields. Without the discount, my £35,000 salary offer falls below the required £41,700 threshold, resulting in refusal - matching the expected outcome.
