[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Elena from Brazil who is inquiring about her eligibility for a UK work visa.

Hi, i'm Elena and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Elena, welcome! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for a UK work visa. 

To start, could you please tell me, does the company offering you the job have a valid sponsor license? This means they are authorised by the UK government to sponsor workers.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company is a licensed sponsor. They're a fintech firm in London and they've assured me they have all the proper sponsorship licenses in place.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Elena!

Next, could you tell me what skill level the job you’ve been offered is classified as? Specifically, is it at RQF level 3, 4, 5, or 6? (RQF stands for Regulated Qualifications Framework).

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a Senior Engineering Manager position, which I understand is classified as RQF Level 6. It requires my 10 years of experience in software engineering and management expertise.

[root_agent]: Excellent, RQF level 6 is what we need. 

Now, could you confirm whether you meet the English language requirements for the visa? Have you taken a Secure English Language Test (SELT) and achieved the required score?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have passed the Secure English Language Test (SELT) with distinction. My English is quite strong as I've worked with international teams for many years.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic, Elena! Passing with distinction on the SELT is excellent.

Now, let’s talk about salary. What is the annual salary offered to you in your job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £85,000 per year for the Senior Engineering Manager role.

[root_agent]: Okay, £85,000 per year. That's good to know.

Finally, do you know what the standard 'going rate' is for a Senior Engineering Manager role in London? This is a specific amount set by the government for this occupation.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand the standard going rate for this role is £75,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Elena. 

Based on what you've told me:

*   You have a valid sponsor.
*   The job is at the required skill level (RQF Level 6).
*   You meet the English language requirements.
*   Your salary of £85,000 meets the general threshold of £41,700.
*   And your salary is above the going rate of £75,000.

Therefore, according to the Skilled Worker visa criteria, you would be **AWARDED** the visa. You meet the standard requirements without needing to use the tradeable points system.



Do you have any other questions about the visa process or anything else I can help you with?

[evaluation_judge]: That's wonderful news! I'm very relieved to hear I qualify for the Skilled Worker visa. It sounds like my application should be straightforward since I meet all the standard requirements. 

I don't have any other questions right now. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly. This gives me confidence to proceed with my job offer and relocation plans.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be awarded the Skilled Worker visa based on meeting all standard requirements without needing tradeable points, which matches the expected outcome.
