[evaluation_judge]: I'll assume the role of Maria and engage with the agent regarding my eligibility for supplementary work under my Skilled Worker visa.

Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Maria, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm here to help! To understand what benefit you're referring to, could you tell me what you're hoping to understand about your eligibility for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm a nurse on a Skilled Worker visa working at a hospital. I've been offered some extra shifts at a different hospital through an agency, and I want to understand if I'm allowed to take these under my current visa without needing to apply for anything else.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying, Maria. That's very helpful.

To assess your eligibility for taking on these extra shifts, could you please tell me, roughly how many hours *per week* are you being offered at the agency, *outside of* your normal contracted hours at your current hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: The agency has offered me about 25 hours per week at the second hospital. These would be in addition to my normal hours at my main hospital job. I'm quite keen as the extra income would really help, but I want to make sure it's allowed with my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Maria.

Just to confirm, you mentioned the extra shifts would be as an Agency Nurse at a different hospital. Is this agency nursing role using the *same* occupation code as your primary nursing position at your current hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'd be working as a nurse in both positions - it's the same nursing role, just at a different hospital through an agency. The occupation code would be the same for both positions.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Maria. 

Given that the roles have the same occupation code, and you're working 25 hours per week in addition to your contracted hours, I need to inform you that this exceeds the permitted limit for supplementary work under the Skilled Worker visa. The rules state you can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week in a second job.

Therefore, working 25 hours per week would be a breach of your visa conditions. Do you understand?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I didn't realize there was a limit of only 20 hours per week for supplementary work. So even though it's the same type of job, I can't do 25 hours? That's a bit disappointing as I was counting on the extra income. What might happen if I were to work those extra hours anyway?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Maria, and I'm sorry to deliver that news. You are correct - even with the same occupation code, the 20-hour limit still applies.

Working those extra hours could have several consequences. It's considered a violation of your visa conditions and could lead to a few different outcomes. These include potential refusal of future visa applications, or even curtailment of your current visa – meaning it could be cancelled before its original expiry date. It could also affect your ability to switch to a different visa in the future.

It's a serious matter, so it's best to remain within the visa guidelines. Would you like me to repeat any of that information, or perhaps clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That sounds quite serious, and I definitely wouldn't want to risk my visa status. Thank you for explaining this clearly. I'll speak to the agency about reducing my hours to 20 or less per week to stay within the rules. Is there any other paperwork or notification I need to make to the Home Office before taking on this supplementary work, or is it automatically allowed as long as I stay under 20 hours?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Maria, I'm glad I could help clarify things. It’s wise to be cautious and prioritize your visa status.

No, there is no requirement to notify the Home Office *before* starting supplementary work, *as long as* you meet all the conditions – including the 20-hour limit and the occupation code/Immigration Salary List criteria. You don't need to submit any paperwork or seek prior approval.

However, it's a good idea to keep records of your hours worked at both jobs, in case you are ever asked to demonstrate compliance with the rules.

Essentially, as long as you stay within the rules, you can begin the supplementary work without prior notification. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. I'll make sure to keep good records of all my hours and stay under the 20-hour limit for my supplementary work. Thank you very much for all the information and for helping me understand the rules so I can stay compliant with my visa conditions.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Maria! I'm delighted I could help. It's always best to be informed and proactive when it comes to visa regulations. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best with your nursing career and your supplementary work! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you again for your help!

✓ The agent correctly identified that working 25 hours per week in a supplementary job would breach my visa conditions, even though the job is in the same occupation code. They properly explained that this is a visa violation that could lead to future visa refusals or curtailment, which matches the expected outcome.
