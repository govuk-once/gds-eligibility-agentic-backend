[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ali and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Ali, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me how long you’ve been studying for your PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently in Year 3 of my 4-year PhD program in Engineering. I've completed a bit more than 2 years so far.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Just to clarify, you’re currently in your third year of a four-year PhD program. And you’ve completed a little over two years of your studies so far, correct?  Could you tell me, have you officially graduated from your PhD program yet?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right, I'm in my third year and have completed a bit over two years of my PhD in Engineering. I haven't graduated yet - I still have more than a year to go before completion.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for confirming. Now, let’s focus on the length of your studies. Could you tell me exactly how many months you’ve spent working on your PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: I've completed about 28 months of my PhD program so far.

[root_agent]: Okay, 28 months. And to confirm, you are still enrolled in your PhD program and haven’t yet graduated?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm still enrolled in my PhD program and haven't graduated yet. I'm working towards completion, but I still have more coursework and research to complete.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Just to be absolutely certain, you’ve completed just over two years and a half of your four-year PhD program, and you’re not yet a graduate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I've completed about 28 months (just over 2 years and a half) of my 4-year PhD program in Engineering, and I'm not yet a graduate. I'm still working toward my doctorate.

[root_agent]: Okay, Ali. Thank you for providing all of this detail. Based on what you’ve told me – that you’re in your third year of a four-year PhD program, you’ve completed approximately 28 months, and you haven’t yet graduated – are you intending to switch to a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly what I'm looking into. I've received a job offer as an Engineering Consultant and I'm wondering if I'm eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa before completing my PhD. I know there are some rules about this, but I'm not sure if I qualify since I haven't graduated yet.

[root_agent]: I understand. Let’s explore that a bit further. The Skilled Worker visa has a specific rule for PhD graduates. Could you tell me, have you completed at least 24 months of your PhD studies?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have completed 28 months of my PhD studies so far, which is more than the 24-month threshold.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for confirming that. Given you've completed more than 24 months of your PhD, you *are* eligible to apply for a Skilled Worker visa before graduating. 

**AWARDED.**

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for a Skilled Worker visa as a PhD student who has completed over 24 months of study (28 months) but has not yet graduated, which aligns with the expected outcome.
