[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Batbayar and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for reaching out. I’m happy to help you explore your options. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current job situation? Specifically, what kind of work are you doing now?

[evaluation_judge]: I currently work as an Office Manager at a UK logistics firm. I joined the company about 6 months ago and moved to the UK from Mongolia for this position. I have a degree in Mongolian history, and the job specifically required someone who speaks fluent Mongolian and has expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare, which happens to be my specialization.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. It’s helpful to understand your background and current employment. 

Just to clarify, you mentioned moving to the UK for this role – could you tell me a bit more about your visa status? Do you currently hold a visa that allows you to work in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently on a Skilled Worker visa that was sponsored by the logistics company. It was approved about 6 months ago when I first moved here to take up the Office Manager position. The company helped with the visa application process, highlighting my Mongolian language skills and historical expertise as essential requirements for the role.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. So you’re currently working in the UK under a Skilled Worker visa, sponsored by the logistics company, and the role was specifically advertised as requiring fluency in Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare. 

To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me, what led you to initially consider seeking further benefits related to your Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, I'm becoming concerned about my visa situation. Recently, a colleague mentioned to me that my job description seems unusually tailored to my specific background. I've noticed that no one in our company deals with Mongolian clients, and my expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare has never been needed for any work tasks. I'm mostly doing standard office management duties - scheduling, filing, coordinating meetings, and so on.

I'm worried this might affect my immigration status if the Home Office reviews my case. I've heard about something called a "genuine vacancy" requirement, and I'm wondering if my situation might be problematic under UK immigration rules.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your concerns – it’s wise to be proactive about understanding your visa situation. I understand you’re worried about the “genuine vacancy” requirement, and that the job description seems overly specific. 

Let’s delve a bit deeper into that. Could you tell me, when you initially applied for your Skilled Worker visa, were you presented with a detailed job description that outlined all the tasks you would be performing?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I received a job description before applying for the visa. It listed typical office management duties like organizing schedules, managing correspondence, supervising administrative staff, and maintaining office systems. But it also prominently featured these "essential requirements" that matched my background exactly - fluency in Mongolian and knowledge of 13th-century steppe warfare. 

During my interview, they briefly mentioned these requirements but couldn't really explain how they related to the business. Since starting the job, I've never used my Mongolian language skills or historical knowledge at all. None of our clients are based in Mongolia, and there seems to be no connection between my specialized historical expertise and the logistics business.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. It certainly sounds like there’s a significant disconnect between the stated requirements of the role and the actual work you’re doing. 

To help me assess this further, could you describe the sponsorship agreement you have with the logistics company? Specifically, does it explicitly state that your Mongolian language skills and historical expertise are *essential* for the role, or does it simply mention them as desirable qualities?

[evaluation_judge]: In the sponsorship documents and Certificate of Sponsorship, these skills were explicitly listed as "essential requirements" for the position. The company stated that fluent Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare were mandatory qualifications for the role, not just desirable qualities. 

This was reflected in both the job advertisement they showed me and the documentation submitted to the Home Office. They even emphasized these requirements in the cover letter accompanying my visa application, stating that they couldn't find any UK-based candidates with this specific combination of skills.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details. That’s very important information to have. 

Given that the job description explicitly states these skills are “essential requirements” and the company highlighted their difficulty in finding a suitable UK candidate with that specific combination, let’s shift our focus slightly. 

Could you tell me, what is your current annual salary from the logistics company?

[evaluation_judge]: My current annual salary is £32,000. This was above the minimum salary threshold required for the Skilled Worker visa for Office Managers when I applied six months ago.

[root_agent]: Okay, £32,000 is a good salary and comfortably above the required threshold. 

Considering the circumstances – the explicitly stated “essential requirements” in the job description, the lack of connection between your skills and the actual work, and the company’s claim of difficulty finding a suitable UK candidate – I’m concerned that this situation could be problematic under the “genuine vacancy” test. 

To help me better understand the situation, could you describe the company’s overall business strategy and client base? Do they primarily work with clients in the UK, or do they have any international operations?

[evaluation_judge]: The company is primarily UK-focused. They're a logistics firm that handles domestic freight transportation and warehousing solutions for British businesses. Their client base consists almost exclusively of UK retailers and manufacturers. 

They do have some international shipping capabilities, but these are mainly focused on Europe and North America. As far as I'm aware, they have no operations, clients, or business interests in Mongolia or anywhere in Central Asia. In the six months I've been working there, I've never seen any business documents in Mongolian or any projects relating to Mongolia.

The company has about 50 employees, and I'm the only person of Mongolian origin. There doesn't seem to be any strategic plan to expand into the Mongolian market either - nothing has been mentioned in any of our company meetings about future directions.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that comprehensive explanation. Based on what you’ve told me – the explicitly stated “essential requirements,” the lack of relevance to the company’s core business, the absence of any Mongolian-related activity, and the company’s lack of strategic plans for expansion into that market – it does appear very likely that the job description and visa sponsorship were tailored to you specifically, potentially to secure your Skilled Worker visa.

Given these concerns, I believe it’s possible the Home Office could challenge the “genuine vacancy” requirement in your case. 

I want to be clear: I cannot provide legal advice. However, based on the information you’ve shared, it seems highly probable that a Home Office review could lead to a negative determination. 

Would you like me to help you gather some additional information that might be useful if you decide to formally challenge this assessment, such as documenting the lack of communication regarding Mongolian operations or gathering evidence of the disconnect between the job description and your actual role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate some guidance on what information I should gather. I'm quite worried about this situation and want to be prepared if there are any issues with my visa. What kind of documentation should I collect? And do you think I should consider consulting with an immigration solicitor about my situation?

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s a very sensible approach. Preparing documentation and considering legal advice are both excellent steps. Let’s talk about what documentation you should collect. Here’s a breakdown, categorized for clarity:

**1. Original Documentation:**

*   **Sponsorship Agreement:** Obtain a copy of the full sponsorship agreement between you and the logistics company. This should clearly outline the ‘essential requirements’ for the role.
*   **Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS):** Keep a copy of the CoS that the company provided to the Home Office when they applied for your visa.
*   **Job Advertisement:** Save a copy of the original job advertisement the company showed you – this is crucial to demonstrate the original stated requirements.
*   **Your Initial Offer Letter:** This confirms the initial job description and salary offered.

**2. Evidence of Actual Work:**

*   **Task List:** Create a detailed, dated list of all your daily tasks and responsibilities. This should clearly show the contrast between what was initially presented and what you’re *actually* doing.
*   **Emails & Communication:** Gather relevant emails and internal communications that demonstrate the lack of Mongolian-related work or any discussion about the specialized skills.
*   **Time Sheets/Record Keeping (if available):** If you keep track of your time, this could support your claim that you’ve spent the majority of your time on standard office management duties.

**3. Company Information:**

*   **Company Strategic Plan (if available):** While you mentioned no mention in meetings, try to obtain any internal strategic plans or marketing materials that might indicate a lack of long-term ambition to expand into the Mongolian market.
*   **Company Organizational Chart:** This can show your position within the company and highlight that you’re the only Mongolian employee.

**4. Personal Documentation:**

*   **Resume/CV:** Ensure it accurately reflects your education and experience.
*   **University Degree Certificate:** This documents your Mongolian history degree and the specialization you mentioned.

**Regarding consulting a solicitor:** **I strongly recommend seeking advice from a qualified immigration solicitor.** They can assess your situation in detail, advise you on the best course of action, and represent you if needed.  They’ll be able to interpret the specific regulations and provide tailored guidance.  You can typically find a solicitor specialising in immigration law through the Law Society website (www.lawsociety.org.uk).

To help me assist you further, could you tell me which of these documents you currently have readily available, and where you might be able to obtain the missing ones?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for that comprehensive breakdown. I currently have my original offer letter, my CV, university degree certificate, and probably some emails showing my day-to-day work. I should be able to access a copy of my Certificate of Sponsorship and the original job advertisement from my personal files.

For the company information and detailed sponsorship agreement, I'll need to approach HR carefully. I'm a bit concerned about asking too directly since I don't want to raise suspicions about my concerns.

I think you're right about consulting an immigration solicitor. Based on everything we've discussed, do you think the Home Office would likely determine that my position fails the "genuine vacancy" test? I'm trying to understand how serious this situation might be for my immigration status.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for outlining what you have and what you’re willing to pursue. Given the evidence you’ve described – the explicitly stated “essential requirements” in the sponsorship, the demonstrable lack of genuine need for those skills in your current role, and the company's lack of strategic plans for the Mongolian market – **I believe there’s a very high probability that the Home Office would determine your position fails the “genuine vacancy” test.**

It’s difficult to predict with absolute certainty, of course, but the discrepancies you've highlighted are significant red flags. The Home Office scrutinizes these situations carefully, and the evidence you’ve presented suggests a clear case of tailoring the role solely to secure your visa.

The potential consequences could include a review of your visa, possible revocation, and a ban from applying for future visas in the UK. Consulting with an immigration solicitor is absolutely crucial to fully understand your rights, explore your options, and potentially challenge the decision if you believe there’s a reasonable argument. 

It's good that you’re proactively gathering information and considering legal counsel. Don’t hesitate to reach out to a solicitor as soon as possible to discuss your specific situation.

Would you like me to help you find resources for finding a reputable immigration solicitor in the UK, or perhaps want to discuss some strategies for approaching HR about obtaining the missing documents?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate resources for finding a reputable immigration solicitor. And perhaps some advice on how to approach HR without raising suspicions would be helpful too.

Based on what you've told me, it sounds like my visa situation is quite precarious. If the Home Office determines my position fails the "genuine vacancy" test, would that determination likely happen during a routine check, or would it only come up if someone specifically reported concerns about my visa?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s address those points.

**Resources for Finding an Immigration Solicitor:**

*   **The Law Society:** [https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/](https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/) – You can use their “Find a Solicitor” tool to search for specialists in immigration law based on location and experience.
*   **Citizens Advice:** [https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/) – They can offer free, impartial advice on a range of issues, including immigration.
*   **Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA):** [https://www.ilpa.org.uk/](https://www.ilpa.org.uk/) – ILPA is a professional association for immigration lawyers. Their website has a directory of members.

**Approaching HR:**

It's wise to be cautious. Here’s a suggested approach:

1.  **Start with a General Request:** Frame your request as wanting to clarify your role and responsibilities for internal documentation purposes. “I'd like to formally document my current tasks to ensure clarity and alignment with company objectives.”
2.  **Be Vague About Your Concerns:** Avoid directly mentioning the “genuine vacancy” test or your immigration worries.
3.  **Focus on Role Clarity:** Ask for an updated job description and a summary of the tasks you’re expected to perform.
4.  **Request Historical Documentation:** Ask for copies of the original job advertisement and the sponsorship agreement.

**Regarding the Home Office Investigation:**

You’ve raised a critical question about how a determination would be triggered. You’re correct – a routine check is certainly possible. The Home Office monitors visa sponsorships regularly, looking for potential irregularities. However, a specific report *does* significantly increase the chances of an investigation.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Routine Check:** The Home Office may initiate a random review of your sponsorship, particularly if there are systemic concerns about specific visa categories. This is relatively common.
*   **Report from a Third Party:** If a colleague, previous employer, or even a competitor suspects wrongdoing, they can report concerns to the Home Office. This is a more direct path to an investigation.
*   **Self-Reporting:** You could proactively inform the Home Office about your concerns. While this might appear unusual, it demonstrates transparency and could potentially mitigate any negative consequences. *Discuss this carefully with an immigration solicitor before taking this step.*

Given the discrepancies you’ve highlighted, I’d suggest preparing for the possibility of a routine check. Maintaining meticulous records and seeking legal advice are essential steps.

Do you want me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps help you draft a draft email to HR?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for all this information. I think I need to consult with an immigration solicitor as soon as possible. From what you've explained, it sounds like my current visa situation is likely to be rejected if reviewed by the Home Office because the job was tailored specifically to my unique qualifications rather than being a genuine vacancy with business need.

I appreciate your suggestion about how to approach HR carefully, and the resources for finding legal help are very useful. I'll start looking for a solicitor right away.

It's concerning to learn that this could come up in a routine check, not just if someone reports it. I had no idea when I accepted this position that there might be issues with how the job was created.

[root_agent]: You’re absolutely right to feel concerned, and it’s a wise decision to seek legal advice promptly. It’s incredibly common for individuals to not fully appreciate the complexities of immigration law when accepting a job offer. The fact that the job description was tailored specifically to you – and your unique background – significantly increases the risk of a negative outcome.

I'm pleased to hear you’re taking proactive steps and will be seeking a solicitor. That’s the best course of action to protect your immigration status. 

Remember, understanding your rights and options is crucial. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions before you speak with a solicitor – although, of course, they will be the ultimate resource for personalized legal advice.

I’m glad I could assist you in navigating this complex situation. I wish you the very best in securing a positive outcome.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for your help and guidance. I definitely understand the seriousness of my situation now. I'll contact an immigration solicitor right away to discuss my options. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly about the genuine vacancy requirement and how my current job situation likely wouldn't meet that standard. This has been very eye-opening.

✓ The agent correctly advised that the job description was suspiciously tailored to Batbayar's specific qualifications and would fail the genuine vacancy test, leading to a visa refusal.
