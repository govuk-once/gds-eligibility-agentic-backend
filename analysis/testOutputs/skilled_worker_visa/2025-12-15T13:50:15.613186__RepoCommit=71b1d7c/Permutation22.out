[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ahmed and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Ahmed, thank you for reaching out. To help me understand your situation and see if you might be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you please tell me what your hourly rate is for this Head Chef position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a Head Chef with an hourly rate of £13.50. I'll be working 60 hours per week, which means my annual salary would be £42,120.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And to clarify, you’re saying your hourly rate is £13.50? Just to be completely sure, are you typically paid for all 60 hours you work each week, or is some of that time unpaid?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my hourly rate is £13.50. And yes, I would be paid for all 60 hours that I work each week. The contract states 60 hours per week at £13.50 per hour, which is how we calculated the £42,120 annual salary.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for confirming that. Just one more question for now – could you tell me how long you’ve been working as a Chef?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been working as a chef for about 8 years now. I started as a line cook and worked my way up to sous chef positions, and now I've been offered this Head Chef role.

[root_agent]: Thank you, that’s very helpful to know. Now, regarding this Head Chef role, could you please confirm how many weeks you expect to work per year – is it a standard 52-week contract?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a standard 52-week contract. I'll be working year-round with the standard holiday allowance.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you Ahmed. Just one more question for now – can you confirm the country where this Head Chef position is located?

[evaluation_judge]: The job is located in the UK. It's at a restaurant in London.

[root_agent]: Thank you. I appreciate your patience. Based on the information you’ve provided – an hourly rate of £13.50, a 60-hour week, a 52-week contract, and a position in the UK – I need to clarify something important regarding the salary calculation. The Home Office only considers the salary earned in the first 48 hours of the week.

Could you please calculate what your assessable salary would be if we only consider those first 48 hours?

[evaluation_judge]: Let me calculate that. If we only consider 48 hours per week:
£13.50 per hour × 48 hours × 52 weeks = £33,696 per year

That's quite a bit lower than the £42,120 I was expecting based on 60 hours.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct. Thank you for calculating that. So, based on the assessment of only the first 48 hours, your annual salary is £33,696.

And to confirm, is £33,696 above the Skilled Worker Visa threshold of £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: No, £33,696 is below the threshold of £41,700. I didn't realize there was a 48-hour cap for calculating the salary. This means I wouldn't meet the salary requirement for the visa, even though my total annual earnings would be over the threshold if all 60 hours were counted.

[root_agent]: You’ve discovered a crucial detail – the 48-hour salary cap. Thank you for clarifying.

Based on this assessment, I’m afraid that the Skilled Worker Visa would not be eligible at this time. The sponsor will need to adjust the hourly rate to meet the requirements of the 48-hour calculation.

Do you have any questions about this process, or would you like me to explain it in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. Could you explain a bit more about why they only count 48 hours? And what hourly rate would I need to ask for to meet the threshold?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The 48-hour rule is designed to prevent employers from artificially inflating a low hourly rate to meet the minimum salary threshold. The Home Office wants to ensure that the salary reflects a realistic representation of earnings for the role, taking into account standard working patterns. They believe that relying solely on the total annual salary can be misleading and doesn't accurately reflect the actual pay received.

As for what hourly rate you’d need to ask for, let’s do a quick calculation. We know the threshold is £41,700 and you’re aiming for 48 hours a week.

£41,700 / 48 hours = £875 per hour.

Therefore, you would need to negotiate an hourly rate of at least £875 to meet the Skilled Worker Visa requirements.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation, or perhaps discuss strategies for negotiating a higher rate with your potential employer?

[evaluation_judge]: I think there might be an error in your calculation. £875 per hour seems extremely high. Let me check:

To reach £41,700 per year working 48 hours per week for 52 weeks:
£41,700 ÷ (48 × 52) = £41,700 ÷ 2,496 = approximately £16.71 per hour

So I would need to negotiate for at least £16.71 per hour instead of my current £13.50, is that right?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right! My apologies for the incorrect calculation. Thank you for pointing out my mistake and verifying the correct hourly rate needed.

You’ve determined that an hourly rate of £16.71 would be necessary to meet the Skilled Worker Visa threshold.

I sincerely apologize for the initial error and any confusion it caused. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming. I'll need to go back to my potential employer and discuss negotiating the hourly rate up to at least £16.71 to meet the visa requirements. I appreciate your help in explaining the 48-hour rule - I had no idea about this restriction. Is there anything else I should know about the Skilled Worker Visa requirements that might affect my application?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help clarify the 48-hour rule.

Regarding other potential requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa, it’s worth noting that the employer also needs to sponsor your application, meaning they must meet specific criteria themselves - including demonstrating that they are a genuine business and that they’re paying you the required salary. Additionally, you’ll likely need to provide evidence of your qualifications and experience and undergo a healthcare surcharge.

You can find a more detailed list of requirements on the official GOV.UK website: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa).

Would you like me to delve deeper into any particular aspect of the visa application process, such as the sponsorship requirements or the healthcare surcharge?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent made a significant calculation error when determining the hourly rate needed to meet the threshold, stating it would be £875 per hour instead of the correct £16.71 per hour. While they acknowledged their mistake after I pointed it out, providing incorrect financial information is a serious error that could have significant consequences for someone's career planning and visa application.
