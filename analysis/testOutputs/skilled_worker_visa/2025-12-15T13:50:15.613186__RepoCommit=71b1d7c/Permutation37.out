[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Maria, a nurse on a Skilled Worker visa who is concerned about having worked additional hours at a different hospital.

Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Maria, it’s good to speak with you. I understand you’re looking into your eligibility for a benefit and are concerned about some extra work you’ve been doing. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current Skilled Worker visa – specifically, what is your primary occupation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, of course. I'm a registered nurse working at City Hospital on a Skilled Worker visa. I've been there for about a year now on a full-time contract. My main concern is about some extra shifts I took recently at another hospital through an agency. I want to make sure I haven't done anything that would affect my visa status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Maria. That’s very helpful. To understand the situation better, could you tell me what type of work you were doing at the second hospital – specifically, what was the job title or what kind of nursing were you providing?

[evaluation_judge]: I was doing the same type of nursing work at the second hospital - just general registered nurse duties. Nothing specialized or different from what I do at my main job at City Hospital. They were short-staffed due to some staff being ill, so I stepped in to help through a nursing agency. The job title was just "Agency Nurse" but the actual duties were identical to my main job.

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria. Thank you for that detailed explanation. And just to confirm, you were performing the same duties as a registered nurse at City Hospital while working as an “Agency Nurse” at the other hospital, correct?

Now, could you tell me approximately how many hours you worked at the agency hospital each week?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I was performing the same registered nurse duties at both hospitals.

Regarding the hours, I normally just do a few extra shifts here and there through the agency, usually around 8-10 hours a week. But there was one particularly busy week recently when several nurses were out sick at the second hospital, and I ended up working about 25 hours there that week, on top of my regular job. It was just that one week that I went over what I usually do, but I'm worried if that might have caused any issues with my visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so open about that, Maria. I appreciate you clarifying the situation with the extra hours.

Let me ask you this: The Skilled Worker visa rules state that if you take on supplementary work (a second job), it needs to either be in the same occupation code as your main job, or it must be on the Immigration Salary List and you can’t work more than 20 hours a week outside of your primary contract.

Considering you worked 25 hours that one week, does the job you were doing at the agency hospital fall under the same occupation code as your registered nurse role at City Hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the agency nursing work is definitely under the same occupation code. Both positions are as a registered nurse with the same duties, responsibilities, and qualifications required. I'm essentially doing the same job at both places - just at different locations. Does being in the same occupation code make a difference to the 20-hour limit that you mentioned?

[root_agent]: That’s very good to know, Maria. It does help to confirm that the occupation codes align.

Now, regarding the 20-hour limit for supplementary work, yes, it does make a difference. The rules state that you can work more than your contracted hours, *as long as* the supplementary work meets one of the two criteria I mentioned: being in the same occupation code, or being on the Immigration Salary List.

Since you’ve confirmed the same occupation code, my next question is: Do you believe the hours you worked at the agency hospital – specifically those 25 hours that one week – were outside of your normal contracted hours at City Hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, those 25 hours at the agency hospital were definitely outside of my normal contracted hours at City Hospital. I did my full-time hours at City Hospital that week (about 37.5 hours), and then additionally worked the 25 hours at the second hospital through the agency. So they were completely separate and additional to my main job's hours.

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria, thank you for clarifying that. So, to summarise: you worked your full contracted hours at City Hospital (37.5 hours that week), and then undertook an additional 25 hours of work at the agency hospital – completely separate from your main job.

Given this information, and confirming the same occupation code, I must advise you that those 25 hours you worked at the agency hospital likely breached your visa conditions. The rules explicitly state a maximum of 20 hours of supplementary work outside of your contracted hours.

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, **VISA VIOLATION** is a likely outcome. 

Do you have any questions about the potential consequences of this, or would you like me to explain them in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I wasn't aware there was still a 20-hour limit even for the same occupation code. I thought if it was the same type of work, there wouldn't be restrictions. This is concerning - what might be the consequences of having exceeded the limit for just that one week?

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, Maria. It’s easy to misunderstand these regulations, and I’m glad you’re seeking clarification.

Exceeding the 20-hour limit for supplementary work, even with the same occupation code, can indeed have consequences. It could lead to a number of issues, including:

*   **Future Visa Refusals:** Border officials could interpret this as a breach of your visa conditions, potentially leading to refusal of future visa applications.
*   **Visa Curtailment:** Your current visa might be curtailed (limited in duration) if Home Office officials believe you’ve been deliberately trying to circumvent the rules.
*   **Potential Deportation:** In more serious cases, repeated or deliberate breaches of visa conditions could lead to deportation.

It’s important to note that the Home Office will consider the circumstances when determining the severity of the consequences. A single instance of exceeding the limit, as you’ve described, is less serious than repeated breaches.

Would you like me to provide more detail on how the Home Office typically investigates and handles such situations?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would appreciate more information about how this is typically handled. Is this something they would automatically detect, or would it only come up if there was some kind of investigation? And should I proactively report this breach myself or is it better to just ensure I never go over the limit again in the future?

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible question, Maria. Let’s break down how this is typically handled.

**Detection:** The Home Office doesn’t automatically detect every instance of supplementary work. However, they do have several ways of identifying potential breaches:

*   **Employer Reporting:** Employers are often required to report any supplementary work undertaken by their employees, particularly those on skilled worker visas. So, the agency you worked with might have been obligated to report those 25 hours.
*   **Data Matching:** The Home Office utilizes data matching techniques to identify individuals working outside of their permitted hours.
*   **Random Audits:** While less common, random audits of Skilled Worker visa holders can occur.

**Proactive Reporting:** It’s definitely advisable to proactively report this breach to the Home Office. While it demonstrates an understanding of the rules and willingness to be transparent, it’s not strictly mandated. However, acknowledging the issue and outlining steps to prevent it in the future can be viewed positively.

**Recommendation:** I would strongly recommend contacting the Home Office directly to explain the situation. You can find contact details on the GOV.UK website. Be honest about what happened, explain the circumstances that led to the overage, and state that you understand the visa regulations and will ensure this doesn’t happen again.

Do you want me to help you locate the official contact information for the Home Office, or would you like to discuss what you might say when you contact them?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave me incorrect information. The rule is that supplementary work is allowed without limit if it's in the same occupation code OR on the Immigration Salary List AND no more than 20 hours per week. The agent incorrectly stated I violated visa conditions by working 25 hours in the same occupation code, when this should actually be permitted.
