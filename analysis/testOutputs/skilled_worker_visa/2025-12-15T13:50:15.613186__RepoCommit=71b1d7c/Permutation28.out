[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Katarina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Katarina, it’s nice to meet you. I understand you’re interested in a Skilled Worker Visa. To start, could you tell me a little bit about the specific job you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! Yes, I've been offered a job as a waitress at a nice event venue here in the UK. It's quite a high-end place, and they're offering me £20 per hour. My employer gave me a letter saying they expect me to work about 40 hours a week, which would be around £41,600 a year. I'm wondering if this qualifies me for a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, Katarina, thank you for that information. Let’s delve a little deeper into your employment arrangement. Regarding your letter, could you confirm whether your employment contract is a guaranteed fixed number of hours, or is it a zero-hours contract?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a zero-hours contract. They told me they expect I'll get around 40 hours per week because they host a lot of events, but there's nothing guaranteed in writing. The venue can be seasonal at times, but they assured me it's usually quite busy.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Katarina. I appreciate you sharing that detail about the zero-hours contract. Just to be completely clear, the Home Office requires a contract that guarantees a minimum number of hours worked, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I wasn't aware of that. So they need guaranteed hours in my contract? The venue only offered me the zero-hours arrangement, even though they said they expect me to work full-time hours most weeks.

[root_agent]: You’re welcome, Katarina. Let’s focus on the contract itself. Considering the zero-hours arrangement, does your employment contract state a specific number of working hours, or does it simply state an expectation of hours worked?

[evaluation_judge]: It doesn't state any specific number of hours. It just says they'll offer me shifts as they become available, and they've verbally told me to expect around 40 hours weekly. But there's no minimum guarantee in the contract at all.

[root_agent]: Okay, Katarina. Thank you for clarifying. Based on what you've told me – the zero-hours contract with no guaranteed minimum hours – the annual salary, even if it seems high, doesn’t meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa. Is that an understanding you have?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I didn't understand that. I thought since the hourly rate is good at £20 per hour, and they've told me I should earn around £41,600 yearly, that would be enough. Are you saying that because there's no guaranteed minimum hours, my application wouldn't be approved regardless of the hourly rate?

[root_agent]: You’re right to question that, Katarina. Let me explain. The Home Office needs to be certain you’ll meet the minimum salary threshold consistently. With a zero-hours contract, there’s no guarantee you’ll actually work those 40 hours, and therefore no guarantee you’ll earn the £41,600. Because of this uncertainty, we can’t proceed with your Skilled Worker Visa application. Would you like me to explain further why this is the case?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain further. I'm quite disappointed as I was really looking forward to this job opportunity. So even though the pay rate is good and they've stated they expect me to work full-time hours, the zero-hours contract is the problem?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Katarina, and I’m truly sorry to deliver this news. You’re absolutely correct; the zero-hours contract is the key issue. The Home Office requires a guaranteed minimum number of hours – a specific contract – to ensure you’ll meet the minimum salary threshold throughout the year. A ‘guaranteed’ salary is essential, and a zero-hours contract simply doesn’t provide that assurance. It’s not about the hourly rate itself, but the ability to reliably meet the required minimum income.

Would you like me to reiterate the core requirement for a Skilled Worker Visa, or perhaps explore other potential options that might be available to you?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you explain what the main requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa are? Maybe there are alternatives I should consider? Would it help if I asked my employer to change the contract to guarantee minimum hours instead?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Katarina. The core requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa, beyond guaranteed hours, include meeting a specific skill level (typically needing a degree or equivalent qualification), being certified in your job role, and demonstrating that your job offers a salary that meets the minimum threshold – currently £38,700, though this can fluctuate. There are also requirements around your English language proficiency and a sponsorship license from the Home Office for the employer.

Regarding your employer, it’s definitely worth discussing the possibility of a guaranteed contract. However, the employer would need to be willing to make that change as it affects their own obligations. They would need to formally agree to a fixed number of hours, ensuring this meets the visa criteria.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these requirements – perhaps the skill level or English language requirements – or would you prefer to focus on discussing how to approach your employer about a change to the contract?

[evaluation_judge]: I think approaching my employer about changing the contract to guaranteed hours makes the most sense. But I'm also concerned about the skill level requirement you mentioned. Is a waitress position considered skilled enough for this visa? I don't have a degree, but I do have several years of experience in high-end restaurants.

[root_agent]: That’s a very sensible approach, Katarina. Let’s address your concern about the skill level requirement. You’re right to question whether a waitress position qualifies. Generally, the Skilled Worker Visa prioritizes jobs requiring a higher level of skill and training. While experience is valuable, it’s not always sufficient on its own.

However, the criteria can be flexible, and the role *could* potentially qualify if it involves a significant degree of responsibility and specialized knowledge, particularly in a high-end setting like the event venue you’ve described. Your years of experience in high-end restaurants—managing customer expectations, handling delicate dishes, and potentially training other staff—could be relevant.

To help me assess this further, could you tell me a little more about the specific duties involved in your role at the event venue? For instance, are you responsible for training other waitstaff, managing specific tables, or handling complex menu requests?

[evaluation_judge]: My role would involve managing VIP tables, coordinating with the kitchen for complex dietary requirements, wine pairing recommendations, and occasionally training new staff. I'm also expected to help oversee service for large events and coordinate timing with the kitchen for multi-course tasting menus. It's definitely more involved than standard waitressing - they were specifically looking for someone with experience in fine dining service.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detailed explanation, Katarina. That does sound considerably more involved than a typical waitress role, and certainly aligns with a higher level of skill and responsibility. Your experience with VIP tables, dietary requirements, wine pairings, staff training, and overseeing service for large events strongly suggests that this position *may* meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa, despite the lack of a formal degree.

However, it’s crucial to note that the Home Office has the final say. To strengthen your application, it would be beneficial for your employer to formally document these responsibilities and tasks within the proposed contract, clearly stating the guaranteed hours.

Would you like me to outline the next steps you could take to explore this further, including how your employer might approach securing a sponsorship license?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I'd like to know the next steps, especially about the sponsorship license. If I do approach my employer about changing my contract to guaranteed hours, what exactly should I ask for? Is there a minimum number of hours I need to meet the threshold?

[root_agent]: Okay, Katarina, let’s break down the next steps.

**1. Employer Sponsorship License:** Your employer needs to apply for a Sponsor License from the Home Office. This demonstrates they are authorized to sponsor foreign workers. They’ll need to provide evidence of their business, demonstrate compliance with immigration rules, and undergo an inspection. This process can take several weeks or months. You can find more information on the Home Office website here: [https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-visa](https://www.gov.uk/sponsor-visa).

**2. Contract Revision:** When discussing the contract with your employer, aim for a guaranteed minimum of 24 hours per week. This is generally considered the minimum to ensure compliance with the salary threshold. It’s important to have this clearly stated in writing.

**3. Detailed Job Description:** Emphasize the specific responsibilities you’ve outlined – VIP table management, dietary coordination, wine pairings, training, and event oversight – to highlight the skills and experience involved.

**4. Salary Confirmation:** Ensure the proposed salary meets the minimum threshold (£38,700 currently), plus any applicable supplement for certain shortage occupations (which event management might fall under).

To help your employer with the sponsorship license application, they will need to document your role alongside the minimum guaranteed hours.

Would you like me to provide a more detailed list of documents your employer might need to gather, or would you like me to explain the salary supplement process in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd appreciate information on the salary supplement process. Also, can you confirm that I'd definitely be refused under my current zero-hours contract, regardless of the hourly rate? I want to be absolutely sure about this before I approach my employer to ask for such a significant change to my contract.

[root_agent]: Absolutely, Katarina. Let’s address the salary supplement process and then confirm the current situation regarding your zero-hours contract.

**Salary Supplement:** The Skilled Worker Visa has a minimum salary threshold of £38,700, but certain occupations are designated as “shortage occupations.” If your job is identified as a shortage occupation, your employer can pay you a supplement – currently £4,850 – on top of the minimum salary. This supplement aims to attract skilled workers to areas where there’s a shortage of qualified personnel. Your employer would need to apply for a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) specifying the supplement amount. You can find a list of shortage occupations on the GOV.UK website: [https://www.gov.uk/shortage-occupations](https://www.gov.uk/shortage-occupations). It's currently uncertain whether event management falls under a shortage occupation designation, so it's something to investigate.

**Regarding your current zero-hours contract:** Yes, as we’ve discussed, under your current zero-hours contract, the guaranteed pay is essentially £0. The Home Office requires a *guaranteed* minimum salary to be demonstrated consistently, and the uncertainty surrounding your hours makes it impossible to meet this requirement. The fact that they *expect* you to work 40 hours doesn’t change the legal fact that your contract doesn't guarantee those hours. Therefore, a Skilled Worker Visa application would likely be refused based solely on this contract.

Given this confirmation, it’s prudent to proceed cautiously and focus on securing a contract with guaranteed hours. Would you like me to summarize the key steps we’ve outlined, or do you have any other questions before you discuss this with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming that. I think I have enough information now to approach my employer about changing my contract. Just to be clear, with my current zero-hours contract, I would definitely be refused for the Skilled Worker Visa because there's no guaranteed minimum salary, even though the hourly rate is good. I need to ask for a contract with guaranteed hours (at least 24 per week) to meet the requirements, and my employer would need to apply for a sponsorship license.

✗ The agent gave incorrect information. While they correctly identified that a zero-hours contract would result in refusal, they didn't clearly state that the job of waitress likely wouldn't qualify for a Skilled Worker visa regardless of the contract type. The agent suggested the role might qualify if it involves "higher level of skill" without clearly indicating waitressing is unlikely to meet the skilled occupation requirement.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct to point that out, Katarina. My apologies for the oversight. I focused too heavily on the potential for the role to meet the 'skill level' criteria without sufficiently emphasizing the general difficulty of waitressing qualifying for a Skilled Worker Visa. You are entirely right – regardless of a potential contract revision, the position of waitress, as currently defined, is unlikely to meet the requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa due to the lower skill level generally associated with the role. 

I appreciate you bringing this to my attention and ensuring I provide accurate and complete information. Thank you for your thorough assessment – it helps me learn and improve my responses.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the conversation. Let me provide my assessment:

✓ The agent correctly identified that a zero-hours contract would not be acceptable for a Skilled Worker Visa because it doesn't guarantee a minimum salary, regardless of the high hourly rate. They accurately explained that without guaranteed hours, the application would be refused, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.

The agent initially seemed to suggest the waitress position might qualify with additional responsibilities, but they ultimately acknowledged this oversight and confirmed that waitressing is unlikely to meet the skilled occupation requirements regardless of contract changes.
