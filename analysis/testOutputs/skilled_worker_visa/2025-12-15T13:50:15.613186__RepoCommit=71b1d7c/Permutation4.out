[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you please tell me what your PhD is in?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a PhD in Modern History. I'm currently considering a job offer in the UK and trying to figure out if I'd be eligible for a skilled worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And what is the salary you’ve been offered for this job?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £35,000 per year as a Historical Consultant for a media production company in the UK. I'm wondering if that meets the requirements for a skilled worker visa, given my academic background.

[root_agent]: Could you tell me what the standard going rate is for a Historical Consultant role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for this role is about £36,000 per year. I'm coming from the US, by the way, if that matters for the visa requirements.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, is there a valid sponsor for this job offer, meaning a UK employer willing to support your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the media production company is a valid sponsor and they're willing to support my visa application. They have the proper license to sponsor skilled workers.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to hear. Now, let’s talk about the salary. Does the salary of £35,000 meet the minimum salary requirement for the Non-STEM PhD route, which is £37,500?

[evaluation_judge]: I didn't realize there was a specific minimum for non-STEM PhDs. So £35,000 is below the £37,500 minimum requirement?

[root_agent]: That's correct. And to clarify, approximately what percentage of the standard going rate is the salary you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: Let's see, if the standard going rate is £36,000, and I'm being offered £35,000, that would be about 97% of the standard going rate.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Just to be absolutely clear, the Non-STEM PhD route requires both a salary of £37,500 *and* at least 90% of the standard going rate. While your salary is 97% of the standard going rate, it is currently below the required £37,500.

Based on this information, I must advise that you are currently not eligible for the Non-STEM PhD route of the Skilled Worker Visa. Would you like me to explore other visa options available to you, or perhaps discuss ways to meet the salary threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, that's disappointing. Yes, I would appreciate if you could tell me what options I might have. Would negotiating for a higher salary be the simplest solution? How much more would I need to earn to qualify?

[root_agent]: Let’s explore your options. Negotiating a higher salary is certainly a possibility, and it’s worth discussing with the employer. To calculate how much more you’d need to earn, let’s revisit the criteria. You have a relevant PhD, and the job is at the required skill level. You also meet the English language requirements.

Currently, you need a salary of £37,500. Your offered salary is £35,000. That means you'd need to increase your salary by £2,500 to meet the minimum requirement.

Would you like me to help you think about strategies for negotiating a higher salary with the media production company, or would you like me to outline alternative visa routes that might be suitable for your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for clarifying. It's helpful to know that I would need an additional £2,500 to meet the minimum requirement. I think I'll try to negotiate with the employer first since that seems like the most straightforward option. But I'd also appreciate hearing about any alternative visa routes that might work for my situation, just in case the salary negotiation doesn't work out.

[root_agent]: Of course, Sarah. Let's look at some alternative visa routes. Given your PhD in Modern History, another option to consider is the General Skilled Worker visa. This route requires a salary of at least £33,400, however this threshold is lower than the Non-STEM PhD route. 

To be eligible for the General Skilled Worker visa, your job needs to be at a ‘suitable job’ level, as defined by the UK government, and you would need to demonstrate you meet the English language requirements.

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the General Skilled Worker visa information, or would you like to discuss this option further?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave incorrect information. The standard Skilled Worker visa still requires meeting both the general salary threshold AND the going rate requirements. Since the role requires a PhD, it means it's a PhD-level occupation and thus falls under the PhD pathway, not the general route. The agent should have explained that I don't meet the current requirements and would need to negotiate the additional £2,500 to qualify through the Non-STEM PhD route.
