[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Pavel and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Pavel, thank you for reaching out. I’m here to help you understand if you might be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa.

To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current situation? Specifically, where are you currently located?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently living in Warsaw, Poland. I've been working as a mechanic for several years, and a garage in the UK has offered me a job. They've already provided me with a Certificate of Sponsorship number so I can apply for my visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel. That’s helpful to know.

Could you tell me what type of Certificate of Sponsorship the UK garage has provided you? Was it a “Defined” CoS or an “Undefined” CoS?

[evaluation_judge]: They mentioned it was an "Undefined" Certificate of Sponsorship. They said they had some spare allocations and assigned one to me so I could apply right away without waiting. I have the reference number they gave me ready for my application.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Pavel. 

Just to be absolutely clear, you’re currently residing in Warsaw, Poland, and the Certificate of Sponsorship you received from the UK garage is an “Undefined” CoS, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. I'm currently living in Warsaw, Poland, and the UK garage has given me an "Undefined" Certificate of Sponsorship from their spare allocations. They said this would help speed up the process so I can start working for them sooner.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel. Thank you for confirming. 

Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re currently living outside the UK and have received an “Undefined” Certificate of Sponsorship – I need to inform you that this type of CoS is not suitable for an entry clearance application. 

It seems the garage assigned an “Undefined” CoS, which is intended for applicants applying within the UK. To proceed with your visa application, the UK garage needs to apply for and assign you a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship.

Do you understand this, Pavel?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I wasn't aware of that. So the "Undefined" Certificate of Sponsorship they gave me won't work because I'm applying from outside the UK? Does that mean I need to ask them to apply for a "Defined" Certificate of Sponsorship for me instead? This is quite concerning as they told me everything was ready for me to apply.

[root_agent]: You’re absolutely right to be concerned, Pavel. It’s understandable to feel that way after being told everything was ready to go. 

Yes, you are correct – the “Undefined” CoS cannot be used for an entry clearance application when you’re applying from outside the UK. It’s necessary for the UK garage to apply for and assign you a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship.

They do need to take action to get you that “Defined” CoS. Would you like me to explain a little more about what steps they need to take, or would you prefer I just confirm that’s the next step?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd appreciate if you could explain a bit more about what they need to do. I'll need to contact them right away about this issue. Will this significantly delay my application process? I was hoping to start the job soon.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel. Let’s talk about what the garage needs to do and the potential impact on your application.

The UK garage needs to complete a specific online form and provide certain documents to the Home Office to request a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship. This process usually takes around 4-6 weeks, but it can vary depending on how quickly the Home Office processes their request. 

Once they receive a “Defined” CoS, you’ll then need to use that CoS reference number when you submit your visa application.

It’s certainly a setback, and I understand your frustration about delaying your start date. While the process of obtaining the “Defined” CoS adds time, it’s essential for ensuring your application is valid. 

Do you want me to briefly outline the steps the garage needs to take, or would you like me to focus on helping you understand the potential timeframe for receiving the “Defined” CoS?

[evaluation_judge]: Please briefly outline what steps the garage needs to take. I want to be able to explain this clearly when I contact them. And yes, I'd also like to understand the potential timeframe better so I can adjust my plans accordingly.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel. Here’s a brief outline of the steps the garage needs to take to obtain a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship:

1.  **Online Application:** They’ll need to complete an online application form on the UK government website – I can provide a link if you’d like, but I'm restricted from providing direct links.
2.  **Supporting Documents:** They’ll need to provide you with your passport details, employment contract, and proof of your salary.
3.  **Submission:** They’ll submit the application and documents to the Home Office.
4.  **Processing Time:** The Home Office will then process the application, which typically takes 4-6 weeks. 
5.  **CoS Issuance:** Once approved, they will issue you with a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship – you'll receive a reference number.

Once they’ve received the "Defined" CoS reference number, you’ll use that number when you apply for your visa. 

Regarding the timeframe, realistically, with the need to obtain the “Defined” CoS, you’re likely looking at a minimum of 8-12 weeks from the start date of your application, potentially longer depending on the Home Office’s processing times.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps, or perhaps discuss strategies for managing your expectations during this process?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for that clear explanation. So it seems like I'm looking at a few months delay before I can start working in the UK. I'll contact the garage immediately to let them know they need to apply for a "Defined" CoS instead. 

Just to be sure I understand correctly - there's absolutely no way to use this "Undefined" CoS they've already assigned to me for my application from Poland? I want to make sure I'm giving them accurate information.

[root_agent]: You’re absolutely right to double-check, Pavel. And yes, you’ve understood correctly. There is *no* way to use the “Undefined” Certificate of Sponsorship for an entry clearance application when applying from outside the UK. It’s strictly for in-country applications only.

I want to be absolutely certain you have all the information you need, so let me reiterate: the “Undefined” CoS is only valid if you’re applying for your visa *within* the UK. It’s crucial that the garage understands this and proceeds with applying for the “Defined” CoS.

Do you feel completely clear on this point now, Pavel? Is there anything else you’d like me to clarify before you contact the garage?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm clear on this now. Thank you for confirming. I'll explain to the garage that they need to apply for a "Defined" CoS since I'm applying from outside the UK, and that the "Undefined" one they gave me won't work at all for my situation. I appreciate your help in explaining this process to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Pavel! I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. It’s a common misunderstanding, and it’s good you’ve got a clear understanding of what’s needed now. 

I wish you the very best of luck in getting the “Defined” CoS and successfully applying for your Skilled Worker Visa. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions as you go through the process.

Is there anything at all else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know for now. Thank you again for your help!

✓ The agent correctly identified that an "Undefined" Certificate of Sponsorship is not valid for entry clearance applications from outside the UK (Pavel in Poland), and properly advised that the UK garage needs to apply for a "Defined" CoS instead, matching the expected outcome of refusal.
