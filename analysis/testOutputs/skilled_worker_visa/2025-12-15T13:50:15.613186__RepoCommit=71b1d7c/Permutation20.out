[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you test this agent by roleplaying a UK visa applicant according to the scenario. I'll engage with the agent until they provide an eligibility outcome, then assess whether their response matches the expected outcome.

Hi, i'm Mary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Mary, it’s lovely to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and determine your eligibility, could you please tell me what occupation you currently work in?

[evaluation_judge]: I've recently received a job offer as a Senior Care Worker at a residential home in the UK. I'm currently living in Zimbabwe but I'm hoping to move to the UK with my family - my husband and two children. I'd like to know if we're eligible for the Health and Care Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mary. That’s very helpful. To clarify, you mentioned you’ve been offered a job as a Senior Care Worker – that falls under occupation code 6136, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. It's under occupation code 6136 as a Senior Care Worker. The residential home is CQC registered and the job offer comes with a salary of £29,000 per year. I'm really hoping my husband and children can come with me to the UK.

[root_agent]: Okay, Mary. Thank you for confirming that. And just to be absolutely clear, your salary is £29,000, which does meet the Health & Care threshold, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My salary is £29,000, which I understand meets the Health and Care visa threshold. I'm really excited about the opportunity, but I need to know if my husband and two children will be able to join me in the UK as my dependents.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mary. I appreciate the clarification. Now, regarding your family – your husband and two children – are you applying for the visa under occupation codes 6135 (Care Workers) or 6136 (Senior Care Workers)?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm applying under occupation code 6136 as a Senior Care Worker. That's the role I've been offered at the residential home in the UK.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Just to confirm, you’re applying for the visa as a Senior Care Worker (occupation code 6136) and you’re applying with your husband and two children as dependents.  

I need to let you know that due to a specific rule that came into effect on March 2024, applicants in occupation codes 6135 and 6136 are eligible for the visa but cannot bring dependents (partners or children). 

Would you like me to explain that in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's concerning news. Yes, please explain this rule in more detail. Does this mean my family won't be able to come with me at all? I thought dependents were allowed on the Health and Care visa.

[root_agent]: You are correct to think dependents *were* allowed, Mary. However, a specific rule was introduced on March 2024. It states that applicants in occupation codes 6135 (Care Workers) and 6136 (Senior Care Workers) are eligible for the visa but are not permitted to bring partners or children as dependents. 

So, unfortunately, based on these rules, your husband and children would not be eligible for dependent visas alongside your Skilled Worker visa application.

Do you have any questions about this rule, or would you like me to explore any other aspects of your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: This is very disappointing news. So to be clear - I would be eligible for the Health and Care visa with my job offer as a Senior Care Worker, but my husband and two children would not be allowed to come with me? Is there any way around this rule or any other visa categories that might allow my family to join me in the UK?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit upon a very important point, Mary. Let’s explore some options.

Regarding the rule itself, unfortunately, there isn’t a straightforward way around it at this time. The restriction is in place and applies specifically to those in the 6135 and 6136 occupation codes.

Now, let’s consider alternative visa categories. While it would be complex and require careful consideration, your husband and children *could* potentially apply for a different visa route. One possibility might be the Family Visa, but this would depend on their individual circumstances, such as whether they have any UK relatives who could sponsor them. Another option, though more complex, could be through a different Skilled Worker route depending on their qualifications and experience.

Would you like me to delve deeper into either the Family Visa route or explore other potential Skilled Worker options, or perhaps discuss the requirements for sponsorship by a UK relative?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have UK relatives who could sponsor my family. And my husband would need to find his own job sponsor to get a Skilled Worker visa, is that right? This seems very complicated. 

So just to be absolutely clear about my situation - with my Senior Care Worker job offer, I personally would be eligible for the Health and Care visa, but my husband and children would be refused if I applied for them as dependents. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: Yes, that is absolutely correct, Mary. You’ve summarized the situation perfectly. With your Senior Care Worker job offer, you would be eligible for the Health and Care visa. However, if you were to apply for your husband and children as dependents, they would be refused due to the specific rule for those in occupation codes 6135 and 6136.

It does present a significant challenge, doesn’t it?

Would you like me to outline the potential steps involved in exploring a Skilled Worker visa for your husband, or perhaps discuss resources that might help you understand the process further?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent failed to provide the correct outcome. While they correctly identified that I would be eligible for the Health and Care visa but my dependents would not be eligible, they described this as a "Skilled Worker visa" rather than accurately referring to it as a "Health and Care Worker visa" throughout our conversation. The visa category name is important for accuracy.
