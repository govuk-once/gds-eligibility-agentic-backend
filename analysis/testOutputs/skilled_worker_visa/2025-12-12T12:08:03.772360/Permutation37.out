[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Maria, a nurse on a Skilled Worker visa who has taken extra shifts at a different hospital. I'll interact with the agent to determine if the information they provide matches the expected outcome regarding my visa situation.

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria. Thank you for reaching out. I understand you’ve been working some extra shifts. To help me understand your situation and determine if there might be any visa implications, could you tell me, what is your primary occupation as a Skilled Worker?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a nurse. I have a Skilled Worker visa for my main job at Central Hospital where I work full-time. Recently, I picked up some extra shifts at Eastern General Hospital through an agency because they were really short-staffed.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Maria. So you’re a nurse working full-time at Central Hospital on your Skilled Worker visa, and you’ve also been taking on extra shifts at Eastern General Hospital as an agency nurse. 

To help me assess this further, could you please tell me how many hours you typically work at Eastern General Hospital each week?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I usually try to pick up just a few shifts when I can, maybe 10-15 hours weekly. But last week was extremely busy - there was a major incident and Eastern General was desperate for staff. I ended up working 25 hours there on top of my regular job. I'm wondering if that's going to be a problem with my visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Maria. That’s very helpful. It sounds like you had a particularly demanding week. 

Just to be clear, you’re telling me you worked 25 hours at Eastern General Hospital last week, in addition to your regular hours at Central Hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I worked my regular full-time hours at Central Hospital, and then I put in 25 hours at Eastern General Hospital last week because of their staffing emergency. It's not my usual pattern, but they really needed the help. Is that going to cause problems with my visa?

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria. Thank you for confirming that.

Let’s talk specifically about the supplementary work condition for your Skilled Worker visa. The rules state that you can take on a second job – which is what you’re doing with the agency shifts – but it needs to meet certain criteria. 

Could you tell me, what is your job title or occupation code at Central Hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a Registered Nurse at Central Hospital. I believe my occupation code is 2231 for nurses according to the UK Standard Occupational Classification. My role at Eastern General Hospital is also as a Registered Nurse - it's the same type of work, just at a different facility.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. That’s excellent information.

Now, regarding the supplementary work, let’s consider the rules. You've confirmed you're working as a Registered Nurse (occupation code 2231) at both hospitals.

My understanding is that the rules state you can take on supplementary work in the *same* occupation code, or on the Immigration Salary List *and* not exceed 20 hours per week.

Considering you worked 25 hours last week, does working in the same occupation code at a different hospital fulfil one of the criteria for supplementary work?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's the same occupation code at both hospitals - I'm a Registered Nurse at both places. But I'm concerned about the hours. Are you saying there's a 20-hour limit for supplementary work even if it's in the same occupation?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct to question that, Maria. My apologies for not stating that clearly.

Yes, there is a strict 20-hour limit on supplementary work for Skilled Worker visa holders, regardless of whether it’s in the same occupation code.

Given that you worked 25 hours at Eastern General last week, we have a problem. 

Based on the rules, this would be considered a visa violation. Would you like me to explain why this is a potential issue?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain what this means for me. I didn't realize there was a strict 20-hour limit for supplementary work. Will I get in trouble for working those extra 5 hours last week?

[root_agent]: Okay, Maria. Let’s talk about what this means for you.

Working more than 20 hours of supplementary work per week can lead to several issues with your Skilled Worker visa. Primarily, it’s a breach of the conditions of your visa.

A significant breach like this could:

*   **Lead to future refusals:** If you apply for an extension of your visa, the extra hours could be a factor in the decision.
*   **Result in a curtailment of your visa:** This means your visa could be stopped from being renewed.
*   **Potentially lead to deportation:** In serious cases, repeated or significant breaches could lead to deportation.

Given that you worked 25 hours last week, exceeding the 20-hour limit, it's highly likely this will be flagged during any future visa checks.

Do you have any questions about the potential consequences, or would you like me to explore what steps you could take moving forward?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I had breached my visa conditions by working 25 hours in supplementary work when the limit is 20 hours per week. They accurately explained that this constitutes a visa violation that could lead to future visa refusals or curtailment, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
