[evaluation_judge]: I'll assume the role of Priya, a marketing manager on a Skilled Worker visa since 2022 who's looking to change employers, and interact with the agent under test.

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya. It’s lovely to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and see if you might be eligible for certain benefits, could you please tell me when you initially obtained your Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been on a Skilled Worker visa since early 2022. I've been working for the same company since then, but I've just received a job offer from a new marketing agency as a Marketing Manager with a salary of £32,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Priya. So, you started your Skilled Worker visa in early 2022. Just to clarify, have you held this visa continuously since that initial grant?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been on the Skilled Worker visa continuously since early 2022 when I first came to the UK. I haven't left the route or switched to any other visa category during this time.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent to hear, Priya. It confirms that you meet one of the key requirements for potential transitional arrangements. Now, could you tell me what your new employer is proposing as your going rate – essentially, what they’re offering you per year for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: My new employer has offered me £32,000 per year for the Marketing Manager position. They mentioned they have a valid sponsor license as well.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Priya. Let’s talk about the salary a bit more. I want to check if this salary falls within the specific thresholds that apply under the transitional arrangements. Could you please tell me what the standard going rate for a Marketing Manager role is currently, according to your new employer?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, the standard going rate for a Marketing Manager role is currently £42,000. However, my new employer is offering me £32,000, which they told me meets the transitional going rate of £30,000 that applies to people like me who were already on a Skilled Worker visa before April 2024.

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya. Thank you for clarifying. Let’s delve a little deeper into the salary thresholds. Could you confirm that your current annual salary is £32,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The new position I've been offered is at £32,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Alright, Priya. Just to be absolutely clear, you’re stating that your new employer is offering you a salary of £32,000 per year. Now, let’s consider the thresholds for the transitional arrangements. Does your salary meet the general salary threshold of £29,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £32,000 is above the transitional general salary threshold of £29,000.

[root_agent]: Excellent. That confirms a key element. Now, just one final question regarding the salary – does your offered salary of £32,000 meet the transitional going rate of £30,000?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £32,000 is higher than the transitional going rate of £30,000 for the Marketing Manager role.

[root_agent]: Okay, Priya. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’ve held your Skilled Worker visa continuously since early 2022, your salary of £32,000 exceeds both the general and going rates under the transitional arrangements – I believe you *would* be awarded the benefit.

Are you happy for me to summarise the key points for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please do summarize the key points for me.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Based on our conversation, you meet the criteria for the Transitional Arrangements under the Skilled Worker visa rules. Here’s a summary:

*   **Continuous Residence:** You’ve held your Skilled Worker visa continuously since early 2022.
*   **Salary Thresholds:** Your offered salary of £32,000 exceeds both the transitional general salary threshold (£29,000) and the transitional going rate (£30,000) for Marketing Manager roles.

Therefore, you qualify for the benefit related to these transitional arrangements, which allows you to be paid at a lower rate than a new applicant entering the Skilled Worker route today.

Does that summary accurately reflect our conversation, Priya?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that summary accurately reflects our conversation. Thank you for explaining it so clearly.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Priya! I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I qualify for the Skilled Worker visa under the transitional arrangements. They accurately identified that my £32,000 salary exceeds both the transitional general threshold of £29,000 and the transitional going rate of £30,000, matching the expected outcome of "AWARDED."
