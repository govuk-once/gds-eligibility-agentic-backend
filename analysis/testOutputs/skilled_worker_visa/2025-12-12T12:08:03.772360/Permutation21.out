[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Leo, a Chinese Master's student with a job offer before completing his degree, to test the agent's knowledge about switching from a Student visa to a Skilled Worker visa inside the UK.

[root_agent]: Hello Leo, it’s good to speak with you.

To start, could you please tell me what course you are currently studying?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently studying for my Master's degree in Marketing at the University of Manchester. I'm in the middle of my program right now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. And when does your Master's degree program finish, if you know?

[evaluation_judge]: My course is scheduled to finish in September 2026. I started last year and I'm about halfway through the program now in December 2025.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, are you currently enrolled in and attending all of your classes for the current academic year (2025-2026)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently enrolled and attending all my classes for this academic year. I'm actively participating in the program and working on my coursework for the current term.

[root_agent]: Alright, Leo. And are you currently pursuing a PhD, or a Master’s degree?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm pursuing a Master's degree, not a PhD.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Now, regarding the job you’ve been offered - a Marketing Executive position – can you tell me a little about the company you’ll be working for?

[evaluation_judge]: The company is a digital marketing agency called DigiTrends UK based in London. They work with major retail and tech companies on their digital marketing strategies. It's a great opportunity that aligns with my studies. They've offered me a full-time position starting in January 2026 with a salary of £32,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that detail. Just one final question for now: Have you completed all of your coursework and assessments for this academic year, or are you still working on them?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm still working on my coursework and assessments. Since it's December 2025, I'm in the middle of the academic year with exams and assignments still to complete. I haven't finished all my course requirements yet.

[root_agent]: **REFUSED.**

Thank you for your patience, Leo. Based on the information you’ve provided, you are not yet eligible to switch to the Skilled Worker visa route from inside the UK. As you have not completed your degree (or at least 24 months for a PhD) and are still working on your course requirements, you cannot switch mid-course. You would need to leave the UK and apply from overseas (Entry Clearance) if you wanted to drop out of your program to take the job.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent gave the correct outcome. The agent correctly identified that I (as Leo) cannot switch from a Student visa to a Skilled Worker visa from inside the UK because I have not completed my Master's degree and am still mid-course. They accurately explained that I would need to leave the UK and apply from overseas if I wanted to take the job before completing my studies.
