[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Tariq, a former PhD student who spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa, and I'm now applying for a Skilled Worker visa as a New Entrant with a £34,000 salary offer for a Junior Data Analyst position. I'll interact with the agent until they give me an eligibility outcome, then evaluate if their determination matches the expected outcome (that I should be REFUSED due to exceeding the 4-year cap for New Entrant status).

[root_agent]: Okay Tariq, thank you for sharing that information. Let’s start with a general question to help me understand your situation better.

Could you please tell me, what type of degree did you earn your PhD in?

[evaluation_judge]: I completed my PhD in Computer Science three years ago. After finishing my studies, I moved onto a Graduate Visa which I've been on for about 3 years and 6 months now. I'm looking to apply for a Skilled Worker visa as I've been offered a Junior Data Analyst position with a salary of £34,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Tariq. That’s very helpful.

To ensure I have a complete picture, could you tell me – and I’ll just ask once at a time – when did you actually *finish* your PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: I finished my PhD 3 years and 6 months ago. Immediately after completing it, I switched to the Graduate visa, which I've been on ever since.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Let’s move on to the job offer itself.

Could you describe the specific duties and responsibilities of the Junior Data Analyst role you’ve been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: In this Junior Data Analyst role, I'll be responsible for analyzing datasets, creating visualizations, writing SQL queries to extract data from databases, building basic statistical models, and providing insights to help with business decisions. I'll also be preparing reports and dashboards for the management team and collaborating with other departments to understand their data needs. The company is a medium-sized tech firm that specializes in financial technology solutions.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detailed description, Tariq.

Now, let’s talk about your salary. You mentioned the offer is for £34,000. Is this salary amount consistent across the entire duration of the 2-year Skilled Worker visa you're requesting?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the salary will be £34,000 for the entire 2-year period. The contract I was offered doesn't include any scheduled raises, so it would remain at that level throughout the visa duration.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that.

Just to be completely clear, you’re requesting a 2-year Skilled Worker visa with a salary of £34,000, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm applying for a 2-year Skilled Worker visa with a salary of £34,000 for the Junior Data Analyst position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tariq.  I need to check a specific rule regarding New Entrant discounts.

Could you confirm how long you’ve been holding your Graduate visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been on my Graduate visa for 3 years and 6 months now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Tariq. Let me just quickly assess this.

Based on the information you’ve provided – your time on the Graduate visa and the salary of £34,000 – it appears you’ve already used up all four years of “time spent” that qualifies for the New Entrant discount. 

Therefore, I must advise that your application for a 2-year Skilled Worker visa under the New Entrant route would be refused. Would you like me to explain why this is the case in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain why my application would be refused. I thought I was eligible for the New Entrant discount with my salary.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Tariq. The New Entrant discount is available for skilled workers earning above £33,400, but it’s subject to a maximum combined total of 4 years of “time spent” on eligible visas – including Student/Graduate visas.

Because you've been on your Graduate visa for 3 years and 6 months, you’ve already used up all four of those years. The rules state that this combined time on Graduate visas, and any previous New Entrant Skilled Worker visas, cannot exceed 4 years.  Therefore, you wouldn't qualify for the New Entrant discount and would need to apply under Option A – the standard Skilled Worker visa route – which allows for a potentially longer duration.

Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So because I've been on my Graduate visa for 3 years and 6 months, I've already used up most of my 4-year New Entrant allocation. And if I were to get a 2-year visa as a New Entrant, that would push me over the 4-year limit, which isn't allowed. Is that right? Does this mean I'd need to apply for the standard Skilled Worker visa with a higher salary requirement?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s absolutely correct, Tariq. You’ve understood it perfectly. Applying for a 2-year Skilled Worker visa as a New Entrant with your current Graduate visa history would indeed push you over the 4-year limit, preventing you from being eligible for the discount.

This would typically mean you’d need to apply for the standard Skilled Worker visa, which may require a higher salary to meet the requirements for a longer visa duration. 

Do you have any questions about the standard Skilled Worker visa application process, or would you like me to provide you with some general information about it?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that my application would be refused because I've already used 3 years and 6 months of my 4-year New Entrant allocation through my Graduate visa, and adding 2 more years would exceed the 4-year maximum limit. The agent properly explained that I would need to apply under the standard Skilled Worker visa route instead. This matches the expected outcome of "REFUSED" in the scenario.
