[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Ahmed, a chef with a job offer in the UK, to test the agent's knowledge about the UK's 48-hour salary cap rule for visa applications.

[root_agent]: Hello Ahmed, it’s nice to speak with you. I’m here to help you with your visa application.

To start, could you tell me how many hours you’re contracted to work per week in your role as Head Chef?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello there. I'm Ahmed and I've been offered a position as a Head Chef in the UK. My contract says I'll be working 60 hours per week. The restaurant is paying me £13.50 per hour, which works out to about £42,120 per year. I'm excited about this opportunity!

[root_agent]: Okay, Ahmed, thank you for letting me know. And that’s fantastic news about the job offer! 

Just to confirm, you’re currently working 60 hours a week, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. According to the job offer, I'll be working 60 hours per week as a Head Chef. It's a busy restaurant so they need me there for the long hours, and the salary of £42,120 per year (at £13.50 per hour) seems good to me. I believe this should meet the salary threshold for my visa, right?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. I appreciate you clarifying the details of your contract.

To help me understand your situation fully, could you tell me what you earn during an *average* 48-hour period of your work week?

[evaluation_judge]: Let me see... if I'm earning £13.50 per hour, then for 48 hours of work I would earn £648 per week. That would be about £33,696 per year if you calculate it over 52 weeks. But my actual contract is for 60 hours per week at £13.50 per hour, which is why the total annual salary offered is £42,120. Does that answer your question?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s perfect, thank you for clarifying. That’s very helpful information.

Let’s just double-check something. When considering your salary for the visa application, the Home Office only looks at the earnings from the first 48 hours of your work week. 

Could you confirm that you’ve earned roughly £648 in any given 48-hour period during your employment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. In a 48-hour period, I would earn £648 (£13.50 × 48 hours). Although my contract is for 60 hours total per week, for the first 48 hours I would earn that amount. Is this going to be an issue for my visa application?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit upon an important detail, Ahmed. Thank you for pointing that out.

Let’s calculate the assessable salary based on the 48-hour rule. If you earn £648 in a 48-hour period, over a year that would be £648 * 52 weeks = £33,696.

Is £33,696 above the standard salary threshold of £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: No, £33,696 is not above the standard salary threshold of £41,700. It's actually quite a bit lower. Does this mean I won't qualify for the visa? I thought since my total annual salary was going to be £42,120 with the 60-hour work week that I would meet the requirements.

[root_agent]: You are correct to be concerned, Ahmed. While your total annual salary of £42,120 sounds promising, the 48-hour rule significantly impacts your eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa.

As we’ve calculated, when considering only the first 48 hours of your work week, your assessable salary is £33,696, which falls below the £41,700 threshold.

Therefore, unfortunately, based on this information, it appears your application may be refused. The sponsor will need to adjust the hourly rate to meet the minimum salary requirement within the 48-hour period.

Do you understand this assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand now. That's disappointing news. So even though I'd be earning above the threshold when working 60 hours, the Home Office only considers the first 48 hours when calculating if I meet the minimum salary threshold. My £13.50 hourly rate would need to be higher to reach £41,700 within just 48 hours per week.

Is there anything I can do? Should I ask my employer to increase my hourly rate instead of relying on the extra hours?

[root_agent]: That’s a very insightful question, Ahmed. You’ve grasped the crucial point about the 48-hour rule perfectly.

Yes, absolutely! Asking your employer to increase your hourly rate is the correct course of action. It’s much more effective to adjust the rate to meet the minimum requirement within the 48-hour period, rather than simply increasing the total number of hours worked.

Would you like me to explain a bit more about how much higher the hourly rate would need to be to meet the threshold, or would you like to discuss the process of requesting this change from your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please tell me how much higher my hourly rate would need to be to meet the threshold. That would be very helpful before I speak with my employer about adjusting my offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s calculate that. We know your assessable salary needs to be £41,700 based on the 48-hour rule.

To find the required hourly rate, we’ll divide the desired salary by the number of hours considered (48):

£41,700 / 48 hours = £875 per hour.

Therefore, your employer would need to increase your hourly rate to £875 to meet the minimum salary threshold for the Skilled Worker Visa.

Does that make sense, Ahmed? Would you like me to elaborate on anything, or perhaps discuss how to approach a conversation with your employer about this?

[evaluation_judge]: I think there might be an error in your calculation. £875 per hour seems extremely high for a chef position. Let me double check this calculation myself.

If I need to earn £41,700 per year working 48 hours per week for 52 weeks:

£41,700 ÷ (48 hours × 52 weeks) = £41,700 ÷ 2,496 = approximately £16.71 per hour

So I think I would need my employer to increase my hourly rate from £13.50 to around £16.71 per hour to meet the threshold within the 48-hour calculation rule. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Ahmed! My apologies for the error in my calculation. Thank you for diligently checking and providing the accurate figure. 

£16.71 per hour is indeed the required hourly rate to meet the 48-hour salary threshold. 

I appreciate you pointing out my mistake – it’s important to verify information. 

Would you like me to help you formulate a way to discuss this with your employer, now that we have the precise figure?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be very helpful. How should I approach this conversation with my potential employer? I want to explain that I need the hourly rate increased from £13.50 to £16.71 to meet the visa requirements, but I'm not sure how best to frame this request.

[root_agent]: Okay, Ahmed, let’s craft a good approach for discussing this with your employer. Here’s a suggested framework, focusing on clarity and professionalism:

1.  **Start with Enthusiasm & Gratitude:** Begin by reiterating your excitement about the Head Chef position and expressing gratitude for the offer. “Thank you again for offering me the Head Chef position. I’m very excited about the opportunity to join your team.”

2.  **Explain the Requirement Clearly:** Clearly state the reason for the request, referencing the Skilled Worker Visa. “I’ve recently been reviewing the visa requirements for the Skilled Worker route, and I’ve identified a key aspect that requires discussion. The Home Office assesses salary based on the first 48 hours of work per week.”

3.  **Present the Calculation (Briefly):** “Based on this, to meet the minimum salary threshold of £41,700, the required hourly rate would be approximately £16.71.” (You don’t need to go into a detailed explanation of the math.)

4.  **Frame it as a Collaboration:**  “I wanted to discuss this with you to explore how we might work together to ensure I can successfully meet these requirements. I’m confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us.”

5.  **Open the Floor for Discussion:** “I’m open to discussing different options and would appreciate your thoughts on how we can proceed.”

Would you like me to help you draft a more formal script or specific wording for any part of this conversation?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, that framework is really helpful. I think I have a good idea now of how to approach this conversation with my potential employer. I'll explain the visa requirements clearly and suggest the needed hourly rate adjustment to meet the threshold. I appreciate all your help in explaining the 48-hour rule and helping me understand why my original offer wouldn't qualify despite the total annual salary appearing to be above the threshold.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Ahmed! I’m genuinely glad I could help clarify the situation and equip you with the tools to have a productive conversation with your employer. 

It’s a good strategy to address this proactively – demonstrating your understanding of the requirements and your willingness to collaborate will likely be viewed positively. 

Wishing you the very best of luck in securing the necessary adjustments to your offer. If you have any further questions or need additional support, please don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that Ahmed's situation would not meet the visa requirements. The agent accurately explained the 48-hour salary cap rule, calculated the assessable salary (£33,696) which falls below the threshold (£41,700), and correctly determined the hourly rate needed to meet requirements (£16.71/hour). The agent's advice matched the expected outcome of "REFUSED" due to the assessable salary being too low.
