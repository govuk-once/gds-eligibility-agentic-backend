[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a 17-year-old Estonian coding prodigy named Lukas who's applying for a UK visa without parental consent documentation. I'll interact with the agent under test until they provide an eligibility outcome, then evaluate if their assessment matches the expected outcome of "INVALID/REFUSED" due to missing safeguarding requirements.

I'm ready to begin the conversation with the agent under test, taking on Lukas's persona and situation.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Lukas. It’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about where you’re from originally?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm from Estonia. I've been programming since I was 11 and now I have a job offer as a Junior Developer in the UK with a salary of £34,000. I'm really excited about this opportunity!

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic, Lukas! It sounds like you’ve got a really promising career ahead of you. To help me understand your situation fully, could you tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old. I know I'm young, but I've been coding for years and this company in the UK was really impressed with my skills and portfolio.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Lukas. Being 17 is important to consider when looking at visa options. To clarify, are you currently living with your parents or guardians?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently living with my parents in Estonia. They're supportive of my career, but they're staying in Estonia while I would be moving to the UK for this job.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Given that you’re living with your parents in Estonia and planning to move to the UK for this job, and you're 17 years old, could you confirm whether you have a letter of consent from your parents regarding your travel and care arrangements in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a letter of consent from my parents. I didn't know I needed one. They're fine with me going, but we haven't prepared any formal documents about it. Is that going to be a problem?

[root_agent]: I understand. Thank you for being upfront about that, Lukas. Based on the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa, particularly regarding applicants under 18, the Home Office requires explicit parental consent and specific care arrangements. Since you don't currently have a letter of consent, I have to advise that your application would be INVALID / REFUSED at this time due to these safeguarding requirements. Would you like me to explain that in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain more about what kind of parental consent I would need. I'm sure my parents would be willing to provide something, I just didn't realize it was required.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Lukas. The parental consent needs to clearly state that they understand and agree to you travelling to the UK, and that you have suitable accommodation and care arrangements in place while you’re there. It should also confirm they are aware of your employment details – specifically, the job offer as a Junior Developer with a salary of £34,000.

Essentially, the Home Office wants to ensure your parents are fully aware of your plans and that you’ll be safe and cared for while you’re in the UK. Because you don’t currently have that documented agreement, it prevents your application from meeting the necessary safeguarding requirements.

Do you have any questions about what might be included in that letter of consent, or would you like me to reiterate the overall outcome – that the application is currently INVALID / REFUSED?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand now. So even though my job offer and salary meet the requirements, I can't get the visa without this parental consent document that specifically mentions my travel plans, job details, and living arrangements. 

So just to be clear, my application would be refused right now without this document, but if I get the proper parental consent letter, would everything else about my application be acceptable?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct, Lukas. You’ve understood it perfectly. The job offer and salary do meet the criteria for the Skilled Worker Visa, but the lack of parental consent is preventing the application from progressing.

And yes, once you obtain a letter of consent that fulfills all the requirements – clearly stating your travel plans, job details, and care arrangements – then the rest of your application *would* be acceptable. It would then be assessed against all other standard visa criteria.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this point, or would you like me to summarise the key points again?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I understand the situation clearly now. Thank you for explaining everything to me. I'll talk to my parents about getting that consent letter prepared with all the required details about my job, travel plans, and living arrangements in the UK.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Lukas. I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. Best of luck with getting the necessary documentation prepared – I’m confident that with the right consent letter, your application will be successful. If you have any further questions down the line, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be INVALID/REFUSED due to missing parental consent documentation, which is required for applicants under 18 years old. They accurately explained that while my job offer and salary meet the requirements, the application fails on safeguarding grounds without explicit parental consent for my travel and care arrangements in the UK.
