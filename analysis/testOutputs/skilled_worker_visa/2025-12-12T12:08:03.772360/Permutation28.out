[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Katarina, a waitress with a zero-hours contract job offer, to test the agent's understanding of UK visa requirements. I'll evaluate whether they correctly identify that a zero-hours contract is not eligible for a skilled worker visa regardless of the hourly rate.

[root_agent]: Okay, Katarina, thank you for sharing that information with me. I understand you’ve been offered a job as a waitress at a high-end event venue and the contract is zero-hours.

To start, could you tell me, what is the hourly rate you’ve been offered for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered £20 per hour at this high-end event venue. The manager said it's a good rate because it's much higher than minimum wage. They've given me a letter saying they expect me to work around 40 hours a week, which would be about £41,600 per year. It sounds like a great opportunity, but I'm not sure if this is enough for a visa. What do you think?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Katarina. That’s very helpful.

So, you’ve been offered £20 per hour and the employer anticipates you working around 40 hours a week, resulting in an estimated annual salary of £41,600.

Just to be clear, this is a zero-hours contract, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. It's a zero-hours contract. The venue manager explained that they have events throughout the year and need flexibility with staff. They said they're confident I'll get around 40 hours per week because they host many events, but it is officially a zero-hours contract so the hours aren't guaranteed in writing.

[root_agent]: Okay, Katarina. Thank you for confirming that it’s a zero-hours contract, and that the anticipated hours are not guaranteed in writing.

Let me ask you this: does the employer guarantee a specific minimum amount of pay, or is the pay based purely on the number of hours you work?

[evaluation_judge]: The pay is purely based on the number of hours I work. There's no guaranteed minimum amount. They just told me verbally that they usually have enough events to keep staff busy for around 40 hours a week, especially their experienced staff, but it's not written as a guarantee in the contract. I'd only be paid for the hours I actually work at the events.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Katarina. That’s very important information.

Just to be absolutely sure I understand, the contract itself doesn’t guarantee any minimum number of hours or earnings, and your pay is entirely dependent on the number of events the venue hosts and how many hours you actually work at those events?

Could you tell me, what is the total annual salary you are expecting to earn with this zero-hours contract, based on their expectation of 40 hours a week?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, you're exactly right. The contract doesn't guarantee any minimum hours or earnings - it's completely dependent on how many events they host and how many shifts I'm given.

Based on their expectation of 40 hours per week at £20 per hour, they've told me I should earn around £41,600 per year (£20 × 40 hours × 52 weeks). That's what they've written in their employer letter, that they "expect" me to work 40 hours a week and earn that amount. But again, this isn't guaranteed anywhere in the contract.

[root_agent]: Okay, Katarina. Thank you for clarifying that.

Let me ask you this: the Home Office requires that the salary offered for a Skilled Worker visa is *guaranteed*. Would you agree that, with a zero-hours contract where the employer’s expectation of earnings isn't formally guaranteed, the salary doesn’t meet this requirement?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would agree with that. I understand that since there's no guaranteed minimum hours in my zero-hours contract, the salary isn't actually guaranteed at all - regardless of what the employer is verbally promising or "expecting." They could technically schedule me for much fewer hours and there would be nothing in the contract to prevent that.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Katarina. That’s a very important point.

Based on our conversation, it appears that this zero-hours contract, with its lack of guaranteed hours and earnings, doesn't meet the criteria for a Skilled Worker visa.

Therefore, I must advise that this job offer would not be eligible for sponsorship under the Skilled Worker visa route.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome. They properly identified that a zero-hours contract with no guaranteed hours doesn't meet the Home Office requirements for a Skilled Worker visa, regardless of the high hourly rate or the employer's expectations of work hours. The agent correctly concluded the application would be refused because the salary isn't guaranteed, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
