[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Lars, a stonemason from Norway, who is seeking information about his eligibility for a UK skilled worker visa.

I'll begin the conversation with the benefits eligibility agent now.

Hello there. My name is Lars, and I'm a stonemason from Norway. I've received a job offer in the UK as a Specialist Stonemason with a salary of £34,000 per year. I understand that I need a visa to work in the UK, and I'm trying to figure out if I'm eligible for a Skilled Worker visa. Could you help me understand the requirements and if I would qualify?

After completing the interaction, I'll evaluate whether the agent provided the correct expected outcome that I should be awarded the visa, since my job is on the Immigration Salary List, I meet both the lower threshold of £33,400 and the going rate requirement of £33,500.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lars, it’s great to speak with you. Let's see if you meet the criteria for a Skilled Worker visa.

To start, can you confirm whether you have a valid sponsor for this job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a valid sponsor for the job. The company offering me the Specialist Stonemason position is licensed to sponsor workers.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent to hear, Lars! Knowing you have a valid sponsor is a crucial first step.

Now, let’s confirm the details of your role. Could you tell me what skill level this Specialist Stonemason position falls under?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure about the exact skill level classification in the UK system, but I know that Specialist Stonemason is considered a skilled trade. My position requires specific technical expertise and years of experience working with different types of stone and restoration techniques. The company has told me it meets the required skill level for a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thanks for clarifying that. It sounds like your role does indeed require a high level of skill. 

Just to be absolutely clear, can you confirm that you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. I've been working with international clients for many years and have taken the required English language test to demonstrate my proficiency. I'm comfortable communicating in English both professionally and personally.

[root_agent]: Wonderful! That’s great news.

Now, let’s focus on the salary aspect. Can you confirm that the job you’ve been offered as a Specialist Stonemason is on the Immigration Salary List (ISL)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been told that Specialist Stonemason is on the Immigration Salary List. The recruitment agent and my potential employer both mentioned this specifically when discussing my visa eligibility.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. 

Let’s move on to the salary itself. Your salary is £34,000 per year, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The salary offer is £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: And to confirm, what is the standard going rate for a Specialist Stonemason, as listed on the Immigration Salary List?

[evaluation_judge]: I was told that the standard going rate for a Specialist Stonemason is £33,500 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lars. Let’s check if your salary meets the requirements. 

Does your salary of £34,000 meet the lower general threshold of £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my salary of £34,000 does exceed the lower general threshold of £33,400.

[root_agent]: Great! And does your salary of £34,000 also meet the standard going rate of £33,500?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my salary of £34,000 is above the standard going rate of £33,500 for my role.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lars. Based on the information you’ve provided – a valid sponsor, a skilled role, meeting English language requirements, a job on the Immigration Salary List, and a salary meeting both the lower threshold and the standard going rate – I’m pleased to inform you that **AWARDED.** The ISL status allows you to bypass the £41,700 general threshold, as long as you are paid the full market rate for your role.

Would you like me to provide any further information about the next steps in the visa application process?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I would be awarded the visa. They correctly explained that since my job as a Specialist Stonemason is on the Immigration Salary List, I can bypass the £41,700 general threshold as long as I meet both the lower threshold (£33,400) and the standard going rate (£33,500) for my role, which my £34,000 salary does.
