[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Dr. Aari, a 29-year-old biological researcher from India with a PhD in Microbiology, seeking information about my eligibility for a UK work visa based on my job offer as a Senior Lab Technician.

Let me start the conversation with the agent under test.

[root_agent]: Hello Dr. Aari, it’s lovely to speak with you. I understand you’re interested in exploring visa options for working in the UK. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current job role?

[evaluation_judge]: Hello! Yes, I'm Dr. Aari from India. I've recently been offered a position as a Senior Lab Technician at a pharmaceutical company in the UK. I have a PhD in Microbiology and have been working as a biological researcher. I'm wondering if I would be eligible for a work visa with this job offer. The company has offered me a salary of £34,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Dr. Aari. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me what your standard going rate for this role would be, according to the employer?

[evaluation_judge]: The standard going rate for this Senior Lab Technician role is £38,000 per year, according to the employer. My offered salary is £34,000, which is lower than this standard rate.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Let’s move on to the next question. Do you currently have a sponsor lined up who is willing to support your visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the pharmaceutical company that offered me the position is a valid sponsor in the UK and they are willing to sponsor my visa application.

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear. Now, could you tell me what subject your PhD is in?

[evaluation_judge]: My PhD is in Microbiology. I completed it in India before starting my career as a biological researcher.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Just to confirm, you’re a 29-year-old with a PhD in Microbiology, and the company offering you the role is a valid sponsor.  

Now, could you confirm whether you meet the English language requirements for working in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements for working in the UK. I've completed the necessary English language testing and achieved the required scores.

[root_agent]: Excellent.  Finally, could you confirm that the job you’ve been offered falls within a skilled occupation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the Senior Lab Technician position at the pharmaceutical company is considered a skilled occupation. It requires specialized knowledge in microbiology and laboratory techniques, which aligns with my educational background and experience.

[root_agent]: Okay, Dr. Aari. Thank you for providing all of this information. Let’s look at the specific criteria.

Considering your PhD in Microbiology, a salary of £34,000, and a standard going rate of £38,000 (which is 80% of the going rate), does the salary meet the lower general threshold of £33,400?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offered salary of £34,000 does meet the lower general threshold of £33,400.

[root_agent]: And does your offered salary meet the discounted going rate of 80% of the standard rate?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, 80% of the standard going rate of £38,000 would be £30,400. My offered salary of £34,000 exceeds this amount.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Dr. Aari. Based on the information you’ve provided – a valid sponsor, a skilled occupation, meeting English language requirements, a PhD in a STEM subject, and a salary that meets both the general threshold and the discounted going rate – I’m very pleased to inform you that you are eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa.

Would you like me to provide you with some links to the official UK government resources regarding the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: That's wonderful news! Yes, I would appreciate if you could share some official UK government resources regarding the Skilled Worker Visa. It would be helpful to have those links for reference as I prepare my application.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here are the official links for the Skilled Worker Visa:

*   **Eligibility:** [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)
*   **Starting your application:** [https://www.gov.uk/apply-skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/apply-skilled-worker-visa)

I hope these are helpful as you move forward with your application. Congratulations again, Dr. Aari! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you very much for providing these links. They will definitely be useful as I prepare my application. I don't have any other questions at the moment. I appreciate your help in confirming my eligibility for the Skilled Worker Visa based on my qualifications and job offer. Have a great day!

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa. They accurately assessed that my PhD in Microbiology (a STEM subject) allows me to qualify with the lower salary threshold of £33,400, and that my £34,000 salary exceeds both this threshold and 80% of the going rate (£30,400).
