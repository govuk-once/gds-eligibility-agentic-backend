[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Liam, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you confirm if there is a valid sponsor for this job opportunity?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a valid sponsor. I just graduated from a UK university with my bachelor's degree, and I've received a job offer from a company that is a licensed sponsor.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, regarding the job itself, does it meet the requirements for a skilled role as defined by the Skilled Worker Visa guidelines?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I believe it does. I've been offered a position as a Junior Financial Analyst, which should be on the skilled occupations list.

[root_agent]: Great. And to ensure we’re covering all bases, can you confirm that you meet the English language requirements for the role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I definitely meet the English language requirements. My bachelor's degree was taught in English here in the UK, so that should satisfy the requirement.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Now, let’s talk about your salary. What is the annual salary you’ve been offered for this Junior Financial Analyst position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered an annual salary of £35,000 for the Junior Financial Analyst position.

[root_agent]: Thank you. To help me determine your eligibility, could you please tell me what the standard going rate is for a Junior Financial Analyst role?

[evaluation_judge]: The standard going rate for this Junior Financial Analyst role is £42,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, and to clarify, 70% of that standard going rate is £29,400, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. 70% of the standard going rate of £42,000 would be £29,400.

[root_agent]: Finally, Liam, could you confirm your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 23 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Now, let's assess your eligibility.

*   **Is there a valid Sponsor?** Yes.
*   **Is the job at the required skill level?** Yes.
*   **Does the applicant meet English requirements?** Yes, degree taught in English satisfies this.
*   **Does the applicant qualify as a New Entrant?** Yes, he is under 26 and switching from a Student Visa.
*   **Does the salary meet the Lower General Threshold (£33,400)?** Yes, £35,000 > £33,400.
*   **Does the salary meet the discounted Going Rate (70%)?** Yes, £35,000 is higher than 70% of the going rate (£29,400).

**AWARDED.** Liam qualifies as a New Entrant, allowing him to be paid less than the standard £41,700 and less than the full going rate. *Note: Time on this visa counts toward the 4-year maximum for New Entrants.*

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa as a New Entrant based on my age (23), recent UK graduation status, and salary (£35,000) which exceeds both the lower general threshold (£33,400) and 70% of the going rate (£29,400).
