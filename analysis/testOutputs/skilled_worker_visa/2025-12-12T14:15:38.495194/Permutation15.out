[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you evaluate this scenario by roleplaying as a user named Lina who is seeking information about Skilled Worker visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Lina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Lina, it’s nice to meet you. To help me understand your situation and see if you might be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa, could you tell me a little bit about the job you’ve been offered? Specifically, what is the job title?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! Yes, I've been offered a job as a Construction Labourer with a company here in the UK. They're offering me quite a good salary - £45,000 per year. I'm currently living abroad but I'm excited about this opportunity. I just need to know if I can get a Skilled Worker visa for this position.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information, Lina. That’s good to hear you’ve found a job! To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me what level qualification the job requires? Specifically, is the job at RQF Level 3 or above?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, I'm not completely sure about the qualification level. The company just told me it's a Construction Labourer position with occupation code 9120, which I believe falls under "Elementary construction occupations." They didn't specifically mention an RQF level. But they are offering me £45,000, which seems quite good for this type of work. Does that help?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Lina. It’s understandable that the qualification level isn’t explicitly stated. Let’s focus on that for now. Could you tell me, roughly, what level of education or training is typically required for someone to perform the duties of a Construction Labourer? For example, is it generally a Level 1, Level 2, or something else?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, this Construction Labourer position doesn't require much formal education. I think you generally need some basic health and safety knowledge, but it's mostly about physical work and following instructions on construction sites. I'd say it's probably a Level 1 or maybe Level 2 qualification at most. The company mentioned they would provide on-the-job training for the specific tasks. They seem more interested in my willingness to work hard than any formal qualifications.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that detailed explanation, Lina. That’s very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, it appears this role is at RQF Level 1 or 2.

To confirm, is there a valid Sponsor associated with this job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company told me they are an approved sponsor for Skilled Worker visas. They said they have their sponsor license and everything ready to go. They just need me to confirm I can apply for the visa before they proceed with the formal offer.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s excellent news to hear that the company is an approved sponsor. Let’s move on to another key factor. Could you confirm that the salary for this position meets the minimum threshold for a Skilled Worker visa? It’s currently £45,000, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. They've offered me £45,000 per year. They mentioned this is actually quite a bit above the standard rate for this type of work, but they were impressed with my experience in construction from my home country and are willing to pay more. Is that enough to meet the threshold?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that detail, Lina. Yes, a salary of £45,000 does meet the threshold.

Now, regarding the nature of the job itself, is the job you’ve been offered at RQF Level 3 or above?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, like I mentioned before, this Construction Labourer job doesn't require much formal education. It's most likely at RQF Level 1 or 2. The company didn't specifically say it was at RQF Level 3 or above. They were mainly interested in my willingness to do physical work and follow instructions on the construction site.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lina. Thank you for clarifying. Based on our conversation, it appears that this Construction Labourer role is at RQF Level 1 or 2.

Therefore, I’m afraid I must advise that you are not eligible for a Skilled Worker visa in this instance. The job must be at RQF Level 3 or above to qualify.

I apologize that I couldn’t offer you more positive news. Would you like me to explain further why this qualification level is required?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing to hear. Yes, please explain why the qualification level is so important, especially when the salary is quite good at £45,000. Does it matter that they're willing to pay me well above the average for this type of work?

[root_agent]: You’re right to ask for clarification, Lina. It’s understandable to feel disappointed when a visa isn’t possible, especially with a good salary offer.

The RQF Level requirement is in place to ensure that the Skilled Worker visa is primarily for jobs that contribute to the UK economy and require a certain level of skills and knowledge. Jobs at RQF Level 1 or 2 are generally considered to be entry-level positions that don't require a significant investment in training or skills development. 

While the salary is a positive factor – and indeed higher than average for this type of work – the visa scheme focuses on roles that meet a specific skill threshold. The requirement for RQF Level 3 or above ensures a connection to the broader UK economy and a skilled workforce.

I understand this can be frustrating, and I’m sorry I can’t offer a more positive outcome for you today. Do you have any other questions about the Skilled Worker visa requirements, perhaps in relation to other types of jobs you might be interested in?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. So even with a high salary, if the job isn't skilled enough at RQF Level 3 or above, I won't qualify for the Skilled Worker visa. That makes sense, but it is disappointing since the company seemed keen to hire me.

Are there any other visa options I might explore for this type of work? Or would I need to look for a different, more skilled position to come to the UK?

[root_agent]: That’s a very perceptive question, Lina. Yes, there are other visa options you might explore, although they would likely have different requirements.

One possibility could be the **Temporary Worker (Health & Care)** visa – this visa route is available for certain health and care roles and doesn't always require an RQF Level 3 qualification. However, the specific requirements would depend on the exact nature of the role.

Alternatively, you could consider looking for a position that *does* meet the RQF Level 3 requirement. This might involve exploring roles with slightly different responsibilities or a different sector within the construction industry. 

You could also investigate the **Youth Mobility Scheme** visa if you’re under 30 and a national of a participating country. 

To help me narrow down the best options for you, could you tell me a little more about your background and what type of work you’ve done previously?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that the Construction Labourer position (RQF Level 1-2) does not qualify for a Skilled Worker visa despite the high salary of £45,000. The agent properly explained that the job must be at RQF Level 3 or above regardless of salary, which matches the expected outcome of refusal.
