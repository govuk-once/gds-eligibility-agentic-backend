[root_agent]: Okay, a Specialist Stonemason. That’s good to know. And to help me determine your eligibility, could you tell me what salary you’ve been offered for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a salary of £34,000 per year for the Specialist Stonemason position.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And could you tell me what the standard going rate for a Specialist Stonemason is in the UK, according to the official salary list?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for a Specialist Stonemason in the UK is £33,500 per year, according to what I've been told.

[root_agent]: Alright. Just to confirm, you’ve been offered a salary of £34,000 per year for a Specialist Stonemason role, and the standard going rate is £33,500 per year?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I've been offered £34,000 per year, and the standard going rate is £33,500 per year for this role.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now, just to be absolutely clear, do you have a UK sponsor who is willing to support your application for a work visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a valid UK sponsor who is willing to support my work visa application.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for letting me know. One last question for now – do you meet the English language requirements for a Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lars. Thank you for all the information. Based on your salary (£34,000), the standard going rate (£33,500), and having a sponsoring employer, you appear to meet the criteria for a Skilled Worker visa.

**AWARDED.**

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly awarded the visa. They recognized that because my job (Specialist Stonemason) is on the Immigration Salary List, I'm eligible with a salary of £34,000 which exceeds both the lower threshold of £33,400 and the going rate of £33,500.
