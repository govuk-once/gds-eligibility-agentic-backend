[root_agent]: Thank you, Kenji. Just one more question regarding the salary. The Skilled Worker visa has a minimum salary threshold. Could you tell me what your annual salary would be for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered an annual salary of £30,000 for the Graphic Designer position.

[root_agent]: Okay, Kenji. Thank you for providing that information. Based on your salary of £30,000, I need to check against the minimum salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa. 

To confirm, can you tell me what your annual salary *would* be for this Graphic Designer position?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. My annual salary for this Graphic Designer position would be £30,000 per year. That's the full-time salary I've been offered by the employer who is willing to sponsor my visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I appreciate you confirming the exact salary.

Let me quickly check the criteria for the Skilled Worker visa against that salary…

…Okay, Kenji. Based on the current requirements, your proposed salary of £30,000 does not meet the minimum salary threshold of £33,400 for the Skilled Worker route.

Therefore, I must advise that you are not eligible for the Skilled Worker visa under these circumstances.

**REFUSED.**

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that my offered salary of £30,000 is below the absolute minimum salary floor of £33,400 for the Skilled Worker visa and accurately determined I would be refused.
