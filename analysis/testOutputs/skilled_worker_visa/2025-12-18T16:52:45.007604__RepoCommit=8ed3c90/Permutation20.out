[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Mary, it's lovely to speak with you. To understand your eligibility, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for a Health and Care Worker visa. I've received a job offer as a Senior Care Worker at a residential home in the UK. The salary is £29,000 per year. I'd like to bring my husband and two children with me. We're currently living in Zimbabwe.

[root_agent]: That's excellent to hear, Mary. Thank you for providing that information. 

To confirm, is the residential home you'll be working at registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the residential home is registered with the Care Quality Commission. My employer mentioned this was important for the visa process.

[root_agent]: That’s very good to know, Mary. It *is* an important requirement.

Just to be absolutely clear, could you confirm the specific occupation code for the role you've been offered? Is it specifically listed as 'Senior Care Worker'?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my offer letter states that my role is a Senior Care Worker with occupation code 6136. The employer made it clear that this is the role I'll be doing and the code that applies to my position.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Mary. That’s helpful. 

Now, knowing you are applying with your husband and two children, are you aware of the recent changes to the rules regarding dependents for the Health and Care Worker visa, specifically for those in the Senior Care Worker role (code 6136)?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't told about any recent changes. What are they? My employer just mentioned that the Health and Care visa would allow me to bring my family with me to the UK. Has something changed?

[root_agent]: You’re right to ask, Mary. There *have* been recent changes. As of March 2024, applicants applying under occupation code 6136 (Senior Care Worker) are eligible for the visa themselves, but unfortunately, they are **no longer permitted to bring dependents** – that includes spouses and children – with them to the UK.

This is a recent change, and it’s understandable your employer may not have been aware of it.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this in more detail. This is very concerning to me. I was making all these plans assuming my family could come with me. Are there any exceptions to this rule? What options do I have? I don't want to leave my husband and children behind.

[root_agent]: I understand this is very concerning, Mary, and I’m truly sorry to deliver disappointing news. I can certainly explain further.

The UK government introduced this change to reduce net migration. The intention is to focus the Health and Care Worker visa on attracting skilled workers *without* family dependents, particularly in roles like Senior Care Worker where there's high demand.

Unfortunately, there are currently **no exceptions** to this rule for the Senior Care Worker (code 6136) visa. 

Your options are limited, and I wish I had better news. You *are* eligible for the visa yourself, meaning you can accept the job offer and move to the UK. However, your husband and children would not be granted dependent visas under the current rules. They would need to pursue other visa routes independently, if they are eligible.

Would you like me to reiterate the key points about your eligibility – your visa being approved while your family’s dependent visas would likely be refused? I know this is a lot to take in.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please reiterate the key points about my eligibility. This is really difficult news to process. Are there any other visa categories my family might be eligible for? Or would I need to look for a different job category that still allows dependents? I'm trying to understand all my options before making such a big decision.

[root_agent]: Of course, Mary. Let's reiterate the key points.

*   **You are eligible** for the Skilled Worker visa as a Senior Care Worker (code 6136) because your salary of £29,000 meets the requirements, and the employer is CQC registered.
*   **Your husband and children are not eligible** for dependent visas alongside your application, due to the rules implemented in March 2024 for this specific occupation code.

Regarding other options for your family, or potentially a different job category, that gets a bit complex. I can tell you that other roles *do* still allow dependents. However, I can only assess eligibility based on the information *you* provide about *your* circumstances.

To explore other job categories, we’d need to look at whether your skills and qualifications meet the requirements for different occupations on the eligible occupations list. 

As for other visa categories for your family, that’s outside the scope of what I can advise on, as I am specifically trained to assess eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa. They may need to explore options like the Family visa (which has strict requirements around income and residency) or Student visas (if they are eligible to study). It might be best for them to seek independent immigration legal advice to explore these options.

Would you like me to provide a link to the list of eligible occupations for the Skilled Worker visa? This will allow you to see if there are any other roles that might suit your skills and allow you to bring your family.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please provide me with that link. I need to understand what other occupations might allow me to bring my family. This change to the rules has really changed my plans. I'm not sure I want to move to the UK without my husband and children. I might need to reconsider my options or look for a different role that would allow us to stay together.

[root_agent]: I completely understand, Mary. It's a huge decision, and it's perfectly reasonable to reconsider your options.

Here is the link to the list of eligible occupations for the Skilled Worker visa: [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/eligible-occupations](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/eligible-occupations)

Please take your time to review it carefully. You’ll be able to see the occupation codes, salary requirements, and whether dependents are allowed for each role.

If you find any other roles that seem interesting and potentially suitable, feel free to come back to me, and I can help you assess your eligibility for those specifically.

Is there anything else I can help you with at this moment? Perhaps clarifying anything about the current situation, or guiding you on how to navigate the list of occupations?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the link and for being so understanding. I'll take some time to look through the list of occupations and see if there are other roles that might match my skills while still allowing my family to join me. This is definitely not what I was expecting when I applied for the job. Just to be absolutely clear - if I proceed with this Senior Care Worker job, I would definitely be eligible for the visa myself, but my husband and children would definitely be denied dependent visas because of this new rule?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Mary. I’m glad I could provide some clarity, and I’m happy to help in any way I can.

And yes, to be absolutely clear:

If you proceed with accepting the Senior Care Worker position (occupation code 6136), **you would definitely be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa yourself.** However, **your husband and children would definitely be refused dependent visas** under the current rules, which came into effect in March 2024. This is due to the specific restrictions placed on dependents for that particular occupation code.

It's a difficult situation, and I want to reiterate that you're right to carefully consider all your options before making a final decision. Take your time reviewing the eligible occupations list, and please don’t hesitate to come back if you have any further questions. I’m here to assist you.

[evaluation_judge]: This is really disappointing news, but I appreciate your clear explanation. I'll need to discuss this with my family and look into other occupation options that might allow us to stay together. Thank you for your help.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Mary. I’m truly sorry I couldn’t deliver better news, but I’m glad I could at least provide you with a clear understanding of the situation.

It’s absolutely the right decision to discuss this with your family and explore all your options. I wish you all the best in finding a solution that works for everyone.

If you do come across any other roles and would like me to help assess your eligibility, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help if you need me.

Take care, and I wish you and your family all the best.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I (Mary) would be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa as a Senior Care Worker, but correctly explained that under the March 2024 rules, my dependents (husband and children) would not be eligible to join me. This matches the expected outcome of a split decision where my visa would be awarded but my family's dependent visas would be refused.
