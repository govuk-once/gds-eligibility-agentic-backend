[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ahmed and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ahmed, nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what kind of job you have, or have been offered?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a chef. I've been offered a position as a Head Chef at a restaurant in the UK.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Ahmed! A Head Chef position sounds interesting.

Could you tell me how many hours per week you are contracted to work in this role?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm contracted to work 60 hours per week in this Head Chef position.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ahmed. And could you please tell me your hourly rate for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: My hourly rate is £13.50 per hour.

[root_agent]: Thanks Ahmed. Just to confirm, is this £13.50 your gross hourly rate, before any deductions?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The £13.50 is my gross hourly rate before any deductions.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

Are you aware of the current salary requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa? Specifically, do you know what the minimum salary threshold is? It's alright if you don't know offhand, just let me know and I will tell you.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure what the exact minimum salary threshold is for a Skilled Worker Visa. Could you please tell me what that is?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ahmed. The current general threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa is £38,700 per year, but there are some exceptions and it can depend on your job role. However, a standard threshold to be aware of is £41,700.

Now, when assessing your salary, it's important to know that the Home Office calculates this based on a 48-hour work week, even if your contract states more hours. 

Knowing this, and given your contracted 60 hours at £13.50 per hour, let's calculate your assessable weekly salary. Would you like me to do that, or would you prefer to calculate it yourself?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd appreciate it if you could calculate it for me, please.

[root_agent]: Certainly. So, based on a 48-hour work week at a rate of £13.50 per hour, your weekly salary would be 48 * £13.50 = £648.

Then, your annual assessable salary would be £648 * 52 weeks = £33,696.

Does that calculation seem correct to you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that calculation makes sense based on what you've explained about the 48-hour cap for assessment purposes.

[root_agent]: Great. So, with an annual assessable salary of £33,696, and the current salary threshold being £41,700, does it appear your salary currently meets the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it doesn't look like my salary meets the requirements if you're only counting 48 hours per week. My assessable salary would be £33,696, which is below the £41,700 threshold.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Ahmed. Based on the information provided and the 48-hour salary cap rule, your assessable salary of £33,696 is unfortunately below the £41,700 threshold.

Therefore, based on the current information, your application would be **REFUSED** on the grounds of not meeting the minimum salary requirement. 

To be eligible, the restaurant would need to either increase your hourly rate, or adjust your role to one that falls under an eligible occupation code with a lower salary threshold – though simply increasing your contracted hours won’t resolve the issue.

Would you like me to explain anything further about this, or perhaps discuss other potential options?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that my application would be refused because my assessable salary (£33,696 based on the 48-hour cap) falls below the £41,700 threshold, matching the expected outcome in the scenario.
