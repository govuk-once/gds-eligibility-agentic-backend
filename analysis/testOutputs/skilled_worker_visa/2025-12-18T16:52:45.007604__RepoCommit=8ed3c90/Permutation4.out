[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's good to speak with you. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me if you have a job offer in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've received a job offer as a Historical Consultant for a media production company in the UK. I have a PhD in Modern History from an American university, and I'm trying to figure out if I qualify for a work visa.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear! To clarify, is this job offer from a company that is licensed by the Home Office to sponsor workers – a licensed sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company is a licensed sponsor. They've confirmed that they can sponsor my visa application.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Is the job itself at the required skill level - meaning is it at least a Regulated Qualification Framework (RQF) level 3 or above? (This generally includes professional occupations).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my job as a Historical Consultant requires advanced qualifications and expertise. It definitely meets the skill level requirements since I'll be using my PhD-level knowledge in this role.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Do you meet the English language requirements for the visa? (For example, through having completed a degree taught in English).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm from the United States where English is my native language, and my PhD was completed entirely in English, so I definitely meet the English language requirements.

[root_agent]: Wonderful. You mentioned you have a PhD in Modern History. Is this PhD directly relevant to the role of Historical Consultant?

[evaluation_judge]: Absolutely! My PhD in Modern History is directly relevant to my role as a Historical Consultant. I'll be using my expertise to advise the media production company on historical accuracy for their projects, drawing directly on my research and academic knowledge.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent. Could you please tell me what your annual salary is for this position?

[evaluation_judge]: The company has offered me an annual salary of £35,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And do you know what the standard going rate is for a Historical Consultant role in the UK? (This is the typical salary for the position).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I was told that the standard going rate for a Historical Consultant in my field is about £36,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on the details you've provided, unfortunately, you currently do not meet the eligibility requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa under the criteria for a PhD holder in a non-STEM field. 

While your salary of £35,000 is above 90% of the £36,000 going rate, the minimum salary threshold for this route is £37,500. 

Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this in more detail. I thought having a PhD would make things easier, not harder. What exactly is the issue with my salary?

[root_agent]: You are right to think a PhD often helps! In this case, because your PhD is in a non-STEM (non-Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subject, there's a specific salary requirement to qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa.

There are a few ways to qualify with a PhD. Generally, the salary needs to be at least £33,000. However, for PhDs in subjects *not* on the STEM list, there's a higher threshold.

To qualify under the PhD route for a non-STEM subject, your salary needs to meet *both* of these conditions:

1.  Be at least £37,500.
2.  Be at least 90% of the going rate for the job.

You meet the second condition (£35,000 is above 90% of £36,000), but your salary of £35,000 is below the £37,500 minimum.

Essentially, the government has set a higher salary floor for PhD holders in non-STEM fields to ensure they are compensated appropriately for their qualifications. You would need a salary of at least £37,500 to meet the requirements. Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So even though I exceed the 90% of the going rate requirement, I still need to meet the £37,500 minimum threshold since my PhD is in a non-STEM field. That means I'd need to negotiate an increase of £2,500 in my salary to qualify. That's really helpful to understand - thank you for the clear explanation.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! You’ve understood it perfectly. Yes, a £2,500 increase would bring your salary to the required £37,500. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your visa options, or any other questions you have?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I have the information I need now. I'll reach out to the company to see if they would be willing to increase my salary offer to meet the threshold. Thank you for your help in clarifying this for me!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Sarah! I'm glad I could help. I wish you the best of luck with your negotiations. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I do not qualify for the visa based on the scenario details. They accurately explained that while my salary exceeds 90% of the going rate, it falls below the £37,500 minimum threshold required for non-STEM PhD holders (Option B). The agent provided the correct reason for refusal and identified the exact amount (£2,500) I would need as a salary increase to meet eligibility requirements.
