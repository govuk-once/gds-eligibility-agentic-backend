[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Fatima, a new recruit from overseas, who wants to understand her eligibility for a work visa with Logistics Co. which currently has a B-rating.

Hi, i'm Fatima and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Fatima, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me what benefit you are hoping to be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there! I've been offered a job with Logistics Co. in the UK, and they said they would sponsor my visa. I'm currently living overseas and this would be my first time working in the UK. I just want to understand if I'll be eligible for the visa sponsorship they're offering. They mentioned something about a Certificate of Sponsorship but I'm not sure about the details or if there might be any issues.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Fatima. It sounds like you're asking about the Skilled Worker Visa. 

To help me understand your situation better, could you please confirm if Logistics Co. currently holds a sponsor license?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they told me they have a sponsor license, but I think there might have been some issue with it recently. The HR person I spoke with mentioned something about the company currently having a "B-rating" after an audit. They said they can still sponsor me, but I'm not sure what that means for my application. Is that going to affect my eligibility for the visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about the B-rating, Fatima. That is an important detail. 

To confirm, just to be absolutely sure, is this your *first* time being sponsored by Logistics Co., or have you previously held a Skilled Worker Visa with them?

[evaluation_judge]: This would be my first time being sponsored by Logistics Co. I've never worked in the UK before, and I've never held any kind of UK work visa. I'm currently in my home country and would be relocating to the UK if the visa is approved.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Fatima. 

Given that this is your first time being sponsored by Logistics Co., and they currently have a B-rating, unfortunately they are currently unable to sponsor *new* workers. Do you understand?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. So they actually can't sponsor me for a visa right now because of their B-rating? That's concerning because they've already offered me the job and were talking about arranging the Certificate of Sponsorship soon. Does this mean I won't be able to start working with them at all, or is there some way around this?

[root_agent]: You are right to be concerned, Fatima. Unfortunately, a B-rating does mean Logistics Co. cannot currently sponsor new workers like yourself. 

While they may have intended to arrange a Certificate of Sponsorship, the system won't allow them to assign one to a new recruit at this time. It’s highly likely any attempt to proceed would result in your visa application being refused.

Are you aware of whether Logistics Co. are taking steps to improve their rating?

[evaluation_judge]: They didn't mention anything about taking steps to improve their rating. I'm really disappointed to hear this. How long does it typically take for a company to move from a B-rating back to an A-rating? And what options do I have now? Should I look for another employer, or is there any way I could still work with Logistics Co. in the future when their rating improves?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Fatima, and I’m sorry to deliver this news.

Unfortunately, the time it takes for a company to move from a B-rating back to an A-rating isn’t fixed and depends on how quickly they address the issues identified in the audit and demonstrate compliance. There’s no set timeframe.

Regarding your options, given their current B-rating, the most practical course of action would be to look for another employer who holds an A-rated sponsor license. That would significantly increase your chances of a successful visa application.

You *could* potentially explore opportunities with Logistics Co. in the future *after* they regain an A-rating, but there's no guarantee of that happening, or of a role being available then. Would you like me to explain a little more about what an A-rated sponsor license means?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I think that would be helpful to understand more about the A-rated sponsor license and what it means. I suppose I should start looking for other opportunities in the meantime since there's no guarantee when Logistics Co. might improve their rating. It's unfortunate that they offered me the position without explaining this limitation.

[root_agent]: You're right to start exploring other opportunities, Fatima. It's best to be proactive.

An A-rated sponsor license means that Logistics Co. (or any sponsor) has been assessed by the Home Office as being compliant with their sponsorship duties. These duties relate to things like ensuring the job is genuine, the salary meets the requirements, and that the worker's immigration status is properly managed. 

With an A-rating, they have the ability to assign Certificates of Sponsorship to both new applicants *and* those seeking to extend their visas. A B-rating, as we've discussed, restricts them to extensions only.

Essentially, an A-rating is a sign of a trustworthy sponsor, and is necessary for successfully sponsoring a new Skilled Worker.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding understanding the Skilled Worker Visa, or perhaps what to look for in a potential employer's sponsorship status?

[evaluation_judge]: That's very helpful to understand. When looking for other employers, is there a way I can check their rating before applying? I'd like to avoid having the same issue again. Also, are there any other key things I should be aware of when seeking a job with visa sponsorship in the UK?

[root_agent]: That’s a very smart question, Fatima. Unfortunately, the Home Office doesn’t publish a public list of sponsor ratings. However, a reputable employer will usually be upfront about having a valid sponsor license.

During the interview process, you can politely ask the potential employer if they currently hold an A-rating sponsor license. You could phrase it as: "Could you confirm the status of your sponsor license?" A legitimate employer won't be hesitant to answer truthfully.

Beyond the sponsor license rating, here are a few other key things to be aware of when seeking a job with visa sponsorship in the UK:

*   **Eligible Occupation Code:** Ensure the job offer aligns with a role on the list of eligible occupations for the Skilled Worker Visa.
*   **Salary Requirements:** The job must meet the minimum salary threshold, which varies depending on the occupation.
*   **Genuine Vacancy:** The role needs to be a genuine vacancy, not created specifically to facilitate a visa application.
*   **Skill Level:** The job usually requires a skill level of RQF level 3 or above (equivalent to A-levels).

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?

[evaluation_judge]: This is all incredibly helpful information. I think I have a much clearer picture now of what I need to look for when pursuing job opportunities with visa sponsorship. Thank you for explaining the importance of the A-rating and the other requirements like salary thresholds and skill levels. I'll definitely ask about the sponsor license status during future interviews. I appreciate all your guidance on this matter!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Fatima! I'm delighted I could help clarify things for you. 

It sounds like you're well-equipped to navigate your job search now. Remember to be thorough and ask questions – it’s always better to be informed.

If you have any further questions down the line, please don't hesitate to reach out. I wish you the very best of luck in finding a suitable opportunity in the UK! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that covers everything I needed to know. Thank you again for all your help!

✓ The agent correctly advised that as Logistics Co. has a B-rating, they cannot sponsor new workers like me (Fatima). The agent accurately explained that the visa application would be refused and recommended looking for employers with A-rated licenses instead. This matches the expected outcome that a B-rated sponsor cannot assign a CoS to new hires.
