[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on this role and engage with the agent under test about Katarina's situation regarding her work visa eligibility.

Hi, i'm Katarina and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Katarina, it's lovely to meet you! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you tell me what type of job you have been offered?





[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a job as a waitress at a high-end event venue. The pay is actually quite good - they're offering £20 per hour. They've given me a letter saying they expect me to work about 40 hours a week, which would be around £41,600 per year. I'm just not sure if I qualify for a work visa with this offer.

[root_agent]: That sounds like a potentially good opportunity, Katarina! To clarify, could you tell me what type of contract you have with the event venue? Is it a fixed-term contract, a permanent contract, or something else?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a zero-hours contract. They've told me they expect me to work 40 hours each week, but there's no guarantee of those hours in my contract. That's why I'm a bit concerned about whether this would qualify me for a visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Katarina. That’s good to know. 

To help me assess your situation, could you confirm whether the 40 hours a week, and therefore the £41,600 salary, is *guaranteed* in your contract? Or is it an *expected* amount of work?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the 40 hours aren't guaranteed in the contract. The contract is zero-hours, so technically they don't have to give me any work at all. The letter just says they "expect" me to work 40 hours a week, but there's nothing binding about that. The hourly rate of £20 is fixed, but the number of hours isn't guaranteed.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so clear, Katarina. I appreciate you explaining the details of your contract.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears your salary isn't guaranteed to meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa. Unfortunately, a zero-hours contract, even with a good hourly rate, doesn’t usually meet the visa requirements as the employer can’t guarantee the minimum salary threshold will be met each year. 

I understand this may not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain this in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain a bit more. I was really hoping this would work out. Does that mean I definitely can't get the visa with this job offer?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Katarina. I'm sorry to deliver disappointing news.

The Skilled Worker Visa requires a salary that meets a specific threshold, and that salary needs to be *guaranteed* by your employment contract. Even though £20 per hour is a good rate, and the expectation is 40 hours a week, a zero-hours contract means your employer isn't legally obligated to offer you those hours. Therefore, they can’t *guarantee* you’ll earn the required amount annually.

Because the earnings aren't guaranteed, the Home Office won’t accept the “expected” earnings from a zero-hours contract, even if that expected amount is above the threshold. 

Based on what you've told me, it does appear that you would unfortunately be ineligible for the Skilled Worker Visa with this specific job offer and contract type.





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that Katarina would be refused for a Skilled Worker Visa because zero-hours contracts don't provide guaranteed earnings, which is required by the Home Office even if the hourly rate is high and expected earnings would exceed the threshold.
