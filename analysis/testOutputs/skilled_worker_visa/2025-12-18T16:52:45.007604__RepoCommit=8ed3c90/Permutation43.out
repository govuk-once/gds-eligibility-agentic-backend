[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Diego and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Diego, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you tell me what type of benefit you are interested in exploring today?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm actually interested in understanding what would happen to my work visa if I take unpaid leave. My company has agreed to let me take a 2-month sabbatical to travel across South America, but I'm on a work visa that my employer sponsors. Will this affect my visa status?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Diego. That’s a very important question to ask! To help me understand your situation a little better, could you please confirm how long your proposed sabbatical would be in weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: My sabbatical would be 2 months long, so that's about 8 weeks of unpaid leave.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Diego. And just to be clear, is this unpaid leave due to a statutory reason, such as sick leave or maternity leave?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's not statutory leave. It's just a personal sabbatical that I requested to travel and explore South America. My company has agreed to hold my job for me while I'm away, but it would be unpaid time off.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Diego. Just to be certain, are you aware of any exceptions that might apply to this situation, perhaps related to your specific visa conditions or your employer's responsibilities?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't know of any specific exceptions that would apply to my case. I'm on a standard work visa (I believe it's called a Skilled Worker visa) that my employer sponsors. I just want to make sure I understand the rules before I commit to this trip.

[root_agent]: Okay, Diego. To confirm, you mentioned this is a Skilled Worker visa. Considering your sabbatical is 8 weeks long, and isn't for a statutory reason like sick or maternity leave, it seems your sponsorship could be affected. 

Do you understand that there's a rule regarding absences from work without pay exceeding 4 weeks in a calendar year?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that rule. Are you saying there's a 4-week limit on unpaid leave for people with Skilled Worker visas? What would happen if I exceed that?

[root_agent]: Yes, that's correct, Diego. Sponsorship can stop if a Skilled Worker is absent from work without pay for more than 4 weeks in any calendar year, with some exceptions which don't seem to apply in your case.

In your situation, with an 8-week sabbatical, exceeding that 4-week limit means your employer is legally required to stop sponsoring your visa. Are you aware of what curtailment of a visa means?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not familiar with what visa curtailment means. Could you please explain what would happen if my employer stops sponsoring my visa due to this unpaid leave?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Diego. Visa curtailment means your visa will be shortened, specifically to 60 days. This means you would have 60 days from the date your employer stops sponsoring you to either leave the UK, or find a new employer who can sponsor you for a Skilled Worker visa. 

Do you understand what I mean by finding a new sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand what finding a new sponsor means - I would need to find another employer willing to sponsor my Skilled Worker visa. So if I take this 8-week sabbatical, my current employer would have to stop sponsoring me, my visa would be shortened to just 60 days, and within those 60 days I'd either need to leave the UK or find a new job with sponsorship. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: Yes, Diego, that is a perfectly accurate summary of the situation. You've understood the implications correctly. 

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding this situation or the Skilled Worker visa rules?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that's all clear now. I'm going to need to reconsider my sabbatical plans. Maybe I could shorten it to 4 weeks or less to stay within the rules. Do you think that would work? Or are there any other options you might suggest for someone who wants to take an extended break without losing their visa status?

[root_agent]: You're very wise to consider shortening the sabbatical, Diego. If you kept the unpaid leave to 4 weeks or less within a calendar year, it wouldn’t trigger the sponsorship curtailment.

Regarding other options, unfortunately, there aren’t many straightforward alternatives while maintaining your current visa status. You could explore if your company would consider using any annual leave entitlement to cover some of the time, reducing the amount of unpaid leave. However, beyond that, the rules around unpaid leave are fairly strict for the Skilled Worker visa.

Would you like me to reiterate any of the key points we've discussed today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think you've explained everything clearly. I'll speak with my employer about potentially shortening the sabbatical to 4 weeks or using some of my paid annual leave to cover part of the time. This has been really helpful - I'm glad I checked before going ahead with my plans. Thank you for your help.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Diego! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It's always best to be informed before making such decisions. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a good day, and I hope you can find a solution that works for you and allows you to enjoy your travels!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I would lose my sponsorship if I took an 8-week unpaid sabbatical, as the rules state sponsorship must be withdrawn if unpaid leave exceeds 4 weeks in a calendar year. They accurately explained visa curtailment to 60 days and outlined my options.
