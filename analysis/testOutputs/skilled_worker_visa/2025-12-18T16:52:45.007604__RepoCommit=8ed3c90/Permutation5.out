[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Lars and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Lars, it's good to speak with you. I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a benefit.

To start, could you please confirm your nationality?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm from Norway. I've received a job offer here in the UK and I want to know if I'm eligible for a work visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you are from Norway. That's helpful to know.

To assess your eligibility for a work visa, could you tell me what your job title will be?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Specialist Stonemason. I've been working as a stonemason in Norway for several years.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you have a job offer as a Specialist Stonemason! 

To confirm, is the company offering you this position a licensed sponsor with the UK government?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, they've confirmed they are a licensed sponsor with the UK government. They mentioned that was necessary for my visa application.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Knowing they are a licensed sponsor is a key piece of information.

Now, could you please tell me what your annual salary will be in this role, before tax?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary they've offered me is £34,000 per year before tax.

[root_agent]: Thank you. £34,000 per year is good to know. 

Do you know what the standard going rate is for a Specialist Stonemason in the UK? (This is the typical salary for the role). Even an approximate figure would be helpful.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate they mentioned for a Specialist Stonemason in the UK is around £33,500 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Finally, have you taken an English language test and do you meet the required level for the visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've taken the required English language test and I've been told that I meet the English language requirements for the visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lars, thank you for providing all of that information.

Based on what you've told me: you are from Norway, you have a job offer as a Specialist Stonemason from a licensed sponsor, your salary is £34,000 per year, the standard going rate for the role is £33,500, and you meet the English language requirements.

Because Specialist Stonemason is on the Immigration Salary List, and your salary meets both the £33,400 minimum *and* the standard going rate of £33,500, you **are eligible** for a Skilled Worker Visa.



Does this information answer your question?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that answers my question perfectly. So I'm eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa because my job is on the Immigration Salary List, my salary meets both the minimum threshold of £33,400 and the going rate for my profession. That's great news! Thank you for confirming this for me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Lars! I'm glad I could provide you with a clear answer and good news. 

It sounds like you understand the reasons for your eligibility, which is fantastic. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Best of luck with your visa application and your move to the UK!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa as a Specialist Stonemason on the Immigration Salary List, with a salary of £34,000 which exceeds both the lower threshold (£33,400) and the going rate (£33,500), matching the expected outcome.
