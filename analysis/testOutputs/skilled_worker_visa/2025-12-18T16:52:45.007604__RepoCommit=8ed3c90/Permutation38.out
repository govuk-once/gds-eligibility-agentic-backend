[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Pavel, a mechanic from Poland currently in Warsaw, who is trying to understand his eligibility for a UK visa using an "Undefined" Certificate of Sponsorship.

Hi, i'm Pavel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Pavel, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility. To start, could you tell me if you are currently in the United Kingdom?





[evaluation_judge]: No, I am not in the United Kingdom. I'm currently living in Warsaw, Poland. A garage in the UK has offered me a job as a mechanic, and they've already given me a Certificate of Sponsorship number so I can apply for my visa.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear you have a job offer and a Certificate of Sponsorship! To help me understand your situation a little better, could you tell me whether the Certificate of Sponsorship you received is a 'Defined' CoS or an 'Undefined' CoS? You may need to check with the garage who provided it.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure, but I think the garage told me it was an "Undefined" CoS. They mentioned they had some spare allocations and gave me one of those so I could apply right away without waiting. I have the reference number they gave me. Does the type of CoS make a difference for my application?

[root_agent]: Yes, the type of Certificate of Sponsorship does make a difference, Pavel. Since you are currently in Warsaw, Poland – outside of the UK – the Certificate of Sponsorship needs to be a "Defined" CoS for your application to be valid. 

An "Undefined" CoS is generally used for people who are *already* in the UK and are switching visa types. 

Could you please confirm with the garage that they have assigned you a "Defined" CoS? This is important before you proceed with your application.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I didn't know there was a difference. I'll check with the garage, but I'm pretty sure they said it was an "Undefined" CoS from their annual allocation. They told me they did this to save time so I could apply immediately. Will this be a problem for my application since I'm applying from Poland?

[root_agent]: Yes, Pavel, unfortunately using an "Undefined" CoS will likely be a problem for your application since you are applying from Poland. The rules state that for applicants outside the UK, a "Defined" CoS *must* be used. 

Applying with an "Undefined" CoS in your situation would likely lead to your application being refused, or rejected as invalid. The garage will need to apply for a "Defined" CoS specifically for your application.

I understand they were trying to save time, but it's important to have the correct type of CoS to avoid issues with your visa application. Would you like me to explain the difference between a "Defined" and "Undefined" CoS in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the difference to me. I'm disappointed that this might delay my application. How long will it take for the garage to get a "Defined" CoS for me instead? Is there anything I can do to speed up the process?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Pavel. A "Defined" CoS is specifically assigned to a named individual and is required for people applying for a visa *from outside* the UK. The UK government assigns a limited number of these to sponsoring companies each year.

An "Undefined" CoS, on the other hand, comes from the sponsor’s annual allocation and is generally used for applications made *from within* the UK - for example, someone already in the UK switching to a Skilled Worker visa.

Regarding the time it takes to get a "Defined" CoS, it unfortunately can vary. The garage needs to apply for one specifically for you, and processing times are set by the Home Office. It can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks. I don’t have access to specific current processing times.

To speed up the process, you could:

*   **Encourage the garage to apply immediately.** The sooner they submit the application for a "Defined" CoS, the sooner you can proceed.
*   **Ensure the garage has all necessary documentation ready.** This includes details about your job, salary, and qualifications.
*   **Follow up with the garage regularly** (politely!) to check on the status of the application.

I understand this is disappointing, but getting the correct CoS is crucial for a successful visa application. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?

[evaluation_judge]: This is frustrating to hear. I was hoping to start my new job next month, but it sounds like there might be delays. I'll contact the garage right away and ask them to apply for a "Defined" CoS instead. 

Just to be clear - there's absolutely no way I can use this "Undefined" CoS they've already given me? Even if the job and salary details are all correct?

[root_agent]: You are right to be frustrated, Pavel – it’s understandable to be concerned about delays to your start date.

And to answer your question directly: no, unfortunately, there is absolutely no way you can use the "Undefined" CoS they’ve already given you when applying for your visa from Poland. Even if all the job and salary details are correct, the Home Office will likely reject your application because the incorrect type of CoS was used. The rules are very specific about this.

It’s best to start the process with the correct "Defined" CoS now to avoid wasting time and money on an application that will be refused. I know it's disheartening, but getting this right from the beginning will increase your chances of a successful visa outcome.

Do you have any other questions I can assist you with?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. I'll definitely ask the garage to apply for a "Defined" CoS immediately. I hope it won't take too long. 

One last question - do you know if I'll need to pay any additional fees for this "Defined" CoS? Or is this something only the garage needs to worry about?

[root_agent]: That's a good question, Pavel. The fees associated with a "Defined" CoS generally fall on the sponsoring company – in this case, the garage. They will likely have to pay a fee to the Home Office when they apply for the "Defined" CoS. 

You, as the applicant, will have your own visa application fee to pay when you submit your Skilled Worker visa application, but that is separate from the CoS assignment fee the garage pays.

I believe the garage is already aware of these costs as part of being a licensed sponsor, but it's always a good idea to confirm with them.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? I'm glad I could clarify things for you.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining everything. I'll get in touch with the garage right away and ask them to apply for the correct "Defined" CoS. I appreciate your help!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Pavel! I'm happy I could help. I wish you the very best of luck with your visa application and your new job as a mechanic. 

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that an "Undefined" CoS cannot be used for an application from outside the UK and that Pavel needs a "Defined" CoS instead. They accurately explained that the application would be refused/rejected if submitted with the wrong type of CoS, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
