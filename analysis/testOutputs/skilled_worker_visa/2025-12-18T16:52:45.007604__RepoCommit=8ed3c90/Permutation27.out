[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by roleplaying a UK resident seeking benefit eligibility information. I'll engage with the agent under test and evaluate their response based on the scenario provided.

Hi, i'm Lucas and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Lucas, it's lovely to meet you! I'm root_agent, and I'm here to help. To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in applying for a UK skilled worker visa. I've received a job offer as a Senior Developer at a startup, but I'm not sure if my salary package meets the requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, great! The Skilled Worker visa has certain salary requirements. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me your annual cash salary – that is, the amount you will be paid in actual money, before tax?

[evaluation_judge]: My cash salary would be £30,000 per year. The startup has also offered me stock options that they value at around £50,000 per year with a vesting schedule. So the total package is worth £80,000, but the actual cash component is just the £30,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Lucas. Just to be absolutely sure I understand correctly, the £50,000 in stock options is *not* paid to you as regular income, it's in the form of shares that vest over time, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. The £50,000 is in the form of company shares that would vest over time. It's not part of my regular monthly income - it's just stock options that might be valuable in the future if the company does well. My guaranteed cash salary would be the £30,000 paid monthly.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. To assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa, do you know if your job role is on the list of eligible occupations? You can find the list here: https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa/eligible-occupations.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand that as a Senior Developer, my job falls under the "Programmer and software development professionals" code 2136, which I believe is on the eligible occupations list for the Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear, Lucas. Now, the Skilled Worker visa has a minimum salary requirement. Are you aware of the current salary thresholds?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not completely sure about the current thresholds. I've heard different figures mentioned - something about a standard threshold around £40,000 and possibly a lower threshold? Could you clarify what the current requirements are?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The general threshold is currently £38,700 per year, but there's also a 'going rate' for your specific occupation. For a Senior Developer (SOC code 2136), the going rate is actually £41,700 per year. There's also a new salary threshold of £33,400 which *may* apply in specific circumstances, but we'll focus on the £41,700 going rate for now. 

With that in mind, does your salary meet the £41,700 threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my cash salary of £30,000 doesn't meet the £41,700 going rate threshold. I was hoping that the stock options might count toward that requirement since the total package is valued at £80,000, but it sounds like that might not be the case.

[root_agent]: You are correct to think the stock options likely won’t count towards the threshold, Lucas. Unfortunately, the Home Office only considers guaranteed salary for Skilled Worker visa eligibility, and stock options or shares that haven't vested aren't considered guaranteed income. 

Therefore, based on a cash salary of £30,000 and the going rate of £41,700 for a Senior Developer, it appears you unfortunately do not meet the salary requirements for this visa at this time. Would you like me to explain this further, or perhaps explore other potential options?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. Would my application definitely be refused then? Could you explain a bit more about why the stock options don't count? I was really hoping this would work out as the total package value is quite good.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Lucas. And you’re right to ask for more detail.

Yes, your application would very likely be refused based on the information provided. The guidance on the Skilled Worker visa ([https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)) specifically states that benefits in kind, like stock options, are *not* counted towards the minimum salary requirement. They only consider the actual, guaranteed cash salary you receive.

The Home Office requires a guaranteed salary because they need to be confident you’ll have sufficient funds to support yourself in the UK without relying on public funds. The value of stock options is uncertain – they may increase in value, but they could also become worthless if the company doesn't succeed. Therefore, they don’t consider it a reliable source of income for visa purposes.

While the overall package *is* valuable, the visa rules focus solely on the guaranteed monetary compensation. Is that explanation helpful?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that explanation helps me understand the situation better. So even though the total value of my package is £80,000, since only £30,000 is guaranteed cash salary, I don't meet the minimum requirements. And since my cash salary is below both the £41,700 going rate and even the lower £33,400 threshold you mentioned, my application would be refused. Is that correct?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Lucas. That is absolutely correct. Even though the total package is valued at £80,000, it's the guaranteed cash salary of £30,000 that matters for the Skilled Worker visa. And as you pointed out, that amount is below both the £41,700 going rate for your occupation and the £33,400 threshold. 

Therefore, based on the information we’ve discussed, your application would likely be refused. I'm sorry I don't have better news. Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information about exploring a salary negotiation with your employer?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that my application would be refused because my guaranteed cash salary of £30,000 does not meet either the standard threshold of £41,700 or the lower threshold of £33,400, and correctly explained that stock options cannot be counted toward the salary requirement for a Skilled Worker visa.
