[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Liam, it's great to chat with you! I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a benefit. 

To start, could you please confirm your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 23 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that's helpful! And could you tell me what your current immigration status is – for example, are you currently on a visa, and if so, what type?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently on a Student Visa. I just finished my Bachelor's degree here in the UK. I'm from Canada originally.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Thanks for that information. 

You mentioned you just finished your Bachelor's degree. Was that degree taught in English?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my degree was taught in English at a UK university.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you.

Do you have a job offer with a company that is a licensed sponsor with the Home Office?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer from a licensed sponsor. They're offering me a position as a Junior Financial Analyst.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear! And what salary are they offering you for the Junior Financial Analyst position?

[evaluation_judge]: They're offering me £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Do you know what the standard going rate is for a Junior Financial Analyst in your location? (An approximate figure is fine if you don't know the exact amount).

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for this role is about £42,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, that's very helpful. 

Just to confirm, is the job itself at the required skill level according to the Skilled Worker visa requirements (generally RQF level 3 or above)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been told that the Junior Financial Analyst position meets the required skill level for the visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. Based on the information you've provided: you are 23, you're currently on a Student Visa, your degree was taught in English, you have a job offer from a licensed sponsor for a role at the required skill level, the salary is £35,000, and the going rate for the role is £42,000.

This means you likely qualify as a New Entrant under the Skilled Worker visa rules. Because you meet the age and recent graduate criteria, and your salary of £35,000 meets both the £33,400 lower general threshold *and* is at least 70% of the going rate (£29,400), you would be **AWARDED** eligibility.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I qualify for the Skilled Worker visa as a New Entrant, confirming that my £35,000 salary exceeds both the £33,400 threshold and 70% of the going rate (£29,400), matching the expected outcome of "AWARDED."
