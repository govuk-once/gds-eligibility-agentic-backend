[evaluation_judge]: I'll help by taking on the role of Batbayar in this scenario to test the agent's performance.

Hi, i'm Batbayar and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Batbayar, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for UK benefits.

To start, are you currently located in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am in the UK. I recently received a job offer from a logistics company here as an Office Manager. I'm wondering if I would be eligible for a Skilled Worker visa with this job.

[root_agent]: That's good to know you're already in the UK, and congratulations on the job offer! 

To assess your eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa, could you tell me what the annual salary offered in the job is?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary they're offering me is £28,000 per year. They said they were particularly interested in me because I speak fluent Mongolian and have expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare, which they specifically listed as mandatory requirements in the job description. The company is a UK logistics firm.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Batbayar. That's very helpful.

Now, to understand the role itself a little better, could you briefly describe the main duties of the Office Manager position as outlined in the job description?

[evaluation_judge]: The job description says I'll be managing the office operations - administrative tasks, handling correspondence, scheduling meetings, managing office supplies, coordinating with other departments, and general office management duties. It's a pretty standard office manager role at their headquarters, but they specifically listed "mandatory requirement: Fluent Mongolian speaker and expert in 13th-century steppe warfare" in the requirements section. I found it a bit unusual, but I do match these qualifications from my history degree.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying the job duties and the unusual requirements. 

To confirm, does the logistics company have any existing business connections or clients in Mongolia?

[evaluation_judge]: No, they don't have any business connections or clients in Mongolia. When I asked about this during the interview, they were a bit vague about why they needed someone with Mongolian language skills and knowledge of historical steppe warfare for an office manager position. They just mentioned it was "part of their future planning" but didn't provide any specific plans for expansion into Mongolia or any projects related to my expertise.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so honest, Batbayar. That's a very important detail.

Based on the information you’ve provided, particularly the lack of a clear business need for the specific skills they’ve requested – fluent Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare – it appears this job offer may not meet the requirements for a genuine vacancy as part of the Skilled Worker visa.

I'm afraid, based on this, your application for a Skilled Worker visa with this job offer would likely be **REFUSED**. The Home Office may see this as an attempt to circumvent the rules by tailoring the job description to fit you specifically, rather than reflecting a genuine business need.



Would you like me to explain any part of this further?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for that explanation. I suspected something might be off about those specific requirements. Could you tell me a bit more about what makes a job vacancy "genuine" for visa purposes? Is there anything I should look for in future job offers?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Batbayar. It's good you were already questioning it!

A "genuine vacancy" for Skilled Worker visa purposes means the job must be a real job with a genuine need within the company. It can't be created solely to help someone obtain a visa. Here are some things to look for in future job offers to help ensure the vacancy is genuine:

*   **Accurate Job Description:** The job description should accurately reflect the actual duties and responsibilities of the role. It shouldn’t be overly specific to *your* qualifications, instead focusing on what the company genuinely needs to fill the position.
*   **Clear Business Need:** There should be a clear and logical reason why the company needs someone to fill this specific role.
*   **Standard Recruitment Process:** The company should have followed a standard recruitment process, including advertising the position and interviewing multiple candidates (not just you).
*   **Realistic Requirements:** The skills and experience requested should be realistic and relevant to the job. As we discussed, requesting skills unrelated to the role raises red flags.
*   **Company Background:** Research the company to make sure it’s a legitimate business and that the job aligns with its overall operations.

Essentially, the job should be one the company would need to fill even if you hadn’t applied.

Does that explanation help clarify what constitutes a genuine vacancy?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you! I understand better now why those specific requirements raised concerns. It does seem like they tailored the job to fit my unusual qualifications rather than having a genuine business need. I'll be more cautious with future job offers and make sure there's a clear connection between the requirements and actual business operations. I appreciate your explanation of what constitutes a genuine vacancy.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Batbayar! I'm glad I could help. It's excellent that you're now aware of these points and will be more cautious in your job search. 

Remember, it’s always best to be thorough and ask questions if something doesn’t seem right. 

If you have any other questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you all the best in finding a suitable and genuine job opportunity.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that my application would be REFUSED based on the vacancy not being genuine. They properly identified that the job requirements (fluent Mongolian and expertise in 13th-century steppe warfare) were suspiciously tailored to my specific profile without any business justification, as the company had no clients or connections to Mongolia. The agent provided an accurate explanation of what constitutes a genuine vacancy for visa purposes.
