[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ali and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ali, it's good to speak with you. I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a benefit. 

To start, are you currently completing a PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently in the third year of my 4-year PhD program in Engineering. I haven't graduated yet, but I've been studying for over two years now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Ali. That's helpful to know.

Have you completed at least 24 months of your PhD program?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have completed more than 24 months of my PhD program. I'm now in my third year, so that's about 2.5 years of study completed so far.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. And just to confirm, do you have a job offer for a role that is considered a skilled occupation, as listed on the UK government website?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a job offer as an Engineering Consultant. I believe it's considered a skilled occupation from what I've seen on the UK government website. I'm hoping to switch to a Skilled Worker visa before I complete my PhD.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent, Ali. Based on the information you’ve provided – you are currently studying for a PhD, you have completed over 24 months of the course, and you have a job offer as an Engineering Consultant – you are likely **AWARDED** eligibility to switch to a Skilled Worker visa *before* completing your PhD.

PhD students are eligible to switch before graduating once they have completed at least 24 months of their course.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! I'm relieved to hear that I can switch to a Skilled Worker visa without having to wait until I complete my entire PhD program. I wasn't sure if I'd be eligible since I haven't graduated yet. Thank you for confirming this for me. I don't have any other questions at the moment.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Ali! I'm glad I could provide you with that reassurance. It's perfectly understandable to be unsure about eligibility, and I'm happy it worked out for you. 

If you do have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Best of luck with your application and your new role as an Engineering Consultant!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for your help and good wishes! I'll start preparing my application for the Skilled Worker visa right away. Have a great day!

✓ The agent correctly determined that I would be awarded eligibility to switch to a Skilled Worker visa before completing my PhD, as PhD students who have completed at least 24 months of their course are eligible for this specific concession.
