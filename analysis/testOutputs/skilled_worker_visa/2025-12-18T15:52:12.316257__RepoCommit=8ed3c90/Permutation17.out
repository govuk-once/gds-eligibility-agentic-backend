[evaluation_judge]: I'll now role-play as Yuki, a Skilled Worker visa holder who wants to take a second job.

Hi, i'm Yuki and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Yuki, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help! 

To best understand your situation, could you please tell me what type of visa you currently hold?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm currently in the UK on a Skilled Worker visa. I'm working full-time as a Graphic Designer with a company that's sponsoring me. I'm wondering if I can take on a part-time job on the weekends to earn some extra money.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, thank you Yuki.

To clarify, are you considering a second job in the *same* field as your current role as a Graphic Designer, or something different?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm actually thinking of working as a bartender on weekends. It's quite different from my graphic design work. It would only be about 10 hours per week, just to earn some extra money. Is this allowed under my current visa?

[root_agent]: Thanks for clarifying, Yuki. 

Is the job of Bartender listed as a shortage occupation on the Immigration Salary List? (You can find lists of shortage occupations on the UK government website if you need to check.)

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't believe bartender is on the shortage occupation or Immigration Salary List. It's just a regular part-time bartending position at a local pub, nothing specialized. It's completely different from my main graphic design job.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Yuki.

Just to be absolutely certain, can you confirm that your main Skilled Worker visa is currently valid and has not expired?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my Skilled Worker visa is definitely valid. I've only been in the UK for about a year on my current visa, and it was issued for 5 years. So I'm well within the valid period of my visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Yuki.

Based on the information you've provided – you are on a Skilled Worker visa, your visa is valid, the second job as a bartender is *not* in the same occupation code as your Graphic Designer role, and it is *not* on the Immigration Salary List – unfortunately, taking on this bartending job would not be permitted under the conditions of your visa.

You are allowed to take on supplementary work, but it must either be in the same occupation code as your main job, *or* be in a shortage occupation, and it must be no more than 20 hours per week.





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct information that the bartending job would not be permitted under my Skilled Worker visa conditions. They accurately explained that supplementary work must either be in the same occupation code or be a shortage occupation, and be no more than 20 hours per week.
