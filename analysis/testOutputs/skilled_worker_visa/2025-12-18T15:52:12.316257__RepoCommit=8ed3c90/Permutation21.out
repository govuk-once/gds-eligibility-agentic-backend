[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Leo, a Chinese student looking to switch from a Student visa to a Skilled Worker visa before completing his Master's degree.

Hi, i'm Leo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Leo, it's lovely to meet you! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you please tell me, what is the current status of your studies? For example, have you completed your course, or are you still studying?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently studying for my Master's degree here in the UK. I'm on a Student Visa that's valid until September 2026. My course started in September 2025, so I'm only about halfway through the first year of my studies.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Leo. That's very helpful.

Could you also tell me, do you have a job offer already? If so, what is the start date for that position?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I actually just received a job offer as a Marketing Executive with a company here in the UK. They want me to start in January 2026, so quite soon. I'm excited about the opportunity but I'm not sure if I can take it since I'd need to switch from my Student visa to a work visa. The company is willing to sponsor me.

[root_agent]: That's great news about the job offer, Leo! It's good they are willing to sponsor you.

To clarify, are you planning to switch to the Skilled Worker visa *while* still currently studying, before you finish your Master's degree?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly what I'm hoping to do. Since the job starts in January 2026 and my course isn't scheduled to finish until September 2026, I would need to leave my studies early to take this job opportunity. Is that something I can do with my current Student visa status?

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Leo. 

Just to be absolutely clear, and to help me assess your situation accurately - are you enrolled in a PhD program, or a Master’s program?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm enrolled in a Master's program, not a PhD. It's a standard one-year Master's degree in Marketing.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Leo.

Based on the information you've provided, I'm afraid you would **not** currently be eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa from within the UK. As you are enrolled on a Master’s program and haven’t yet completed your course, or completed 24 months of a PhD, a switch to a Skilled Worker visa isn’t possible at this time.



You would need to complete your studies first, or explore the option of applying for the Skilled Worker visa from outside the UK. Would you like me to explain this in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain it to me in more detail. I'm a bit disappointed as I was really looking forward to this job opportunity. What are my options if I still want to pursue this position?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Leo. It's frustrating when things don't quite align as planned.

Here's a more detailed explanation of your options:

Currently, the rules state that a student can only switch to a Skilled Worker visa *after* completing their course (or after 24 months of a PhD). Since your Master’s program isn’t scheduled to finish until September 2026, and you'd be leaving it early in January 2026, you don't meet this requirement.

Your options are:

1. **Complete your studies:** You could finish your Master's degree as planned. Once you’ve completed the course, you would then be eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa while still in the UK. However, this means delaying the start of your employment until September 2026.

2. **Apply from outside the UK:** You could choose to leave the UK and apply for the Skilled Worker visa from outside the UK (this is called 'entry clearance'). This would involve returning to China and going through the application process there.

Essentially, switching *mid-course* (before completion) isn’t permitted unless you are a PhD student who has completed at least 24 months of study, which isn’t your situation.

Does this make things a little clearer? Would you like me to clarify any part of this, or perhaps discuss the implications of each option?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for explaining that so clearly. I think I understand now - since I haven't completed my Master's degree, I can't switch to a Skilled Worker visa from within the UK.

If I went with the second option of applying from outside the UK, would I need to formally withdraw from my studies before leaving? And approximately how long would the entry clearance process take if I applied from China? I'm wondering if the company might be willing to delay my start date a bit if the process isn't too lengthy.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Leo! I'm glad the explanation was helpful.

Yes, you would generally need to formally withdraw from your studies before applying for entry clearance as a Skilled Worker from outside the UK. Continuing your studies while applying from abroad could complicate the application process and potentially lead to a refusal. It’s best to demonstrate a clear intention to pursue employment, not continue studying.

Regarding the processing time for entry clearance from China, it can vary. As of today, December 14, 2025, the UK government states that processing times are up to 15 weeks – although it can sometimes take longer depending on individual circumstances and current demand. You can find the latest estimated processing times here: [https://www.gov.uk/visa-processing-times](https://www.gov.uk/visa-processing-times) (I'm providing this link now as it gives an *estimate* but I am not using it for eligibility criteria).

15 weeks is roughly 3-4 months, so a delay to your start date would likely be necessary. It's definitely worth discussing with the company and seeing if they are willing to be flexible, given your situation and their sponsorship.

Would you like me to help you understand any other aspects of the Skilled Worker visa or the entry clearance process? For example, are you curious about the documentation required?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for that information. That's quite a long processing time - I'll definitely need to talk with the employer about potentially delaying my start date.

One more question - if I do complete my Master's degree in September 2026 as originally planned, how soon after completion could I apply for the Skilled Worker visa while remaining in the UK? Would I need to wait for my actual graduation ceremony, or could I apply as soon as I finish my final exams and coursework?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Leo! I'm glad I could help.

That's a very good question regarding timing after completing your Master's. 

You wouldn't need to wait for the actual graduation ceremony to apply. You can apply for the Skilled Worker visa as soon as you have completed *all* of your exams and coursework, and have a confirmed end date for your studies. Essentially, once your Student visa’s permitted activities have ended – meaning you've finished your course requirements – you are eligible to apply to switch to the Skilled Worker visa.

Having official confirmation of completion (like a transcript showing completion of all modules) is a good idea to include with your application, but you don't need to physically have the graduation certificate in hand to apply.

However, it is important to apply *before* your Student visa expires. You’ll usually have a 60-day ‘cooling off’ period after your course finishes to switch, but it’s best to apply well within that timeframe to avoid any potential issues.



Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly advised me that I am NOT eligible to switch to a Skilled Worker visa from within the UK. They accurately explained that as a Master's student who hasn't completed their course, I don't meet the requirement of having completed my studies before switching. The agent also correctly outlined my options - either complete my studies first or apply from outside the UK.
