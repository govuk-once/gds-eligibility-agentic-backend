[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ravi and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Ravi, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for different benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm interested in a Skilled Worker visa for the UK. I have a job offer as a System Administrator from TechRecruit Ltd. They're offering me £50,000 per year, but I'll be working full-time at Bank Corp, which is their client. I'm from India, and I want to know if I'm eligible for this visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Ravi. That's very helpful.

To better understand your situation, could you please clarify how often you will be working at Bank Corp? Will you be working there full-time, part-time, or on a rotating basis?

[evaluation_judge]: I'll be working full-time at Bank Corp - that's 100% of my time. TechRecruit Ltd is my employer on paper, but I'll be at Bank Corp's offices every day and reporting to their managers. It seems like a permanent arrangement as far as I understand.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Ravi. That's very helpful to know.

To confirm, would you say that TechRecruit Ltd will be directly responsible for your day-to-day tasks and how you perform your job, or will Bank Corp be managing those aspects of your work?

[evaluation_judge]: Bank Corp will be managing my day-to-day tasks. Their managers will be directing my work, setting my priorities, and evaluating my performance. TechRecruit is just paying my salary and handling the paperwork. I'll be essentially functioning as part of Bank Corp's IT team, but employed through TechRecruit.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Ravi.

In this arrangement, will TechRecruit Ltd be retaining full responsibility for your duties as a System Administrator, or will that responsibility primarily lie with Bank Corp?

[evaluation_judge]: From what I understand, TechRecruit Ltd won't have much responsibility for my actual duties. Bank Corp will be fully responsible for assigning my tasks, supervising my work, and evaluating how I perform. TechRecruit seems to just handle the administrative side - paying my salary, sorting out my contract and visa sponsorship. The actual work responsibility lies with Bank Corp.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Ravi. That’s a very clear explanation.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears your situation may not meet the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa. Specifically, it seems like you might be filling a routine permanent position at Bank Corp, with TechRecruit Ltd acting as a supplier of labour. 

I must inform you that your application would likely be **REFUSED** under these circumstances. Would you like me to explain the reasoning in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain the reasoning in more detail. I'm a bit surprised by this as the salary is good and I thought I had a legitimate job offer.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Ravi. I understand your surprise, and it's good you asked for more detail.

The Skilled Worker Visa is designed for roles where the sponsoring company – in your case, TechRecruit Ltd – genuinely *needs* the role to be filled within *their own* organisation. The rules state that a Skilled Worker cannot be sponsored to work 100% of the time for a client (like Bank Corp) if the role essentially fills a permanent need *at the client's* organisation. This is to prevent companies from using the visa system to provide staff to other businesses, effectively acting as a recruitment agency.

In your situation, because you’ll be working full-time at Bank Corp, reporting to their managers, and performing duties directly supervised by them, the Home Office would likely see TechRecruit Ltd as simply supplying labour to Bank Corp. They won’t see TechRecruit Ltd as needing a System Administrator within *their own* operations. The responsibility for your work lies with Bank Corp, not TechRecruit Ltd.

This is known as the “routine role” third-party ban. The sponsor must retain full responsibility for the worker's duties, which doesn't seem to be the case here.



Does that explanation make sense, Ravi?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does make sense now. I didn't realize there were these specific rules about working for third parties. So essentially, even though TechRecruit would be my employer on paper and the visa sponsor, the fact that I'd be permanently working at Bank Corp's site under their management means this arrangement wouldn't qualify for a Skilled Worker visa. 

Is there any way this could be restructured so it would be eligible? Or should I be looking for a direct employment opportunity with a company that needs my skills in-house?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood the situation perfectly, Ravi. You're right – even with TechRecruit as the formal employer, the practical reality of the arrangement is key.

Regarding restructuring, it would be very difficult to make this arrangement eligible without significant changes. To qualify, TechRecruit Ltd would need to demonstrate genuine involvement in your day-to-day work and retain full responsibility for your duties. For example, if you regularly returned to TechRecruit's offices for tasks, or if TechRecruit's staff were directly involved in supervising your work alongside Bank Corp's managers, it *might* be possible. However, given your description, that doesn't seem likely.

Therefore, you are absolutely correct to consider seeking a direct employment opportunity with a company that needs your skills in-house. That would be the most straightforward path to a Skilled Worker Visa.

Would you like me to provide any information about resources for finding direct employment opportunities in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly informed me that my application would be refused. According to the criteria, this arrangement violates the "contracting out" rule since TechRecruit is acting as a recruitment agency supplying labor to a third party (Bank Corp), with me reporting to Bank Corp managers and working there indefinitely. The expected outcome is indeed REFUSED, matching what the agent told me.

[evaluation_judge]: Wait, I need to correct myself. The agent correctly informed me that my application would be REFUSED, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario. The agent accurately explained that since I would be working 100% of the time at Bank Corp under their management, with TechRecruit merely acting as a supplier of labor, this violates the "routine role" third-party ban for Skilled Worker visas.

✓ The agent correctly identified that my application would be REFUSED, explaining that this arrangement violates the third-party ban where a sponsor cannot supply workers to fill routine permanent positions at client organizations.
