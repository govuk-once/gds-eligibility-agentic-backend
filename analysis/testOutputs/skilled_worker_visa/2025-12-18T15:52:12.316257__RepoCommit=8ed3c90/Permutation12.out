[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Amara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Amara, it's lovely to meet you. I understand you're checking your eligibility for a benefit. To start, could you please tell me what benefit you are interested in applying for?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm checking about the Skilled Worker visa. I'm an architect from Nigeria, and I've received a job offer in the UK. The company wants me to work part-time, 3 days a week (about 22.5 hours), as I'll be doing some private study alongside my work. They're offering me £30 per hour, which works out to about £35,100 per year. I'm trying to understand if I'm eligible for the visa with this arrangement.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Amara. That's very helpful. 

To assess your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa, could you please confirm if you are being sponsored by a licensed sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the company is a licensed sponsor. They've already got approval to sponsor architects, and they've prepared the Certificate of Sponsorship for me. I just want to make sure I meet the salary requirements before proceeding further.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear they are a licensed sponsor and have a Certificate of Sponsorship prepared for you.

To help me understand your situation better, could you please confirm which salary threshold your sponsor is using - £33,400 or £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: I believe they're using the £41,700 threshold. They mentioned something about this being the standard option. I'm concerned because my actual annual salary will be £35,100 since I'm working part-time.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Amara. It’s good you’re being proactive about checking the salary requirements.

Just to be absolutely certain, and to help me assess your eligibility, could you please confirm the specific job title listed on your Certificate of Sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: The job title is "Architect." It's a professional position where I'll be designing buildings and managing some smaller projects for the firm. I'm fully qualified with my architecture degree and have several years of experience in Nigeria.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your job title, Amara. That's helpful.

Given your job title is Architect, and your sponsor is using the £41,700 threshold, do you understand that the Skilled Worker visa generally requires an *actual gross annual salary* of at least £41,700?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I was worried about that. So even though my hourly rate of £30/hour would equal to around £58,500 if I were working full-time, the actual £35,100 I'll be earning is what matters? I was hoping that because my hourly rate is quite high, there might be some flexibility for part-time workers.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to ask about that, Amara. You've understood correctly. 

Unfortunately, for the standard £41,700 threshold, it is the *actual gross annual salary* that matters – which in your case is £35,100. While your hourly rate is good and would meet the going rate if calculated pro-rata, the general threshold is typically a hard floor and cannot be pro-rated in your situation.



Therefore, based on the information you've provided, it appears you currently do not meet the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa.

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. So there's no way around this? I can't qualify based on my hourly rate even though it's quite good? Would I need to either work more hours or negotiate a higher hourly rate to reach that £41,700 minimum?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Amara. It is frustrating when things don't quite align.

You are correct - unfortunately, there isn't a way around the £41,700 minimum annual salary in your case. As you've rightly identified, to meet the requirements, you would indeed need to either increase your working hours to reach an actual gross annual salary of £41,700, or negotiate a higher hourly rate with your employer to achieve the same outcome.

Are you aware of any other potential routes for eligibility, such as being in a profession experiencing a shortage, or qualifying under a different salary threshold (like the £33,400 'new entrant' threshold)?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not aware of architects being on any shortage list, and I wouldn't be considered a new entrant as I've been working in this field for several years already. This is frustrating. So to be clear, my application would definitely be refused unless I can get the actual annual salary up to £41,700, correct?

[root_agent]: You are absolutely right to want to be clear, Amara. And yes, you’ve understood correctly.

Based on the information you’ve provided – being a qualified Architect with several years of experience, sponsored under the standard £41,700 threshold, and with an actual gross annual salary of £35,100 – your application would likely be refused.

It's a frustrating situation, I understand. To reiterate, increasing your hours or negotiating a higher hourly rate to reach that £41,700 threshold would be necessary for you to meet the Skilled Worker visa requirements under these circumstances.



Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information on how to discuss this with your sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly assessed my eligibility. The expected outcome was that I would be refused a Skilled Worker visa as the actual gross salary doesn't meet the general threshold, which is correct. However, they introduced confusion by asking if I was in a "shortage" profession or could qualify as a "new entrant," which aren't relevant factors for this specific issue of pro-rating thresholds.
