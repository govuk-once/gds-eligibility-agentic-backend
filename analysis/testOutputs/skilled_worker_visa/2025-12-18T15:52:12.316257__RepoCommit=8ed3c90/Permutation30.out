[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Omar and interact with the agent to test their knowledge about the Skilled Worker visa eligibility, specifically regarding the "genuine vacancy" test.

Hi, i'm Omar and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Omar, it's nice to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what kind of work you are hoping to do in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there, thanks for your help. I'm actually looking into my eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa. My uncle owns a small restaurant in London, and he's offered me a job as the Restaurant Manager with a salary of £45,000. I've been working in hospitality back home for a few years, and this seems like a good opportunity. Can you help me understand if I would qualify?

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Omar! I can certainly help you explore your eligibility for the Skilled Worker visa. A salary of £45,000 is a good starting point.

To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about the restaurant itself? Specifically, approximately how many people does it seat?

[evaluation_judge]: The restaurant is quite small actually, just about 10 seats. It's a cozy little place that my uncle has owned for several years now. It specializes in our traditional cuisine.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Omar. That's helpful.

Currently, does the restaurant already *have* a manager in place?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, there is actually a manager already working there. My uncle mentioned they would still need me as another restaurant manager though. He said I'd be handling "general oversight" of the restaurant operations.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that, Omar. 

Could you elaborate a little on what “general oversight” would involve in this role? What specific duties would you be responsible for?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, my uncle didn't really go into much detail about the specific duties. He just said "general oversight" would involve helping to supervise the restaurant operations, maybe dealing with some suppliers, and assisting with day-to-day management tasks. The job description was pretty vague to be honest. I think he's still figuring out exactly what I'd be doing, but he assured me the salary would be £45,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being honest about the details, Omar. That's very helpful.

Just to confirm, is this a newly created position, or has someone previously held the role of Restaurant Manager at this restaurant?

[evaluation_judge]: It's a new position. My uncle said he's creating this role specifically for me to join the team. There's the existing manager who handles most things now, but my uncle wants to bring me on board too. He said having family in the business would be good.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Omar.

Given the information you've provided – the small size of the restaurant, the existing manager, the vague job description focusing on "general oversight," and the fact that the role is newly created specifically for you as family – there's a possibility the Home Office might view this position as not being a "genuine vacancy." 

Do you understand what I mean by a "genuine vacancy"?

[evaluation_judge]: Not completely, no. What exactly does "genuine vacancy" mean? Is there a problem with my uncle creating a position for me?

[root_agent]: That's a very good question, Omar. I'm glad you asked.

A "genuine vacancy" means the Home Office needs to be convinced that the job is a real, necessary position within the business, and isn't simply created to facilitate a visa application. They look closely at whether the role is actually needed and whether a suitable settled worker (someone with the right to live and work in the UK already) could realistically fill it.

The fact that the role is newly created *specifically* for you, and that your uncle has said having family in the business would be good, raises concerns. The Home Office might investigate whether the restaurant truly *needs* another manager, given its size and the existing management structure. They want to be sure the job isn't just a way for you to come to the UK.



Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. So they might think my uncle is just trying to help me move to the UK rather than having a genuine business need for another manager. Since the restaurant is so small with only 10 seats and already has a manager, they might question why they'd need to hire another manager from overseas, especially a family member. Is that going to be a problem for my visa application?

[root_agent]: You've understood the situation perfectly, Omar. Yes, that is precisely the concern. 

Based on the information we've discussed, it is likely the Home Office would scrutinize this application very closely, and there's a significant risk it could be refused due to not meeting the "genuine vacancy" requirement. They may request further evidence from your uncle to demonstrate a legitimate business need for the role, and it would be difficult to provide compelling evidence given the restaurant’s size and existing management.

While your salary meets the threshold and the job *could* be considered skilled, the "genuine vacancy" issue is a significant hurdle in this situation.



Would you like me to explain anything further about this, or perhaps discuss other potential options?

[evaluation_judge]: So if I understand correctly, even though the salary is good enough at £45,000 and the job is technically skilled, I would likely be refused because the Home Office wouldn't believe there's a genuine need for a second manager in such a small restaurant, especially since I'm related to the owner. That seems disappointing. Are there any alternatives I should consider instead?

[root_agent]: You understand perfectly, Omar. You’ve summarized the situation very accurately. The salary and skill level are important, but they aren’t the only factors. The “genuine vacancy” test carries significant weight.

It is disappointing, and I’m sorry to deliver that news.

Regarding alternatives, considering the challenges with this particular role, you might explore these options:

1. **Seek a different job offer:** Applying for a Restaurant Manager position (or a similar skilled role) with a company unrelated to your family would likely strengthen your application significantly. A role with a clear, demonstrably genuine need would be much more likely to be approved.
2. **Different Visa Route:** Explore if there are any other visa routes that might be suitable for your situation, though the Skilled Worker visa is generally the most common for this type of employment.
3. **Strengthen Evidence (Difficult):** While challenging, your uncle could try to significantly redefine the role, providing a very detailed job description outlining specific, essential duties that *couldn't* be covered by the existing manager. However, given the size of the restaurant, this would be difficult to make credible.

Given the current circumstances, pursuing a genuinely independent job offer is likely the most viable path forward. Would you like me to provide information about finding job opportunities in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. That's disappointing news but I appreciate you being direct with me. So the fact that I'm related to the owner combined with the small restaurant size and existing manager would make this look suspicious to the Home Office. I think I'll look into other opportunities with restaurants not owned by my family members. 

Thanks for explaining this to me. I wasn't aware of the "genuine vacancy" requirement before. It's good to know before I went through the whole application process only to be refused.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Omar. I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you. It's always best to be aware of the potential challenges upfront.

You’ve grasped the key points perfectly – the combination of factors does create a higher risk of refusal. Focusing on independent job opportunities is a sensible approach.

If you have any further questions about the Skilled Worker visa, or any other UK immigration matters, please don’t hesitate to ask. I’m here to help in any way I can.

I wish you the best of luck with your job search!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you very much for your help and advice. I'll start looking for independent job opportunities instead. Good day to you!

✓ The agent correctly identified that this would be refused based on the "genuine vacancy" test. They accurately explained that despite meeting the salary threshold and skill requirements, the Home Office would likely reject the application because the position appears to have been created specifically for a family member in a small restaurant that already has a manager. The agent provided a clear explanation of why this would fail the genuine vacancy requirement.
