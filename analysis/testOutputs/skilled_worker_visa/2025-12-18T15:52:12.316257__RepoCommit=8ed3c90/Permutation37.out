[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Maria, a nurse on a Skilled Worker visa who wants to understand if her supplementary work is compliant with her visa conditions.

Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Maria, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help! To understand your situation better, could you tell me what benefit you are interested in? Specifically, are you asking about your Skilled Worker visa and whether additional work is permitted?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm a nurse at a hospital here on a Skilled Worker visa, and I've been offered some extra shifts at a different hospital. I want to make sure I understand if I'm allowed to take this additional work without getting in trouble with my visa status. I'd like to pick up quite a few extra shifts as the pay is good, so I want to check what the rules are.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's very sensible of you to check, Maria. It's good to be sure! 

To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me approximately how many hours *per week* you are expecting to work at this second hospital, *in addition* to your regular contracted hours at your primary hospital? Just an estimate is fine for now.

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I'm generally thinking about 20-25 hours per week at the second hospital. This past week was actually quite busy, and I ended up doing 25 hours of extra shifts there because they were short-staffed. I'm a nurse at both hospitals, doing essentially the same job. Is that going to be a problem with my visa?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Maria. That's very helpful.

Just to confirm, you've mentioned you worked 25 hours of overtime at the second hospital *this past week* specifically. Generally, you anticipate working between 20-25 hours per week at the agency. 

To be absolutely certain, could you confirm whether your job title and occupation code are the same at both hospitals? (For example, Registered Nurse at both locations).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm a Registered Nurse at both hospitals. My main job is at the NHS hospital where I have my contracted hours that my visa is based on, and then I'm also working as a Registered Nurse through an agency at the second hospital. The work is essentially identical - same nursing duties, same occupation code. I just thought it would be a good way to earn some extra money, especially when they're short-staffed.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. That's very clear.

Given that you are working as a Registered Nurse – the same occupation code – at both hospitals, the issue hinges on the number of hours you work at the second hospital *in addition* to your contracted hours.

The rules state that you can undertake supplementary work, but it *cannot* exceed 20 hours per week. You mentioned working 25 hours last week, and generally anticipating 20-25 hours per week.

Unfortunately, working 25 hours, even for one week, would be a breach of your visa conditions.



**VISA VIOLATION.** By working 25 hours in a second job, you have breached your visa conditions. This can lead to future refusals or curtailment of your visa if detected. It's important to ensure you do not work more than 20 hours per week at the agency.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this, or would you like me to explain this further?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that working 25 hours at my second job was a visa violation since supplementary work must not exceed 20 hours per week, even though the work is in the same occupation code.
