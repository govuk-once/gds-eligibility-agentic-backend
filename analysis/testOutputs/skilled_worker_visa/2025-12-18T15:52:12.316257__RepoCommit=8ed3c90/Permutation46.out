[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Yara and interact with the benefit eligibility agent as requested.

Hi, i'm Yara and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Yara, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help!

To start, could you please tell me if you are currently in the UK?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently outside the UK. I was previously a student in the UK, but I'm now abroad and planning to apply for a Skilled Worker visa to return.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. 

Have you already taken a Secure English Language Test (SELT) for a previous UK visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I took a SELT for my previous Student visa application. I passed a B1 level test about 4 years ago when I came to study in the UK. I still have the reference number from that test.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, thank you.

Is that SELT test still within its 2-year validity period?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the SELT test I took is now outside the 2-year validity period. It's been about 4 years since I took it for my Student visa application.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying.

Was that SELT test used in a *successful* previous UK visa application?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the SELT test was used for my successful Student visa application. I completed my studies in the UK using that visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And just to confirm, was the level of English demonstrated in that test at least a B1 level?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the test I passed was at B1 level.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you *are* eligible! 

Because you previously used a valid B1 SELT for a successful UK visa application (your Student visa), you can re-use it even though it has now expired.



Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding the Skilled Worker visa or any other benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: That's good news! No, I think that covers what I needed to know about using my previous SELT for the Skilled Worker visa application. Thank you for the information.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible to use my expired SELT test because it was previously used for a successful visa application, matching the expected outcome.
