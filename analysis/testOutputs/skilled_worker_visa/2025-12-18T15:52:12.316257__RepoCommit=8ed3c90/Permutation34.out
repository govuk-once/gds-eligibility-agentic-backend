[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Sarah, who owns 100% of Sarah Consulting Ltd and is trying to understand her eligibility for a Skilled Worker visa based on her current pay structure.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility.

To start, could you please tell me, is the company you work for a licensed sponsor with the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. Yes, my company Sarah Consulting Ltd is a licensed sponsor with UKVI. I own the company - I'm actually the director and 100% shareholder. I'm trying to figure out if I can sponsor myself for a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know, thank you. It’s helpful to confirm Sarah Consulting Ltd is a licensed sponsor.

As you mentioned you're the director and 100% shareholder, could you please describe how you currently receive your income from the company? Specifically, how much of your income is paid as a regular salary (PAYE) and how much is paid as dividends?

[evaluation_judge]: I structure my income in a tax-efficient way. I currently pay myself a PAYE salary of £12,570 per year, which is the personal allowance threshold, and then I take £40,000 in dividends. So in total, I receive about £52,570 from the company annually. I was wondering if this income structure would qualify me for a Skilled Worker visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying your income structure, Sarah. That's very helpful.

Just to confirm, the Skilled Worker visa has a minimum salary threshold. Could you confirm the job role you would be sponsored for, and what the going rate is for that role, according to UKVI’s guidance? You can find information on eligible occupations here: https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa#eligible-occupations (although I cannot directly provide you with the going rate).

[evaluation_judge]: I would be sponsored as a Management Consultant, which is an eligible occupation for the Skilled Worker visa. According to the UKVI guidance, the going rate for this role is below my total income - I know the general threshold is £26,200 or £41,700 for businesses like mine, and my total income is well above that at £52,570. I just wasn't sure if the fact that most of my income comes from dividends rather than PAYE salary would affect my eligibility.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Sarah. You're right to consider how the source of your income impacts eligibility.

Given that you are a director and 100% shareholder of Sarah Consulting Ltd, the rules around salary are specific. To clarify, does your company pay you a salary that meets the minimum salary threshold of £41,700 *as a PAYE salary*? Dividends do *not* count towards meeting the salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa in your situation.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, I see. No, my actual PAYE salary is only £12,570. The rest of my income is through dividends (£40,000). So my PAYE salary doesn't meet the £41,700 minimum threshold. I was hoping my total income of £52,570 would count, but it sounds like the dividends won't be considered for the visa requirements.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Sarah. Unfortunately, despite your total income being above the threshold, only your PAYE salary counts towards the £41,700 minimum for someone in your position – as a director and 100% shareholder of the sponsoring company.

Therefore, based on the information you've provided, your application would be **REFUSED** as your current salary structure does not meet the requirements. 

To be eligible, you would need to adjust your pay structure to receive a PAYE salary of at least £41,700, and pay income tax and National Insurance on that full amount.



Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding this?

[evaluation_judge]: That's quite unfortunate, but thank you for explaining it clearly. So if I wanted to qualify, I'd need to restructure my compensation to receive at least £41,700 as PAYE salary instead of taking most of my income as dividends. That would obviously increase my tax and National Insurance contributions significantly. I'll need to consider whether that makes financial sense for me. Thanks for your help in understanding the requirements.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Sarah. I understand it's not the news you were hoping for, but I'm glad I could provide clarity.

You've understood perfectly – restructuring your compensation to a PAYE salary of at least £41,700 is the necessary step to meet the visa requirements, and it would indeed affect your tax and National Insurance contributions.

I'm happy to have helped you understand the requirements so you can make an informed decision. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that as a director and 100% shareholder, I could not count dividends toward the minimum salary threshold for a Skilled Worker visa, and only my PAYE salary of £12,570 would count. The agent accurately concluded my application would be refused since I don't meet the £41,700 minimum salary requirement.
