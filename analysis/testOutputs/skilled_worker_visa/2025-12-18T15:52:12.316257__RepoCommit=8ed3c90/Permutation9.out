[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Miguel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Miguel, nice to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me what type of job you have been offered in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a registered nurse from the Philippines and I've been offered a job as a Band 5 Nurse at an NHS Trust here in the UK. I'm not sure if I qualify for any special visa categories with this role.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Miguel! Being a registered nurse at an NHS Trust is a fantastic starting point.

To clarify, could you please tell me your salary offer for the Band 5 Nurse position? Just the annual salary amount will be perfect.

[evaluation_judge]: My salary offer is £28,407 per year. That's the entry-level rate for a Band 5 nurse in the NHS as I understand it.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Miguel. That salary is very helpful to know.

Just to confirm, is the NHS Trust you've been offered a position with a public authority?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's definitely an NHS Trust, which is a public authority in the UK healthcare system.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thanks for confirming that, Miguel.

Finally, to help me assess your eligibility, could you please confirm that you are applying for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm looking to apply for a Skilled Worker Visa to work in the UK as a nurse.

[root_agent]: Okay Miguel, thank you for providing all of that information.

Based on what you've told me – you are a registered nurse, you have a job offer as a Band 5 Nurse at an NHS Trust (a public authority), and your salary is £28,407 – you **are** eligible for a Health and Care Visa under the Skilled Worker Visa route. 

The National Pay Scale for Band 5 nurses meets the requirements, and your salary matches that band. The usual general salary threshold doesn’t apply in your case.



Does that make sense? Would you like me to explain anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! So I understand that I qualify for a Health and Care Visa even though my salary is below the general threshold because I'm being paid according to the NHS Band 5 pay scale, is that right? Do I need to provide any special documentation to prove this when I apply?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Miguel! That is absolutely correct. You qualify for the Health and Care Visa because your salary aligns with the NHS Band 5 pay scale, meaning the general salary threshold doesn’t apply to you.

Regarding documentation, yes, you will likely need to provide evidence to demonstrate that your salary meets the National Pay Scale. This could include:

*   **Your employment contract:** This should clearly state your salary and job title (Band 5 Nurse).
*   **A letter from your employer (the NHS Trust):** Confirming your salary band and that it aligns with the national pay scales.
*   **Evidence of the NHS pay scales:** While not always essential, having a link to the official NHS pay scales (or a screenshot) can be helpful.

It’s always best to check the most up-to-date guidance on the [gov.uk website](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa) to ensure you have all the required documentation.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am eligible for a Health and Care Visa despite my salary being below the general threshold because it meets the NHS Band 5 pay scale requirements.
