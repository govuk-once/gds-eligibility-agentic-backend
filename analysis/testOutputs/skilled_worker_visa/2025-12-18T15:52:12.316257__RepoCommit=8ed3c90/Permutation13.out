[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Tariq and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Tariq, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you tell me if you've previously held any UK visas? If so, what type of visas were they?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have. I spent 3 years on a PhD Student Visa and then switched to a Graduate Visa, which I've been on for the past 3 years and 6 months now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Tariq. That's helpful. 

Are you currently in the UK, and if so, does your current Graduate Visa allow you to work?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently in the UK on my Graduate Visa which does allow me to work. My Graduate Visa is actually coming to an end soon - that's why I'm looking into my options.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. To assess your options, could you tell me what type of job you have been offered, and what the annual salary for that position is?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Junior Data Analyst with an annual salary of £34,000. The employer is willing to sponsor my visa for 2 years.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tariq. That's very helpful.

Just to clarify, are you aware that the Skilled Worker visa has different salary requirements depending on your experience and whether you qualify as a 'new entrant'? Are you hoping to qualify as a 'new entrant' to meet the salary requirements for this role?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand there are different salary requirements. My employer mentioned that my salary would qualify under the 'new entrant' rate, which I believe is lower than the standard rate. So yes, I'm hoping to qualify as a 'new entrant' since my salary is £34,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Tariq. 

To assess your eligibility for the 'new entrant' salary rate, could you please confirm how much time you’ve spent in the UK on *any* type of visa before starting your current Graduate Visa? Specifically, I need to know about any time spent on a Student Visa, or any other type of visa.

[evaluation_judge]: I spent 3 years in the UK on my PhD Student Visa before switching to my Graduate Visa, which I've now been on for 3 years and 6 months.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Tariq.

Considering you've spent 3 years on a Student Visa and 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa, it appears you may have reached the maximum amount of time allowed under the 'new entrant' rules. These rules generally allow for a maximum of 4 years combined time on a Student Visa, Graduate Visa, or under the 'new entrant' provisions of the Skilled Worker visa.

To be certain, are you aware of any time you may have *previously* held a Skilled Worker visa as a 'new entrant'?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I've never held a Skilled Worker visa before. I've only had the Student Visa for my PhD (3 years) and then my Graduate Visa (3 years and 6 months).

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Tariq.

Based on the information you've provided – 3 years on a Student Visa and 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa – it seems you have exceeded the 4-year limit for utilising the 'new entrant' salary discount.

Therefore, unfortunately, you would not be eligible to apply for a Skilled Worker visa for 2 years relying on the 'new entrant' salary rate of £33,000. To be eligible, your salary would need to meet the standard Skilled Worker visa salary requirements, which are currently higher than £34,000.

Would you like me to provide you with information about the current standard salary requirements for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please tell me what the standard salary requirements would be. I'm a bit confused since I thought time on a Student Visa didn't count toward the 4-year limit, just the Graduate Visa time. But if I'm not eligible for the new entrant rate, what would my options be?

[root_agent]: You are right to question that, Tariq, and apologies for the initial oversight! You are correct that time on a *Student* Visa typically does *not* count towards the 4-year limit. It’s the time on a Graduate Visa, or time spent as a new entrant on a Skilled Worker visa, that counts towards that limit.

With 3 years on a Student Visa and 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa, you have exceeded the 4-year limit.

Regarding the standard salary requirements, as of April 4th, 2024, the general threshold for a Skilled Worker Visa is £38,700 per year. However, there are some exceptions. As a Junior Data Analyst, your occupation code (2117) is on the Immigration Salary List, which means the minimum salary requirement is £33,900. 

However, because you've exceeded the 'new entrant' time limit, your salary of £34,000 *is* above the occupation-specific minimum, but *below* the general threshold. 

Your options are:

1.  **Negotiate a higher salary:** If your employer is willing to increase your salary to at least £38,700, you would meet the general threshold.
2.  **Explore alternative visa routes:** Depending on your circumstances, there may be other visa routes available, although the Skilled Worker visa is usually the most straightforward route for sponsored employment.

Would you like me to provide further detail on either of these options? Or perhaps information on how to confirm the correct occupation code for your role?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent failed to correctly assess my eligibility. They stated that I've exceeded the 4-year limit by having 3 years on a Student Visa and 3.5 years on a Graduate Visa. However, only Graduate Visa time counts toward the 4-year cap, not Student Visa time. With 3.5 years on a Graduate Visa alone, I should be ineligible for the additional 2 years as a New Entrant since that would exceed the 4-year maximum. The agent corrected themselves in the follow-up, but still made a confusing statement about exceeding the 4-year limit with both visas combined.
