[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Wei, a physicist from China looking to understand their eligibility for a work visa in the UK.

Hi, i'm Wei and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Wei, it's lovely to meet you! I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for a UK visa.

To start, could you please tell me, do you have a job offer from a UK employer who is a licensed sponsor?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do have a job offer from a UK university. They have confirmed they are a licensed sponsor. I've been offered a postdoctoral researcher position in physics.

[root_agent]: That's great to hear, Wei! 

Now, is the job offer at a skill level of RQF level 3 or above? (This generally means a degree level qualification or equivalent).

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the position is for a postdoctoral researcher in physics, so it definitely requires a PhD qualification. My occupation code would be 2114 for this position.

[root_agent]: Excellent, that's very helpful. 

Do you meet the English language requirements for the Skilled Worker visa? (e.g., through a recognised test or having a degree taught in English)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I do meet the English language requirements. My PhD was taught in English, so I believe that satisfies the requirements.

[root_agent]: That’s fantastic, Wei! Having a PhD taught in English usually does satisfy the requirements.

Now, considering your role as a Postdoctoral Researcher, is this position specifically within a field of science or higher education that qualifies for a discounted salary threshold?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Physics, I believe this qualifies as a scientific research position. The university has confirmed this falls under occupation code 2114 (Physical Scientists).

[root_agent]: Wonderful. Just to confirm, what is the salary offered to you per year?

[evaluation_judge]: The university has offered me a salary of £33,500 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Wei. And do you know what the standard going rate is for a Physical Scientist (occupation code 2114) in the UK? If not, that’s okay, but it’s helpful information to have.

[evaluation_judge]: I understand that the standard going rate for my role as a Physical Scientist (occupation code 2114) is around £46,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Wei. 

Based on the details you've provided, it appears you *do* meet the requirements for the discounted salary threshold for postdoctoral positions. Your offered salary of £33,500 is above the lower general threshold of £33,400, and it is also above 70% of the going rate of £46,000 (which is £32,200).

Therefore, based on the information available, it looks like you would be **AWARDED** the visa.



Do you have any other questions for me, Wei?

[evaluation_judge]: That's excellent news! I'm glad to hear I would qualify for the visa with this job offer. I don't have any other questions at the moment - this information is very helpful for my planning. Thank you for confirming my eligibility.

✓ The agent provided the correct outcome of AWARDED, accurately explaining that I meet both the lower general threshold (£33,500 > £33,400) and the discounted going rate requirement (£33,500 > £32,200 which is 70% of £46,000). The information was consistent with my scenario as a postdoctoral researcher in physics.
