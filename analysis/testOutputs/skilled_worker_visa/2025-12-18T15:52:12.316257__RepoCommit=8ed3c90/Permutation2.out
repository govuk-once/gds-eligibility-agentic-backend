[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Liam, it's good to speak with you. To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me your age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 23 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks Liam. And could you please tell me what your current visa status is, or how you are currently residing in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently on a Student Visa. I just finished my Bachelor's degree here in the UK. I'm from Canada originally.

[root_agent]: Thanks for that information, Liam. Now, could you please tell me the details of the job you've been offered - specifically, what is the job title?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been offered a position as a Junior Financial Analyst.

[root_agent]: Great, thanks Liam. And what is the salary offered for the Junior Financial Analyst position?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary offered is £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Liam. Finally, do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Junior Financial Analyst role, as determined by the UK government? (Don't worry if you don't know it exactly, an approximate figure is fine).

[evaluation_judge]: I was told that the standard going rate for this role is about £42,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you very much for providing all of that information, Liam. Based on what you’ve told me – your age, your current visa status, the job offer as a Junior Financial Analyst with a salary of £35,000, and the going rate of £42,000 – it appears you **would be eligible** under the Skilled Worker Visa rules as a “New Entrant”. 

Specifically, because you are under 26, recently graduated, and switching from a Student Visa, you meet the criteria to be considered a New Entrant. Your salary meets both the lower general threshold of £33,400 and is above 70% of the going rate (£29,400).



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! So I'll be able to stay and work in the UK after I finish my studies. I assume I'll need to apply for this Skilled Worker Visa before my student visa expires, right? How long would this visa be valid for?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Liam! Yes, that’s correct – you'll need to apply for the Skilled Worker Visa before your Student Visa expires.

As for how long the visa would be valid for, initially it will likely be granted for 3 years. However, because you qualify as a New Entrant, you’ll be subject to the 4-year maximum period that you can spend on this visa route. Time spent on the Skilled Worker Visa as a New Entrant *will* count towards that 4-year limit.

After those initial 3 years, you can apply to extend your visa, and eventually apply for settlement (Indefinite Leave to Remain) if you continue to meet the eligibility requirements. However, remember the 4-year limit applies to New Entrants.

Would you like me to provide information on the application process, or anything else regarding the Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. So I get 3 years initially, but I can only be considered a "New Entrant" for up to 4 years total. After that time, would I need to meet the standard salary requirements instead of the discounted ones if I want to extend my stay?

[root_agent]: That's a very astute question, Liam! You've understood the New Entrant rules perfectly.

Yes, exactly. After you’ve been on the Skilled Worker Visa for a period that, when added to your time as a New Entrant, reaches a total of 4 years, you will no longer be eligible for the discounted salary rates. 

At that point, any extension applications would need to meet the standard salary requirements – currently £38,700, or the going rate for your role, whichever is higher. You would essentially transition out of the "New Entrant" category and be treated as a standard Skilled Worker applicant.



Is there anything else I can clarify for you about this?

[evaluation_judge]: That makes sense. I appreciate how clear you've made this for me. I don't have any other questions right now. Thank you for confirming my eligibility and explaining how the visa timeline works!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Liam! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It's great to hear you feel more confident about your options. 

If you do have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Best of luck with your job and your visa application!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly assessed that I would be eligible for the Skilled Worker visa as a New Entrant, matching the expected outcome. They accurately identified that I qualify as a New Entrant due to being under 26 and a recent graduate, and that my salary of £35,000 meets both the lower general threshold (£33,400) and exceeds 70% of the going rate (£29,400).
