[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Samuel and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Samuel, welcome! I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. 

To start, could you please tell me the occupation code listed on your job offer? You'll find this on the Certificate of Sponsorship.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a care assistant, and my job offer shows the occupation code 6135. I've been offered quite a good salary of £45,000 to work as an in-home private carer for a wealthy family. The recruitment agency that arranged this is handling my visa sponsorship.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Samuel. That's very helpful.

Since your job code is 6135, which is for Care Worker, I need to ask: is the agency sponsoring your visa also registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the recruitment agency isn't CQC registered. They told me they're just an introduction service that matches carers with families. They do have a valid sponsorship license though, which is why they can offer me the visa. They said that since I'll be working directly for the family, they don't need to be CQC registered themselves.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Samuel. I understand the agency is acting as an introduction service and is not CQC registered, and that you will be directly employed by the family.

Given that your role is as a Care Worker (code 6135), and the employer – the family you'll be working for – is not covered by a CQC registration, I'm afraid you would not currently meet the eligibility requirements for the Skilled Worker Visa in this instance.



I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for, and I apologise for that. Would you like me to explain the reasoning in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I'd like to understand why I'm not eligible. The salary is quite good at £45,000, and the agency told me they have a valid sponsorship license. What's the issue with the CQC registration exactly?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Samuel. You are right to point out the good salary and valid sponsorship license – those are important factors generally. However, there's a specific requirement for Care Worker visas (occupation code 6135) to protect individuals in this role.

For a Skilled Worker to be eligible under this code, their employer **must** be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England. This is because the rules are designed to ensure that care workers are employed by organisations that meet specific standards of quality and safety. 

In your case, you'd be working directly for a private family, and the agency is only acting as an introduction service. Because the family isn’t a CQC-registered provider, the requirements aren't met. This is to prevent potential exploitation and ensure a safe working environment for care workers.

Essentially, even with a sponsor license and a high salary, the CQC registration is a non-negotiable requirement for this specific job role when the employer is a private household.



Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. So even though the salary is good and they have a sponsorship license, because I'd be working as a care worker directly for a family that isn't CQC registered, I don't qualify for the visa. I understand that's to protect care workers from exploitation. Thanks for explaining that clearly.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Samuel. I’m glad I could clarify things for you. You've understood the situation perfectly – the high salary and sponsor license aren't enough on their own when the CQC registration is missing for a Care Worker role directly with a private family.

I'm happy to have helped explain the reasoning. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your help in understanding the eligibility requirements.

✓ The agent correctly identified that I would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa as a Care Worker because the employer (recruitment agency) is not CQC registered, which is a specific requirement for this occupation code despite meeting other criteria like salary and sponsorship.
