[evaluation_judge]: Hello, I'm interested in understanding if I'm eligible for a UK work visa based on my situation. I've received a job offer as a Junior Data Analyst with a salary of £34,000. I previously spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa after completing my PhD, and the new job is offering me a 2-year contract.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Tariq. Thank you for reaching out. I understand you’re looking into a UK work visa.

To start, could you please confirm the type of visa you’re currently holding or have held in the past?

[evaluation_judge]: I previously spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate Visa after completing my PhD. That visa has now ended, and I've received this job offer as a Junior Data Analyst with a £34,000 salary for a 2-year contract.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Regarding your Graduate Visa, could you tell me exactly when it was issued and when it ended?

[evaluation_judge]: My Graduate visa was issued right after I completed my PhD, around January 2020, and it ended about 6 months ago in July 2023. I was able to stay on it for 3 years and 6 months because there were some extensions granted during the pandemic period.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Just to confirm, your Graduate visa was issued in January 2020 and ended in July 2023, with extensions granted due to the pandemic, giving you a total of 3 years and 6 months on the visa.

Now, could you tell me what type of degree you obtained during your PhD?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct about my Graduate visa timing.

My PhD was in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science from the University of Manchester. I completed the full doctoral program and received my PhD degree.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tariq. That’s very helpful.

Considering your PhD in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science from the University of Manchester, and the fact that you spent 3 years and 6 months on a Graduate visa, could you please confirm if you’ve ever held any other UK visas before this Graduate visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Before my Graduate visa, I was on a Tier 4/Student visa for about 4 years while completing my PhD. I haven't held any other type of UK visa besides these two.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. So, you spent approximately 4 years on a Tier 4/Student visa before your 3 years and 6 months on the Graduate visa.

Let me just double-check something to ensure I have all the details correct. Regarding the “New Entrant” discount, the criteria states that it's only available for a maximum combined total of 4 years, including time spent on Student/Graduate visas.

Given that you spent 4 years on your Tier 4/Student visa and 3 years and 6 months on your Graduate visa, does that mean you’ve already used all the “New Entrant” time allowance?

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't aware of these specific rules about time limits. I thought I might be eligible for a work visa since my previous visas were for studying and then the post-study work period. My employer suggested they could sponsor me as a "New Entrant" since this would be my first proper job in the UK related to my field of study.

[root_agent]: I understand. It’s good to clarify these rules.

Let’s delve a little deeper. You mentioned your employer suggested you might qualify as a “New Entrant.” To confirm, could you tell me what your current job offer is exactly? Specifically, what is the job title and the salary being offered?

[evaluation_judge]: The job title is Junior Data Analyst at a tech company in Manchester. They've offered me £34,000 per year on a 2-year contract. They mentioned they'd be sponsoring me on a Skilled Worker visa and thought I might qualify for the New Entrant rate since this would be my first full-time professional role in the UK after my studies.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Tariq. So, you’re applying for a Skilled Worker visa, sponsored by your employer, and you’re hoping to qualify for the New Entrant discount due to this being your first full-time professional role in the UK.

Considering the salary of £34,000, which is above the £33,400 floor for the New Entrant discount, and the fact that you’ve spent 4 years on Student/Graduate visas, does it seem like you would have time remaining to qualify for this discount?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure. This is all a bit confusing to me. Are you saying that the time I've already spent on my Student and Graduate visas counts against some kind of limit for the New Entrant discount? I thought since I'm just starting my professional career in the UK, I'd qualify as a new entrant regardless of my previous study time.

[root_agent]: You’re absolutely right to be confused, and it’s a common point of misunderstanding. Yes, the time spent on your previous Student and Graduate visas does count against the 4-year limit for the “New Entrant” discount.

As I explained previously, the “New Entrant” discount is only available for a maximum combined total of 4 years, including time spent on Student/Graduate visas. Given that you spent 4 years on your Tier 4/Student visa and 3 years and 6 months on your Graduate visa, you’ve already utilized that 4-year limit.

Therefore, unfortunately, based on the current criteria, you wouldn’t be eligible for the New Entrant discount.

Would you like me to outline the alternative options available to you for obtaining a UK work visa, such as applying under Option A (full salary) for the Skilled Worker visa?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. Yes, please explain what my alternatives might be. What would I need to qualify under the full salary option? Is my £34,000 offer sufficient for that?

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand your disappointment, Tariq. Let’s explore your alternative options.

Applying under Option A – the full salary – means you’ll need to demonstrate that your salary meets the minimum requirements for a Skilled Worker visa. Currently, the minimum salary threshold is £38,700, but there are exceptions for certain occupations, including data analysis.

Your current offer of £34,000 is *below* this threshold. However, your employer can demonstrate that your role meets the requirements for a ‘going rate’ for Junior Data Analysts in the UK, which could potentially allow you to be sponsored on a lower salary. They’ll need to provide evidence of this ‘going rate’ – typically through a detailed job description and benchmarking data.

To qualify under Option A, your employer would also need to prove to the Home Office that they are a ‘genuine sponsor’ – meaning they have the capacity to comply with all the requirements of the Skilled Worker visa.

Would you like me to elaborate on the specific steps your employer needs to take to demonstrate the ‘going rate’ and establish themselves as a genuine sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain more about the "going rate" and if my £34,000 salary might qualify. I'm worried that if the New Entrant discount doesn't work for me, I might not be able to take this job at all. What exactly would my employer need to do to help me qualify?

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s clarify the "going rate" requirement. It’s designed to ensure that sponsored workers are paid fairly and don’t depress wages in the UK labour market.

Essentially, your employer needs to demonstrate that £34,000 is a realistic and appropriate salary for a Junior Data Analyst role with your skills and experience in Manchester. They can do this through a few key methods:

*   **Benchmarking Data:** They'll likely use salary surveys and data from reputable sources (like Payscale, Glassdoor, or industry-specific reports) to show that the average salary for a Junior Data Analyst in Manchester falls around or above £34,000.
*   **Detailed Job Description:** A very detailed job description outlining your responsibilities, required skills, and experience level is crucial.
*   **Supporting Documentation:** They might provide evidence of the company's financial stability and their ability to meet the salary requirements.

Now, regarding your concern – whether £34,000 might qualify, it’s a challenging situation. It’s *below* the standard £38,700 threshold. However, there are a few potential avenues:

1.  **Occupation Exception:** Data analysis is consistently listed as an occupation that can qualify for a lower salary under the Skilled Worker visa. Your employer will need to explicitly argue that your role as a Junior Data Analyst falls within this exception.

2.  **Sponsor’s Financial Capacity:** The Home Office will assess the employer’s ability to meet their sponsorship obligations. A smaller, newer company might have a slightly better chance if they can demonstrate sufficient financial resources.

3.  **Salary Review:** Your employer might be willing to agree to a salary review after a probationary period (typically 6-12 months) to bring you closer to the £38,700 threshold.

To help your employer with this process, could you provide me with a detailed description of your job responsibilities, the technologies you’ll be using, and your key skills? Knowing this will enable me to provide more targeted information on how to approach this challenge. Would you like to start by describing your primary duties as a Junior Data Analyst?

[evaluation_judge]: My role as a Junior Data Analyst would involve:

- Analyzing large datasets using Python and SQL
- Creating data visualization dashboards with Tableau
- Supporting the senior team with reporting and insights
- Helping maintain our data warehouse
- Performing statistical analysis on customer behavior data

I'll be using my PhD knowledge in machine learning algorithms, though at a more practical business level rather than academic research. The company is a mid-sized tech firm that's been operating for about 8 years with around 120 employees.

Is there any way to argue that my PhD qualifications make me eligible for some kind of exception, or does the time limit on the New Entrant discount apply regardless of my qualifications?
