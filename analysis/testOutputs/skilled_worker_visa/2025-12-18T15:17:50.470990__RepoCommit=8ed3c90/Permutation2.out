[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Liam, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand your eligibility, could you please tell me your age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 23 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And could you please tell me what your current visa status is, or how you are currently residing in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently on a Student Visa. I just finished my Bachelor's degree here in the UK. I'm from Canada originally.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify, was your Bachelor's degree taught in English?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my degree was taught in English.

[root_agent]: Great. Do you have a job offer with a licensed sponsor?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a job offer as a Junior Financial Analyst with a licensed sponsor.

[root_agent]: Excellent. What is the annual salary offered for the Junior Financial Analyst position?

[evaluation_judge]: The salary offered is £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Do you know what the 'going rate' is for a Junior Financial Analyst in your location? (This is the typical salary for the role). If not, that's okay, but it would be helpful to know.

[evaluation_judge]: I believe the standard going rate for this role is £42,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Finally, is this your first time applying for a Skilled Worker Visa, or have you held one previously?

[evaluation_judge]: This is my first time applying for a Skilled Worker Visa. I've only been on a Student Visa so far.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for answering all of my questions, Liam. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you **are eligible** for a Skilled Worker Visa as a New Entrant. 

You are under 26, recently completed a degree which was taught in English, and have a job offer from a licensed sponsor. Your offered salary of £35,000 meets both the £33,400 lower general threshold *and* is above 70% of the going rate of £42,000. 

Please note that time spent on this visa will count towards the 4-year maximum allowed for New Entrants.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That sounds great news! Just to understand better, what does the 4-year maximum for New Entrants mean? Will I need to do something different after that period?

[root_agent]: That's a good question! The 4-year maximum for New Entrants means you can benefit from the reduced salary requirements (like the 70% going rate and £33,400 threshold) for a maximum of 4 years in total on the Skilled Worker Visa route. 

After those 4 years have passed, you'll need to meet the standard Skilled Worker Visa salary requirements – currently £38,700 (general threshold) or the full going rate for your role – to continue being sponsored. You would essentially transition out of being considered a "New Entrant" at that point.

Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So after 4 years, I'll need to be earning at least £38,700 or the full going rate for my role (whichever is higher) to stay on the Skilled Worker Visa. That's really helpful to know for my future planning. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly!

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Liam! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. It’s smart to be planning ahead. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Best of luck with your Skilled Worker Visa application and your new role as a Junior Financial Analyst!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa as a New Entrant. They accurately explained that I meet all requirements: I'm under 26, recently graduated with a UK degree taught in English, have a job offer from a licensed sponsor, and my salary of £35,000 exceeds both the lower threshold (£33,400) and 70% of the going rate (£29,400). They also correctly mentioned the 4-year maximum period for New Entrants.
