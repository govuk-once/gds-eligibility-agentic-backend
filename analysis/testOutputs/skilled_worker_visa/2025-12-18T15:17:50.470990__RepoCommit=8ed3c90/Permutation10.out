[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Samuel, a care assistant from Ghana, looking for information about visa eligibility for a job offer in the UK.

Hi, i'm Samuel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Samuel, it's lovely to meet you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for different benefits. 

To start, could you tell me what kind of job you have been offered in the UK? Just the job title will be fine for now.





[evaluation_judge]: I have a job offer as a care assistant in the UK. It's with a private family, but I'll be hired through a recruitment agency. They're offering me a really good salary, which is why I'm interested.

[root_agent]: That's good to hear the salary is attractive, Samuel. To clarify, is the job title specifically listed as a 'Care Worker' (SOC code 6135) or 'Senior Care Worker' (SOC code 6136) on your job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's listed as a Care Worker with SOC code 6135 on my job offer. The recruitment agency mentioned this specifically in the paperwork they sent me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Samuel. My next question is: is the recruitment agency that is hiring you registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the recruitment agency isn't registered with the CQC. They explained that they just act as an introduction service between me and the private family I'll be working for. They handle the visa sponsorship since they have a license, but they're not CQC registered as they don't provide care services directly.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so clear, Samuel. Based on the information you've provided, I'm afraid you would not be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa under the specific rules for Care Workers. 

Because your job is as a Care Worker (SOC code 6135), the employer – in this case, the agency facilitating your employment with the private family – *must* be registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England. As the agency is not CQC registered, you do not meet this requirement.



I understand this may be disappointing news, and I apologise for that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing news. I thought since they were offering me such a good salary at £45,000 and they have a sponsorship license, everything would be fine. Are you sure there's no way around this requirement? The family I'd be working for is quite wealthy and the working conditions would be good.

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Samuel, and it's perfectly reasonable to think a good salary and sponsorship license would be enough. However, the CQC registration requirement for Care Worker visas is in place to protect individuals in care roles and ensure quality standards are met. It's not something that can be bypassed, even with a generous salary or good working conditions.

The rules specifically state the *employer* must be registered with the CQC. The fact that the family is wealthy doesn’t change this requirement. The agency acting as an introduction service, even with a sponsorship license, doesn’t fulfill the CQC registration criteria.

I wish I had better news for you. Would you like me to reiterate any part of the eligibility criteria, or would you like to discuss other potential visa routes (although I believe this specific job likely won’t fit any others)?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. Thank you for explaining that to me. I didn't realize the CQC requirement was so strict. No, I don't think I need any other information right now. I'll have to go back to the agency and let them know about this issue. I appreciate your help in clarifying this for me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Samuel. I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you, even if it wasn’t the news you were hoping for. 

It’s always best to be fully informed. I wish you the best of luck in discussing this with the agency and in your job search. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out.



Have a good day, Samuel.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you. Have a good day as well.

✓ The agent correctly identified that I would be refused a visa because the employer (recruitment agency) is not CQC registered, which is a mandatory requirement for Care Worker visas, despite meeting other criteria like having a valid sponsor and sufficient salary.
