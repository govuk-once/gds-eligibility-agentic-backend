[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Liam and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Liam, thanks for reaching out. To start, could you please confirm if there is a valid sponsor associated with your job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my employer is a valid sponsor. I'm a recent graduate from Canada but I completed my Bachelor's degree here in the UK. I'm 23 years old and just got a job offer as a Junior Financial Analyst with a salary of £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that your employer is a valid sponsor. And you mentioned you're 23 years old. To help me understand your situation further, could you tell me what your degree is in?

[evaluation_judge]: I have a Bachelor's degree in Finance that I just completed here in the UK. I was on a Student Visa during my studies, which I've just finished recently.

[root_agent]: That’s great to hear. Now, let’s talk about the job offer itself. Could you please tell me what the standard going rate is for a Junior Financial Analyst role in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: The standard going rate for my role as a Junior Financial Analyst is £42,000 per year. My offered salary is £35,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, are you under 26 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm 23 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, Liam. And to confirm, you’re transitioning from a Student Visa to this new role, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm transitioning from my Student Visa now that I've graduated to start this new job as a Junior Financial Analyst.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Finally, could you confirm whether you meet the English language requirements for this role? (e.g., did your degree at the University here in the UK teach in English?)

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my degree was taught in English at the university here in the UK, so I meet the English language requirements.

[root_agent]: Okay, Liam. Thank you for providing all of this information. Let me just quickly review everything to assess your eligibility.

...

Based on the information you’ve given me, it appears you *do* qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa as a New Entrant. Specifically, you meet the criteria of being under 26, a recent graduate, and your salary of £35,000 is above the lower general threshold of £33,400 and also exceeds 70% of the standard going rate of £42,000 (£29,400).

**AWARDED.**

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa as a New Entrant, as I am under 26, transitioning from a Student Visa, and my salary of £35,000 exceeds both the lower general threshold (£33,400) and 70% of the going rate (£29,400).
