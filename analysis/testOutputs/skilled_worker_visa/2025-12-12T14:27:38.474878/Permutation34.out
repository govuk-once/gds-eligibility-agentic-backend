[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Sarah who owns a company and is seeking information about visa sponsorship eligibility.

Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your company? Specifically, are you a director of the company?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I own 100% of my company "Sarah Consulting Ltd" - it's a UK registered business that I set up a few years ago. I'm the sole director of the company.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. And to confirm, you are the sole director and own 100% of “Sarah Consulting Ltd”? Just to be absolutely clear.

[evaluation_judge]: That's correct. I'm the sole director and I own 100% of Sarah Consulting Ltd.

[root_agent]: Alright. And could you tell me what your salary and any dividends you receive from the company are?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, I've structured my pay in what I thought was a tax-efficient way. I take a salary of £12,570 per year, which is the personal allowance amount, and then I take £40,000 in dividends. So in total, my income is £52,570 annually.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details, Sarah. Just to confirm, the £12,570 is a salary paid through PAYE, and the £40,000 is a dividend payment, correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, exactly. The £12,570 is my PAYE salary, and the £40,000 comes as dividend payments. I structured it this way for tax purposes.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Let’s delve a little deeper into the dividend aspect. Could you tell me, are the dividends paid to you as a director and shareholder, or are they paid to a separate entity?

[evaluation_judge]: The dividends are paid to me directly as the shareholder of the company. Since I own 100% of the shares, I receive all the dividends that the company pays out.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sarah. That’s helpful to know. Now, regarding the Skilled Worker Visa, the rules state that if you’re a majority shareholder or director, you need to demonstrate a qualifying salary paid through PAYE. Considering your current income structure – a salary of £12,570 and £40,000 in dividends – would you say that your total income meets the requirements for a Skilled Worker Visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, my total income is £52,570, which I thought would be enough since it's over the £41,700 threshold I heard about. Is that not the case? Do they look at my total income differently because I'm the director?

[root_agent]: You’re right to question that, Sarah. It’s a common misunderstanding. The Skilled Worker Visa criteria specifically states that only the PAYE salary counts towards the threshold. Dividends do not.

So, to be clear, based on your salary of £12,570 and your dividend income of £40,000, your total income of £52,570 doesn't meet the requirements.

Therefore, I have to inform you that based on the current Skilled Worker Visa criteria, you would not be eligible. Would you like me to explain why this is the case in more detail, or would you like me to explore if there are any other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So even though my total income is over the threshold, because most of it is dividends and not PAYE salary, I don't qualify. That's disappointing to hear. Could you explain a bit more about why dividends don't count toward the threshold? And what would I need to do to qualify?

[root_agent]: I understand your disappointment, Sarah. Let’s break down why dividends aren’t counted. The Skilled Worker Visa is designed to ensure sponsored workers are genuinely contributing to the UK economy through a regular, earned salary. Dividends are generally considered a return of profit, not a regular salary. 

The official guidance states: "Dividends do not count towards the qualifying salary threshold.” The aim is to ensure the salary reflects the value of your work within the company, not just a distribution of profits.

To qualify for the Skilled Worker Visa, you would need to demonstrate a minimum qualifying salary of £41,700 paid through PAYE. This would likely involve increasing your salary to meet that threshold, or exploring alternative salary structures.

Would you like me to provide some examples of how you could increase your salary through PAYE, or would you like to discuss alternative visa options that might be suitable for your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave incorrect guidance. While they correctly stated that dividends don't count toward the qualifying salary threshold (only PAYE salary does), they initially stated that I "would say that your total income meets the requirements" when asking about my understanding, which could be misleading. They later provided the correct information that I would not qualify with my current structure, but this inconsistency in messaging could cause confusion.
