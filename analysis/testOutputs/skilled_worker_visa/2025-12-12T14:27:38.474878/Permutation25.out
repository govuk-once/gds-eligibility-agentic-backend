[evaluation_judge]: I'll take on the role of Michael, a Jamaican national, and engage with the agent to determine my eligibility for a benefit related to English language requirements.

Hi, i'm Michael and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Michael, it’s nice to meet you. To help me understand your situation, could you tell me a little bit about where you’re from?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm from Jamaica. I'm looking to move to the UK for a job as a Youth Worker and was wondering about the English language requirements for my visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And just to confirm, you’re a national of Jamaica?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm a Jamaican national. I have my Jamaican passport for identification.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Michael. I see you’ve provided your Jamaican passport. Now, could you tell me if you’ve taken any kind of Secure English Language Test (SELT) as part of your application process?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't taken any English language tests. I was wondering if I need to since I'm from Jamaica where English is the main language.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re a Jamaican national and haven’t taken a SELT – it appears you might be exempt from the English language requirement. Would you be able to tell me if you have a degree that was taught in English?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have a degree taught in English. I just have my Jamaican nationality and passport. Is that enough for the exemption?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s absolutely correct. Jamaica is listed as a majority English-speaking country by the Home Office. Therefore, your nationality alone is sufficient to waive the requirement for a Secure English Language Test for your Skilled Worker Visa application.

**AWARDED.** You meet the English requirement automatically via nationality.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I meet the English language requirement through my Jamaican nationality, without needing to take a SELT. This matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
