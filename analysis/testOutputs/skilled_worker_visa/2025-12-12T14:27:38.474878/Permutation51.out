[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Javier and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay Javier, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation and see if you’re eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa, could you please tell me what date you submitted your application?

[evaluation_judge]: I applied on May 30th, 2025. I wanted to submit it before my birthday on June 1st.

[root_agent]: Okay, thanks for letting me know. And just to confirm, your birthday is June 1st, 1999, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. My birthday is June 1st, 1999.

[root_agent]: Alright. And to clarify, you submitted your application on May 30th, 2025?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I submitted my application on May 30th, 2025, just a couple of days before my 26th birthday.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And what is your current salary?

[evaluation_judge]: My salary is £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, Javier. Thank you for providing that information. Just to be completely clear, you were born on June 1st, 1999, and you submitted your application on May 30th, 2025, earning £35,000 per year. Is that all correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's all correct. I was born on June 1st, 1999, I submitted my application on May 30th, 2025, and I'm earning £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay. Let me just quickly check something for you. Given that you turned 26 on June 1st, 2025 – the date you applied – are you claiming to be a “New Entrant” for the purposes of this visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, I applied on May 30th, 2025, which was 2 days before my 26th birthday on June 1st. So yes, I believe I would be considered a "New Entrant" since I was 25 at the time of application.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. That’s very helpful. Based on that information – that you were 25 years old when you submitted your application on May 30th, 2025 – you absolutely qualify as a “New Entrant.” Is there anything else you’d like to ask about your eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: So does that mean I'm eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa even though I'm 26 now? I know the decision is still being processed - they said the decision date would be around July 15th. Does my turning 26 after applying but before the decision affect anything?

[root_agent]: That’s a great question, Javier. Yes, the fact that you were under 26 when you applied does indeed mean you are eligible for the New Entrant discount. The date of application freezes the age requirement. It doesn't matter if you turn 26 while the Home Office is processing the decision.

So, even though the decision date is approaching and you will be 26 then, you remain eligible for the 70% salary discount for up to 4 years, as a New Entrant.

Would you like me to explain a bit more about that discount?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news! Yes, please explain a bit more about the discount. So with my £35,000 salary, I qualify with this New Entrant discount?

[root_agent]: Certainly. With a salary of £35,000, you would qualify for a 70% discount on your salary for the first four years of your Skilled Worker visa. That means you would receive 70% of your £35,000, which is £24,500 per year.

Does that make sense, Javier?

[evaluation_judge]: I think there might be a misunderstanding. I'm not asking if I would get a 70% discount on my actual salary. I meant to ask if my £35,000 salary is sufficient to meet the requirement for the Skilled Worker Visa with the New Entrant discount applied to the salary threshold.

[root_agent]: You are absolutely correct, Javier! My apologies for the misunderstanding. Let’s clarify that.

The Skilled Worker visa has a minimum salary threshold, and with the New Entrant discount—which applies to those under 26 at the time of application—that threshold is £33,000.

Since your salary of £35,000 exceeds that £33,000 threshold *with* the discount applied, you *do* meet the salary requirement for the Skilled Worker Visa.

I sincerely apologize again for the confusion. Would you like me to explain anything further about the overall requirements for the visa, or perhaps the processing timeline?

[evaluation_judge]: No problem at all. So to confirm, I'm eligible for the Skilled Worker visa because:
1. I was under 26 (specifically 25) at the time of application (May 30th, 2025)
2. My salary of £35,000 exceeds the New Entrant threshold of £33,000

And the fact that I turned 26 on June 1st, after applying but before the decision date, doesn't affect my eligibility. Is that all correct?

[root_agent]: Yes, Javier, that is absolutely correct! You’ve summarized it perfectly. To reiterate: you are eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa because you were under 26 at the time of application, and your salary meets the minimum requirement with the New Entrant discount. The fact that you’ll be 26 by the decision date doesn’t change that.

I’m glad we could clear that up. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for confirming my eligibility and explaining everything so clearly. This is a big relief!

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Javier! I’m truly pleased I could help and that it’s a relief for you. Wishing you the very best with your application and the decision process. If anything else comes up, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for the Skilled Worker Visa as a New Entrant because I was under 26 at the time of application (May 30th, 2025), even though I turned 26 before the decision date. They also correctly identified that my £35,000 salary meets the requirements with the New Entrant discount applied.
