[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Pavel from Poland who's trying to understand his eligibility for a UK visa using a Certificate of Sponsorship provided by his employer. I'll interact naturally until the agent provides an eligibility outcome, then evaluate if their response aligns with the expected outcome.

Hi, i'm Pavel and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Pavel, it’s nice to speak with you. To help me understand your situation and see if you might be eligible for a Skilled Worker Visa, could you tell me where you are currently located?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently in Warsaw, Poland. I've been offered a job as a mechanic at a garage in the UK, and they've already given me a Certificate of Sponsorship number to use for my visa application.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel. Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, you’re currently in Warsaw, Poland, and you’ve received a Certificate of Sponsorship number from the UK garage where you’ve been offered a job as a mechanic.

Could you tell me what salary you’ll be earning as a mechanic in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'll be earning £28,000 per year at the garage. They seem like a good company - they've already sorted out my Certificate of Sponsorship so I can apply right away. They mentioned they had some spare allocations they could use.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Pavel. That’s very helpful. Now, regarding the Certificate of Sponsorship, could you tell me whether you are currently in the UK, or are you applying for the visa from outside the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm applying from outside the UK. I've never been to the UK before actually. I'm currently in Warsaw where I work as a mechanic, but I'm looking forward to moving to the UK for this new job opportunity. The garage has already given me the Certificate of Sponsorship number so I can start my application.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel. Thank you for clarifying that you’re applying from outside the UK. This is important. Given that you are applying from outside the UK, the garage has provided you with an “Undefined” Certificate of Sponsorship. 

Just to confirm, are you aware that an “Undefined” Certificate of Sponsorship cannot be used for entry clearance applications from outside the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware of that at all. The garage just told me they had some spare allocations and gave me the Certificate of Sponsorship number to use for my application. They didn't mention anything about different types of certificates or that there might be a problem because I'm applying from outside the UK. What does this mean for my application?

[root_agent]: I understand, Pavel. It sounds like there might be an issue with the Certificate of Sponsorship you’ve been provided. 

Because you are applying for the visa from outside the UK, the UK garage *must* apply for and assign a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship. An “Undefined” CoS is only for applicants who are already in the UK.

Therefore, based on this information, I’m afraid your application will likely be refused or rejected as invalid. The Home Office will require a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship to process your entry clearance application.

Do you want me to explain a little more about why the “Defined” CoS is necessary?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, I'd like to understand more about why there's a difference and what I need to do now. I'm quite concerned because I thought everything was already arranged properly.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Pavel. Let me explain. The “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship is essentially a guarantee from the UK employer that they are willing and able to sponsor you for the Skilled Worker visa. It’s a more formal and robust assurance.

With an “Undefined” Certificate of Sponsorship, the garage is essentially saying they *intend* to sponsor you, but haven't formally committed to it with the Home Office. It’s used for people already in the UK. For applicants applying from outside the UK, the Home Office needs to be certain the employer is serious and prepared to sponsor you long-term. That's why they require a "Defined” CoS, which demonstrates that commitment.

Essentially, you need the garage to apply for a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship specifically for you. They’ll need to provide evidence of your salary and the job role to support this application.

Would you like me to outline the steps the garage needs to take to obtain a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please tell me what steps the garage needs to take. I'll need to contact them about this right away. I'm a bit frustrated they didn't know about this requirement - it seems like they've given me the wrong type of certificate.

[root_agent]: Okay, Pavel. Let’s go through the steps the garage needs to take to obtain a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship. They’ll need to:

1.  **Complete the online Skilled Worker Sponsor Licence application:** They need to apply for a licence to sponsor workers on the Skilled Worker visa. This can be done on the GOV.UK website.

2.  **Create a CoS:** Once licensed, they’ll need to create a CoS for you. This involves providing details about your job role, salary, and your personal details.

3.  **Submit the application to the Home Office:** They’ll then submit the CoS application to the Home Office.

4.  **Receive the Defined CoS:** Once approved, the Home Office will issue a “Defined” Certificate of Sponsorship.

It’s understandable that you're frustrated – it’s good to know this now. The garage should have been aware of this requirement when offering you the job. 

Would you like me to provide a link to the GOV.UK page where they can begin the online application for a sponsor licence? [https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa)

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave incorrect information by saying the garage needs to apply for a sponsor license. Since they already have "undefined CoS allocations," they clearly already have a sponsor license. The agent should have explained that the garage simply needs to apply for a defined CoS for me specifically, not go through the entire license application process. This is a significant error that could cause unnecessary delay and confusion.
