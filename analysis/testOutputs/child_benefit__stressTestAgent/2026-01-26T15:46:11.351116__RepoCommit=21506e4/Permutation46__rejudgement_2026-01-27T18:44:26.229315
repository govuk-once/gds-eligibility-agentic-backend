2026-01-27T18:46:47.009143 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent provided incorrect information. According to the expected outcome, the user is "Not Eligible (Expired)" due to being a jobseeker with pre-settled status for more than 91 days (95 days) without a job offer. The agent incorrectly stated that the 91-day jobseeker time limit doesn't apply to Child Benefit.
