2026-01-26T16:02:26.998254 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:02:30.370877 [actor]: I should role-play as a user who just had a baby 4 months ago but forgot to apply for Child Benefit until now. I need to find out if I can get the benefit backdated for those 4 months.

I'll respond to the agent's question about having responsibility for a child.

Hi there. Yes, my partner and I have a 4-month-old baby. We've been so busy with the new arrival that we completely forgot to apply for Child Benefit until now. I'm worried we might have lost out on some money for these past few months. Can we still claim for the time since our baby was born?

2026-01-26T16:02:33.922818 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Congratulations on your new baby! I understand you're concerned about potentially missing out on Child Benefit payments for the past 4 months.

I'm pleased to tell you that Child Benefit can be backdated for up to 3 months from when your claim is received. Since your baby is 4 months old, you would be able to claim from when your application is processed and get it backdated for 3 of those 4 months. You won't be able to claim for the entire 4-month period since birth, but you can receive most of it.

Let me continue with a few more eligibility questions to make sure you qualify.

Do you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T16:02:35.696885 [actor]: That's good to know about the backdating, even if we'll miss out on one month. 

No, neither of us earns over £60,000 per year. Both of us work, but our individual incomes are well below that amount.

2026-01-26T16:02:38.167839 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's good news regarding your eligibility. Since neither you nor your partner earns over £60,000 per year, you won't have to pay the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge. 

If either of you had earned between £50,000 and £60,000 annually, there would be a partial tax charge, but since you're both below that threshold, you should receive the full Child Benefit amount.

Next question: Do you and your baby live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:02:39.209448 [actor]: Yes, we do live in the UK. We've been living here for several years now, and our baby was born here at the local hospital.

2026-01-26T16:02:40.706063 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you and your baby live in the UK. That's another important eligibility requirement for Child Benefit.

Next question: Is your baby a British citizen, or do they have the right to live in the UK (for example, through settled or pre-settled status)?

2026-01-26T16:02:41.892333 [actor]: Yes, our baby is a British citizen. They were born here in the UK, and both my partner and I are British citizens as well.

2026-01-26T16:02:43.477939 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your baby is a British citizen. That's excellent for your eligibility.

Next question: Is your baby living with you and your partner? (I understand this is likely the case, but I need to confirm for eligibility purposes.)

2026-01-26T16:02:45.405760 [actor]: Yes, of course, our baby lives with us. We're the primary caregivers and our baby has been living with us since birth.

2026-01-26T16:02:49.530706 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your baby lives with you. That's exactly what I would expect, but it's important to verify for the eligibility assessment.

Based on all the information you've provided, I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit. To summarize:

- You have a child under 16 (a 4-month-old baby)
- Neither you nor your partner earns over £60,000 annually
- You and your baby live in the UK
- Your baby is a British citizen
- Your baby lives with you as the primary caregivers

You should apply as soon as possible. When you do, you'll be able to get your claim backdated for up to 3 months, meaning you'll only miss out on 1 month of payments since your baby was born 4 months ago.

You can apply online or by post using form CH2, which you can download from the GOV.UK website or order by phone. Would you like more information about how to apply?

2026-01-26T16:02:51.863754 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that we're eligible for Child Benefit. It's a relief to know we'll only miss out on one month of payments rather than all four. We'll definitely apply as soon as possible.

I think we have all the information we need now to go ahead with the application. Thanks for your help!

2026-01-26T16:02:54.422363 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility and correctly explained that claims can be backdated up to 3 months, meaning the user would only miss 1 month of payments for their 4-month-old baby.
