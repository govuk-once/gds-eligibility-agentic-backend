2026-01-26T16:05:55.172384 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:05:56.112597 [actor]: I do have a child, yes. I have a 5-year-old daughter who lives with me.

2026-01-26T16:05:57.434613 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know that you have a 5-year-old daughter who lives with you.

Do you normally live in the UK? (This includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland)

2026-01-26T16:05:58.419709 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I have pre-settled status since I moved here from Germany last year.

2026-01-26T16:06:00.359693 [root_agent]: I understand that you live in the UK with pre-settled status since moving from Germany last year.

Are you subject to immigration control or do you have any restrictions on your right to be in the UK? Having pre-settled status is important information, but I need to understand if there are any specific restrictions on your stay.

2026-01-26T16:06:01.956419 [actor]: I have pre-settled status, so I don't think I have restrictions. I've been looking for work for the past 3 months though - about 95 days now. I was told I might need to be working to keep my benefits.

2026-01-26T16:06:04.432027 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Having pre-settled status is relevant to your eligibility.

For Child Benefit specifically, people with pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme are generally eligible as long as they're "habitually resident" in the UK, which you appear to be since you live here with your daughter.

The fact that you're currently looking for work doesn't necessarily affect your Child Benefit eligibility, though it might impact other benefits. Child Benefit is not contingent on employment status.

May I ask if anyone else is claiming Child Benefit for your daughter already? For example, another parent or guardian?

2026-01-26T16:06:06.580615 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for my daughter. It's just me taking care of her. I was just concerned because someone mentioned that as a jobseeker with pre-settled status, there might be a time limit on my right to reside for benefit purposes. I've been unemployed and looking for work for about 95 days now, and I don't have a job offer yet.

2026-01-26T16:06:10.958483 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. I understand your concern about the time limit for jobseekers with pre-settled status.

You're right that there are some restrictions for certain benefits when you have pre-settled status and are a jobseeker. However, Child Benefit has different rules than some other benefits.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have a 5-year-old daughter who lives with you
- You live in the UK with pre-settled status
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

It appears you would be eligible for Child Benefit. The "right to reside" time limits that apply to some benefits like Universal Credit for jobseekers with pre-settled status don't apply in the same way to Child Benefit.

Do you have any income over £50,000 per year? This would affect whether you might have to pay a tax charge on the Child Benefit (though you'd still be eligible to claim it).

2026-01-26T16:06:13.210476 [actor]: No, I don't have income anywhere near £50,000. I've been unemployed for the past three months and have been using my savings to get by. So my income is definitely below that threshold.

I'm glad to hear that the jobseeker time limits don't affect Child Benefit. I was worried because I heard there was a 91-day limit for jobseekers with pre-settled status for some benefits, and I've been looking for work for about 95 days now.

2026-01-26T16:06:16.556283 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared with me:

Good news - you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Since your income is well below £50,000, you wouldn't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge either.

You're correct that some benefits do have time limits for jobseekers with pre-settled status, but Child Benefit specifically doesn't have the same 91-day restriction that applies to some other benefits. Child Benefit is primarily concerned with your responsibility for a child who lives with you, which you have confirmed.

Since you have a 5-year-old daughter living with you in the UK, you have pre-settled status, and no one else is claiming for her, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T16:06:18.507352 [actor]: Yes, I would like information about how to apply for Child Benefit. I'm relieved to hear that I am eligible despite being unemployed for more than 91 days with pre-settled status. This will really help with my daughter's expenses while I continue my job search.

2026-01-26T16:06:21.322877 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that someone with pre-settled status who has been jobseeking for more than 91 days remains eligible for Child Benefit, as this benefit doesn't have the same right to reside restrictions as some other benefits.
