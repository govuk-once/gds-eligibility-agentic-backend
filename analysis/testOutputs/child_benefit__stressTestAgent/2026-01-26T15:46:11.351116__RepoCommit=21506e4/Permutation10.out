2026-01-26T15:49:34.704648 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:49:36.002609 [actor]: Hello there. Yes, I'm responsible for a 12-year-old boy named Liam who lives with me. I'm his foster parent.

2026-01-26T15:49:38.085192 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Being a foster parent is an important factor in determining Child Benefit eligibility.

Next question: Is Liam being looked after by a local council or local authority?

2026-01-26T15:49:39.312156 [actor]: Yes, Liam has been placed with me by the local authority. I'm his foster parent through the council's fostering program.

2026-01-26T15:49:44.089508 [root_agent]: I understand that Liam has been placed with you by the local authority through their fostering program.

Based on the information you've provided, you would not typically be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam. This is because Child Benefit is generally not payable for children who are looked after by a local council or local authority.

As a foster parent receiving placements through the local authority's fostering program, you would typically receive foster care allowances from the council instead of Child Benefit. These allowances are designed to cover the costs of caring for Liam.

The local authority remains responsible for Liam's care, even though he lives with you day-to-day, which is why Child Benefit isn't typically available in this situation.

If your circumstances change in the future, such as if you were to adopt Liam or if he were to leave local authority care, then your eligibility for Child Benefit might change.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation or any other aspects of Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:49:46.938200 [actor]: I see, so I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because Liam is under the care of the local authority and I receive foster care allowances instead. That makes sense. The council does pay me a fostering allowance that covers his accommodation and maintenance. Thank you for explaining this clearly. I don't have any other questions about Child Benefit at the moment.

2026-01-26T15:49:49.289782 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that foster parents caring for children placed by a local authority are not eligible for Child Benefit as they receive foster care allowances instead.
