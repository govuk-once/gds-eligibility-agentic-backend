The agent initially provided incorrect information by stating the mother would be eligible for Child Benefit despite Liam receiving Universal Credit, but upon being challenged, the agent correctly identified that when a child receives Universal Credit in their own right, the parent becomes ineligible for Child Benefit, which matches the expected "Not Eligible" outcome.
