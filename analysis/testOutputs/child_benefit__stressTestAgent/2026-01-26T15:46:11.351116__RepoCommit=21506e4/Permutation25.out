2026-01-26T15:56:28.947735 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:56:29.863062 [actor]: Yes, I have a 5-year-old son named Leo.

2026-01-26T15:56:31.048479 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please tell me if you live in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:56:31.955374 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK with my husband.

2026-01-26T15:56:32.908984 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. To further assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, does your son Leo normally live with you?

2026-01-26T15:56:34.534330 [actor]: Actually, Leo has been in local authority care for about 10 weeks now. I don't have any income myself to contribute to his upkeep, but my husband (Leo's stepfather) sends £30 per week to the carer for Leo's needs.

2026-01-26T15:56:36.931717 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this may be a sensitive situation.

Since Leo is currently in local authority care, this affects your Child Benefit eligibility. When a child is in care for 8 weeks or more, Child Benefit usually stops. However, there are some exceptions.

Given that your husband is contributing £30 per week towards Leo's maintenance, this could potentially affect the situation. 

May I ask if you're currently receiving Child Benefit for Leo, or are you looking to make a new claim?

2026-01-26T15:56:39.246307 [actor]: I was receiving Child Benefit for Leo before he went into care, but I'm worried about whether I'm still eligible now that he's been in care for over 8 weeks. I just want to understand if I can still receive it given our current situation.

2026-01-26T15:56:43.296308 [root_agent]: I understand your concern. Based on the information you've provided:

Since Leo has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks (10 weeks now), Child Benefit payments would typically stop. The general rule is that Child Benefit stops when a child has been in care for 8 weeks or more.

The regular contributions your husband is making (£30 per week) are relevant, but for Child Benefit to continue, you would need to be contributing at least the weekly rate of Child Benefit toward Leo's maintenance. As of my knowledge, this is more than the £30 currently being contributed.

You should notify the Child Benefit Office about Leo's change in circumstances if you haven't already done so. They can provide specific guidance for your situation and confirm when payments should stop.

If Leo returns to live with you in the future, you can reclaim Child Benefit at that time.

Would you like me to explain anything else about this situation?

2026-01-26T15:56:45.252585 [actor]: I'm a bit confused. I thought that since my husband is contributing to Leo's care, that would count for my eligibility. Since we're married and living together, doesn't his contribution count as mine? The £30 he sends each week - is that not enough to maintain my eligibility?

2026-01-26T15:56:50.192494 [root_agent]: I understand your confusion, and that's a very reasonable question.

When assessing Child Benefit eligibility for a child in care, the rules look at contributions toward the child's maintenance. While you and your husband are a family unit for many purposes, for Child Benefit specifically, the rules focus on whether the person claiming Child Benefit (you in this case) is contributing at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount toward the child's maintenance.

The current weekly Child Benefit rate for an eldest or only child is £25.60 (as of my knowledge), so the £30 your husband contributes weekly does exceed this amount. However, for maintaining eligibility, the guidance indicates that this contribution should be coming from the Child Benefit claimant.

That said, this is a nuanced situation, and the Child Benefit Office can provide the most definitive answer for your specific circumstances. I would recommend contacting them directly to explain your situation, including the fact that your husband is making regular contributions while you're not earning income yourself.

They may consider your family circumstances holistically, especially given that you're married and the contributions are coming from your household.

2026-01-26T15:56:52.840585 [actor]: I think there might be some misunderstanding. From what I understand, my husband's contribution should count as mine since we're married and living together. The government website mentions that a partner's money counts as the claimant's contribution if they're married or civil partners and living together.

So given that my husband is contributing £30 weekly, which is more than the Child Benefit amount, shouldn't I still be eligible even though Leo has been in care for 10 weeks?

2026-01-26T15:56:56.516062 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the misunderstanding. Thank you for providing that clarification.

Yes, for Child Benefit purposes, your husband's contributions can count as yours since you are married and living together. Since your husband is contributing £30 per week, which exceeds the Child Benefit rate (£25.60 for the eldest or only child), you should remain eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit payments even though Leo has been in care for more than 8 weeks.

The key requirement is that you (or in this case, your household through your husband) are contributing at least the weekly rate of Child Benefit toward Leo's maintenance, which you are doing.

You should make sure the Child Benefit Office is aware of your current situation and the contributions being made, but based on what you've shared, you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I apologize for my earlier confusion.

2026-01-26T15:56:58.829411 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that. I'm relieved to know that I'm still eligible for Child Benefit since my husband is contributing £30 weekly toward Leo's care. I'll make sure to keep the Child Benefit Office updated about our situation. This clarification has been really helpful.

2026-01-26T15:57:01.462615 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent ultimately provided the correct information that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit because their husband's contribution of £30 weekly (which exceeds the Child Benefit rate) counts as the claimant's contribution since they're married and living together.
