2026-01-27T18:46:27.545854 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that a person needs to be at least 16 to claim Child Benefit. According to the scenario, a person under 16 CAN claim for their own child, though it's usually not financially optimal. The agent gave erroneous information by stating there are "no exceptions" to the age requirement.
