2026-01-26T16:03:14.776582 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. To do this accurately, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First question: Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:03:16.179168 [actor]: Yes, I have a 15-year-old son named Simon. He's been detained under the Mental Health Act and is currently in a secure psychiatric unit. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-26T16:03:18.174902 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I understand that your 15-year-old son Simon is currently in a secure psychiatric unit under the Mental Health Act.

For children in hospital or residential care, the rules for Child Benefit depend on specific circumstances.

Since Simon is being detained under the Mental Health Act, could you please tell me if he was receiving Child Benefit before he entered the psychiatric unit?

2026-01-26T16:03:19.568883 [actor]: Yes, I was receiving Child Benefit for Simon before he was admitted to the psychiatric unit. I've been quite worried about whether this would affect his benefits since he's been away for 10 weeks now.

2026-01-26T16:03:22.357137 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your concern about Simon's Child Benefit while he's in the psychiatric unit.

Based on UK government rules, if your child is in hospital or residential care and you were already receiving Child Benefit for them, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for a limited period.

Since Simon is in a psychiatric unit after being detained under the Mental Health Act, and it's been about 10 weeks, you should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit. You can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks while your child is in residential care or hospital.

May I ask if you're still paying for any of Simon's needs or costs while he's in the psychiatric unit?

2026-01-26T16:03:24.317940 [actor]: Yes, I still provide for some of Simon's personal needs. I buy him clothes, personal items, and some snacks that he likes. I also keep his bedroom at home ready for when he comes back. I visit him regularly and bring him things he needs. It's been difficult, but we're hoping he'll be able to come home soon.

2026-01-26T16:03:28.992858 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I appreciate that you're continuing to provide for Simon's personal needs while he's in the psychiatric unit, and maintaining his home environment for when he returns.

Based on the information you've provided:

1. Your son Simon is 15 years old
2. He has been in a psychiatric unit for approximately 10 weeks after being detained under the Mental Health Act
3. You were receiving Child Benefit for him before his admission
4. You continue to provide for his personal needs and maintain his home

You remain eligible for Child Benefit in this situation. The UK government allows Child Benefit to continue for up to 12 weeks when a child is in hospital or residential care. Since Simon has been in the unit for about 10 weeks, you are still within this timeframe.

If Simon's stay extends beyond 12 weeks, you may still be eligible if you're continuing to spend a similar amount on his needs as you were before his admission, which appears to be the case based on what you've shared.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility in this situation?

2026-01-26T16:03:31.264515 [actor]: No, that's all the information I needed. Thank you for confirming that I'm still eligible for Child Benefit while Simon is in the psychiatric unit, at least for the 12-week period. It's a relief to know that I can continue receiving this support while he's getting the help he needs. I appreciate your clear explanation of the rules.

2026-01-26T16:03:33.808046 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can continue for up to 12 weeks while a child is in hospital or residential care, and correctly assessed that the parent remains eligible since the child has only been in the psychiatric unit for 10 weeks.
