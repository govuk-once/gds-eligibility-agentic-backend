2026-01-26T15:48:29.704445 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:48:31.537648 [actor]: I'm David, a single father to my 14-year-old son Jack. My son was placed in local authority care about 3 months ago, but he still comes home to stay with me every weekend - he arrives Friday evening and leaves Sunday evening. I'm wondering if I can still get Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-26T15:48:33.537161 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context, David. I understand you're asking about Child Benefit for your 14-year-old son Jack who is in local authority care but stays with you on weekends.

When a child goes into local authority care, this can affect Child Benefit entitlement. Let me ask: Does the local authority pay you an allowance for looking after Jack during the weekends?

2026-01-26T15:48:34.972183 [actor]: No, the local authority doesn't pay me any allowance for looking after Jack during the weekends. I take care of all his expenses when he's with me from Friday evening to Sunday evening each weekend.

2026-01-26T15:48:38.426555 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, David. 

When a child goes into care, Child Benefit usually stops if they're expected to be there for more than 8 weeks. However, there are special rules that may apply in your situation.

Since Jack regularly comes home to stay with you every weekend (Friday evening to Sunday evening), and you're not receiving any allowance from the local authority for these periods, you might be eligible for what's called "weekly Child Benefit."

Weekly Child Benefit can be paid for the weeks when your child regularly spends at least 24 hours with you. In your case, since Jack stays with you from Friday evening to Sunday evening (which is more than 24 hours each weekend), you may qualify.

May I ask, have you been receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into care, or is this a new application?

2026-01-26T15:48:39.923723 [actor]: Yes, I was receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into care. The payments stopped after he had been in care for 8 weeks. I wasn't sure if I could still claim anything since he comes home regularly.

2026-01-26T15:48:44.951234 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification, David. 

Based on the information you've provided, you should be eligible for weekly Child Benefit payments for the weeks when Jack stays with you for at least 24 hours. Since he regularly stays with you from Friday evening to Sunday evening each weekend (which is more than 24 hours), you would qualify for these weekly payments.

Since your Child Benefit has already stopped after Jack was in care for 8 weeks, you'll need to contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them about this regular weekend arrangement. You should explain that Jack comes home every weekend for more than 24 hours, and that you don't receive any allowance from the local authority for these periods.

You'll need to request that they reinstate your Child Benefit on a weekly basis for the weeks when Jack stays with you. The Child Benefit Office may require confirmation from the local authority about these regular weekend visits.

Would you like me to provide information on how to contact the Child Benefit Office to arrange this?

2026-01-26T15:48:47.348778 [actor]: Yes, that would be helpful. So just to confirm, I am eligible for weekly Child Benefit payments because Jack stays with me for two nights every weekend? That's good news - I wasn't sure if I'd get anything since he's technically in care. I'd appreciate the contact information for the Child Benefit Office so I can get this sorted out.

2026-01-26T15:48:51.919884 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that a parent whose child is in local authority care but regularly stays with them for at least 24 hours each week can claim weekly Child Benefit payments.
