The correct outcome should be "Eligible (via Exception)" because Jack spends 2 nights in a row at home, which is the specific exception that applies here. The agent incorrectly focused on the "24 hours a week" part rather than the "2 nights in a row" exception, which is the actual reason David qualifies.
