2026-01-27T18:47:03.440369 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed to identify the exception that Martin could request an unequal split of his contribution, allocating £26.05 to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry, which would make Ben eligible for full rate benefit while Jerry would be ineligible. The expected outcome was "Eligible for Ben (Full Rate), Not Eligible for Jerry" but this wasn't addressed at all.
