2026-01-26T15:46:13.328856 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:46:14.527509 [actor]: Yes, I have responsibility for my son Leo. He's 8 years old and lives with me and my husband Tom. He's in primary school.

2026-01-26T15:46:16.277093 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have responsibility for your 8-year-old son Leo who lives with you and attends primary school.

Is your son Leo normally living with you in the UK? By this, I mean is your home his main residence?

2026-01-26T15:46:17.240239 [actor]: Yes, Leo lives with us full-time at our home in Manchester. This is definitely his main residence.

2026-01-26T15:46:18.433544 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you or your husband subject to immigration control or have any restrictions on your residency status in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:46:19.450095 [actor]: No, neither of us has any immigration restrictions. We're both UK nationals living in Manchester.

2026-01-26T15:46:20.625643 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does either you or your husband have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:46:21.794279 [actor]: No, neither of us earns that much. Tom works as a teacher earning £35,000 a year, and I work part-time earning £15,000.

2026-01-26T15:46:26.462917 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. 

Based on what you've told me, it appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have responsibility for Leo, who is 8 years old and in primary school (under 16)
2. Leo lives with you full-time in the UK
3. Neither you nor your husband is subject to immigration control
4. Both of your individual incomes are below the £60,000 threshold (meaning you would receive the full amount without the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

You can claim Child Benefit for Leo. The current rates are £25.60 per week for your first child and £16.95 per week for any additional children.

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:46:29.376170 [actor]: That's great news! Thank you for confirming we're eligible for Child Benefit for Leo. We'll look into filling out that CH2 form online. Just to clarify, since Leo is our only child, we would receive the £25.60 per week rate, correct? 

I don't have any other questions right now. This has been very helpful.

2026-01-26T15:46:32.023664 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the family is eligible for Child Benefit, as they have responsibility for an 8-year-old child living with them in the UK, neither parent is subject to immigration control, and their income is below the threshold.
