2026-01-26T15:56:07.301827 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T15:56:08.354088 [actor]: Hello, yes, I do have a child. My son Tom is 14 years old.

2026-01-26T15:56:09.434431 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask: Is your son Tom living with you?

2026-01-26T15:56:10.863622 [actor]: Well, not at the moment. Tom has severe behavioral needs and has recently moved into a residential school. The local council is paying for it, and he's been there for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-26T15:56:12.860818 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand Tom is currently at a residential school funded by the local council. 

To help determine your Child Benefit eligibility in this situation, may I ask: How often does Tom come home to stay with you? For example, does he return on weekends, holidays, or other regular periods?

2026-01-26T15:56:14.197724 [actor]: He comes home most weekends and during school holidays. The residential placement is primarily for his educational needs and managing his behavioral issues during the week, but I'm still his main carer when he's not at school.

2026-01-26T15:56:16.804860 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. Since Tom comes home most weekends and during school holidays, and you're still his main carer when he's not at school, you would typically still be eligible for Child Benefit.

When a child is in residential education funded by a local authority but regularly returns home to stay with you (as Tom does on weekends and holidays), you can generally continue to receive Child Benefit. This is because you're still considered to be responsible for Tom even though he spends weekdays at the residential school.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility in this situation?

2026-01-26T15:56:18.944382 [actor]: That's great news! I was worried I might lose the Child Benefit since he's been at the residential school. So even though it's been 10 weeks already, I can continue to receive the benefit? Does it matter how long he stays at the residential school as long as he keeps coming home on weekends and holidays?

2026-01-26T15:56:22.866769 [root_agent]: I'm glad I could help clarify this for you. Yes, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for Tom despite him being at the residential school for 10 weeks already, as long as he continues to come home regularly on weekends and holidays.

The duration of his stay at the residential school doesn't affect your eligibility as long as:
1. He continues to return home regularly (as he does on weekends and holidays)
2. You remain responsible for him during these periods
3. The placement is primarily for educational purposes (which it is in your case)

Your situation falls under the rules for children in residential accommodation for educational or medical needs. Since the local authority is paying for his education and care at the residential school, but he regularly returns to your home, you remain eligible for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-26T15:56:25.190483 [actor]: That's really helpful information, thank you. I'm relieved to know I can keep receiving the Child Benefit. I've been told that if his situation changes in the future, I should notify the Child Benefit office, is that right? I don't have any other questions about my eligibility right now.

2026-01-26T15:56:27.315429 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly explained that Child Benefit can continue when a child is in residential education but regularly returns home on weekends and holidays, as the parent remains responsible for the child.
