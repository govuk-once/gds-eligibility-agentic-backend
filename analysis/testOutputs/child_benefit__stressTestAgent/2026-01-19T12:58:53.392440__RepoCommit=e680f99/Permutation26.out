2026-01-19T13:09:52.307328 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you several questions to understand your situation.

First, are you responsible for raising a child under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:09:54.008156 [actor]: I need to roleplay as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the instructions to be obtuse, answer indirectly, and speak as if entering search terms.

son zahid 15 lives aunt

2026-01-19T13:09:55.809604 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing some information. I understand your son Zahid is 15 years old and lives with his aunt.

To determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand your relationship and responsibility for Zahid. Do you contribute to Zahid's upbringing financially or otherwise, even though he lives with his aunt?

2026-01-19T13:09:56.545832 [actor]: send money weekly zahid aunt £15

2026-01-19T13:09:58.351914 [root_agent]: I understand you send £15 weekly to Zahid's aunt to help support him. 

Thank you for sharing this information. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand who has the main responsibility for Zahid's day-to-day care. Would you say Zahid's aunt has the primary responsibility for looking after him on a day-to-day basis?

2026-01-19T13:09:59.327183 [actor]: aunt takes care yes mum sends money too £15 weekly

2026-01-19T13:10:01.805580 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that Zahid's aunt takes care of him day-to-day, and both you and Zahid's mother send money to support him.

In this situation, since Zahid lives with his aunt who has the primary responsibility for his day-to-day care, she would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for him, rather than you.

However, I have a few more questions to fully assess the situation. Is there any formal arrangement in place regarding Zahid living with his aunt? For example, is there a legal guardianship or fostering arrangement?

2026-01-19T13:10:02.759567 [actor]: no official paper grandmother sends money not mother me father

2026-01-19T13:10:06.969826 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that you are Zahid's father, there is no official legal arrangement, and both you and Zahid's grandmother send money to support him while he lives with his aunt.

Based on the information you've provided, since Zahid primarily lives with his aunt who has day-to-day responsibility for him, she would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for him.

In situations where a child lives with someone else, the UK government typically pays Child Benefit to the person who has primary responsibility for the child. Since there's no formal legal arrangement and Zahid's aunt is providing the day-to-day care, she would generally be considered the appropriate person to claim.

If you'd like to discuss your specific situation further or explore any potential exceptions, you may want to contact the Child Benefit Office directly for personalized guidance.

Would you like me to provide information about any other aspects of Child Benefit that might be relevant to your situation?

2026-01-19T13:10:08.142392 [actor]: aunt not claiming can I claim paying weekly support

2026-01-19T13:10:13.212862 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important information. If Zahid's aunt is not claiming Child Benefit for him, and you are providing regular financial support, you may potentially be eligible to claim.

According to the UK government guidelines, Child Benefit can be paid to someone who's responsible for a child, even if they're not the parent, as long as they contribute to the cost of providing for the child at least equal to the weekly rate of Child Benefit.

Since you're providing regular weekly financial support of £15, you might be eligible to claim. However, there are a few considerations:

1. The Child Benefit Office typically considers who has the main responsibility for the child
2. They may take into account the overall arrangement and who provides the day-to-day care
3. Only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child

To make a claim in this situation, you would need to apply for Child Benefit and explain your circumstances. The Child Benefit Office would then assess your claim, potentially considering factors like:
- Your regular financial contributions
- Your involvement in Zahid's life
- The fact that no one else is currently claiming

Would you like to know how to proceed with making a claim?

2026-01-19T13:10:14.399441 [actor]: how much child benefit need contribute grandmother me together send £30

2026-01-19T13:10:19.447522 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You and the grandmother together send £30 to support Zahid.

To be eligible for Child Benefit, you generally need to contribute at least an amount equivalent to the weekly Child Benefit rate. The current standard weekly Child Benefit rates (as of my last update) are:

- £24.00 for the eldest or only child
- £15.90 for each additional child

Since you and the grandmother together contribute £30 weekly, which exceeds the standard rate for Child Benefit, the contribution amount would be sufficient. However, only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child. So either you or Zahid's grandmother could potentially claim, but not both.

The decision about who should claim would typically depend on who is considered to have more responsibility for the child. Since you're Zahid's father and are contributing financially, you may have a basis to claim, especially if the aunt isn't claiming.

To proceed with a claim, you would need to complete a Child Benefit claim form (CH2) and include an explanation of your circumstances, detailing your financial contributions and relationship with Zahid.

Would you like me to explain more about the claim process?

2026-01-19T13:10:21.269685 [actor]: So I can claim child benefit for Zahid because our combined contributions are enough?

2026-01-19T13:10:24.881784 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent provided incorrect information by stating the father could potentially claim Child Benefit when eligibility requires the child to live with the claimant or the claimant to be considered responsible for the child's day-to-day care, which is not the case here as Zahid lives with his aunt who provides primary care.
