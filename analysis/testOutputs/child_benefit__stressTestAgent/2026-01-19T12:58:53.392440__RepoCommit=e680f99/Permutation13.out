2026-01-19T13:04:48.320482 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

Maya 4 fostering adoption placement

2026-01-19T13:04:51.017815 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit for Maya who is in a fostering or adoption placement. Let me ask questions one at a time to understand your situation better.

Are you fostering Maya or is this an adoption placement?

2026-01-19T13:04:51.919810 [actor]: adoption placement with us not final yet

2026-01-19T13:04:53.302653 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand Maya is in an adoption placement with you that hasn't been finalized yet.

Have you been officially approved as an adoptive parent for Maya by a local authority or adoption agency?

2026-01-19T13:04:54.222158 [actor]: approved adopters Maya living with us now

2026-01-19T13:04:55.865280 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're approved adopters and Maya is now living with you.

For Child Benefit purposes, I need to understand how long Maya has been living with you in this adoption placement. Has she been living with you for more than 8 weeks?

2026-01-19T13:04:56.624862 [actor]: moved in last month

2026-01-19T13:04:59.770842 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Maya moved in last month, so that's less than 8 weeks ago.

Based on the information you've provided, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Maya even though the adoption isn't finalized yet. As approved adopters with the child living with you in a placement for adoption, you can claim Child Benefit.

However, since Maya has been with you for less than 8 weeks, I should mention that the previous benefit claimant (if there was one) might still be receiving payments during this transition period. Child Benefit can only be paid to one person for a child.

Would you like me to explain how to make a claim for Child Benefit for Maya?

2026-01-19T13:05:00.525280 [actor]: Yes eligible?

2026-01-19T13:05:04.829766 [root_agent]: I need to think carefully about this eligibility question for Child Benefit in an adoption placement situation.

Based on the UK government's rules for Child Benefit eligibility:

1. You're approved adopters
2. Maya (age 4) is living with you in an adoption placement
3. The adoption isn't yet finalized
4. Maya moved in last month (less than 8 weeks ago)

Yes, you are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Maya. When a child is placed with you for adoption, you can claim Child Benefit even before the adoption is finalized, as long as you're responsible for the child and they're living with you.

You don't need to wait for the 8-week period to claim - this is just a transition period where the previous claimant (if there was one) might still be receiving payments. You can make your claim right away, but payments might take into account any overlap period.

Would you like me to explain how you can apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T13:05:08.559938 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that approved adopters with a child placed for adoption are eligible for Child Benefit even before the adoption is finalized.
