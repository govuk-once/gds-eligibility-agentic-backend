2026-01-19T13:08:52.047354 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine whether you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:08:52.952051 [actor]: residential school Tom 14 years old

2026-01-19T13:08:54.086156 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. To clarify, are you responsible for a 14-year-old named Tom who attends a residential school?

2026-01-19T13:08:54.898668 [actor]: yes council pays residential school behavioral needs

2026-01-19T13:08:56.231494 [root_agent]: I understand. Thank you for that information. Is Tom living at the residential school for his education, but you still have parental responsibility for him?

2026-01-19T13:08:57.105907 [actor]: yes son moved there 10 weeks ago behavioral issues

2026-01-19T13:08:59.106700 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. Since Tom has been living at the residential school for 10 weeks due to behavioral needs, I need to understand a bit more about your situation.

Do you regularly pay towards Tom's maintenance or care costs, even though the council is paying for the residential school?

2026-01-19T13:09:00.017043 [actor]: council pays everything local authority funding

2026-01-19T13:09:01.373174 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Since the local authority is funding everything for Tom's care at the residential school, I need to ask: Do you have any other children living with you that you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T13:09:02.394707 [actor]: no just Tom son only child

2026-01-19T13:09:06.616815 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Based on the information you've provided, I need to consider your Child Benefit eligibility carefully.

Since Tom is living in residential education paid for entirely by the local authority (council) and has been there for 10 weeks, this affects your eligibility for Child Benefit.

When a child is being looked after by a local authority and the local authority is paying for their accommodation or maintenance, Child Benefit is typically not payable to the parent. The rules state that if the child has been in residential care for more than 8 weeks with full local authority funding, Child Benefit payments would generally stop.

However, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit if Tom regularly returns home to stay with you for periods of time (such as weekends, holidays). Does Tom come home to stay with you on a regular basis?

2026-01-19T13:09:07.731652 [actor]: school is for education not care or fostering he has accommodation there for school

2026-01-19T13:09:10.184031 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important clarification. I need to understand this situation better.

If Tom is at a residential school primarily for educational purposes rather than being in care, and you still maintain parental responsibility, then the situation is different from what I initially understood.

To clarify: Even though Tom lives at the school during term time, do you remain fully responsible for him? For example, does he return home to you during school holidays and some weekends?

2026-01-19T13:09:11.224245 [actor]: yes still my son stays at school weekdays comes home some weekends holidays

2026-01-19T13:09:15.599912 [root_agent]: I understand now. Thank you for explaining the situation more clearly.

Based on what you've shared, you are likely still eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. Tom is your child and you maintain parental responsibility for him
2. He comes home to you on some weekends and during holidays
3. The residential school is primarily for educational purposes, not care
4. You remain responsible for Tom even though he stays at the school on weekdays

Since Tom is still considered to be living with you (even though he's temporarily away at school), and you remain responsible for him, you should be eligible for Child Benefit.

The key distinction here is that Tom is at a residential school for educational purposes, not because he's being "looked after" by the local authority in a care arrangement, even though the council is funding his education.

Would you like me to explain how to claim or maintain your Child Benefit in this situation?

2026-01-19T13:09:19.412649 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly recognized that the child is at residential school primarily for education (not care), the parent maintains responsibility, and the child returns home regularly, which means the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit.
