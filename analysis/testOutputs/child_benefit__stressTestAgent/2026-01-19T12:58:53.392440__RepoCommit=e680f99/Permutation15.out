2026-01-19T13:05:32.473173 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To provide you with the correct information, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:05:33.310380 [actor]: Child benefit daughter Emma twelve lives with mother

2026-01-19T13:05:34.899050 [root_agent]: I'll help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit based on your situation.

Since you've mentioned that your 12-year-old daughter Emma lives with her mother rather than with you, I need to ask: Do you contribute financially to Emma's upbringing?

2026-01-19T13:05:35.855091 [actor]: Send birthday present money for food £10 week

2026-01-19T13:05:37.566158 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

I need to understand if you have any form of shared caring responsibility for Emma. Based on the UK government rules, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with.

Do you have any formal or informal arrangement with Emma's mother regarding shared care or parental responsibility?

2026-01-19T13:05:38.691868 [actor]: No agreement pay money weekly for food Emma's mother doesn't claim benefit

2026-01-19T13:05:40.758663 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, I need to understand your situation more clearly. You mentioned that Emma lives with her mother, you send birthday presents and contribute £10 weekly for food, and Emma's mother doesn't claim Child Benefit.

Do you have any form of parental responsibility for Emma, either through a legal arrangement or informal agreement?

2026-01-19T13:05:41.654668 [actor]: Father of Emma give money every week

2026-01-19T13:05:43.615223 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you are Emma's father and you provide money for her every week.

To understand your situation better: How often does Emma stay with you, if at all? For example, does she visit on weekends, holidays, or other regular arrangements?

2026-01-19T13:05:44.472007 [actor]: Emma visits holidays sometimes not regular arrangement

2026-01-19T13:05:46.263747 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, I need to understand one more aspect of your situation. Since Emma lives with her mother but her mother isn't claiming Child Benefit, and you have some involvement in Emma's life by providing financial support and seeing her during some holidays:

Are you considering claiming Child Benefit for Emma yourself?

2026-01-19T13:05:47.252248 [actor]: Yes want claim child benefit for Emma

2026-01-19T13:05:51.354242 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you want to claim Child Benefit for Emma.

Based on the UK government guidelines, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with. Since Emma primarily lives with her mother, you would generally not be eligible to claim Child Benefit as the non-resident parent.

For you to claim Child Benefit, one of the following would typically need to apply:
1. Emma would need to live with you for an equal or greater amount of time than with her mother
2. You would need to have a formal agreement where you have equal or primary responsibility for Emma

Since Emma only visits you occasionally during holidays and primarily lives with her mother, it appears you wouldn't be eligible to claim Child Benefit yourself. The mother would be the eligible person to claim, even though she currently doesn't.

If you believe your circumstances are special, you could contact the Child Benefit Office directly to discuss your specific situation.

2026-01-19T13:05:54.091528 [actor]: I understand. Based on the information I've learned, I won't be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma since she lives primarily with her mother and I only contribute £10 per week (which is less than the required Child Benefit payment amount of £26.05/week to be considered "responsible" when the child doesn't live with you). Thank you for explaining this to me.

2026-01-19T13:05:56.730344 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with (Emma's mother), and that the father would not be eligible as he doesn't have equal or primary care responsibility.
