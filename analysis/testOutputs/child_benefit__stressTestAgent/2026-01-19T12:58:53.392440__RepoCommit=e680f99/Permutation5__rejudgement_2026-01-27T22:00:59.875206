According to gov.uk guidance, someone who doesn't live with the child can claim Child Benefit if they contribute financially to the upkeep of the child at least equal to the Child Benefit amount and no one else is claiming. Since Mark contributes £150 monthly (exceeding the £113 Child Benefit) and the ex-wife isn't claiming, he is indeed eligible.
