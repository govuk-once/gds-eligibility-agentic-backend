2026-01-19T13:11:17.790543 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First question: Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T13:11:18.611898 [actor]: child benefit for my daughter

2026-01-19T13:11:19.826761 [root_agent]: I see that you're asking about Child Benefit for your daughter. To continue assessing your eligibility, could you please confirm your daughter's age?

2026-01-19T13:11:20.551251 [actor]: She's 7 years old

2026-01-19T13:11:21.716708 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Is your daughter living with you? Or do you pay an equivalent amount to the Child Benefit rate toward their upbringing?

2026-01-19T13:11:22.629371 [actor]: yes she lives with us

2026-01-19T13:11:23.633468 [root_agent]: Thank you. Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-19T13:11:24.411550 [actor]: my wife earns money not me

2026-01-19T13:11:25.723858 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To properly assess your eligibility, I need to know about your wife's income specifically. Does your wife's individual income exceed £50,000 per year?

2026-01-19T13:11:26.632766 [actor]: 65 thousand pounds

2026-01-19T13:11:31.100111 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Based on what you've shared:

Your wife's income is £65,000 per year, which is above the £50,000 threshold for Child Benefit. This means you can still claim Child Benefit, but you'll be affected by what's called the "High Income Child Benefit Charge" (HICBC).

Here's what this means:
- You can still claim Child Benefit for your 7-year-old daughter
- Since your wife's income is between £50,000 and £60,000, she'll need to pay back some of the Child Benefit through the tax system
- With an income of £65,000, your wife would need to pay back the full amount of Child Benefit through a self-assessment tax return

You have two options:
1. Claim Child Benefit and pay the tax charge through self-assessment
2. Choose not to receive the payments (but still fill in the claim form to help protect your State Pension)

Would you like me to explain more about either of these options?

2026-01-19T13:11:32.344974 [actor]: so my wife pays tax and I get the money

2026-01-19T13:11:37.075416 [root_agent]: I understand your question about how the Child Benefit payment works when the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies. Let me clarify:

Yes, that's essentially correct. The Child Benefit would be paid to you as the claimant (typically the person who applies and has the child living with them), but your wife would need to pay the tax charge through self-assessment because her income is above the threshold.

Since her income is £65,000, she would effectively need to pay back 100% of the Child Benefit received through her taxes. This means that while you would receive the payments, your household would ultimately return the full amount through your wife's tax.

Some families in your situation choose to claim but opt out of receiving payments to avoid the administrative burden of paying it back through tax. However, filling in the claim form even if you opt out of payments helps protect your National Insurance credits, which can be important for your State Pension.

Would you like to know more about the National Insurance credits benefit or how to make a claim?

2026-01-19T13:11:40.943580 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the family can claim Child Benefit for their 7-year-old daughter who lives with them, but would be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge since the wife earns £65,000, which would require repaying the full amount through self-assessment.
