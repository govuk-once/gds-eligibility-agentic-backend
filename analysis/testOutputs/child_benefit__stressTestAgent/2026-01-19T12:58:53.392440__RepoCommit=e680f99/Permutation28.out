2026-01-19T13:10:44.121620 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T13:10:47.424203 [root_agent]: I notice there's some confusion here. Let me clarify that I'm here to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK rules based on your specific situation.

To continue our assessment, may I ask: Are you currently living in the UK with your child, or are you just visiting temporarily?

2026-01-19T13:10:51.029433 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're visiting the UK for 6 months with your son.

To be eligible for Child Benefit in the UK, you generally need to be "living in" the UK, which typically means you have your permanent home in the UK. A 6-month visit would usually be considered temporary and not establish you as normally living in the UK.

Additionally, eligibility usually requires that you have the right to reside in the UK, which depends on your immigration status.

May I ask what your immigration status is in the UK for this 6-month visit?

2026-01-19T13:10:55.999453 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Based on what you've shared:

You're visiting the UK on a tourist visa for 6 months with your 5-year-old American son.

I can now determine that you would not be eligible for UK Child Benefit. Child Benefit eligibility requires that:

1. You're "living in" the UK (not just visiting temporarily)
2. You have the right to reside in the UK (a tourist visa doesn't meet this requirement)
3. You're responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training)

While you do have a child under 16, as a tourist visiting temporarily, you don't meet the residency requirements for Child Benefit. Child Benefit is designed for those who have established their home in the UK, not for visitors or tourists.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about UK benefits or services during your visit?

2026-01-19T13:10:59.686348 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that tourist visitors on temporary stays are not eligible for UK Child Benefit as they don't meet the "living in" requirement or have the right to reside in the UK.
