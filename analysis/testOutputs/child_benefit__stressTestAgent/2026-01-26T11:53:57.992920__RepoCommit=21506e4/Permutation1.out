2026-01-26T11:54:00.261975 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time to understand your situation better.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T11:54:01.355300 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Leo who is 8 years old. He's currently in primary school.

2026-01-26T11:54:02.884228 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your 8-year-old son Leo who's in primary school. 

To continue determining your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask: Does Leo live with you permanently or at least for part of the time?

2026-01-26T11:54:04.513152 [actor]: Yes, Leo lives with me and my husband Tom permanently in our home in Manchester.

2026-01-26T11:54:06.319254 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know that Leo lives with you and your husband permanently.

Next question: Are you or your husband responsible for looking after Leo? By this I mean providing for his day-to-day care and supporting him financially.

2026-01-26T11:54:07.483866 [actor]: Yes, my husband Tom and I are both responsible for Leo. We care for him day-to-day and support him financially. Tom works as a teacher and I work part-time.

2026-01-26T11:54:08.821334 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know that both you and Tom are responsible for Leo's care.

My next question is: Are you and your husband both UK residents for tax purposes?

2026-01-26T11:54:09.821667 [actor]: Yes, we're both UK nationals and live permanently in Manchester. We've been living here for many years.

2026-01-26T11:54:11.233625 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you and your husband are UK residents.

Next question: Is either you or your husband's individual income over £60,000 per year before tax?

2026-01-26T11:54:12.475331 [actor]: No, neither of us earns that much. Tom earns £35,000 a year as a teacher, and I earn £15,000 from my part-time job.

2026-01-26T11:54:16.439271 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your household income.

Based on all the information you've provided, you are eligible for Child Benefit for your son Leo. You meet the key criteria:

1. You have a child under 16 (Leo is 8)
2. Leo lives with you permanently
3. You and your husband are responsible for Leo's care
4. You are both UK residents
5. Neither of you has an individual income over £60,000 per year (which would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

Since your individual incomes are below £60,000, you would receive the full Child Benefit amount without any tax charge. Currently, the rate is £25.60 per week for your first or only child.

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to fill out the CH2 claim form, which you can get online from the GOV.UK website or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T11:54:19.411189 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for Child Benefit for Leo. That's really helpful to know we can receive £25.60 per week. I appreciate you explaining all the eligibility criteria we meet and confirming we won't face any tax charges since our incomes are below the threshold. I'll look into getting the CH2 claim form from the GOV.UK website to start my application. This information has been really helpful, thank you.

2026-01-26T11:54:22.209428 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility requirements and correctly determined that the person would qualify based on having an 8-year-old child who lives with them, both parents being UK residents with incomes below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
