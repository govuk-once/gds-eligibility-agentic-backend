2026-01-26T12:15:28.695025 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T12:15:30.126336 [actor]: I need to play the role of a person seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. Let me respond to the agent's question.

Yes, I am responsible for raising my daughter Fiona. She's 16 and lives with me in Edinburgh.

2026-01-26T12:15:31.431926 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. 

Is your daughter Fiona in approved education or training? For Child Benefit purposes, approved education generally includes things like school, college courses, or certain training programs.

2026-01-26T12:15:32.590958 [actor]: Yes, Fiona has left school and recently joined the "No One Left Behind" programme in Scotland. She's training there now.

2026-01-26T12:15:35.368502 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Just to be clear, is the "No One Left Behind" programme a type of approved training or education? Specifically, does it count as one of the following:
- A-levels or Scottish Highers
- NVQs up to level 3
- Home education (if it started before your child turned 16)
- Traineeships in England
- Foundation Apprenticeships or Traineeships in Wales
- Other approved training or education programs

2026-01-26T12:15:37.057913 [actor]: Yes, it's a Scottish government approved training program specifically designed for young people who have left school. The "No One Left Behind" programme is aimed at helping young people like Fiona get skills and training. It's one of Scotland's official youth employment initiatives.

2026-01-26T12:15:38.701630 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification.

Since Fiona is 16 and participating in an approved training program, that's good to know for her eligibility.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) earn more than £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T12:15:39.849308 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that much. My annual income is well below £60,000, and I'm a single parent.

2026-01-26T12:15:41.623668 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Since you're a single parent with an income well below £60,000, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Do you have the right to live in the UK (such as being a UK national, having settled status, or having pre-settled status with certain residency rights)?

2026-01-26T12:15:43.337489 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK citizen. I've lived in Edinburgh my whole life.

2026-01-26T12:15:47.783678 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information.

Based on what you've told me so far, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit because:
- You are responsible for raising your daughter Fiona who lives with you
- Fiona is 16 and in approved training (the "No One Left Behind" programme)
- Your income is below the £60,000 threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge
- You have the right to live in the UK as a UK citizen

Child Benefit can be paid for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. You can receive £24.00 per week for your eldest or only child, and £15.90 for each additional child.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T12:15:49.120054 [actor]: That's great news! Yes, I would like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, please.

2026-01-26T12:15:52.220086 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a 16-year-old in approved training with a parent who is a UK citizen and earns below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
