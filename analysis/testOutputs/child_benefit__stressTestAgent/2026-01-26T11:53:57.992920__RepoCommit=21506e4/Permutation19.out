2026-01-26T12:01:35.325977 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you several questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:01:37.702107 [actor]: I'm Pete, and I have a daughter named Holly who is 9 years old. My ex-wife Sue and I are separated. Holly stays with me 3 days a week and with her mother 4 days a week. We both take care of her needs - I buy her clothes and food when she's with me, and Sue does the same when Holly is with her. I'm wondering if I'm eligible for Child Benefit.

2026-01-26T12:01:40.579501 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context, Pete. I understand you have a 9-year-old daughter named Holly who stays with you 3 days a week and with her mother Sue for 4 days a week.

In this situation, since your daughter lives with both you and your ex-wife at different times, only one person can receive Child Benefit for her. Typically, Child Benefit is paid to the person who has the child living with them most of the time - in this case, it appears to be your ex-wife Sue since Holly stays with her 4 days compared to 3 days with you.

However, I need to confirm: Is your ex-wife Sue currently receiving Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-26T12:01:43.213756 [actor]: I'm not sure if Sue is already claiming Child Benefit for Holly. We've both submitted claims to HMRC because we couldn't agree between ourselves about who should get it. We both feel we contribute equally to taking care of Holly, even though she stays with Sue slightly more days per week. I know I spend quite a lot on Holly's needs when she's with me.

2026-01-26T12:01:47.034943 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Pete. I understand that both you and Sue have submitted claims for Child Benefit for Holly since you couldn't agree between yourselves.

In this situation, HMRC will need to decide who will receive the Child Benefit. Since you've both made a claim, HMRC will typically make a decision based on these factors:

1. Who Holly lives with for more days per week (in this case, Sue has Holly for 4 days versus your 3 days)
2. Who has the main responsibility for Holly's day-to-day care

Based on the information you've provided, it's likely that HMRC will award the Child Benefit to Sue since Holly spends more nights at her home. However, this isn't guaranteed as HMRC will look at all aspects of the care arrangements.

Have you received any communication from HMRC about your claim since both you and Sue submitted applications?

2026-01-26T12:01:50.010720 [actor]: No, I haven't received any communication from HMRC about my claim yet. We only submitted our claims recently. I understand that they'll likely make a decision based on who has Holly more nights, but I was hoping there might be a way for us to share the benefit or for me to receive some recognition for the care I provide during my 3 days with her. I spend a lot on her needs - food, clothes, activities, and everything else she requires. But from what you're saying, it sounds like Sue will probably get the benefit because Holly stays with her one more night per week, is that right?

2026-01-26T12:01:53.830396 [root_agent]: You're right, Pete. Based on the current Child Benefit rules, only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child, and it's typically awarded to the person the child lives with for more days of the week. Since Holly stays with Sue for 4 days compared to your 3 days, it's likely that HMRC will award the benefit to Sue.

Unfortunately, there isn't currently a system to split or share Child Benefit between separated parents. I understand this can feel unfair when you're providing substantial care and financial support during your time with Holly.

While you wait for HMRC's decision, it might be worth having a conversation with Sue about how you both support Holly financially. Some separated parents come to private arrangements where they share the benefit in some way, though this would be an informal agreement between you and not something HMRC administers.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit or what other support might be available to you as a separated parent?

2026-01-26T12:01:57.390937 [actor]: I appreciate the explanation. It's disappointing that there's no formal way to share the benefit when both parents are actively involved in raising the child. I might try talking to Sue about possibly sharing some of the benefit since we both contribute to Holly's upbringing, though I'm not sure she'll be open to that discussion.

Are there any other benefits or support I might be eligible for as a separated parent who has my child for part of the week? I'm trying to make sure I'm accessing any help that might be available to me to provide the best I can for Holly during her time with me.

2026-01-26T12:02:00.097353 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that with split care arrangements, only one person can claim Child Benefit, and it's typically the person who has the child more nights per week (Sue with 4 nights vs Pete's 3).
