2026-01-26T12:06:45.047186 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions to understand your situation.

To start, do you have responsibility for any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:06:47.505449 [actor]: I need to play the role of someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll engage with the agent naturally as a parent in the given situation.

Hi there! Yes, I have a daughter named Emma who's 18. She's just started university this year - she's doing a 3-year Bachelor's degree. She still lives at home with me and commutes to the university each day. I'm wondering if I can still claim Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-26T12:06:49.646290 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. To help determine if you can claim Child Benefit for your 18-year-old daughter Emma who's at university, I need to ask a few more questions.

Is Emma's university course considered "approved education" under the Child Benefit rules? Approved education typically includes full-time education such as A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or a degree course at university.

2026-01-26T12:06:51.669258 [actor]: I'm not entirely sure about the specific classification, but Emma is studying for a Bachelor's degree at university. It's a full-time 3-year course. Does that count as approved education? I thought university would qualify, but I'm not certain about the exact definitions for Child Benefit.

2026-01-26T12:06:53.879151 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Yes, a full-time Bachelor's degree course at university does count as approved education for Child Benefit purposes.

For children aged 16-19, Child Benefit can continue if they're in approved education, which includes higher education courses like university degrees.

Now, may I ask if Emma lives with you for all or most of the time? I understand you mentioned she commutes to university daily, but I just want to confirm.

2026-01-26T12:06:55.233621 [actor]: Yes, Emma lives at home with me full-time. She commutes to university each day but comes back home every evening. She doesn't stay in university accommodation - she's still fully living at home with me.

2026-01-26T12:06:57.801396 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Since Emma lives with you full-time, that's another important eligibility criterion met.

Next, I need to ask about your income. If either you or your partner (if you have one) has an individual income over £50,000 per year, the Child Benefit payment may be affected by what's called the High Income Child Benefit Charge. Does either you or a partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-26T12:06:58.817378 [actor]: No, neither myself nor my partner earns over £50,000 per year. My income is well below that threshold.

2026-01-26T12:07:00.843069 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since neither you nor your partner earns over £50,000 per year, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which is good news.

Now, just to confirm - is Emma receiving any payment for any work-based training or apprenticeship that exceeds a certain threshold? Or is she solely a full-time university student without significant training income?

2026-01-26T12:07:02.914863 [actor]: Emma is solely a full-time university student. She doesn't have any work-based training or apprenticeship. She does have a small part-time job at a local café on weekends to help with her expenses, but it's just regular student employment, not any kind of formal training or apprenticeship.

2026-01-26T12:07:06.734936 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Emma's part-time job at the café doesn't affect your Child Benefit eligibility, as it's just regular employment and not a paid training program.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma because:

1. She is under 20 years old (she's 18)
2. She is in approved full-time education (a Bachelor's degree course at university)
3. She lives with you full-time
4. Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold
5. She is not in paid work-based training that would disqualify her

You can continue to receive Child Benefit for Emma until she turns 20 or completes her course, whichever comes first. If her circumstances change (such as if she moves out or leaves her course), you should inform the Child Benefit Office.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement?

2026-01-26T12:07:08.689969 [actor]: Actually, I think there might be a misunderstanding about university education. I've just remembered reading something about university being considered "advanced education" rather than "approved education" for Child Benefit. Does this make a difference to my eligibility? I'm worried I might not qualify after all since Emma is doing a university degree rather than A-levels or something similar.

2026-01-26T12:07:12.770647 [root_agent]: You've raised an important point, and I need to correct my previous information.

You're absolutely right - there is a distinction between "approved education" and "advanced education" that affects Child Benefit eligibility. University degree courses are indeed classified as "advanced education," not "approved education."

For Child Benefit purposes, "approved education" typically includes:
- A-levels or similar qualifications
- Scottish Highers
- NVQs up to level 3
- Home education (if started before age 16)

University degrees and other higher education courses are considered "advanced education" and generally do not qualify for Child Benefit.

Based on this clarification, since Emma is studying for a Bachelor's degree at university, you would unfortunately not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for her. Child Benefit typically stops after a child turns 16, unless they're in approved education or training (which doesn't include university degrees).

I apologize for my earlier incorrect information. Thank you for bringing this important distinction to my attention.

2026-01-26T12:07:15.293101 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing but thank you for explaining. I didn't realize university education wouldn't qualify for Child Benefit. So just to be clear, since Emma has started her Bachelor's degree, I'm no longer eligible to receive Child Benefit for her even though she's still only 18 and living at home with me?

2026-01-26T12:07:16.887637 [actor]: I understand the situation now. Thank you for clarifying that since Emma is in advanced education (university) rather than approved education, I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit, even though she's 18 and still living at home with me.

2026-01-26T12:07:19.002751 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent initially made a mistake about university education qualifying for Child Benefit, but correctly identified and corrected this error, accurately explaining that Bachelor's degree courses are considered "advanced education" not "approved education" and therefore do not qualify for Child Benefit.
