2026-01-26T11:56:39.409115 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T11:56:40.845240 [actor]: I'll answer your question as though I'm in the situation described. I'll act as David, the single father.

Yes, I have responsibility for my son Jack, who is 14 years old.

2026-01-26T11:56:41.871438 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, David. 

And does Jack live with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T11:56:43.200503 [actor]: Actually, my situation is a bit complicated. Jack was placed in local authority care about 3 months ago, but he comes home to stay with me every weekend. He arrives Friday evening and stays until Sunday evening each week.

2026-01-26T11:56:45.365604 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your situation with Jack. That's important to know.

Since Jack is in local authority care but stays with you regularly on weekends, I need to understand this arrangement better. Are you still considered to be contributing at least the same amount as the weekly rate of Child Benefit toward your son's upkeep?

2026-01-26T11:56:47.062266 [actor]: Yes, I do contribute to Jack's upkeep. I buy him clothes, pay for activities when he's with me on weekends, and make sure he has everything he needs. I spend more than the weekly Child Benefit rate on him, especially when he's staying with me every weekend.

2026-01-26T11:56:49.971967 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, David.

Based on what you've shared, your situation is affected by the rules for children in care. Generally, Child Benefit stops if a child goes into care for more than 8 weeks continuously. 

Since Jack has been in local authority care for about 3 months (which is more than 8 weeks), you would typically not be eligible for Child Benefit for him, even though you continue to contribute to his upkeep and he stays with you on weekends.

However, if there's any change in this arrangement in the future where Jack returns to live with you full-time, you could become eligible again for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?

2026-01-26T11:56:51.846108 [actor]: Actually, I was told that since Jack stays with me every weekend - Friday evening through Sunday evening, which is two nights in a row each week - I might still be eligible for Child Benefit despite him being in care for more than 8 weeks. Is that correct? I thought there was an exception for children who regularly spend at least 2 nights in a row at home.

2026-01-26T11:56:54.652963 [root_agent]: You've raised an important point that I need to check carefully. Let me review the specific rules about children in care who regularly return home.

You're absolutely right, David. According to the rules, if a child in care regularly spends at least 2 nights in a row at home, then Child Benefit can continue to be paid. Since Jack stays with you every weekend from Friday evening through Sunday evening (which is 2 nights in a row each week), you would indeed still be eligible for Child Benefit despite him being in local authority care for more than 8 weeks.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Based on the regular weekend stays pattern you've described, you should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit for Jack.

2026-01-26T11:56:56.788189 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that. I'm relieved to hear that I'm still eligible for Child Benefit given Jack's regular weekend stays with me. It's helpful to know the system recognizes our ongoing relationship even though he's primarily in care right now.

2026-01-26T11:56:59.179190 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent initially provided incorrect information but then correctly stated that Child Benefit can continue if a child in care regularly spends at least 2 nights in a row at home, which applies in this case.
