2026-01-28T13:10:58.903956 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly told the user they were eligible for Child Benefit when the expected outcome was "Not Eligible." Courses done with an employer's agreement (as is the case with Tom's coding course) are explicitly excluded from approved education for Child Benefit eligibility purposes.
