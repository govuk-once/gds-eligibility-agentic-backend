2026-01-26T12:08:46.841119 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you several questions one at a time.

First, are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T12:08:48.888691 [actor]: Hello! I'm Joan and I have a question about Child Benefit for my daughter Kelly. She's 16 and just finished her GCSEs in June. She's been accepted to start her A-levels at college in September, but right now it's August, so she's technically not in school at the moment. I'm a bit worried about whether I'm still eligible for Child Benefit during this summer break.

2026-01-26T12:08:52.302843 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context, Joan. I understand you're concerned about Child Benefit eligibility during the summer break between your daughter Kelly's GCSEs and starting A-levels.

Based on the UK government rules, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for a child who is 16 if they're continuing in approved education. The summer break between GCSEs and starting A-levels is considered a normal part of education, so you would remain eligible during this period.

Child Benefit can continue for children under 20 who are in approved education, which includes A-levels at college. Since Kelly has been accepted and will be starting her A-levels in September, your Child Benefit should continue through this summer break.

Is there anything specific about your situation with Kelly that might affect this eligibility that I should know about?

2026-01-26T12:08:55.365504 [actor]: That's really good news! I was concerned that I might lose the payments during this summer break. Kelly is definitely starting her A-levels in September - she's already enrolled and everything. There's nothing unusual about our situation - she lives with me full-time and I'm her only parent claiming the benefit. So it sounds like I don't need to do anything special to keep receiving the payments during this summer gap, is that right?

2026-01-26T12:08:58.737043 [root_agent]: That's correct, Joan. You don't need to do anything special to keep receiving Child Benefit payments during this summer break between Kelly's GCSEs and her A-levels starting in September.

Since Kelly is 16, lives with you full-time, and is already enrolled to continue her education in approved A-levels, your Child Benefit will continue automatically through this period. The summer break is considered a normal part of the educational process.

As you're already claiming Child Benefit and are the only parent doing so, the payments should continue without interruption. You only need to update HMRC if your circumstances change, such as if Kelly decided not to continue with her education.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement?

2026-01-26T12:09:00.810021 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. I'm really relieved to hear that the Child Benefit will continue through the summer break. It's a weight off my mind knowing I don't have to do anything special. Thank you for clarifying that for me!

2026-01-26T12:09:03.560444 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit continues during the summer break between GCSEs and A-levels for a 16-year-old who is enrolled to continue approved education in September.
