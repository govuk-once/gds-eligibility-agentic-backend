2026-01-26T12:10:32.596036 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:10:34.729484 [actor]: I'll take on the role of a parent with a child who's currently in a psychiatric unit.

Hello, yes I have a son named Simon who is 15 years old. He's been detained under the Mental Health Act and placed in a secure psychiatric unit about 10 weeks ago. I'm wondering if I'm still eligible to receive Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-26T12:10:36.882492 [root_agent]: I understand your situation. Thank you for explaining that your 15-year-old son Simon has been in a psychiatric unit for about 10 weeks after being detained under the Mental Health Act.

When a child is in hospital or residential care, Child Benefit can continue depending on the circumstances. Are you still responsible for Simon and maintaining regular contact with him during his stay in the psychiatric unit?

2026-01-26T12:10:39.954483 [actor]: Yes, I'm still responsible for Simon. I visit him regularly at the psychiatric unit, about twice a week. I'm still maintaining his room at home and buying clothes and personal items for him. The doctors say this is temporary treatment and they're hoping he'll be able to come home in a couple of weeks when his condition stabilizes. I'm very involved in discussions about his care plan as well.

2026-01-26T12:10:43.312968 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Based on what you've told me, you appear to still be eligible for Child Benefit for Simon because:

1. You're maintaining regular contact with him by visiting twice a week
2. You're still financially responsible for him by purchasing clothes and personal items
3. You're maintaining his room at home for his return
4. His placement is temporary and he's expected to return home
5. You remain actively involved in his care planning

When a child goes into hospital or residential care, Child Benefit generally continues if you're still responsible for the child and maintaining contact. Since Simon's stay is temporary (currently 10 weeks), and you've maintained your parental responsibilities and regular contact, you should continue to receive Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement while Simon is in the psychiatric unit?

2026-01-26T12:10:45.616082 [actor]: That's a relief to hear that I can still receive the Child Benefit during this difficult time. No, I don't have any other questions about it right now. Thank you for confirming I'm still eligible - that helps take one worry off my mind while we focus on getting Simon the help he needs.

2026-01-26T12:10:48.363618 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit can continue when a child is in residential care/psychiatric unit if the parent maintains contact and responsibility, which the user clearly does.
