2026-01-27T18:53:01.058423 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated there are no exceptions, but according to the scenario, an exception applies if the married child lives with the claimant and depends on them. The expected outcome should have been "Eligible (via Exception)" not ineligible.
