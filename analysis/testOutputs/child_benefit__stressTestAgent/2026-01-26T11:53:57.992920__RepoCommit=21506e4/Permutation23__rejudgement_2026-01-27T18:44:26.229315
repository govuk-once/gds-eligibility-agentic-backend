2026-01-27T18:52:46.548372 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly determined the user was not eligible for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome was "Eligible." Per UK guidelines, a non-resident parent who contributes at least the weekly Child Benefit amount (which the user does at £30/week equivalent) can be eligible, even if the child lives with someone else.
