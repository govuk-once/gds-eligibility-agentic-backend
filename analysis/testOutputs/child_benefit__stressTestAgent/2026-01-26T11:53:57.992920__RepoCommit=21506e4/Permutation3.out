2026-01-26T11:54:47.844434 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you a series of questions one by one to assess your situation.

First question: Do you have any children living with you who are under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T11:54:49.501672 [actor]: I'm Gary, I'm 50 years old and I live with my son Ben who is 17. Ben finished school in June this year and hasn't gone to college. He's registered with the local youth careers service and is looking for an apprenticeship at the moment. Would I be eligible for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T11:54:51.667548 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context, Gary.

Based on what you've shared, I need to understand Ben's current situation a bit better. 

Is Ben currently enrolled in any form of approved education or training while he's looking for an apprenticeship? This would include things like further education courses, training courses approved by the government, or being registered with a careers service while actively looking for work or an apprenticeship.

2026-01-26T11:54:53.565896 [actor]: No, Ben isn't enrolled in any education or training courses right now. He left school in June after finishing his exams and decided not to continue with college. But he is registered with the local youth careers service and they're helping him look for apprenticeship opportunities. He's been actively applying for positions and has had a couple of interviews so far.

2026-01-26T11:54:57.165426 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification, Gary.

Based on the information you've provided, Ben is 17 years old and is registered with the local youth careers service while actively looking for apprenticeship opportunities. This is important because for Child Benefit eligibility, a young person under 20 needs to be in approved education or training.

Since Ben is registered with a careers service and is actively seeking work/apprenticeships, he might qualify under what's called "extension periods" - where Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after a young person leaves approved education or training if they register with a careers service.

Can you confirm when exactly Ben left school? Was it after completing his GCSEs or A-levels (or equivalent qualifications)?

2026-01-26T11:54:59.051197 [actor]: Yes, Ben left school in June this year after finishing his A-levels. He got his results in August. So it's only been about 2-3 weeks since he officially left education. The careers service has been really helpful so far in guiding him toward apprenticeship opportunities in his field of interest.

2026-01-26T11:55:02.187297 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Gary.

Since Ben only left approved education about 2-3 weeks ago after completing his A-levels, and he has registered with the careers service while actively looking for apprenticeships, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit.

The rules allow for Child Benefit to continue for up to 20 weeks (approximately 5 months) after a young person leaves approved education or training if they register with a careers service, which Ben has done. Since it's only been 2-3 weeks, you are well within this extension period.

Is Ben living with you full-time at your home?

2026-01-26T11:55:03.263949 [actor]: Yes, Ben lives with me full-time at our home. He has been living with me since he was young.

2026-01-26T11:55:06.995103 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Gary.

Based on all the information you've provided:
- Ben is 17 years old
- He completed his A-levels in June and got his results in August
- He left approved education only 2-3 weeks ago
- He is registered with the careers service and actively looking for apprenticeships
- He lives with you full-time
- You are responsible for him

You should still be eligible for Child Benefit. Since Ben has only recently left education (within the last 2-3 weeks) and has registered with the careers service while looking for apprenticeships, you fall within the 20-week extension period during which Child Benefit can continue.

If you're already receiving Child Benefit for Ben, it should continue during this period. If you haven't applied yet, you can still do so.

Do you have any other questions about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T11:55:09.425271 [actor]: That's great news. I wasn't sure if I'd still be eligible since he's not in education anymore. So I'll continue to receive it for up to 20 weeks while he's looking for an apprenticeship with the careers service? What happens if he finds an apprenticeship - would I still get Child Benefit then?

2026-01-26T11:55:12.017417 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after a 17-year-old leaves approved education if they register with a careers service, which aligns with the eligibility rules.
