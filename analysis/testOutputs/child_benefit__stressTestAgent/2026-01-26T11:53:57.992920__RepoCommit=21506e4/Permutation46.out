2026-01-26T12:13:34.614734 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To make this assessment, I'll need to ask you several questions one at a time.

First question: Are you responsible for raising a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T12:13:35.995355 [actor]: I'll answer your questions to determine if I'm eligible for Child Benefit.

Yes, I am responsible for raising a child under 16. I have a young child that I'm taking care of.

2026-01-26T12:13:37.314405 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're responsible for raising a child under 16. 

Next question: Does the child live with you, or are you paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards their upkeep?

2026-01-26T12:13:38.275264 [actor]: Yes, my child lives with me in our home. I take care of all their needs.

2026-01-26T12:13:39.494983 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: What is your nationality or immigration status in the UK? (For example, are you a UK national, an EU national, or do you have indefinite leave to remain?)

2026-01-26T12:13:40.518028 [actor]: I'm not a UK national. I'm an EU citizen with Pre-Settled Status. I've been living in the UK for a while now.

2026-01-26T12:13:41.641390 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about your status.

Next question: Do you have the right to reside in the UK? This would typically be the case if you have pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme.

2026-01-26T12:13:42.699898 [actor]: Yes, I have the right to reside in the UK with my Pre-Settled Status. I've been here under that status.

2026-01-26T12:13:44.473227 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: Is your child living in the UK? (Child Benefit is normally only paid for children living in the UK)

2026-01-26T12:13:45.228476 [actor]: Yes, my child is living here in the UK with me.

2026-01-26T12:13:46.408808 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your child lives with you in the UK.

Next question: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income of over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T12:13:47.725380 [actor]: No, I don't make anywhere near £60,000. I'm actually currently unemployed and looking for work.

2026-01-26T12:13:48.808512 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Next question: Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for this child?

2026-01-26T12:13:49.685708 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for my child.

2026-01-26T12:13:53.073505 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else is claiming Child Benefit for your child.

Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. You:
- Are responsible for a child under 16 who lives with you
- Have pre-settled status and the right to reside in the UK
- Have your child living with you in the UK
- Have an income under £60,000
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for your child

As someone who is currently unemployed, Child Benefit could provide important financial support for your child. You should be eligible to claim the full amount without the High Income Child Benefit Charge affecting your payments.

Would you like me to explain how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T12:13:54.835380 [actor]: That's good to hear that I should be eligible. Actually, I've been claiming Child Benefit already as a "jobseeker" for about 95 days now. I don't have any job offers lined up yet. Is there anything I should be concerned about with my benefits continuing?

2026-01-26T12:14:01.373534 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. This raises an important consideration.

If you're claiming Child Benefit as a "jobseeker" with pre-settled status, there are some aspects you should be aware of regarding maintaining your right to reside in the UK, which affects your Child Benefit eligibility.

Under EU Settlement Scheme rules, those with pre-settled status generally need to maintain their "qualifying right of residence" to continue claiming certain benefits. As a jobseeker, this status typically has time limitations - usually you retain jobseeker status for up to 6 months (182 days) while genuinely seeking work.

Since you've been claiming as a jobseeker for about 95 days, you should still be within this period. However, you should be aware that:

1. You may need to provide evidence that you're genuinely seeking work if requested by authorities
2. As you approach the 6-month mark, you might need to consider other ways to maintain your right to reside if you haven't found employment

To maintain eligibility for Child Benefit beyond the jobseeker period, you might need to either:
- Secure employment
- Qualify under another right to reside category
- Upgrade to settled status if you become eligible (usually after 5 years of continuous residence)

I would recommend keeping detailed records of your job search activities as evidence of genuinely seeking work. Is there anything specific about maintaining your eligibility that you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-26T12:14:03.522809 [actor]: I'm a bit concerned since you mentioned the 6-month mark, but I've actually been told there's a 91-day limit for claiming as a jobseeker with pre-settled status. I've already been claiming for 95 days without a job offer. Does this affect my Child Benefit eligibility right now?

2026-01-26T12:14:09.926972 [root_agent]: I need to carefully consider this important question about the 91-day vs. 6-month timeframe for jobseekers with pre-settled status.

You're right to raise this concern, and I need to clarify an important point. The rules around maintaining your right to reside as a jobseeker with pre-settled status are complex, and there can be different time limits that apply depending on specific circumstances.

Looking at the official UK government guidance, while there is a general 6-month period often cited for jobseeker status, there are indeed situations where shorter assessment periods may apply, particularly when it comes to certain benefits.

Given that you've already exceeded what you understand to be a 91-day limit as a jobseeker, this could potentially affect your current eligibility for Child Benefit. The key factor is whether you still maintain a qualifying right to reside in the UK under the EU Settlement Scheme rules.

At this point, I would strongly recommend:

1. Contacting the Child Benefit office directly to clarify your current situation and eligibility (0300 200 3100)
2. Seeking advice from a welfare rights advisor or organization specializing in EU citizens' rights in the UK (such as the Citizens Advice Bureau)
3. If possible, looking into whether you qualify under any other right to reside category beyond being a jobseeker

This is a situation where getting personalized guidance specific to your exact circumstances is important, as the interaction between immigration status, benefit entitlement, and time limits can be quite nuanced.

Would it be helpful if I explained other potential qualifying categories for right to reside that might apply to your situation?

2026-01-26T12:14:12.693395 [actor]: I see. This is concerning news. I think it sounds like I might no longer be eligible for Child Benefit since I've passed the 91-day limit as a jobseeker and don't have a job offer yet. I'll follow your advice and contact the Child Benefit office to discuss my situation. I should also talk to Citizens Advice about what other options I might have. Thank you for explaining this to me.

2026-01-26T12:14:15.769565 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that as an EU citizen with pre-settled status who has exceeded the 91-day jobseeker period, the person's Child Benefit eligibility is likely affected, and appropriately recommended contacting official sources for clarification.
