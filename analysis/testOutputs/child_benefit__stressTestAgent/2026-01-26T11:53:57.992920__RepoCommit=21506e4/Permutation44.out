2026-01-26T12:12:24.567819 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility correctly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T12:12:26.393681 [actor]: I need to respond as if I'm a real person seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll play the role of a parent with a child in care who comes home for visits.

Hello! Yes, I have a son named Leo who is 12 years old. He's currently in local authority care, but he comes to visit me regularly.

2026-01-26T12:12:27.979806 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your son Leo. Since he's in local authority care but visits you regularly, I need to understand a bit more about the situation.

How often does Leo come to visit you? For example, does he stay with you for regular overnight visits?

2026-01-26T12:12:29.650427 [actor]: Yes, Leo comes to stay with me every weekend. He arrives on Saturday morning at 10:00 AM and stays until Sunday at 11:00 AM before going back to the care home. This happens every week, so he spends Saturday night with me.

2026-01-26T12:12:32.123975 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know that Leo stays with you regularly every weekend, including overnight on Saturdays.

For children in care, Child Benefit eligibility depends on the specific arrangements. 

Since Leo is in local authority care but regularly stays with you overnight, I need to ask: Do you contribute financially to Leo's upkeep or maintenance in any way? This could include buying clothes, providing meals during his visits, or other expenses.

2026-01-26T12:12:34.231218 [actor]: Yes, I do contribute financially when Leo stays with me. I buy his clothes, provide all his meals during his weekend visits, and I also get him things for school sometimes. I have a bedroom set up for him at my place with all his things, and I make sure he has everything he needs when he's with me on the weekends.

2026-01-26T12:12:37.834889 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. It's clear you're contributing financially to Leo's care during his regular weekend visits.

Based on the information you've provided, you may be eligible for some Child Benefit. When a child is in care but regularly returns home, the person who contributes financially to the child's upkeep during these periods may qualify for Child Benefit for those days.

Since Leo stays with you regularly every weekend (one night per week), you might be eligible for a portion of the Child Benefit, specifically for the days he spends with you.

To confirm this further, may I ask if the local authority or anyone else is currently receiving Child Benefit for Leo?

2026-01-26T12:12:40.141669 [actor]: As far as I know, nobody is receiving Child Benefit for Leo right now. When he first went into care, I stopped receiving it. I wasn't sure if I was still eligible for anything since he's with the local authority most of the time, but I do look after him during those weekend visits. I haven't applied for any benefits since he went into care.

2026-01-26T12:12:44.408210 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This information is helpful for determining your eligibility.

Since Leo is in local authority care but regularly stays with you overnight every weekend, and you contribute financially to his care during these visits, you may be eligible for what's called "apportioned" Child Benefit.

When a child is in care but regularly spends time with a parent or guardian who contributes to their upkeep, Child Benefit can sometimes be paid on a proportional basis for those days. In your case, since Leo stays with you one night per week (approximately 1/7 of the time), you could potentially receive about 1/7 of the full Child Benefit amount.

To apply for this, you would need to contact the Child Benefit Office and explain your specific situation, including:
- That Leo is in local authority care
- That he regularly stays with you overnight every weekend
- That you contribute financially to his care during these visits

Would you like me to ask you any more questions about your circumstances, or would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T12:12:46.938839 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that I might be eligible for a portion of the Child Benefit. That's really helpful to know. 

I do have one more question - does it matter that Leo actually spends 25 hours with me each weekend? I've heard something about there being a 24-hour rule. Does the fact that he's with me for more than 24 hours each week (from Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am) affect my eligibility at all?

2026-01-26T12:12:51.350725 [root_agent]: That's a great question about the timing. You're right to bring up the duration of Leo's visits.

For Child Benefit purposes, what's most relevant is the number of nights (rather than hours) that Leo stays with you. Since Leo stays with you overnight on Saturdays, this counts as one night per week.

The 24-hour period you're referring to might relate to how the benefit is calculated. Child Benefit can be apportioned based on the number of nights a child spends with different caregivers. In your case, since Leo spends one night out of seven with you each week, you could potentially receive approximately 1/7 of the full Child Benefit amount.

The fact that his visits total 25 hours doesn't change the calculation, as it's based on nights rather than total hours. What matters is that he regularly stays overnight with you on a consistent basis, and you contribute financially to his care during these times.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about how Child Benefit might apply in your situation?

2026-01-26T12:12:53.210336 [actor]: I see, so it's counted by nights rather than hours. That makes sense now. 

One more thing - Leo has been in care for almost a year now. Does it matter how long he's been in care? Will that affect whether I can get any benefit?

2026-01-26T12:12:57.666833 [root_agent]: That's another good question. The length of time Leo has been in care doesn't directly affect your eligibility for the apportioned Child Benefit. What matters most is the current and ongoing arrangement where he stays with you regularly overnight and you contribute to his care.

However, there is a practical consideration: Child Benefit can typically only be backdated for up to 3 months from when you make a claim. So while you may have been eligible for this apportioned benefit since Leo began his regular weekend visits, you would only be able to receive payments going back a maximum of 3 months from when you submit your application.

The key factors for your eligibility remain:
1. Leo regularly stays with you overnight
2. You contribute financially to his care during these visits
3. No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for him

The fact that he's been in care for almost a year doesn't disqualify you from claiming the apportioned benefit for the nights he spends with you.

2026-01-26T12:13:00.331447 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that. So if I understand correctly, I am eligible for a partial Child Benefit payment (about 1/7 of the full amount) because Leo stays with me overnight once a week, and I contribute to his care during those visits. I can only claim going back 3 months, but I can start receiving it going forward.

I think that answers my questions about eligibility. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office to apply for the apportioned benefit.

2026-01-26T12:13:03.313422 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the user is eligible for apportioned Child Benefit (1/7 of the full amount) since the child stays overnight once a week, with the parent contributing financially to the child's care during visits.
