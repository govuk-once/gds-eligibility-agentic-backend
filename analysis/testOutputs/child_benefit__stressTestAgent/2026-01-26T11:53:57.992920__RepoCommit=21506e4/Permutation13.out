2026-01-26T11:58:40.985772 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you or who you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T11:58:42.695366 [actor]: I'm Ali, and yes, I have a 4-year-old child named Maya living with my wife Zara and me. Maya was placed with us by the adoption agency and has moved into our home, but the final adoption order hasn't been granted by the court yet.

2026-01-26T11:58:44.471483 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Ali. I understand that Maya, who is 4 years old, is living with you and your wife Zara as part of the adoption process, but the final adoption order hasn't been granted yet.

Is Maya being looked after by a local council (local authority) currently, or are you fully responsible for her care under the placement arrangement?

2026-01-26T11:58:45.952290 [actor]: Maya is not being looked after by a local council. Under the placement arrangement, my wife and I are fully responsible for her care. She's living with us in our home, and we're taking care of all her needs while we wait for the final adoption order to be processed.

2026-01-26T11:58:47.489240 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Ali. That's helpful information.

To further understand your situation, may I ask whether you or your wife are receiving any other payments specifically for Maya from the local authority or adoption agency during this placement period?

2026-01-26T11:58:48.814998 [actor]: We don't receive any specific payments for Maya from the local authority or adoption agency. We're covering all her expenses ourselves as her prospective adoptive parents.

2026-01-26T11:58:50.750159 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Ali.

Now I need to ask about your and your wife's nationality status. Are either you or your wife UK citizens, have settled status, or have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T11:58:51.976783 [actor]: Yes, both my wife Zara and I are UK citizens. We've lived here our entire lives.

2026-01-26T11:58:53.646422 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both you and your wife Zara are UK citizens.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask about your work situation. Is either you or your wife working outside the UK, or working for a company based outside the UK?

2026-01-26T11:58:54.900033 [actor]: No, neither of us works outside the UK or for a company based outside the UK. We both work for companies based here in the UK.

2026-01-26T11:58:58.658045 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both of you work for UK-based companies.

Based on what you've told me about your situation, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Maya. Since:

1. Maya is living with you and your wife
2. You're fully responsible for her care under the placement arrangement
3. You're not receiving any other payments from the local authority for her
4. Both you and your wife are UK citizens
5. Neither of you works outside the UK or for foreign companies

Although the final adoption order hasn't been granted yet, as Maya's prospective adoptive parents with her living in your home and you being responsible for her care, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit.

I should note that your household income may affect the amount you receive if either you or your wife has an individual income over £50,000 per year (the High Income Child Benefit Charge may apply).

Would you like me to explain how you can apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T11:58:59.859159 [actor]: Yes, that would be helpful. Can you explain how I can apply for the Child Benefit for Maya?

2026-01-26T11:59:03.001491 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a child placed with prospective adoptive parents, correctly noting that since Maya lives with them and they're responsible for her care, they are eligible to claim Child Benefit even before the final adoption order.
