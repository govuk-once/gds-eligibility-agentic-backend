2026-01-26T11:55:13.512600 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you a few questions to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T11:55:15.151350 [actor]: I'm Elena, 42 years old. I have a daughter named Sofia who is 18 years old. She finished school about two years ago and isn't studying anymore. She works as a receptionist, about 30 hours a week.

2026-01-26T11:55:18.802235 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Elena.

Based on what you've shared, it appears your daughter Sofia would not qualify for Child Benefit since she is 18 years old and not in approved education or training. Child Benefit can generally be claimed for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education such as A-levels, NVQs, or certain other educational programs.

Since Sofia is working as a receptionist and not studying, she wouldn't meet the education requirement for Child Benefit eligibility for children between 16-19 years old.

Is there perhaps another child you're responsible for that you're inquiring about for Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T11:55:21.075826 [actor]: No, Sofia is my only child. I wasn't sure about the rules since she's still under 20, but I understand now that because she's working full-time and not in education, I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-26T11:55:23.216686 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is only available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training, which Sofia is not.
