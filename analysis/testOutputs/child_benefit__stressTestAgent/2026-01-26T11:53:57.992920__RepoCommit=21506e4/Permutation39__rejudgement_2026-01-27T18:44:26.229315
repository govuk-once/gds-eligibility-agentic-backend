The agent correctly determined the eligibility and noted the claimant would be eligible for Child Benefit with their adopted children. The agent accurately provided the current rates and explained the High Income Child Benefit Charge. The adoption allowance does not disqualify them from receiving Child Benefit, which the agent implicitly recognized by determining they were eligible.
