2026-01-26T12:05:52.147192 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T12:05:53.839114 [actor]: I'm looking to check if I can get child benefit for my son, Jordan. He's 17 years old and lives with me.

2026-01-26T12:05:55.778973 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son Jordan is 17 and lives with you. 

Since he's over 16, I need to know: Is Jordan in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or certain traineeships.

2026-01-26T12:05:56.978446 [actor]: No, Jordan isn't in any education or training at the moment. He finished his GCSEs last year but hasn't gone to college or started working yet.

2026-01-26T12:06:00.134851 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Jordan.

Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they are in approved education or training. Since Jordan is 17 and not currently in approved education or training, he doesn't meet the eligibility criteria.

If Jordan decides to enter approved education or training in the future (such as A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or other approved courses), you could then become eligible and might want to apply at that time.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T12:06:02.077010 [actor]: So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit at all for Jordan now? Is there any other benefit I might be able to get since he's still living at home with me but not working or studying?

2026-01-26T12:06:06.284129 [root_agent]: You're right that you're not currently eligible for Child Benefit for Jordan since he's 17 and not in approved education or training.

Regarding other potential benefits, you might want to look into:

1. Universal Credit - You may be able to claim for Jordan as a dependent if he lives with you and meets certain conditions

2. Housing Benefit - Having a non-dependent child at home might affect your entitlement, but you could still be eligible for support

3. Council Tax Support - Some local councils offer reductions for households with low income or with young adults who are not working

4. Jobseeker's support - There may be programs available to help Jordan find employment or training

To get specific advice about these options, I'd recommend:
- Contacting your local Jobcentre Plus
- Using the benefits calculator on GOV.UK
- Speaking with Citizens Advice who can provide free guidance on your specific situation

Would you like me to explain more about any of these potential options?

2026-01-26T12:06:09.064671 [actor]: I see, thank you for explaining about Child Benefit and suggesting those other options. I'll look into Universal Credit and the other benefits you mentioned. I'll also try to encourage Jordan to consider some education or training options that might help with our situation. This has been really helpful.

2026-01-26T12:06:11.289680 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because their 17-year-old son is not in approved education or training.
