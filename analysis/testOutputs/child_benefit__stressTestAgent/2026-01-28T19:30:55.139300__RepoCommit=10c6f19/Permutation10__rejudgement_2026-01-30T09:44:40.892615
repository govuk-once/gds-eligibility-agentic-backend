**Justification:**

The agent appropriately identified the key disqualifying factor: the user is a registered foster carer receiving a full fostering allowance from the local authority that covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance. The agent clearly stated: "you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam" and explained that "when a local authority pays towards a child's accommodation or maintenance (which they do through fostering allowances), the foster carer cannot claim Child Benefit for that child."

This aligns with the eligibility criteria on gov.uk which states that you cannot claim Child Benefit if a local authority is paying towards the child's accommodation or maintenance. The agent's assessment matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** for this foster parent scenario where the council pays the fostering allowance.
