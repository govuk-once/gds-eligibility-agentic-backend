2026-01-28T19:48:21.252319 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T19:48:22.954245 [actor]: chilld benefit eligble 5 year old visiting uk

2026-01-28T19:48:25.844352 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. I can see you have a 5-year-old who is visiting the UK.

To help assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand your situation better.

Are you responsible for this 5-year-old child (meaning you're their parent or main carer), and do you live in the UK yourself?

2026-01-28T19:48:27.476973 [actor]: yes responsible im here 6 months tourist visa from america

2026-01-28T19:48:30.372329 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you're responsible for the child and you're currently in the UK on a tourist visa from America for 6 months.

This is an important detail for eligibility. Child Benefit generally requires that you or your child are living in the UK, and there are specific immigration status requirements.

Let me ask: Is the 5-year-old child living with you here in the UK during your 6-month stay, or are they still in America?

2026-01-28T19:48:31.850478 [actor]: child is with me in uk now

2026-01-28T19:48:34.531388 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So both you and your 5-year-old child are currently in the UK together on a tourist visa from America.

To assess your eligibility properly, I need to understand your immigration status better, as this affects Child Benefit eligibility.

Do you have "right to reside" in the UK - meaning do you have settled status, pre-settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or any other immigration status beyond a standard tourist/visitor visa?

2026-01-28T19:48:35.986778 [actor]: just normal tourist visa 6 months no working

2026-01-28T19:48:38.911669 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You have a standard 6-month tourist visa with no right to work.

This is a crucial point: Child Benefit eligibility requires that you have the right to reside in the UK. A tourist visa (visitor visa) typically does not give you the "right to reside" for benefits purposes.

However, let me ask one more question to be thorough: Are you or your child a UK national, or do either of you have any other connection to the UK (such as through citizenship, settled status, or any other legal status)?
