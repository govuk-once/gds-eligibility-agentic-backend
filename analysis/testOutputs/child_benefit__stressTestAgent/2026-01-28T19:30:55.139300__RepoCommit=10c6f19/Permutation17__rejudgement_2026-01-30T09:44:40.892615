**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors the agent correctly identified:**

1. **Crown Servant Exception**: The agent properly recognized that as a UK Armed Forces member, the user is treated as ordinarily resident in the UK even while stationed abroad in Germany. This is the critical exception that makes the user eligible despite not physically living in the UK.

2. **Child Requirements Met**: The agent confirmed the children (aged 8 and 10) are under 16 and live with the user on the military base.

3. **Responsibility Established**: The agent verified the user is responsible for the children.

4. **No Duplicate Benefits**: The agent confirmed the user is not receiving child benefit from Germany or another country.

5. **Clear Eligibility Statement**: The agent explicitly stated "**You are eligible for Child Benefit**" and provided clear reasoning.

The agent also appropriately addressed the High Income Child Benefit Charge considerations while correctly noting this doesn't affect eligibility itself. The communication was clear, methodical, and reached the correct conclusion that matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
