**Justification:**

While the agent made an error in explaining the *timing* mechanism (incorrectly stating that Child Benefit stops on "31 August after a young person turns 19"), the agent ultimately communicated the **correct eligibility outcome**: that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit for their son.

The expected outcome is: **Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday).**

The agent clearly stated: "Unfortunately, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit for your son" and confirmed "no more Child Benefit as your son is now over the age limit for the scheme."

According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 20 (or leaves approved education/training, whichever is earlier). Since the son turned 20 last week, he is no longer eligible—which is exactly what the agent communicated.

The agent's explanation of *when* eligibility would have ceased was incorrect (the agent suggested it stopped at 19, when it actually stops at 20), but the **final eligibility determination**—that the user is not currently eligible—aligns with the expected outcome.
