**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Mo is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Child's age qualification**: Zahid is 15 years old (under 16) ✓

2. **Contribution threshold**: According to gov.uk guidance, when a child lives with someone else, you can claim if you contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate to the child's upkeep. The current rate for one child is £25.60/week (approximately £26.05 in some references).

3. **Aggregated contributions**: The agent correctly identified that Mo contributes £15/week and his mother contributes £15/week, totaling £30/week - which **exceeds the threshold**. The guidance explicitly states contributions can be combined from multiple people as long as the total meets the threshold.

4. **No competing claim**: The aunt doesn't claim Child Benefit, removing that barrier.

5. **Agreement requirement**: The agent appropriately noted that Mo and his mother must agree on who claims (since only one person can claim), and Mo confirmed this agreement.

The agent's conclusion that Mo "could be eligible" and can claim Child Benefit is correct. The scenario specifically tests whether aggregated contributions from multiple family members (Mo + grandmother) can satisfy the contribution requirement - and they do (£30 ≥ £26.05).

The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that **agrees** with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
