**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user (Mark) is **not eligible** for Child Benefit because Lucas lives with Jenny full-time. However, according to the government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, there is a specific provision for non-resident parents who contribute to a child's upkeep.

According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, you can claim Child Benefit if you're responsible for a child, which includes cases where you:
- "pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent in kind) towards looking after the child"

In this scenario:
- Mark contributes £150/month (approximately £34.50/week)
- The current Child Benefit rate is approximately £26.05/week (£113/month) for the first child
- Mark's contribution **exceeds** the Child Benefit amount
- Jenny is **not claiming** Child Benefit

According to the eligibility criteria, Mark meets the "contributing to upkeep" exception and should be eligible to claim Child Benefit, especially since Jenny is not claiming it. The agent incorrectly stated multiple times that financial contribution doesn't matter and that only the resident parent can claim, missing this important exception to the rule.

**Expected outcome:** Eligible  
**Agent's communicated outcome:** Not eligible  
**Agreement:** No 👎
