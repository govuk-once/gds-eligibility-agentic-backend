**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit**, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of the exception**: The agent properly identified that while the child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks (14 weeks), the parent remains eligible because they are "still paying for her maintenance costs and the hospital is not contributing towards these costs."

2. **Accurate application of hospital rules**: The agent explicitly stated: "The rule is that Child Benefit can continue after 12 weeks in hospital if you're still responsible for contributing to the child's maintenance costs - which you clearly are."

3. **Proper verification of criteria**: The agent systematically verified:
   - Child's age (6 years old - eligible)
   - Parental responsibility (yes)
   - NHS hospital stay exceeding 12 weeks (14 weeks)
   - Parent regularly spending money on child's upkeep (£30/week on books, pyjamas, special food)
   - Hospital NOT contributing to maintenance costs

4. **Clear communication**: The agent provided a clear, definitive statement: "you should be eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter" and explained the reasoning transparently.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome that Mary (the mother) retains eligibility beyond the 12-week limit due to the exception for parents who continue to spend money regularly on their child's upkeep while in hospital.
