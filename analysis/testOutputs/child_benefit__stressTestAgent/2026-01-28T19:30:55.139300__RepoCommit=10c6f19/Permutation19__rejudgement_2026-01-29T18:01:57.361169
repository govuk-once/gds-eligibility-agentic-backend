2026-01-29T18:19:58.013562 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 **Justification:** The agent correctly communicated the eligibility outcome that aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**
- **Expected Outcome:** Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible
- **Agent's Communication:** The agent determined that the ex-partner (who has the child 4 days/week and where the child is registered) would be eligible, while the user (who has the child 3 days/week) would not be eligible
- **User's Identity:** Based on the transcript, the user stated "she stays with me 3 days week ex has her 4 days" - this identifies the user as Pete (3 days) and the ex as Sue (4 days)

**Key Points:**
1. The agent correctly applied the "main responsibility" test under dual claimant rules
2. The agent properly identified that Sue (4 days, child registered at her address) has main responsibility
3. The agent correctly concluded Pete (the user, 3 days) would not be eligible
4. This matches the expected outcome: Sue Eligible, Pete Not Eligible

The agent's assessment was thorough, accurate, and properly applied HMRC's priority rules for disputed claims where parents cannot agree.
