2026-01-28T19:39:13.730276 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:39:15.453938 [actor]: child not living with me temperary gramma has him surgery recovery

2026-01-28T19:39:18.153010 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your child is temporarily living with their grandmother while you recover from surgery.

Let me ask you this:

**Do you normally live with your child, and is this temporary arrangement expected to last less than 52 weeks?**

2026-01-28T19:39:19.624377 [actor]: 6 weeks going back after recovery

2026-01-28T19:39:21.824898 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. A 6-week temporary arrangement while you recover from surgery is well within the allowed timeframe.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you responsible for the child - meaning you normally provide for their care, make decisions about their upbringing, and contribute to the costs of looking after them?**

2026-01-28T19:39:23.299501 [actor]: yes pay for everything school clothes food

2026-01-28T19:39:25.004844 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It's clear you're responsible for your child's care and costs.

Now let me ask:

**Do you normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T19:39:26.376440 [actor]: live uk yes

2026-01-28T19:39:28.156435 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Next question:

**Is your child also normally living in the UK (apart from this temporary 6-week stay with their grandmother)?**

2026-01-28T19:39:29.626575 [actor]: yes child lives uk always just with gramma now

2026-01-28T19:39:32.035049 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now, an important question about your current situation:

**Are you currently claiming Child Benefit for this child, or are you asking about making a new claim?**

2026-01-28T19:39:33.414840 [actor]: not claiming yet want to know if can claim

2026-01-28T19:39:35.478667 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you want to make a new claim.

Let me ask you:

**Are you the child's parent, or do you have another relationship to the child (such as being their legal guardian or other carer)?**

2026-01-28T19:39:36.869897 [actor]: im the mother parent

2026-01-28T19:39:38.866426 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Let me ask:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for this child - such as the child's grandmother or the other parent?**

2026-01-28T19:39:40.593683 [actor]: gramma not claiming no one claiming

2026-01-28T19:39:43.344316 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question:

**Do you have a partner (married, in a civil partnership, or living together as a couple)?**

(This is important because if you do have a partner, I'll need to check about their income, as there are rules about Child Benefit and the High Income Child Benefit Charge if either partner earns over £50,000 per year)

2026-01-28T19:39:44.675546 [actor]: single mother no partner

2026-01-28T19:39:46.700229 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One final question:

**Do you or does your child have any immigration restrictions on your right to remain in the UK, or are you subject to immigration control?**

2026-01-28T19:39:48.575379 [actor]: no born here uk citizen both of us

2026-01-28T19:39:53.368188 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:
- You are the parent of a child under 16 (or under 20 if in approved education/training)
- You are responsible for the child - you pay for their care, clothing, food, and school costs
- Both you and your child normally live in the UK and are UK citizens
- The temporary 6-week arrangement with your child's grandmother while you recover from surgery does not affect your eligibility, as temporary separations of less than 52 weeks are allowed
- No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for your child
- You have no immigration restrictions

You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit. The temporary living arrangement with grandmother during your recovery will not prevent you from claiming, as you remain responsible for your child and this is a short-term situation.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T19:39:56.497934 [actor]: thank you got answer needed

2026-01-28T19:39:59.148489 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly assessed that the temporary 6-week stay with grandmother during surgery recovery does not affect eligibility, correctly applied the 52-week temporary separation rule, verified all key eligibility criteria (UK residence, responsibility for child, no one else claiming), and reached the correct conclusion of eligibility.
