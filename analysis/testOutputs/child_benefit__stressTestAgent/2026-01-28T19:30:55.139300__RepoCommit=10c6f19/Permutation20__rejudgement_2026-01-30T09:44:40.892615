**Justification:**

The expected outcome for this scenario is **Eligible**, and the agent clearly communicated that the user "**appears to be eligible for Child Benefit**."

The agent's assessment is correct because:

1. **Responsibility criterion met**: Maria (the grandmother) is responsible for her 14-year-old granddaughter Lucia, paying for all her needs (food, clothes, school supplies) and providing day-to-day care.

2. **Relationship criterion met**: According to gov.uk guidance, you can claim Child Benefit for a child you're looking after in an **informal arrangement** (friend or relative's child), as long as the local council isn't paying for their accommodation. The agent correctly identified that the grandmother qualifies despite not being the parent.

3. **Other criteria met**: 
   - Child is under 16 (14 years old)
   - Child lives with the applicant as main residence
   - Applicant is UK citizen living in UK
   - No one else is claiming Child Benefit for the child

The agent provided a clear, accurate eligibility determination that matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** and correctly explained the reasoning. The agent also appropriately mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge as additional relevant information.
