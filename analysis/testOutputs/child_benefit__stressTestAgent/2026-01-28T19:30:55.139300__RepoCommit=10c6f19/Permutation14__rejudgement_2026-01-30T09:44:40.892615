**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Temporary absence properly handled**: The agent correctly identified that the 6-week temporary arrangement with the grandmother falls well within the allowed timeframe (the 8-week rule mentioned in the scenario context, and the 52-week rule the agent referenced for longer separations).

2. **No competing claim**: The agent verified that the grandmother is not claiming Child Benefit, which is crucial under the 8-week temporary absence rule.

3. **Responsibility maintained**: The agent confirmed that Sophie continues to be responsible for Noah's care and costs (paying for "everything school clothes food"), which maintains her eligibility during the temporary absence.

4. **All eligibility criteria met**: The agent systematically verified:
   - Child under 16 ✓
   - Parental responsibility ✓
   - UK residence for both parent and child ✓
   - No competing claims ✓
   - No immigration restrictions ✓

5. **Correct conclusion**: The agent clearly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and explained that "the temporary 6-week arrangement...does not affect your eligibility."

The agent's assessment matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** based on the 8-week temporary absence rule where no other person has claimed Child Benefit.
