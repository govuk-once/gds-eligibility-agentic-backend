2026-01-28T19:38:40.402468 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T19:38:42.418205 [actor]: child livs with me yes adoptin not finised yet

2026-01-28T19:38:44.936791 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since the adoption isn't finalized yet, I need to understand your current legal status with the child.

Are you currently the child's approved adoptive parent (meaning you have legal approval to adopt and the child has been placed with you), or are you in an earlier stage of the adoption process?

2026-01-28T19:38:46.429280 [actor]: approved adopter child placed with us moved in

2026-01-28T19:38:48.983402 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. That's helpful information - as an approved adopter with the child placed with you and living in your home, this is relevant to your eligibility.

Now I need to ask: Is the child under 16 years old, or if they're 16 or over, are they under 20 and still in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T19:38:50.677584 [actor]: child is 4 years old

2026-01-28T19:38:53.220376 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you have a 4-year-old child who has been placed with you as an approved adopter and is living with you.

Next question: Are you normally living in the UK? (This means the UK is where you usually live, even if you travel abroad temporarily)

2026-01-28T19:38:54.629855 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T19:38:56.644110 [root_agent]: Thank you. And just to confirm - are you the person who is mainly responsible for this child? In other words, are you the primary person looking after them day-to-day?

2026-01-28T19:38:58.073838 [actor]: yes we look after them everyday

2026-01-28T19:39:00.564420 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year? 

(This won't necessarily mean you can't get Child Benefit, but it may affect whether there's a tax charge to pay back some or all of it)

2026-01-28T19:39:02.203063 [actor]: no income under that

2026-01-28T19:39:06.431982 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a 4-year-old child (under 16)
✓ The child lives with you
✓ You are an approved adopter with the child placed in your care
✓ You are the person mainly responsible for the child
✓ You normally live in the UK
✓ Your income is under £60,000, so you won't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge

**Important point about adoption:** You can claim Child Benefit as an approved adopter once the child is placed with you and living with you, even before the adoption is legally finalized.

You should be able to proceed with applying for Child Benefit. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T19:39:11.506284 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that an approved adopter with a placed child under 16 living with them in the UK, who is the primary caregiver with income under £60,000, is eligible for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible."
