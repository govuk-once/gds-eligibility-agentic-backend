**Justification:**

While the agent made an error in explaining *when* the child benefit stopped (incorrectly stating it stops on "31 August after turning 19"), the agent ultimately communicated the **correct eligibility outcome**: that the user is **not eligible** for child benefit for their son.

The key facts are:
- The son turned 20 last week
- According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit stops when a child turns 20, even if still in approved education
- The expected outcome is: "Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)"

The agent clearly stated: "**Unfortunately, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit for your son**" and "**no more Child Benefit as your son is now over the age limit for the scheme**."

Although the agent's reasoning about the specific cut-off date was flawed (citing 31 August after turning 19 rather than the 20th birthday), the final eligibility determination communicated to the user was correct: the user is not eligible because their son has aged out of the system by turning 20.

The evaluation judge correctly identified the technical error in the agent's explanation, but for the purposes of assessing whether the agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome (not eligible), the agent did communicate this correctly.
