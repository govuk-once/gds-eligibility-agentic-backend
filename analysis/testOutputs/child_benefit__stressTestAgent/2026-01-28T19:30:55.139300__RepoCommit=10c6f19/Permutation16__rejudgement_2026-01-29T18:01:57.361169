2026-01-29T18:21:50.771275 [confirmation_judge]: **Assessment of Agent's Performance:**

The agent communicated that the user (Hannah) is **eligible** for Child Benefit. Let me evaluate whether this aligns with the expected outcome.

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Eligible ("You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit")

**Analysis:**

The agent correctly applied the rules for this scenario:

1. **Child's Age:** Oliver is 14 (under 16) ✓
2. **Responsibility:** Hannah is responsible for Oliver and pays for his costs ✓
3. **UK Residency:** Hannah is a UK resident ✓
4. **Hospitalization:** Oliver has been in hospital abroad for 15 weeks (more than 12 weeks)
5. **International Exception:** The agent correctly identified that Oliver went abroad specifically for hospital treatment, which is the key exception that maintains eligibility despite the extended hospitalization period

The agent appropriately recognized that:
- The hospitalization abroad for treatment purposes is a temporary absence
- Child Benefit continues when a child is in hospital abroad specifically for treatment
- Hannah remains responsible and continues to pay for Oliver's costs
- Oliver is expected to return to the UK

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome perfectly. According to gov.uk guidance, when a child goes abroad specifically for hospital treatment and the parent continues to support them financially, Child Benefit eligibility continues.

**Judgement:** 👍
