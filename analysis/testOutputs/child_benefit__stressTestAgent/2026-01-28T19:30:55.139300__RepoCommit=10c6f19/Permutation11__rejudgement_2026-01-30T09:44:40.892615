**Justification:**

The agent communicated that Karen **is eligible** for Child Benefit for her 17-year-old son Ryan who has started an apprenticeship. However, the expected outcome is that Karen is **Not Eligible** and must stop her claim.

The agent made a critical error by treating apprenticeships as "approved education or training" without understanding the specific rules that apply. According to the government guidance on https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, Child Benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds depends on whether they are in approved education or training. However, **apprenticeships in England are specifically treated differently** - they constitute paid employment, and young people in apprenticeships typically work 30+ hours per week.

The key rule the agent missed is that Child Benefit stops when a young person starts **paid work of 24 hours or more per week**, even if under 20. Since Ryan started an Intermediate Apprenticeship, he is in paid employment that almost certainly exceeds 24 hours per week, making him ineligible.

The agent should have:
1. Asked about the hours Ryan works in his apprenticeship
2. Understood that apprenticeships are paid work, not "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes
3. Applied the 24-hour work rule to determine Ryan's ineligibility

The agent's conclusion directly contradicts the expected outcome, telling Karen she can claim when she actually cannot.
