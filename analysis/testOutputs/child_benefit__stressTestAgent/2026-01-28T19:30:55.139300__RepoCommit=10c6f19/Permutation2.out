2026-01-28T19:31:27.365243 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:31:28.963079 [actor]: daughter doing a levels sixth form

2026-01-28T19:31:31.246218 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your daughter doing A-levels in sixth form would qualify as approved education.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Are you responsible for this child? In other words, do you live with her and are you responsible for her care and upbringing?**

2026-01-28T19:31:32.836249 [actor]: yes she lives with me in london

2026-01-28T19:31:35.456566 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you or your partner's individual income over £50,000 per year?**

(This is important because if either of you earns over this amount, it may affect your Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-28T19:31:37.090747 [actor]: income 40000 work in london

2026-01-28T19:31:39.091214 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

One more important question:

**Does anyone else also claim Child Benefit for your daughter, or is anyone else claiming her in their Child Benefit claim?**

2026-01-28T19:31:40.420603 [actor]: no just me single father

2026-01-28T19:31:43.913451 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:

✓ You have a daughter who is doing A-levels in sixth form (which counts as approved education or training for those under 20)

✓ She lives with you and you are responsible for her

✓ Your income is £40,000, which is below the £50,000 threshold, so you won't have to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge

✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

As a single father living with and caring for your daughter who is in approved education, you meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

**Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-28T19:31:49.859556 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria: the daughter qualifies as she's doing A-levels (approved education for under 20s), the user is responsible for her care and lives with her, income is below £50,000 threshold, and no one else claims Child Benefit for her.
