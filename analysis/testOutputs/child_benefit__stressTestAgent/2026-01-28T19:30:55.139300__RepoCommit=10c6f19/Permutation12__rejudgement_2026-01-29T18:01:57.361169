**Justification:**

The expected outcome for this scenario is **Not Eligible**. According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, Child Benefit stops when "your child starts getting certain benefits, like Universal Credit, Income Support or Employment and Support Allowance, in their own right."

In this case:
- The son (Liam, 18) is claiming Universal Credit in his own name as an independent person
- This directly triggers the disqualification criterion stated in the official guidance

The agent failed to communicate this outcome. Instead, the agent:
1. Initially indicated the user appeared eligible (before learning about the UC claim)
2. When informed about the UC claim, stated they could not give a definitive answer
3. Repeatedly said the guidance doesn't clearly address this situation
4. Directed the user to contact HMRC instead of communicating the clear rule

However, the official guidance **does** clearly address this: a child claiming Universal Credit in their own right disqualifies them from Child Benefit. The agent should have communicated that based on the son claiming UC independently, the user would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit, as this is explicitly stated in the eligibility criteria.

The agent's uncertainty and refusal to state the clear disqualification rule means they did not communicate the correct outcome of "Not Eligible."
