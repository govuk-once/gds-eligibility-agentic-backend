2026-01-28T19:41:43.836334 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T19:41:45.345984 [actor]: child benefit son studing a levels turned 20 last week

2026-01-28T19:41:47.226365 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your son is studying A-levels but turned 20 last week.

Let me ask you this: **Is your son still enrolled in and actively attending his A-level course?**

2026-01-28T19:41:48.805724 [actor]: yes still doing a levels full time wont finish til june

2026-01-28T19:41:51.255190 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know. Your son is still doing A-levels full time and won't finish until June.

Now I need to ask: **Are you responsible for your son? By this I mean, does he normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards his upkeep?**

2026-01-28T19:41:52.706853 [actor]: he lives with me yes pays for evryhing

2026-01-28T19:41:54.506024 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son lives with you and you pay for everything.

Let me ask you: **Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do either of you have a 'no recourse to public funds' condition on your visa or immigration status?**

2026-01-28T19:41:55.976406 [actor]: no we are uk citizens born here

2026-01-28T19:41:58.082058 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you're both UK citizens born here.

One more important question: **Is your son the only person claiming Child Benefit for himself, or is anyone else (such as another parent or guardian) currently receiving Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T19:41:59.781879 [actor]: just me claiming no one else

2026-01-28T19:42:04.912598 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Unfortunately, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit for your son.**

Here's why: Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 (and in some cases just turned 20) if they're in approved education or training. However, there's an important age limit - **Child Benefit stops on 31 August after a young person turns 19**, or when they leave education or training, whichever comes first.

Since your son turned 20 last week and is still in education, this means he passed his 19th birthday some time ago. Even though he's still doing A-levels full-time until June, Child Benefit would have already stopped on 31 August following his 19th birthday.

If you've been receiving Child Benefit payments after that date, you should contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them of the situation, as you may have been overpaid and might need to repay any payments received after he was no longer eligible.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-28T19:42:06.463090 [actor]: ok so no more child benefit then understood thanks

2026-01-28T19:42:08.414031 [root_agent]: You're welcome. Yes, that's correct - no more Child Benefit as your son is now over the age limit for the scheme.

I'm glad I could help clarify this for you. If you have any other questions in the future, feel free to ask. Take care!

2026-01-28T19:42:13.902958 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that Child Benefit stops on 31 August after a young person turns 19, but according to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit actually stops when the child turns 20 or leaves approved education/training (whichever is earlier). Since my son turned 20 last week, eligibility ceased on his 20th birthday, not on the previous 31 August after turning 19.
