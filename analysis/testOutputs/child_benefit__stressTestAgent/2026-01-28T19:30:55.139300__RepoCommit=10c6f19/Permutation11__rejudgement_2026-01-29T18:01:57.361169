**Justification:**

The agent communicated that Karen **is eligible** for Child Benefit for Ryan because he is in an apprenticeship. However, the expected outcome is that Karen is **Not Eligible** and must stop her claim.

According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, Child Benefit stops when a young person:
- Starts paid work of 24 hours or more per week, OR
- Starts an apprenticeship

The key issue is that apprenticeships in England are treated differently from staying in approved education (like A-levels). Apprenticeships are paid work arrangements, and starting an apprenticeship is specifically a disqualifying event for Child Benefit purposes.

The agent incorrectly stated that "He's in an approved apprenticeship (which counts as approved education or training) ✓" and concluded Karen was eligible. This contradicts the government guidance which makes clear that apprenticeships disqualify claimants from Child Benefit.

The agent's eligibility determination directly contradicts the expected outcome that Karen is not eligible because Ryan has started an apprenticeship. Therefore, the agent failed to communicate the correct outcome.
