**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key evidence:**

1. The agent identified the critical issue: "A tourist visa (visitor visa) typically does not give you the 'right to reside' for benefits purposes."

2. The agent explicitly stated: "Child Benefit eligibility requires that you have the right to reside in the UK."

3. The agent correctly assessed that a standard 6-month tourist visa with no right to work does not satisfy the "right to reside" requirement for Child Benefit purposes.

4. The agent asked appropriate follow-up questions to confirm there was no other qualifying status (UK nationality, settled status, etc.).

**Analysis:**

The user is a US citizen on a standard tourist visa with no recourse to public funds and no right to reside for benefits purposes. This clearly fails Criteria 2 (Immigration Status / Right to Reside), making them ineligible for Child Benefit. The agent accurately identified this disqualifying factor and communicated it appropriately to the user.

The expected outcome is "Not Eligible" and the agent's communication reflects this outcome correctly.
