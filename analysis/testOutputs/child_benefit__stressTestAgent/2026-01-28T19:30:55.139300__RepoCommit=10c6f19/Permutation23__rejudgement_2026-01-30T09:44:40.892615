**Justification:**

The agent determined that Kevin is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and the specific circumstances of this permutation, Kevin should be **eligible**.

**Key Analysis:**

1. **The Contribution Test**: According to gov.uk guidance on "child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else", a parent who doesn't live with their child can still claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate toward the child's upbringing.

2. **Kevin's Contributions**: Kevin contributes £120 every 4 weeks for groceries and clothes. This averages to £30 per week (£120 ÷ 4 = £30/week), which exceeds the Child Benefit threshold of £26.05 per week for the eldest/only child.

3. **Lump Sum Contributions**: The guidance explicitly allows for contributions to be made as a lump sum covering a set period, not just weekly payments. Kevin's monthly bulk purchases qualify as such contributions.

4. **Agent's Error**: The agent focused solely on the fact that the daughter lives with her mother full-time and dismissed Kevin's eligibility without properly assessing whether his financial contributions met the threshold for eligibility when a child lives elsewhere.

The agent communicated an outcome of "NOT eligible" when the expected outcome is "Eligible" based on Kevin's qualifying contributions. Therefore, this is incorrect.
