**Justification:**

While the agent correctly identified that the user technically meets the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, the agent **failed to communicate a critical piece of information** that is central to this scenario: the user is a 15-year-old minor parent.

According to the scenario context and the Gov.UK guidance on Child Benefit:

1. **A person under 16 CAN claim Child Benefit for their own child** - this is technically correct
2. **However**, the guidance explicitly states: "You'll usually get more if [someone responsible for you] claims... on your behalf"

The expected outcome notes this is "Eligible (Though potentially financially suboptimal)" - meaning the agent should have:
- Confirmed basic eligibility (which they did)
- **But also explained that having the user's parents claim on behalf of both the user AND the baby would likely be more financially beneficial**
- Warned that if the 15-year-old claims directly, the parents might lose the Child Benefit they currently receive for the 15-year-old herself

The agent never asked about the user's age, never identified that this is a minor parent situation, and never provided the crucial financial guidance that would help the user make an informed decision. While the eligibility determination was technically correct, the failure to identify and communicate the financial implications represents a significant omission in properly serving this vulnerable young parent.

The agent communicated "eligible" when they should have communicated "eligible but you should consider having your parents claim instead for better financial outcomes."
