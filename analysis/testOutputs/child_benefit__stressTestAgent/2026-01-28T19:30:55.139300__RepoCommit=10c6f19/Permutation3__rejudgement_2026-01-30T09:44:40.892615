**Justification:**

The agent communicated an **incorrect eligibility outcome**. 

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Eligible only until 31st August (approximately 8-9 weeks from when Ben left school in late June)

**Why the agent was wrong:**

According to the official gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), there is a specific extension for 16-17 year olds who have left education and are registered with an approved careers service. The user's son Ben clearly meets these criteria:

1. He is 17 years old (within the 16-17 age range)
2. He left education in June
3. He is registered with the careers service
4. He is actively looking for an apprenticeship

Under these circumstances, Child Benefit can continue for **up to 20 weeks** after leaving education, not just until 31st August as the agent stated.

The agent repeatedly dismissed the significance of the careers service registration, stating "Registration with the careers service alone does not extend your Child Benefit entitlement beyond the 31st August" and "Simply being registered with the careers service and looking for an apprenticeship, unfortunately, doesn't count." This is factually incorrect according to the gov.uk eligibility rules.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, noting that the agent "failed to recognize this extension period."
