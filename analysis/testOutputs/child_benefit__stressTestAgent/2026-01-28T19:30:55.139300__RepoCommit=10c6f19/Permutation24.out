2026-01-28T19:45:09.400096 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:45:11.228965 [actor]: son 14 yrs old residnetial scool council pays

2026-01-28T19:45:13.216185 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old son who is at a residential school that the council pays for.

Let me ask you this: **Does your son live at the residential school full-time, or does he come home to live with you during school holidays?**

2026-01-28T19:45:14.675363 [actor]: full time been there 10 weeks behavioral problems

2026-01-28T19:45:17.182050 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. I understand your son has been at the residential school full-time for 10 weeks due to behavioral problems, and the council is paying for it.

This is an important consideration for Child Benefit eligibility. Let me ask you: **Before your son went to the residential school, were you receiving Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T19:45:19.045775 [actor]: yes was getting it before he went

2026-01-28T19:45:22.428524 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Since your son is now living full-time at a residential school paid for by the council, this affects your Child Benefit entitlement.

Let me ask you: **Has the council or the residential school told you that they are receiving any allowances or payments for your son's maintenance or accommodation costs?**

(This is important because if the council or local authority is paying for his full maintenance and accommodation, it can affect whether you continue to receive Child Benefit while he's there.)

2026-01-28T19:45:24.757629 [actor]: council pays evreything maintenance accommodation everything

2026-01-28T19:45:28.278108 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is a crucial detail.

Based on what you've told me, since the council is paying for everything - maintenance, accommodation, and all costs - for your son at the residential school, and he's living there full-time, **you are generally not eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit while he remains in this arrangement**.

This is because when a local authority is meeting all the costs for a child in residential care or accommodation, the Child Benefit typically stops. 

Let me ask one more question to be thorough: **Have you already notified the Child Benefit Office about your son's change in living circumstances, or are you still currently receiving Child Benefit payments for him?**

2026-01-28T19:45:29.873170 [actor]: still getting payments now do I need stop it

2026-01-28T19:45:33.885620 [root_agent]: Yes, **you do need to report this change to the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible**.

Since the council is paying for all of your son's costs at the residential school and he's living there full-time, you should not continue receiving Child Benefit for him during this period. 

**What you need to do:**

1. Contact the Child Benefit Office immediately to tell them about the change in your son's living circumstances
2. You can call them on **0300 200 3100** (Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm)
3. Explain that your son has been living full-time at a council-funded residential school for the past 10 weeks

It's important to report this quickly because if you continue receiving payments you're not entitled to, you may have to pay the money back.

**One final question:** When your son comes home for holidays or visits, does he stay with you?

2026-01-28T19:45:35.233161 [actor]: yes comes home holidays

2026-01-28T19:45:39.796554 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know. This is actually important information.

**When your son comes home to stay with you during school holidays**, you may be able to claim Child Benefit again for those periods. However, the rules can be complex depending on how the arrangement is structured.

Here's what you should do:

1. **Contact the Child Benefit Office now** on **0300 200 3100** to:
   - Report that your son has been in council-funded residential accommodation since 10 weeks ago
   - Explain that he comes home to you during school holidays
   - Ask them about re-claiming Child Benefit for the holiday periods when he's back with you

2. They will advise you on the specific process and whether you can claim for holiday periods

The key point is: you're generally **not eligible while he's at the residential school full-time with the council paying**, but you **may be eligible again during holidays** when he's living with you.

Is there anything else about your situation you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T19:45:41.457588 [actor]: ok so not eligble now right thats what you saying

2026-01-28T19:45:44.634319 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. **Based on what you've told me, you are not eligible for Child Benefit while your son is living full-time at the council-funded residential school.**

The key reasons are:
- Your son is living at the residential school full-time
- The council is paying for all his maintenance and accommodation costs

You need to contact the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible to stop the payments and avoid having to repay money later.

However, remember that during school holidays when he comes home to live with you, the situation may be different - so do discuss this with the Child Benefit Office when you contact them.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-28T19:45:46.353742 [actor]: no thats all needed to know thanks

2026-01-28T19:45:50.686348 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately advised that I am not eligible for Child Benefit while my son is living full-time at a council-funded residential school where the council pays for all maintenance and accommodation costs, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible (until week 12)" since my son has been there for 10 weeks (still within the 12-week grace period, though the agent didn't mention this specific detail).
