**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit while the son is in residential accommodation paid for by the council. However, the expected outcome is **Eligible (until week 12)**.

According to the scenario and the 12-week rule for residential accommodation:
- The son has been in residential accommodation for **10 weeks**
- Children in residential accommodation (as distinct from "Care") retain Child Benefit eligibility for **12 weeks**
- Since only 10 weeks have passed, the user should still be **eligible for another 2 weeks**

The agent failed to identify or communicate this critical 12-week grace period for residential accommodation. Instead, the agent incorrectly stated the user is not eligible and should stop receiving payments immediately. The correct guidance should have been that the user remains eligible until the 12-week threshold is reached (i.e., for 2 more weeks), after which eligibility would cease.

The evaluation judge's note acknowledges this discrepancy by mentioning "though the agent didn't mention this specific detail" - this is a fundamental error, not a minor omission, as it directly affects the eligibility determination and the user's immediate actions.
