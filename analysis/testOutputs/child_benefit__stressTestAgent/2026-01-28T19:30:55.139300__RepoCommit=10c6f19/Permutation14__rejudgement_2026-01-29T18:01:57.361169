**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Temporary absence correctly handled**: The agent properly recognized that the child's 6-week stay with grandmother during the mother's surgery recovery is a temporary arrangement that does not disqualify eligibility. The agent correctly cited the 52-week rule for temporary separations.

2. **All eligibility criteria verified**: The agent systematically confirmed:
   - Child under 16/20 and in UK
   - Mother is responsible for the child (pays for everything)
   - Both are UK residents/citizens
   - No one else is claiming Child Benefit
   - No immigration restrictions
   - Mother is the parent with ongoing responsibility

3. **Correct application of 8-week rule**: While the agent mentioned the 52-week rule (which is accurate), the scenario specifically relates to the 8-week rule where Child Benefit continues when a child temporarily lives elsewhere and no one else claims. The 6-week duration falls well within this threshold.

4. **Clear outcome communicated**: The agent explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided sound reasoning.

The agent's assessment aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
