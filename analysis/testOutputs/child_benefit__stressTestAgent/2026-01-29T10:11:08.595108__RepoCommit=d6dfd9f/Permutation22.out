2026-01-29T10:22:25.585904 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T10:22:27.038263 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Arthur. He's 7 years old.

2026-01-29T10:22:28.922979 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Do you live with Arthur and are you responsible for raising him on a day-to-day basis?

2026-01-29T10:22:31.396699 [actor]: Well, that's a bit complicated at the moment. Arthur has been in the hospital. He was there for 10 weeks, then came home for 2 weeks, but he fell ill again and had to go back. He's been back in the hospital for 3 weeks now.

2026-01-29T10:22:33.828020 [root_agent]: I'm sorry to hear Arthur has been unwell. I hope he recovers soon.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand the situation better. When Arthur is not in hospital, does he normally live with you in your home?

2026-01-29T10:22:35.363145 [actor]: Yes, he normally lives with me at home. When he's well, he's always with me.

2026-01-29T10:22:37.115534 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. 

Just to confirm - when Arthur is in hospital, is he expected to return home to live with you once he's well enough to be discharged?

2026-01-29T10:22:38.835429 [actor]: Yes, of course. He'll come back home to me as soon as he's well enough to leave the hospital.

2026-01-29T10:22:40.819779 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful to know.

Now, are you the person who is mainly responsible for Arthur - meaning you're the one who looks after him and makes decisions about his care and upbringing?

2026-01-29T10:22:42.529823 [actor]: Yes, I am. I'm his mum and I'm the one who looks after him and makes all the decisions about his care.

2026-01-29T10:22:44.244447 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Arthur, or are you asking because you'd like to make a new claim?

2026-01-29T10:22:46.373121 [actor]: I'm currently receiving Child Benefit for Arthur, but I'm worried about whether I can still get it since he's been in hospital for so long now.

2026-01-29T10:22:49.056988 [root_agent]: I understand your concern. That's a very reasonable question given Arthur's hospital stays.

To help clarify your situation, I need to ask: Is Arthur in an NHS hospital or a similar medical facility where the costs of his care and accommodation are being met by the NHS or local authority?

2026-01-29T10:22:50.554839 [actor]: Yes, he's in an NHS hospital. The NHS is covering all his care and accommodation costs.

2026-01-29T10:22:53.221054 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. This is important information.

One final question: Has Arthur been in hospital continuously for more than 12 weeks, or have his hospital stays (when added together) been interrupted by his time at home?

2026-01-29T10:22:55.333932 [actor]: Well, his stays have been interrupted. He was in for 10 weeks first, then came home for 2 weeks, then went back in and he's been there for 3 weeks now. So it wasn't continuous - he had that 2-week break at home in between.

2026-01-29T10:23:00.338551 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you remain eligible for Child Benefit for Arthur.**

Here's why:

Since Arthur's hospital stays have been **interrupted** by his time at home (the 2-week period between admissions), they are not counted as one continuous stay. This means the 12-week rule for children in hospital doesn't apply in your situation yet.

According to the rules, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for a child who is temporarily in hospital, as long as:
- The child normally lives with you (which Arthur does)
- They are expected to return home to you (which he is)
- You remain responsible for them (which you are)

The 12-week limit would only apply if Arthur were in hospital **continuously** for more than 12 weeks. Since his stays were broken up by coming home, each hospital stay is counted separately.

So you should continue to receive your Child Benefit as normal. There's no need to worry about losing it based on what you've described.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T10:23:02.469705 [actor]: Oh, that's such a relief! I was really worried about it. No, I think that's everything I needed to know. Thank you so much for explaining it all to me.

2026-01-29T10:23:07.076151 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, when calculating the 12-week period for children in hospital, breaks at home of 28 days or less do not restart the count - the hospital stays are added together cumulatively. With 10 weeks + 3 weeks = 13 weeks total, Arthur has exceeded the 12-week threshold, making the claimant ineligible for Child Benefit after the cumulative 12th week.
