2026-01-29T10:19:39.685961 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-29T10:19:41.929337 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have two children - they're 8 and 10 years old.

2026-01-29T10:19:44.395079 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Are you responsible for the child or children? This means do they live with you, or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent in kind) towards looking after them?

2026-01-29T10:19:45.950943 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for them. They live with me and my wife.

2026-01-29T10:19:47.707592 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Next question: Do you or your wife normally live in the UK? (This includes being ordinarily resident in the UK, even if you're temporarily away)

2026-01-29T10:19:49.349012 [actor]: Well, no actually. I'm currently posted to Germany with the British Armed Forces. My wife and children are living here with me on the base.

2026-01-29T10:19:51.486151 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Being posted abroad with the British Armed Forces is an important detail.

Let me ask: Are you a member of HM Forces (British Armed Forces) who is subject to UK tax on your pay?

2026-01-29T10:19:53.011415 [actor]: Yes, that's correct. I'm Major Thompson with the British Armed Forces and I am subject to UK tax on my pay.

2026-01-29T10:19:55.086525 [root_agent]: Thank you, Major Thompson. That's very helpful information.

One more question to confirm your eligibility: Has anyone else already claimed Child Benefit for these same children? For example, has your wife or anyone else made a claim for them?

2026-01-29T10:19:56.691823 [actor]: No, no one else has claimed Child Benefit for them. Neither my wife nor anyone else has made a claim.

2026-01-29T10:20:00.358722 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions, Major Thompson.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have two children aged 8 and 10 (both under 16)
✓ You are responsible for them - they live with you
✓ You are a member of HM Forces subject to UK tax on your pay (this means you're treated as ordinarily resident in the UK even though you're posted to Germany)
✓ No one else has claimed Child Benefit for these children

As a member of the British Armed Forces subject to UK tax, you meet the residency requirements for Child Benefit even while posted abroad.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for both of your children. Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T10:20:03.849021 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T10:20:06.488207 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that as a member of HM Forces subject to UK tax, the user meets the residency requirements for Child Benefit even while posted abroad in Germany, and correctly verified all other eligibility criteria (children under 16, living with the claimant, and no duplicate claims).
