2026-01-29T10:15:53.452440 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T10:15:55.239375 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. I'm looking after a 12-year-old boy named Liam.

2026-01-29T10:15:57.196068 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Are you responsible for Liam? This means you live with him and are responsible for his care - such as providing for his food, clothing, and general welfare.**

2026-01-29T10:15:58.973190 [actor]: Yes, I am. He lives with me and I look after him. He was placed with me by the local authority - I'm his foster carer.

2026-01-29T10:16:01.159451 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're Liam's foster carer.

**Is Liam living with you under a formal fostering arrangement where the local authority is paying you a fostering allowance?**

This is important because it affects Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-29T10:16:02.810161 [actor]: Yes, that's right. The local council pays me a fostering allowance that covers his accommodation and maintenance.

2026-01-29T10:16:06.478551 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam**. 

This is because when a child is looked after by the local authority and placed with foster carers who receive a fostering allowance, the foster carer cannot claim Child Benefit for that child. The fostering allowance you receive from the local council is meant to cover the costs of looking after Liam.

However, if you have any other children living with you who are not in foster care, you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for them.

**Do you have any other children in your household who are not foster children?**

2026-01-29T10:16:08.750926 [actor]: No, it's just me and Liam. So I can't claim Child Benefit for him then because of the fostering allowance from the council. I understand, thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T10:16:12.257719 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that foster carers receiving a fostering allowance from the local authority are not eligible to claim Child Benefit for the fostered child, as the fostering allowance is intended to cover the child's costs.
