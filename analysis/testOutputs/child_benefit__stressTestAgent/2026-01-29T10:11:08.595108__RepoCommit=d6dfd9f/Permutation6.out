2026-01-29T10:13:46.893918 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T10:13:48.647160 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter who's 6 years old.

2026-01-29T10:13:50.056494 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Does your daughter normally live with you, or are you responsible for her care?**

2026-01-29T10:13:52.259242 [actor]: Well, she normally lives with me, but she's been in hospital for about 14 weeks now. She has a serious condition, so she's been there for quite a while. But I visit her every day and I'm still looking after her needs - I spend money each week on things like books, pyjamas, and special food for her.

2026-01-29T10:13:55.005526 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that - I'm sorry to hear your daughter has been unwell.

This is an important detail. Let me ask:

**Has your daughter been in hospital continuously for 12 weeks or more, or is it expected that she will be in hospital for at least 12 weeks in total?**

2026-01-29T10:13:56.568874 [actor]: Yes, she has been in hospital continuously for 14 weeks now, so it's been more than 12 weeks.

2026-01-29T10:13:58.832899 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to understand your residency status:

**Are you living in the UK, and do you have the right to reside here (for example, are you a UK citizen, or do you have settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another immigration status that gives you the right to live in the UK)?**

2026-01-29T10:14:00.340868 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK citizen and I live here in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:14:02.782560 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me ask one more important question:

**Are you the only person claiming Child Benefit for your daughter, or is someone else (such as another parent or guardian) also claiming or planning to claim Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-29T10:14:04.526498 [actor]: No, I'm the only one claiming. It's just me - I'm her mum and I'm responsible for her.

2026-01-29T10:14:09.784543 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to give you some important guidance about your situation:

**You are generally eligible for Child Benefit** as you:
- Have a child under 16
- Are a UK citizen living in the UK
- Are responsible for your daughter's care
- Are the only person claiming for her

However, there's an **important rule** that applies to your specific circumstances:

When a child has been in hospital continuously for **12 weeks or more**, Child Benefit normally stops being paid. This rule exists because the NHS is covering the child's care costs during their hospital stay.

**But there's good news:** You mentioned you're still spending money on your daughter's needs (books, pyjamas, special food, etc.) while she's in hospital. If you're continuing to contribute to the costs of looking after your child while they're in hospital, you may still be able to receive Child Benefit.

**What you should do:** You need to contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them of your daughter's hospital stay and explain that you're still contributing to her care costs. They can then assess your individual situation and determine whether you can continue receiving Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T10:14:11.809554 [actor]: No, that's very helpful, thank you. I'll make sure to contact the Child Benefit Office and let them know about the situation.

2026-01-29T10:14:16.169890 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that while the standard rule would stop Child Benefit after 12 weeks of continuous hospitalization, an exception applies when the parent continues to contribute to care costs, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (via Exception)" and aligns with the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care.
