2026-01-29T10:14:18.040272 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:14:19.512936 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Jack. He's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T10:14:21.469839 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Do you live in the UK, or are you a member of HM Forces or a civil servant posted abroad?**

2026-01-29T10:14:22.907952 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:14:24.619843 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

**Is Jack living with you, or does he live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T10:14:26.449384 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. Jack was placed in local authority care about 3 months ago, but he comes home to stay with me every weekend - he arrives Friday evening and leaves Sunday evening.

2026-01-29T10:14:28.552833 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this is a complicated situation.

Let me ask you this: **Is the local authority paying for Jack's accommodation while he's in care during the week?**

2026-01-29T10:14:30.040500 [actor]: Yes, the local authority is paying for his accommodation while he's in care during the week.

2026-01-29T10:14:32.699018 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

**When Jack comes home to stay with you on weekends, does he stay for more than 52 nights per year in total?**

(To help you work this out: if he stays every weekend from Friday to Sunday evening, that would typically be around 104 nights per year - 2 nights per weekend × 52 weeks)

2026-01-29T10:14:34.885210 [actor]: Yes, he does. He stays with me every weekend - Friday and Saturday nights - so that's 2 nights every week, which would be about 104 nights a year.

2026-01-29T10:14:38.709361 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me give you an assessment based on what you've told me.

**Based on the information you've provided, you ARE eligible for Child Benefit for Jack.**

Here's why:

Even though Jack is in local authority care during the week with the local authority paying for his accommodation, you can still claim Child Benefit because he stays with you for more than 52 nights per year. In your case, he's staying approximately 104 nights per year (every weekend), which exceeds the 52-night threshold.

The rule is that if a child in care or hospital stays with you for more than 52 nights a year, you can claim Child Benefit for the weeks when they stay with you.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about claiming Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-29T10:14:42.406276 [actor]: No, that's very helpful. Thank you for clarifying that for me. I'm glad to know I can still claim Child Benefit even though Jack is in care during the week.

2026-01-29T10:14:45.073921 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the exception rule that allows parents to claim Child Benefit when a child in local authority care stays with them for more than 52 nights per year, correctly calculating that weekend stays amount to approximately 104 nights annually, which exceeds the threshold.
