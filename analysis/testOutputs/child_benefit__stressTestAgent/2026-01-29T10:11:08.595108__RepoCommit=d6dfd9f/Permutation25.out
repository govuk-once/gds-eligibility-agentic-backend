2026-01-29T10:24:28.056575 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:24:29.521982 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Leo, who's 5 years old.

2026-01-29T10:24:31.384125 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about Leo.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Do you live with Leo, or does he live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T10:24:33.068150 [actor]: He's been living with someone else - he's been in local authority care for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-29T10:24:35.698993 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand Leo has been in local authority care for 10 weeks.

Let me ask you:

**Are you still contributing to the cost of providing for Leo (for example, contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay, or the equivalent value in kind)?**

2026-01-29T10:24:37.740526 [actor]: No, I'm not able to contribute myself - I don't have any income. But my husband, who is Leo's stepfather and lives with me, sends £30 a week to Leo's carer to help with his upkeep.

2026-01-29T10:24:39.580599 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Let me ask you:

**Is your husband (Leo's stepfather) responsible for Leo - meaning, was he living with Leo and providing for him before Leo went into local authority care?**

2026-01-29T10:24:41.474666 [actor]: Yes, he was. We were all living together as a family before Leo went into care, and my husband was helping to provide for him.

2026-01-29T10:24:44.620964 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now, let me ask:

**Is the £30 per week that your husband is contributing at least equal to the amount that Child Benefit would pay for Leo?**

(For context, Child Benefit is currently paid at £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, and £16.95 per week for each additional child.)

2026-01-29T10:24:46.277586 [actor]: Yes, it is. He's contributing £30 per week, which is more than the £25.60 Child Benefit rate for an only child.

2026-01-29T10:24:48.526826 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, let me ask one final question to complete the assessment:

**Are you or your husband currently responsible for any other children under 16 (or under 20 if in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T10:24:50.362293 [actor]: No, Leo is our only child.

2026-01-29T10:24:55.450168 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you may be eligible for Child Benefit** for Leo, even though he is in local authority care.

Here's why:

- Leo is under 16 years old
- Your husband was responsible for Leo before he went into care (they lived together as a family)
- Your husband is contributing at least the Child Benefit rate (£30 per week, which exceeds the £25.60 rate) towards Leo's upkeep

Under the rules, when a child is in local authority care, you can still claim Child Benefit if you're contributing to the cost of providing for them at a rate that's at least equal to what Child Benefit would pay. Since your husband meets this condition and was responsible for Leo before he went into care, either you or your husband should be able to claim.

**Next steps:** You should apply for Child Benefit if you haven't already, or if you were previously claiming it, you should inform the Child Benefit Office about your circumstances to ensure your claim continues.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:24:57.797647 [actor]: No, that's very helpful, thank you. I'm glad to know that my husband's contributions count and that we may still be eligible. I'll get in touch with the Child Benefit Office about our situation.

2026-01-29T10:25:02.309014 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rules for children in local authority care, correctly identifying that contributions at or above the Child Benefit rate (£30/week vs £25.60/week) from a person who was previously responsible for the child can maintain eligibility.
