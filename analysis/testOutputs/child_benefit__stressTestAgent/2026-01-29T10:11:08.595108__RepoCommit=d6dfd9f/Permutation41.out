2026-01-29T10:33:59.160654 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:34:01.275365 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have two children, Ben who's 10 and Jerry who's 8. They live with my ex-partner though, not with me.

2026-01-29T10:34:04.837098 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand your situation better: **Do you contribute to the cost of raising Ben and Jerry, for example by paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit would be (currently at least £25.60 a week for the eldest child and £16.95 per week for each additional child)?**

2026-01-29T10:34:06.447105 [actor]: Yes, I do contribute. I pay £40 per week towards their costs.

2026-01-29T10:34:08.128865 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to understand more about your ex-partner's situation: **Is your ex-partner currently claiming Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry?**

2026-01-29T10:34:09.739752 [actor]: Yes, my ex-partner is currently claiming Child Benefit for both Ben and Jerry.

2026-01-29T10:34:13.373930 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to let you know that **only one person can get Child Benefit for each child**. Since your ex-partner is already claiming Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry, you would not be eligible to claim it as well.

However, there is an option available if circumstances change: if you and your ex-partner both contribute to the children's upbringing, you can agree between yourselves who should claim the Child Benefit. If you both think you should be the one to claim it instead, your ex-partner would need to stop their claim first, and then you could make a new claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T10:34:15.729236 [actor]: Wait, but I thought there was something about if you contribute at least as much as the Child Benefit amount, you might still be able to claim it even if the children don't live with you? I pay £40 a week towards their costs - doesn't that count for anything?

2026-01-29T10:34:19.456153 [root_agent]: You've raised a really good point, and I apologize for not being clearer. Let me reconsider your situation more carefully.

You're right that there are provisions for people who don't live with the child but contribute to their costs. However, I need to clarify an important detail about your contributions:

**Do you pay this £40 per week directly to your ex-partner, or do you pay it towards specific costs for the children (such as paying directly for things like childcare, school expenses, clothing, etc.)?**

This distinction is important because the rules around claiming Child Benefit when a child lives with someone else can depend on the nature of your financial contribution.

2026-01-29T10:34:21.006334 [actor]: I pay the £40 per week directly to my ex-partner to help with the children's costs.

2026-01-29T10:34:25.777139 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

I need to be honest with you: based on the information you've provided, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation**.

Here's why:

1. **Only one person can receive Child Benefit for each child** - your ex-partner is already claiming it for Ben and Jerry.

2. **The children live with your ex-partner**, not with you, which means your ex-partner has the primary responsibility for them.

3. While you do contribute financially (£40 per week), **payments made directly to the other parent don't generally qualify you to claim Child Benefit when that parent is already claiming it and the children live with them**.

The Child Benefit system prioritizes the person the child lives with. The contribution rules you mentioned typically apply in more specific circumstances, such as when a child lives with someone else who is *not* claiming Child Benefit.

Your financial contributions are important for supporting your children, but they don't create a separate entitlement to Child Benefit in this case.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T10:34:27.897954 [actor]: Oh, I see. So because my ex-partner is already claiming it and the children live with them, I can't claim it even though I contribute. That makes sense now. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T10:34:32.023276 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that only one person can claim Child Benefit per child, and since the ex-partner is already claiming it for both children and they live with the ex-partner, the user is not eligible to claim it despite making financial contributions.
