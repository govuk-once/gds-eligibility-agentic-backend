2026-01-29T10:11:10.640487 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T10:11:12.392954 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have a son who's 8 years old and lives with me.

2026-01-29T10:11:14.369576 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next, I need to ask: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:11:16.180609 [actor]: Yes, I do. I live in Manchester with my husband and our son.

2026-01-29T10:11:18.141403 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask: **Are you or your husband the person mainly responsible for your son? In other words, are you or your husband the one who is primarily looking after him?**

2026-01-29T10:11:19.861616 [actor]: Yes, we are. My son Leo lives with us - with me and my husband - and we look after him.

2026-01-29T10:11:21.371112 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question: **Are either you or your husband currently claiming Child Benefit for your son?**

2026-01-29T10:11:23.289459 [actor]: No, we're not currently claiming it. That's why I'm asking about eligibility - I want to know if we can claim it.

2026-01-29T10:11:26.326471 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

I have one final question to complete the assessment: **Do you or your husband have the right to claim benefits in the UK? This means you would typically be a UK citizen, have settled status, or have the right to reside and claim benefits here.**

2026-01-29T10:11:28.400304 [actor]: Yes, we both do. We're both UK nationals, so we have the right to claim benefits here.

2026-01-29T10:11:32.647507 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 8-year-old son)
✓ Your son lives with you
✓ You and your husband are responsible for looking after him
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You have the right to claim benefits in the UK as UK nationals
✓ Neither of you is currently claiming Child Benefit for him

Since you meet all the eligibility criteria, you should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit for your son. Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, so either you or your husband can make the claim (but not both).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:11:38.387354 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, asked appropriate questions about the child's age, residence, responsibility for care, UK residency, and right to claim benefits, and correctly concluded that the user is eligible based on the information provided.
