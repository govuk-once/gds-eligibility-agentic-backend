2026-01-29T10:26:51.212659 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:26:52.801335 [actor]: Hi, yes I do. My son Jordan is 17 and lives with me.

2026-01-29T10:26:55.389336 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Is Jordan currently in approved education or training?**

(This could include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or similar qualifications at school, college, or through training providers)

2026-01-29T10:26:57.188261 [actor]: No, he's not. He finished his GCSEs last year and he's not in college or doing any training or anything like that.

2026-01-29T10:26:59.548680 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Since Jordan is 17 and not in approved education or training, I need to understand your situation a bit more.

**When did Jordan finish his education or training? Was it before or after he turned 16?**

(This is important because eligibility can continue for a short period after education ends, depending on the circumstances)

2026-01-29T10:27:01.304895 [actor]: He left school after finishing his GCSEs last year, so he would have been 16 at the time.

2026-01-29T10:27:03.819593 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Is Jordan currently registered with a careers service or with Connexions (or the equivalent service in your area)?**

(After leaving education, there can be a limited extension period for Child Benefit in certain circumstances, and registration with these services can be relevant to eligibility)

2026-01-29T10:27:05.475374 [actor]: No, he's not registered with any careers service or anything like that. He's just been at home, not really doing much to be honest.

2026-01-29T10:27:09.356669 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining Jordan's situation.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to let you know that **you would not currently be eligible for Child Benefit for Jordan**.

Here's why:

- Child Benefit is payable for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training
- Jordan is 17 and is not currently in approved education or training
- Since he left education after turning 16 and is not enrolled in any approved courses, he doesn't meet the criteria for the extension beyond age 16

Child Benefit would have stopped being payable for Jordan once he left approved education after his 16th birthday.

**Do you have any other children under 16, or under 20 who are in approved education or training, for whom you might be eligible?**

2026-01-29T10:27:12.802199 [actor]: No, Jordan is my only child. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T10:27:14.996576 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my 17-year-old son Jordan is not in approved education or training, which is required for Child Benefit to continue beyond age 16.
