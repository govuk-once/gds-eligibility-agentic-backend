2026-01-29T10:12:47.372547 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T10:12:48.955861 [actor]: Yes, I have a daughter. She's 18 years old.

2026-01-29T10:12:50.815368 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To assess your eligibility, I need to know: **Is your 18-year-old daughter currently in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T10:12:52.952390 [actor]: No, she's not. She left school two years ago and now she works as a receptionist. She's doing about 30 hours a week.

2026-01-29T10:12:56.565954 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to let you know that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** for your daughter in this situation.

Here's why: Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 16, or for young people aged 16 to 19 if they are in approved education or training. Since your daughter is 18, working as a receptionist for 30 hours a week, and not in approved education or training, she doesn't meet the eligibility criteria.

Child Benefit stops when a young person:
- Turns 20, or
- Leaves approved education or training (whichever comes first)

Since your daughter left school two years ago and is now working full-time, Child Benefit would have stopped when she left education.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T10:12:59.910247 [actor]: Oh, I see. That makes sense - she's been working for a while now. Thank you for explaining that to me. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T10:13:02.291653 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the claimant is not eligible for Child Benefit because their 18-year-old daughter is working full-time and not in approved education or training, which is correct according to Child Benefit rules that cover children under 16 or under 20 if in approved education or training.
