2026-01-29T10:15:25.092680 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T10:15:26.642592 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who is 5 years old, his name is Hans.

2026-01-29T10:15:28.430932 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Does Hans normally live with you, or does he live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T10:15:29.811432 [actor]: Yes, Hans lives with me. He normally lives with me.

2026-01-29T10:15:31.717183 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

**Are you responsible for Hans? This means you're the one who looks after him and pays for things like his food, clothes, and other needs.**

2026-01-29T10:15:33.420454 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for Hans. I look after him and pay for all his needs - his food, clothes, and everything else he needs.

2026-01-29T10:15:35.423168 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

**Are you living in the UK, or do you have a specific connection to the UK such as working here or receiving a UK State Pension?**

2026-01-29T10:15:36.998823 [actor]: Yes, I'm living in the UK. I moved here recently from Germany.

2026-01-29T10:15:39.274094 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Hans? For example, could Hans's other parent or another family member already be receiving Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-29T10:15:40.744761 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Hans. It's just me looking after him.

2026-01-29T10:15:45.274888 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

✓ You have a child (Hans) who is 5 years old - under the age limit
✓ Hans normally lives with you
✓ You are responsible for Hans and pay for his needs
✓ You are living in the UK
✓ Nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Hans

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

You meet all the key criteria:
- You're responsible for a child under 16
- The child lives with you
- You live in the UK
- No one else is claiming for the same child

You can now apply for Child Benefit if you haven't already done so. The benefit is usually paid every 4 weeks, though you may be able to get it paid weekly if you're a single parent or getting certain other benefits.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:15:48.961248 [actor]: That's great news, thank you so much for your help! I'll go ahead and apply for it then.

2026-01-29T10:15:51.111540 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately verified all necessary criteria (child under 16 living with the claimant, claimant's responsibility for the child, UK residency, and no duplicate claims) and correctly concluded eligibility for Child Benefit based on the information provided.
