2026-01-29T10:16:14.115867 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T10:16:16.142981 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Ryan. He's 17 and lives with me at home.

2026-01-29T10:16:18.063028 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Ryan live with you in the UK?

2026-01-29T10:16:19.872005 [actor]: Yes, he does. We live in the UK together.

2026-01-29T10:16:22.093164 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. 

Is Ryan in full-time non-advanced education or approved training? For example, is he in school, college doing A-levels or similar qualifications, or in an approved training programme?

2026-01-29T10:16:24.028833 [actor]: He's just started an apprenticeship actually - an Intermediate Apprenticeship. He finished school and started it recently.

2026-01-29T10:16:26.235872 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Can I ask - is this Intermediate Apprenticeship an approved training programme? Specifically, is it unpaid or does Ryan receive £173 or less per week in training allowance?

2026-01-29T10:16:28.518656 [actor]: It's a government-funded apprenticeship, so he does get paid for it. I think apprentices get the apprentice minimum wage, which is more than £173 a week when you work full-time hours.

2026-01-29T10:16:30.921996 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Just to confirm - you mentioned Ryan is 17. Can you tell me his exact age, or when he turns 18? This is important because the rules for Child Benefit eligibility change depending on whether a young person is under or over certain age thresholds.

2026-01-29T10:16:32.660646 [actor]: He turned 17 about three months ago, so he won't be 18 for another nine months or so.

2026-01-29T10:16:34.530847 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Are you the person responsible for Ryan? By this I mean, are you the main person who looks after him and meets the costs of bringing him up?

2026-01-29T10:16:36.759185 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm his mum and he lives with me. I pay for everything - the rent, food, all his costs.

2026-01-29T10:16:40.666995 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, here's my assessment of your eligibility for Child Benefit:

**You are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ryan.**

Here's why:
- You are responsible for Ryan and meet the costs of bringing him up
- He lives with you in the UK
- He is under 20 years old (currently 17)
- Although he's in an apprenticeship that pays more than £173 per week, approved apprenticeships do count as approved training for Child Benefit purposes, even if they're paid

The key point is that Ryan is under 20 and in an approved apprenticeship, which qualifies as approved training. This means you can continue to claim Child Benefit for him.

However, please note that Child Benefit will stop when Ryan either:
- Turns 20, or
- Leaves his approved training

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:16:46.419915 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, young people aged 16-19 in paid work (including apprenticeships where they earn above £173 per week) do not qualify for Child Benefit - only those in full-time non-advanced education or unpaid approved training qualify, and the agent explicitly confirmed Ryan earns more than £173 per week in his apprenticeship.
