2026-01-15T12:24:24.413045 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:24:25.358047 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?


2026-01-15T12:24:26.489790 [actor]: 14 son

2026-01-15T12:24:27.003157 [root_agent]: Thank you. And is your son currently living with you full-time?

2026-01-15T12:24:27.702786 [actor]: weekend visits from care

2026-01-15T12:24:28.209305 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Is your son in local authority care?

2026-01-15T12:24:28.873710 [actor]: yes 3 months now

2026-01-15T12:24:29.502057 [root_agent]: Thank you. And to confirm, has your son been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks continuously?

2026-01-15T12:24:30.256314 [actor]: yes more than 8 weeks

2026-01-15T12:24:31.315079 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. When he is not in care, does he spend at least two nights in a row with you, or a total of 24 hours or more in a week with you?

2026-01-15T12:24:32.024312 [actor]: friday saturday night every week

2026-01-15T12:24:33.629169 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you *are* likely still eligible for Child Benefit. 

Even though your son is in local authority care, because he spends every weekend with you – including two nights in a row – this meets the exception to the usual rules. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





2026-01-15T12:24:34.980824 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know I'm eligible for Child Benefit. That's helpful information.

2026-01-15T12:24:37.327775 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that David remains eligible for Child Benefit despite Jack being in care for more than 8 weeks because Jack spends two consecutive nights (Friday and Saturday) at David's home every weekend, which meets the exception criteria.
