2026-01-15T12:32:51.536723 [root_agent]: Hello! I can help you with that. To start, could you please confirm how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:32:52.155245 [actor]: forty

2026-01-15T12:32:52.712015 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you the parent or legal guardian of the child the Child Benefit would be for?

2026-01-15T12:32:53.320313 [actor]: mark mother

2026-01-15T12:32:53.847003 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Is Mark currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:32:54.518619 [actor]: prison youth custody

2026-01-15T12:32:55.409410 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So, Mark is currently in youth custody. Could you please confirm how long Mark has been in custody? Knowing the length of time will help me assess eligibility.

2026-01-15T12:32:56.103008 [actor]: ten weeks now

2026-01-15T12:32:57.575497 [root_agent]: Thank you. According to the rules, Child Benefit generally stops when a child is in custody for more than 8 weeks. As Mark has been in custody for 10 weeks, unfortunately, it appears you are no longer eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for him. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





2026-01-15T12:32:59.540991 [actor]: no why stopped need money

2026-01-15T12:33:00.943673 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidelines, Child Benefit payments stop after a child has been in custody for more than 8 weeks, and since Mark has been detained for 10 weeks, the mother is no longer eligible.
