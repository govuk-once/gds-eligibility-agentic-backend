2026-01-15T12:35:26.570298 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:35:27.579043 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand. I'm root_agent, and I'm here to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me your age?


2026-01-15T12:35:28.184024 [actor]: seventeen

2026-01-15T12:35:29.036575 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently in full-time non-advanced education? (This includes things like A-Levels or equivalent, or a course below degree level).





2026-01-15T12:35:29.708290 [actor]: modern apprentice glasgow

2026-01-15T12:35:30.937660 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, a Modern Apprenticeship is a vocational training programme, is that correct?



I'm asking because the rules around apprenticeships and Child Benefit can be a little complex. I want to make sure I understand your situation accurately.

2026-01-15T12:35:31.685787 [actor]: yes training getting paid

2026-01-15T12:35:32.989001 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Generally, Child Benefit doesn't continue once a person turns 16 and starts a full-time apprenticeship in Scotland, England or Northern Ireland. 

To be certain, could you tell me if this apprenticeship is part of a formal government-approved scheme?

2026-01-15T12:35:33.817777 [actor]: Scottish government approve apprenticeship scheme

2026-01-15T12:35:35.593960 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Based on the information you've provided – you are 17, undertaking a Scottish Government approved apprenticeship scheme, and receiving payment for it – it seems you are **not** eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit.

The rules state that Child Benefit usually stops when a person starts an apprenticeship. Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or are you happy with this initial assessment?





2026-01-15T12:35:37.242525 [actor]: why not eligible

2026-01-15T12:35:39.733937 [root_agent]: Certainly. Child Benefit generally stops when a person turns 16 and begins a full-time apprenticeship in Scotland, England, or Northern Ireland. This is because apprenticeships are considered a form of qualifying employment or training.

The government considers that once someone is in an apprenticeship, they are gaining skills and earning money, and therefore are no longer considered dependent for financial support through Child Benefit. 

There *is* an exception in Wales, where Child Benefit can continue for up to 2 years while someone is doing an apprenticeship, but this doesn’t apply in Scotland.

Does that explanation make sense?

2026-01-15T12:35:40.481281 [actor]: father can claim benefit?

2026-01-15T12:35:42.879184 [root_agent]: That's a good question. Your father may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for you, but only if *he* meets the eligibility requirements and you meet specific conditions as a young person. 

Specifically, even though you're doing an apprenticeship, Child Benefit *might* still be payable if you're earning less than £184 per week from your apprenticeship. 

To determine if your father can claim, could you tell me approximately how much you earn per week from your Modern Apprenticeship? It’s okay to give an estimate.

2026-01-15T12:35:43.556973 [actor]: earn £120 weekly

2026-01-15T12:35:45.998711 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Since you earn £120 per week from your apprenticeship, which is less than £184, your father *may* be able to claim Child Benefit for you.

However, your father would need to meet the other eligibility requirements for Child Benefit himself (such as being responsible for your care and meeting the National Insurance requirements). It's ultimately his decision whether to apply and it will be up to HMRC to confirm his eligibility.

Would you like me to summarise the key points of our conversation, or is there anything else I can help you with?

2026-01-15T12:35:49.969391 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent provided incorrect information by stating the father may be eligible if the apprentice earns less than £184 weekly. For Child Benefit in Scotland, Modern Apprenticeships are not approved training regardless of earnings, and payments should stop when a child starts an apprenticeship.
