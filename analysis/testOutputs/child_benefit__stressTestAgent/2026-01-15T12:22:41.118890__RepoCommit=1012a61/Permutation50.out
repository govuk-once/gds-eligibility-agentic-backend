2026-01-15T12:37:35.869952 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:37:36.492961 [root_agent]: Okay, I can help you with that. 

To start, could you please tell me your age?


2026-01-15T12:37:37.347677 [actor]: I'm looking about child benefit I'm in Scotland

2026-01-15T12:37:38.560601 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you're in Scotland. That's helpful.

Are you currently in full-time, non-advanced education? (For example, A-levels, or equivalent, or are you in Scotland doing Highers or Advanced Highers?)

2026-01-15T12:37:39.400208 [actor]: no left school already but doing training programme in Edinburgh

2026-01-15T12:37:40.394125 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. You've left school and are now doing a training programme in Edinburgh.

Could you tell me what kind of training programme it is? Specifically, is it an apprenticeship?

2026-01-15T12:37:41.013824 [actor]: No One Left Behind

2026-01-15T12:37:41.981346 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you are participating in the "No One Left Behind" training programme.

Just to confirm, this programme requires you to train for at least 30 hours a week?

2026-01-15T12:37:42.685083 [actor]: yes full time all week

2026-01-15T12:37:43.277087 [root_agent]: Okay, excellent. And just one final question for now - is this training programme funded by the Scottish Government?

2026-01-15T12:37:43.936795 [actor]: yes scotland funded

2026-01-15T12:37:46.161524 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. 

Based on the information you’ve provided – you are over 16, no longer in full-time non-advanced education, and participating in the Scottish Government funded "No One Left Behind" training programme in Edinburgh – you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. This programme is specifically recognised as an exception to the usual rules regarding eligibility while undertaking training.



However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that the training is expected to last for at least 30 hours per week?

2026-01-15T12:37:46.976993 [actor]: yes told you already 30 hours

2026-01-15T12:37:49.291138 [root_agent]: You are absolutely right to call me out on that! My apologies – I should have remembered that information. I am still under development and working on improving my memory.

Therefore, based on all the information you've given me, you *are* eligible for Child Benefit. You are over 16, no longer in full-time non-advanced education, and completing the Scottish Government funded "No One Left Behind" training program for at least 30 hours a week.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit today?

2026-01-15T12:37:52.301479 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that the "No One Left Behind" programme in Scotland is an approved training scheme that qualifies for Child Benefit eligibility.
