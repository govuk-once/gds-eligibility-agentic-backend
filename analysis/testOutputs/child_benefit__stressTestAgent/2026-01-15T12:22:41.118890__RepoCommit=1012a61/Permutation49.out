2026-01-15T12:37:16.422335 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:37:17.206688 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me your age?


2026-01-15T12:37:17.840375 [actor]: i'm 38 years old

2026-01-15T12:37:18.671909 [root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently in full-time education? By full-time education, I mean studying for at least 12 hours a week.





2026-01-15T12:37:19.510007 [actor]: no not me but my son tom

2026-01-15T12:37:20.085462 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're asking about your son, Tom. 

How old is Tom?

2026-01-15T12:37:20.848666 [actor]: 17 years old

2026-01-15T12:37:21.546345 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Is Tom currently in full-time education? This means studying for at least 12 hours a week.

2026-01-15T12:37:22.163954 [actor]: doing computer coding course

2026-01-15T12:37:23.230490 [root_agent]: Thank you. Is this computer coding course funded by a future employer as part of an agreement that he will join them afterwards? In other words, is it a course with an employer’s agreement to secure a job?

2026-01-15T12:37:24.058166 [actor]: yes company pays for course then he works there

2026-01-15T12:37:27.034316 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided, Tom's course doesn't qualify as 'approved education' for Child Benefit purposes, as it's being funded by a future employer as part of a job agreement. 

Therefore, it's unlikely you would be eligible for Child Benefit for Tom. However, to be absolutely sure, could you confirm whether Tom is receiving any other financial support or benefits? This won’t change the eligibility based on education, but helps to have a complete picture.



*(Internal thought: The provided links state that courses with an employer’s agreement are not considered approved education. I’ve explained this to the user and asked a clarifying question to ensure no other factors are at play).*

2026-01-15T12:37:27.819996 [actor]: he's not paid anything just gets the course free

2026-01-15T12:37:28.634567 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Tom isn’t receiving any other financial support besides the course being free.

Just to be absolutely certain, is Tom living with you?

2026-01-15T12:37:29.379196 [actor]: yes at home with me

2026-01-15T12:37:32.281122 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Based on everything you've told me: Tom is 17, undertaking a computer coding course funded by a future employer as part of a job agreement, and he lives at home with you.

Unfortunately, this means you are not eligible for Child Benefit for Tom. The rules state that 16-19 year olds are generally only eligible if they are in approved education *and* not funded by an employer in that way.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?



*(Internal thought: I’ve reviewed the information against the provided links and confirmed the ineligibility. I've clearly explained the reasoning to the user and offered further assistance.)*

2026-01-15T12:37:35.320981 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly determined that Child Benefit isn't available when the child is taking a course with an employer's agreement, which matches the expected outcome for this scenario.
