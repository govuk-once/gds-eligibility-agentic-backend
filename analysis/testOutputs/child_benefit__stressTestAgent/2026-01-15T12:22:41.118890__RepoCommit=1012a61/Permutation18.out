2026-01-15T12:27:24.266260 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you're eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:27:25.076978 [actor]: I want to know child benefit son in college

2026-01-15T12:27:25.935080 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying you're asking about Child Benefit for your son who is in college.

To assess eligibility, could you please tell me how old your son is?

2026-01-15T12:27:26.722416 [actor]: he is 19 studying A levels

2026-01-15T12:27:27.174000 [root_agent]: Thank you. And is your son in full-time education?

2026-01-15T12:27:27.949141 [actor]: yes full time a levels

2026-01-15T12:27:28.522285 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. Just to confirm, is your son currently receiving Child Benefit?

2026-01-15T12:27:29.344648 [actor]: yes we get it now birthday soon

2026-01-15T12:27:30.530510 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know his birthday is soon. Just so I understand correctly – when your son turns 20, he will no longer be eligible for Child Benefit, even though he's still studying his A-levels. Is that something you were aware of?

2026-01-15T12:27:31.274453 [actor]: no when he turn 20

2026-01-15T12:27:32.433636 [root_agent]: You are correct to ask - Child Benefit will end when your son turns 20, even if he is still in full-time education, such as studying for his A-levels. 

To be absolutely sure, is your son currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:27:33.160306 [actor]: yes home with me

2026-01-15T12:27:34.876050 [root_agent]: Thank you. Just to summarise, your son is currently 19, studying A-levels full-time, and lives with you. You currently receive Child Benefit for him. However, once he turns 20, his eligibility for Child Benefit will end, even though he is still in full-time education.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit today?

2026-01-15T12:27:36.604276 [actor]: Thank you I understand now

2026-01-15T12:27:37.739194 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit ends when the son turns 20, even if still studying A-levels.
