2026-01-15T12:27:10.178279 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:27:11.083230 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me if you are currently living in the UK?


2026-01-15T12:27:11.849674 [actor]: living in germany military base

2026-01-15T12:27:12.734040 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you're living in Germany on a military base.

Are you a member of the British Armed Forces – often referred to as a Crown servant?

2026-01-15T12:27:13.414150 [actor]: army major posted overseas two children

2026-01-15T12:27:14.210423 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that you are an Army Major posted overseas and have two children.

Just to be clear, are those children living with you in Germany?

2026-01-15T12:27:15.001090 [actor]: yes wife children with me on base

2026-01-15T12:27:16.649728 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming your wife and children are with you on the base in Germany.

Based on the information you've provided so far – that you are a Crown servant stationed outside the UK with your wife and children living with you – it *appears* you may be eligible for Child Benefit. However, to be completely certain, could you please confirm the ages of your children?

2026-01-15T12:27:17.454400 [actor]: 8 and 10 years old

2026-01-15T12:27:19.538902 [root_agent]: Thank you. Ages 8 and 10 are perfect.

Based on everything you've told me – that you are a Crown servant stationed in Germany, your wife and two children (aged 8 and 10) live with you there – you *should* be eligible for Child Benefit.

However, I recommend checking the official government website to ensure complete accuracy and understand the full application process. Would you like me to summarise the key points from the eligibility criteria based on our conversation?

2026-01-15T12:27:22.831930 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that as a Crown servant (Army Major) posted overseas with children living with them, the family qualifies for Child Benefit despite living outside the UK.
