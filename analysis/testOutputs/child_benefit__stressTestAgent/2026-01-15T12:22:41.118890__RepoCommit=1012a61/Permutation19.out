2026-01-15T12:27:38.390504 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:27:39.232045 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you check if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?

2026-01-15T12:27:39.926734 [actor]: holly 9 years old

2026-01-15T12:27:40.738788 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Now, could you please tell me, on average, how many nights a week does Holly stay with you?

2026-01-15T12:27:41.564998 [actor]: 3 nights pete 4 nights ex-wife sue

2026-01-15T12:27:42.678938 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. So Holly stays with you 3 nights a week and with her mother 4 nights a week.

To clarify, are you currently responsible for providing financial support – such as buying clothes and food – for Holly?

2026-01-15T12:27:43.490688 [actor]: buy clothes food holly both of us

2026-01-15T12:27:44.303367 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you both contribute to Holly's expenses.

Just to be absolutely sure I understand the situation correctly, are you and Holly’s mother separated?

2026-01-15T12:27:45.062240 [actor]: separated pete sue not together

2026-01-15T12:27:46.802946 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are separated from Holly’s mother.

Given that you are both separated and contributing to Holly’s care, and she spends more nights with her mother, it's likely that HMRC would consider her to primarily live with her mother. Only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child.

Are you aware if Holly’s mother has *also* claimed Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-15T12:27:47.519088 [actor]: both submitted claims hmrc

2026-01-15T12:27:49.552271 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that you both submitted claims to HMRC.

As you've mentioned both claims have been submitted, HMRC will need to decide who is eligible to receive Child Benefit for Holly. They will typically award it to the person the child lives with the most, which in this case is likely to be Holly’s mother, as she stays with her 4 nights a week compared to your 3 nights. 

Do you understand that HMRC will make the final decision?

2026-01-15T12:27:50.307758 [actor]: hmrc decides who gets money

2026-01-15T12:27:51.577642 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. HMRC will ultimately decide who receives the Child Benefit. They will consider all the circumstances, including where Holly spends the majority of her time.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or perhaps any other questions you have?

2026-01-15T12:27:55.024068 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that when both parents claim Child Benefit for the same child, HMRC decides who receives it, typically awarding it to the parent with whom the child lives most of the time (Sue in this case).
