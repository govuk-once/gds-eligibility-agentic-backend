2026-01-15T12:33:17.393861 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:33:18.005642 [root_agent]: Okay, I can help you with that. 

To start, are you under 20 years old?


2026-01-15T12:33:18.944241 [actor]: My daughter Kelly 16 just finished GCSEs accepted college September

2026-01-15T12:33:20.015408 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. That's helpful to know.

Given that your daughter Kelly is 16 and has finished her GCSEs, with a place at college starting in September, is she currently living with you?

2026-01-15T12:33:20.725078 [actor]: Yes lives with me worried about summer break

2026-01-15T12:33:21.889445 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know. You mentioned being worried about the summer break - that's a valid concern. 

Just to confirm, are you the child’s mother? (This helps determine your relationship to the child for eligibility purposes).

2026-01-15T12:33:22.711801 [actor]: Mother daughter lives with me summer gap worried benefits stop

2026-01-15T12:33:23.711337 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you are Kelly’s mother and that she lives with you.

To clarify, is your daughter planning to start her college course in September, and is this a full-time education course?

2026-01-15T12:33:24.436784 [actor]: A-levels September full-time yes

2026-01-15T12:33:26.663786 [root_agent]: Great, that's good to hear.

Based on the information you’ve provided – your daughter is 16, lives with you, has just finished her GCSEs, and is accepted into a full-time A-Level college course starting in September – you *should* continue to be eligible for Child Benefit during the summer break between finishing school and starting college. 

Do you have any other children you receive Child Benefit for? Knowing this won’t change the eligibility for Kelly, but helps me understand your overall situation.

2026-01-15T12:33:29.231358 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Child Benefit continues during the summer break between finishing GCSEs and starting A-levels in September.
