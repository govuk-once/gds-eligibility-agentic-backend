2026-01-15T12:26:21.766521 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:26:22.665997 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:26:23.511276 [actor]: age 28 single mother

2026-01-15T12:26:23.862212 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is your child?

2026-01-15T12:26:24.625503 [actor]: 6 year old son Noah

2026-01-15T12:26:25.254351 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Currently, where does your son, Noah, primarily live? With you, or with someone else?

2026-01-15T12:26:26.145866 [actor]: grandmother house for 6 weeks recovery from surgery

2026-01-15T12:26:27.257745 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. So Noah is currently living with his grandmother while you recover from surgery. 

To clarify, is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Noah? For example, is your mother (Noah's grandmother) claiming for him?

2026-01-15T12:26:27.972470 [actor]: no grandmother not claiming

2026-01-15T12:26:28.834855 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. And just to confirm, how long has Noah been living with his grandmother? Is it more or less than 8 weeks?





2026-01-15T12:26:29.642034 [actor]: less than 8 weeks just 6 weeks

2026-01-15T12:26:32.239533 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided – you are 28, your son Noah is 6, he is currently living with his grandmother for 6 weeks while you recover, and his grandmother is not claiming Child Benefit – it appears you are *likely* still eligible for Child Benefit.

The rules state you can usually continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 8 weeks while your child lives with someone else, as long as no one else is claiming for them.

However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that you were already receiving Child Benefit *before* Noah went to live with his grandmother?

2026-01-15T12:26:32.985181 [actor]: yes receiving before

2026-01-15T12:26:35.289675 [root_agent]: Excellent. Based on all the information you've provided – you were already receiving Child Benefit, you are 28, your son Noah is 6, he is currently living with his grandmother for 6 weeks while you recover, and his grandmother is not claiming Child Benefit – it is highly likely you will continue to be eligible for Child Benefit. 

As long as Noah returns to live with you within the 8-week period, and no other claim is made, your benefit should continue uninterrupted.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





2026-01-15T12:26:38.120964 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly explained that Child Benefit can continue for up to 8 weeks while a child temporarily lives elsewhere, provided no one else claims the benefit.
