2026-01-15T12:25:43.149663 [actor]: I understand I need to role play as Liam (18) who lives with his mother Jessica and is currently receiving Universal Credit while studying for A-levels.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:25:44.022436 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please confirm how old you are?

2026-01-15T12:25:44.809388 [actor]: 18 doing A levels

2026-01-15T12:25:45.386395 [root_agent]: Thank you. And just to clarify, are you currently receiving Universal Credit in your own right?

2026-01-15T12:25:46.185646 [actor]: yes got universal credit myself

2026-01-15T12:25:48.037208 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. 

According to the information available, Child Benefit usually stops when a young person turns 18 and starts receiving Universal Credit in their own right. As you are 18 and receiving Universal Credit, it appears you may not be eligible for Child Benefit.

However, there are exceptions if you are continuing in approved education. Could you please confirm if your A-level studies are a full-time course?

2026-01-15T12:25:48.671951 [actor]: full time yes

2026-01-15T12:25:49.468157 [root_agent]: Thank you. Just to be absolutely sure, are you studying at an approved educational establishment? This generally includes schools, colleges, universities, and some training courses.

2026-01-15T12:25:50.288195 [actor]: college course

2026-01-15T12:25:52.499564 [root_agent]: Okay, great. So you are 18, receiving Universal Credit in your own right, and studying for A-levels at college as a full-time student.

Based on this information, you are likely **not** eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state that Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 18 *and* starts getting Universal Credit in their own right, even if they are in full-time education.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T12:25:53.672884 [actor]: not eligible then

2026-01-15T12:25:55.845893 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed Liam that he is not eligible for Child Benefit because he is 18 and receiving Universal Credit in his own right, which disqualifies him even though he is in approved full-time education.
