2026-01-15T12:26:38.693324 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:26:39.576353 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:26:40.368877 [actor]: I'm 45 years old need child benefit

2026-01-15T12:26:41.022341 [root_agent]: Thank you. And could you please tell me, do you live with the child you would be claiming Child Benefit for?

2026-01-15T12:26:41.846554 [actor]: live separate from daughter Emma she with her mother

2026-01-15T12:26:42.622808 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you live separately from your daughter, Emma. 

To clarify, does Emma's mother currently claim Child Benefit for Emma?

2026-01-15T12:26:43.360745 [actor]: ex not claim benefit for Emma

2026-01-15T12:26:44.509436 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Emma’s mother doesn’t currently claim Child Benefit.

Now, could you please tell me roughly how much you contribute financially towards Emma’s upbringing each month? It’s okay to give me an approximate amount.





2026-01-15T12:26:45.384393 [actor]: send birthday present yearly and £10 weekly for food

2026-01-15T12:26:46.859293 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to be clear, so I can assess your eligibility correctly, the £10 weekly is a direct payment to Emma’s mother for her food, and the birthday present is the only other financial contribution you make?



I'm carefully checking this against the rules to make sure I give you the right information.

2026-01-15T12:26:47.724233 [actor]: £10 week food money yes present once year

2026-01-15T12:26:50.228651 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. 

Currently, to be eligible for Child Benefit when a child doesn't live with you, you generally need to be contributing at least the same amount as the full Child Benefit rate, which is £26.05 per week. As you are contributing £10 per week, this unfortunately falls below the required amount. 

Therefore, based on the information you’ve provided, you wouldn’t currently meet the criteria to claim Child Benefit for Emma.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps you’d like me to explain the rules in more detail?

2026-01-15T12:26:53.430761 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Mike is ineligible for Child Benefit because his £10/week contribution is less than the required £26.05/week minimum contribution needed when the child lives elsewhere.
