2026-01-16T16:09:00.801304 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your situation.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:09:02.492855 [actor]: I need to roleplay as a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the rules to be obtuse, speak like I'm using search terms, and not directly answer questions.

2026-01-16T16:09:04.018371 [root_agent]: I understand you're asking about Child Benefit in relation to unemployment and needing money for your children.

To properly assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask you some specific questions. 

Do you currently have responsibility for any children who live with you?

2026-01-16T16:09:04.741665 [actor]: pre-settled status kid money government help

2026-01-16T16:09:05.834765 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you may be asking about Child Benefit in relation to pre-settled status.

Does your child live with you in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:09:06.618677 [actor]: yes living with me looking for work EU citizen

2026-01-16T16:09:07.765028 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your child lives with you in the UK, you're looking for work, and you're an EU citizen with pre-settled status.

How old is your child?

2026-01-16T16:09:08.518086 [actor]: child 8 years school

2026-01-16T16:09:10.146435 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know your child is 8 years old and in school.

Since you mentioned you're an EU citizen with pre-settled status, I need to ask: do you have the right to reside in the UK? This is important for determining Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-16T16:09:11.112348 [actor]: jobseeker status 3 months already

2026-01-16T16:09:12.731732 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, you're an EU citizen with pre-settled status, currently with jobseeker status for 3 months already, and you have an 8-year-old child living with you who attends school in the UK.

Are you currently receiving any other benefits or support from the UK government?

2026-01-16T16:09:13.615992 [actor]: no benefits yet applied recently

2026-01-16T16:09:15.099540 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you haven't received benefits yet but have recently applied.

One more important question: Is there anyone else (such as another parent or guardian) who might be claiming Child Benefit for this child already?

2026-01-16T16:09:15.855491 [actor]: no one else claiming single parent

2026-01-16T16:09:20.117903 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're a single parent and no one else is claiming Child Benefit for your child.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You're an EU citizen with pre-settled status
- You have an 8-year-old child who lives with you and attends school in the UK
- You're currently looking for work with jobseeker status for 3 months
- You're a single parent with no one else claiming for your child

You may be eligible for Child Benefit as you're responsible for a child under 16 who lives with you. However, your right to claim benefits with pre-settled status can depend on your continued right to reside in the UK.

Since you're currently a jobseeker, you should be aware that your right to reside as a jobseeker may be time-limited. I would recommend that when you apply for Child Benefit, you also seek advice from a welfare rights advisor or citizens advice to ensure your immigration status doesn't affect your claim.

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:09:20.842263 [actor]: when jobseeker status end

2026-01-16T16:09:25.607778 [root_agent]: That's an important question. As an EU citizen with pre-settled status, your right to reside as a jobseeker can be complex.

Generally, EU citizens with pre-settled status who are genuine jobseekers can maintain their right to reside for a "reasonable period" - typically up to 6 months. However, after this initial period, you may need to show you have a genuine chance of finding work and are actively seeking employment to maintain your jobseeker status.

This can affect your eligibility for certain benefits, including Child Benefit. If your jobseeker status ends and you don't establish another right to reside (such as through employment, self-employment, or being self-sufficient), your eligibility for Child Benefit might be affected.

I strongly recommend you seek advice from an immigration advisor or welfare rights specialist who can provide guidance specific to your situation, as these rules can be complicated and are subject to change, especially following Brexit.

Would you like to know about any other options that might be available to you?

2026-01-16T16:09:26.461693 [actor]: how many days jobseeker allowed

2026-01-16T16:09:30.998857 [root_agent]: The specific time limits for jobseeker status under pre-settled status can be complex, but I'll explain the general framework.

For EU citizens with pre-settled status, you're typically allowed to maintain jobseeker status for what's considered a "reasonable period" - generally around 6 months (approximately 182 days). 

However, this isn't a strict cut-off. After this initial period, you may need to provide evidence that:
- You're genuinely looking for work
- You have a realistic chance of finding employment

The authorities may assess whether you have a "genuine prospect of work" to determine if you can continue with jobseeker status beyond the initial period.

It's important to note that these rules can be applied differently in individual cases, and maintaining evidence of your job search activities is crucial.

For definitive advice on your specific situation, I recommend contacting an immigration advisor or an organization like Citizens Advice, as they can provide guidance tailored to your circumstances.

2026-01-16T16:09:32.828461 [actor]: 95 days jobseeker status no job offer yet

2026-01-16T16:09:38.035258 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. You've been on jobseeker status for 95 days (about 3 months) and don't have a job offer yet.

Since you're approximately halfway through the typical initial "reasonable period" of 6 months for jobseekers with pre-settled status, you still have time within the general framework before additional scrutiny might be applied to your status.

For your Child Benefit eligibility:
- You should be eligible to apply for Child Benefit now based on your current pre-settled status with jobseeker right to reside
- It would be advisable to maintain detailed records of all your job-seeking activities (applications, interviews, communications with potential employers, etc.)
- If possible, consider registering with employment agencies and attending any available skills training or job fairs to strengthen your position as a genuine jobseeker

As you continue your job search, be aware that finding employment before reaching the 6-month mark would strengthen your position regarding both your immigration status and benefit entitlements.

Would you like information about applying for Child Benefit now, while you continue your job search?

2026-01-16T16:09:39.098094 [actor]: jobseeker status 91 days limit

2026-01-16T16:09:43.015785 [root_agent]: I notice there might be some confusion about the jobseeker status duration limits.

To clarify: There isn't a strict 91-day limit for jobseeker status with pre-settled status. As I mentioned earlier, the general guideline is that EU citizens with pre-settled status can typically maintain jobseeker status for a "reasonable period" - often considered to be around 6 months (approximately 182 days).

If you've been told about a specific 91-day limit, this could be:
- A misunderstanding
- Related to a different immigration category
- Part of a specific assessment in your case

Regarding your Child Benefit eligibility:
- You should be eligible to apply now based on your current status
- Your 8-year-old child lives with you in the UK
- You're responsible for the child and no one else is claiming

I strongly recommend that you:
1. Apply for Child Benefit as soon as possible while you have jobseeker status
2. Continue documenting all your job search activities thoroughly
3. Consider seeking specific immigration advice about your situation

Would you like guidance on how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-16T16:09:45.080568 [actor]: Thank you for providing information. Job search 91 days limit worried about benefit eligibility.

2026-01-16T16:09:46.856409 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for someone with pre-settled status, correctly stating they would be eligible while maintaining jobseeker status, and clarified there isn't a strict 91-day limit.
