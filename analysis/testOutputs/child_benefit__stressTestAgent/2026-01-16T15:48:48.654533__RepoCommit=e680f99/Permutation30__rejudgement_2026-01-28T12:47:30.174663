2026-01-28T12:50:47.565163 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly conveyed the eligibility outcome. The agent told the user they are eligible, but failed to clarify that Lucas (who earns £18,000) should be the claimant receiving the payments while Emily (who earns £65,000) should pay the tax charge. The agent assumed the user was the claimant when in fact Lucas should be.
