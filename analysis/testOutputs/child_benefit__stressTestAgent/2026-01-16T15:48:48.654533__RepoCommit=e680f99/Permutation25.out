2026-01-16T15:59:36.328745 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To do this, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

Let me start with: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:59:37.714236 [actor]: I'll now play the role of a UK resident asking about child benefit eligibility, following the guidelines to be obtuse and speak like I'm entering search terms.

child benefit my son care home 5 years old

2026-01-16T15:59:39.183442 [root_agent]: I'll help determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.

Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you have a 5-year-old son who may be living in a care home. Is that correct? I need to understand your situation better to advise you properly.

2026-01-16T15:59:40.193218 [actor]: yes Leo care home local authority care 10 weeks no income stepfather pays money

2026-01-16T15:59:41.536180 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information about Leo. Let me ask you: Is Leo temporarily in the care home (for less than 12 weeks) or is this a longer-term arrangement?

2026-01-16T15:59:42.448401 [actor]: 10 weeks care home my husband sends money to them

2026-01-16T15:59:45.638186 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since Leo has been in the care home for 10 weeks (which is less than 12 weeks) and you're contributing financially towards his care, this is important information for determining your Child Benefit eligibility.

Let me ask: Before Leo went into the care home, was he living with you and were you responsible for his care?

2026-01-16T15:59:46.568535 [actor]: yes Leo lived with me before care husband pays £30 each week to carer

2026-01-16T15:59:48.466120 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Leo lived with you before going into care, and the placement has been less than 12 weeks with you still contributing financially to his care, this is helpful for determining your eligibility.

Do you currently receive Child Benefit for Leo, or are you applying for the first time?

2026-01-16T15:59:49.559562 [actor]: already get child benefit now Leo in care 10 weeks husband pays money

2026-01-16T15:59:52.872025 [root_agent]: I understand that you already receive Child Benefit for Leo, who has now been in care for 10 weeks, and your husband contributes £30 weekly toward his care.

Based on this information, you can continue to receive Child Benefit while Leo is in local authority care, as:

1. The placement has been less than 12 weeks (you mentioned 10 weeks)
2. You're maintaining regular financial contributions toward Leo's care
3. You had responsibility for Leo before he entered care

If Leo stays in care longer than 12 weeks, you may still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit if you continue making regular financial contributions toward his maintenance, as you're doing now.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility in this situation?

2026-01-16T15:59:55.814933 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that Child Benefit can continue while a child is in local authority care for less than 12 weeks with the parent making financial contributions.
