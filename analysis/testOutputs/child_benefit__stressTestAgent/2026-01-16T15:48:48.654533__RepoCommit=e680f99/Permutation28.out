2026-01-16T16:01:01.349189 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To make this assessment, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time about your situation.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:01:02.373864 [actor]: child benefit. yes. visiting UK. son is 5.

2026-01-16T16:01:03.614091 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask about your residency status.

Are you normally living in the UK, or do you have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:01:04.557867 [actor]: tourist visa. 6 month. from USA with son.

2026-01-16T16:01:08.092756 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to carefully consider this situation.

Based on what you've shared, it appears you're visiting the UK on a 6-month tourist visa from the USA with your 5-year-old son. 

After reviewing the eligibility criteria, I don't believe you would qualify for UK Child Benefit. Child Benefit is typically available to people who are considered "normally living in the UK" with permanent residency rights, not those on temporary tourist visas.

The UK government considers factors like whether you have your main home in the UK, how long you're staying, and your immigration status. A tourist visa is temporary by nature and doesn't establish the UK as your main residence.

Is there anything specific about your situation that you think might affect this assessment?

2026-01-16T16:01:11.025322 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit requires being "normally living in the UK" with permanent residency rights, not being on a temporary tourist visa.
