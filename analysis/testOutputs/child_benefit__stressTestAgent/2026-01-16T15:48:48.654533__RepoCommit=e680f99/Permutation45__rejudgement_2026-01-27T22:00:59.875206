2026-01-27T22:04:58.801175 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ The agent gave incorrect information. According to UK government guidance, after 12 weeks in hospital where the parent is not regularly spending money on the child's upkeep (which the user clearly stated), Child Benefit is not eligible. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" but the agent incorrectly advised continued eligibility.
