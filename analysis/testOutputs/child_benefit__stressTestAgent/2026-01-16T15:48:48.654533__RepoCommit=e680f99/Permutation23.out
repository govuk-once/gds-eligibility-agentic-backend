2026-01-16T15:58:46.449312 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you several questions one by one.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T15:58:47.154285 [actor]: Child benefit eligibility

2026-01-16T15:58:48.834061 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit in the UK.

To determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit, I'll need to ask you some questions about your situation. 

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-16T15:58:49.565090 [actor]: Sarah 12 years old

2026-01-16T15:58:50.918692 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child named Sarah who is 12 years old.

To continue assessing your Child Benefit eligibility, I need to know: Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-16T15:58:51.542792 [actor]: Yes UK

2026-01-16T15:58:52.428622 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK.

Is Sarah living with you most of the time?

2026-01-16T15:58:53.344119 [actor]: Not living with daughter Sarah. 50 years old

2026-01-16T15:58:54.760701 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. I understand that your daughter Sarah is not living with you, and that you are 50 years old.

Since Sarah doesn't live with you, I need to understand more about her living situation. Who is Sarah living with currently?

2026-01-16T15:58:55.438146 [actor]: With her mother

2026-01-16T15:58:56.980245 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Sarah lives with her mother.

For Child Benefit eligibility, it's important to determine who has the main responsibility for Sarah. 

Do you provide any financial support for Sarah, or do you have any form of shared parental responsibility?

2026-01-16T15:58:57.976393 [actor]: Buy groceries clothes £120 every 4 weeks

2026-01-16T15:59:00.178351 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you provide financial support for Sarah by buying groceries and clothes, amounting to approximately £120 every 4 weeks.

In the UK Child Benefit system, typically only one person can receive Child Benefit for a child, and this is usually the person the child lives with most of the time (which appears to be Sarah's mother in this case).

Is Sarah's mother currently claiming Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-16T15:59:00.892390 [actor]: Don't know

2026-01-16T15:59:04.905184 [root_agent]: Thank you for your honesty. That's okay if you don't know whether Sarah's mother is claiming Child Benefit.

Based on the UK government rules, generally only one person can get Child Benefit for a child, and this is typically the person the child lives with most of the time. Since Sarah lives primarily with her mother, her mother would normally be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit.

In situations where parents are separated and both provide financial support, the person who has the main day-to-day responsibility for the child is usually the one who can claim the benefit. 

Given that Sarah lives with her mother, while you provide some financial support, it appears that you would not be the primary claimant for Child Benefit. However, if there are special circumstances regarding the care arrangements, these might affect eligibility.

Would you like me to explain any specific aspects of the Child Benefit eligibility criteria in more detail?

2026-01-16T15:59:05.718778 [actor]: So not eligible?

2026-01-16T15:59:09.055643 [root_agent]: That's correct. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you wouldn't be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah. 

Under UK rules, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who has main responsibility for the child - usually the person the child lives with most of the time. Since Sarah lives primarily with her mother, her mother would be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit.

The financial support you provide (£120 every 4 weeks for groceries and clothes) is certainly important for Sarah's wellbeing, but it doesn't typically override the eligibility criteria that focuses on who the child primarily lives with.

If circumstances were to change regarding Sarah's living arrangements, or if you were to take on primary caring responsibility for her, then your eligibility could be reassessed.

2026-01-16T15:59:12.305523 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is typically paid to the person the child lives with most of the time, which in this case is Sarah's mother, not the person providing partial financial support.
