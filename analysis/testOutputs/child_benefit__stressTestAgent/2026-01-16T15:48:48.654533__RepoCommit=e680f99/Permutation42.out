2026-01-16T16:07:07.910445 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have any children who live with you?

2026-01-16T16:07:08.726887 [actor]: benefit child eligibility money for my daughter

2026-01-16T16:07:09.787171 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit for your daughter, I need to understand your situation better.

How old is your daughter?

2026-01-16T16:07:10.688929 [actor]: sian 17 years

2026-01-16T16:07:12.506619 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your daughter Sian is 17, I need to understand if she meets the continuing eligibility criteria for Child Benefit at that age.

Is Sian currently in approved education (such as A-levels, NVQs up to level 3) or training, or has she left education?

2026-01-16T16:07:13.259880 [actor]: started apprenticeship wales cardiff

2026-01-16T16:07:15.201292 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Sian has started an apprenticeship in Cardiff, Wales.

Is this an approved training or education program that's unpaid, or is it a paid apprenticeship? (Child Benefit can typically continue for unpaid approved training, but there are different rules for paid apprenticeships.)

2026-01-16T16:07:15.868123 [actor]: foundation apprenticeship welsh government funding

2026-01-16T16:07:17.089516 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To clarify, is this foundation apprenticeship unpaid, or does Sian receive any payment or wage beyond the Welsh Government funding? The payment status affects Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-16T16:07:17.769852 [actor]: welsh government funding not wages

2026-01-16T16:07:19.050072 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Sian receives Welsh Government funding rather than wages for her foundation apprenticeship.

Do you currently live in the UK? (This is an important factor for Child Benefit eligibility)

2026-01-16T16:07:19.674498 [actor]: cardiff with sian

2026-01-16T16:07:21.345468 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in Cardiff with Sian.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year? (This affects whether you might be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-16T16:07:22.213521 [actor]: single parent no partner below threshold

2026-01-16T16:07:26.289174 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a single parent with an income below the threshold.

Based on the information you've provided:

1. Your daughter Sian is 17 years old
2. She's in a foundation apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government (not receiving wages)
3. You live together in Cardiff
4. You're a single parent with income below the high income threshold

From my assessment, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit can continue for a young person until they turn 20 if they're in approved education or training, which includes many types of unpaid apprenticeships.

Since Sian is living with you and you're responsible for her, and your income is below the threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply, you should qualify for the full Child Benefit amount.

Would you like information about how to claim Child Benefit or any other aspects of the benefit?

2026-01-16T16:07:29.821432 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Child Benefit continues for a 17-year-old in approved education/training (foundation apprenticeship) until age 20, and accurately assessed all relevant eligibility criteria.
