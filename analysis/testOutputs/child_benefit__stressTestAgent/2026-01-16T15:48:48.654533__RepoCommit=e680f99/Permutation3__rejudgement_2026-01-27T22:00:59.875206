The agent correctly identified that Gary is eligible for Child Benefit because Ben is 17, has left education within the last 20 weeks (June to August), and is registered with a local youth careers service looking for an apprenticeship, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)."
