2026-01-16T15:49:56.400735 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:49:57.250977 [actor]: I'll roleplay as someone asking about child benefit eligibility.

my daughter Sofia

2026-01-16T15:49:58.176179 [root_agent]: I understand you have a daughter named Sofia. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to know Sofia's age. How old is she?

2026-01-16T15:49:58.818828 [actor]: daughter 18

2026-01-16T15:50:00.236589 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your daughter Sofia is 18, I need to know whether she's in approved education or training. Is Sofia currently in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T15:50:00.906919 [actor]: works receptionist

2026-01-16T15:50:02.961918 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Since your daughter Sofia is 18 and working as a receptionist rather than being in approved education or training, she would not qualify for Child Benefit.

Child Benefit is typically available for children under 16, or under 20 if they remain in approved education or training. Since Sofia is 18 and working rather than studying, she would not meet the eligibility criteria.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available?

2026-01-16T15:50:05.759432 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly stated that Child Benefit is not available for an 18-year-old who is working as a receptionist rather than being in approved education or training.
