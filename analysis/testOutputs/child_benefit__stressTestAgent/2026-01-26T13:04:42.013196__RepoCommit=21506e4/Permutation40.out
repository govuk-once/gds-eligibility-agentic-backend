2026-01-26T13:21:27.498278 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T13:21:28.715195 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Simon who is 15 years old. However, he's currently been detained under the Mental Health Act and has been placed in a secure psychiatric unit for the past 10 weeks.

2026-01-26T13:21:30.670320 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your son Simon. I understand this must be a difficult situation.

Since Simon is currently in a secure psychiatric unit under the Mental Health Act, I need to understand a bit more about his situation. 

Do you normally care for Simon when he's not in the psychiatric unit? In other words, is he normally living with you?

2026-01-26T13:21:31.859187 [actor]: Yes, Simon normally lives with me at home. This is the first time he's been placed in a psychiatric unit. He's always been under my care before this happened.

2026-01-26T13:21:34.199218 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Simon normally lives with you and is temporarily in the psychiatric unit.

Based on the UK government rules, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 52 weeks while your child is in hospital or residential care (including a psychiatric unit). Since Simon has only been in the unit for 10 weeks, you remain eligible for Child Benefit.

Now I'd like to confirm another aspect of eligibility. Is Simon in education or approved training?

2026-01-26T13:21:35.817174 [actor]: Yes, Simon is still enrolled in school. Before he was placed in the psychiatric unit, he was attending his regular secondary school. The hospital has arrangements for education to continue during his treatment, so he's still considered to be in education.

2026-01-26T13:21:37.956782 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Simon is still in education. That's important for Child Benefit eligibility.

Since Simon is 15 years old, still in education, normally lives with you, and has only been in the psychiatric unit for 10 weeks (which is less than the 52-week limit for maintaining eligibility), you would be eligible for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility or any other questions you might have?

2026-01-26T13:21:39.864090 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for confirming that I'm still eligible for Child Benefit while Simon is in the psychiatric unit. It's been a difficult time for our family, so I'm glad to know this support will continue.

2026-01-26T13:21:42.037949 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit continues for up to 52 weeks while a child is in residential care, and since Simon has only been in the psychiatric unit for 10 weeks, the parent remains eligible.
