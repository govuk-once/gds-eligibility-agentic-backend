2026-01-26T13:13:52.234871 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one by one.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T13:13:53.497883 [actor]: I'll help by role-playing as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Yes, I have a son named Arthur. He's 7 years old.

2026-01-26T13:13:55.274786 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your son Arthur. 

Does Arthur live with you? Or if not, do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent in kind) towards looking after him?

2026-01-26T13:13:56.795079 [actor]: Yes, Arthur normally lives with me, but he's currently in the hospital. He was in hospital for 10 weeks, then came home for about 2 weeks, but unfortunately got sick again and had to go back to the hospital. He's been back in hospital for about 3 weeks now.

2026-01-26T13:13:59.291902 [root_agent]: I'm sorry to hear that Arthur has been unwell and has spent time in the hospital. Thank you for providing this information.

The time Arthur spends in the hospital doesn't affect your eligibility for Child Benefit. Since he normally lives with you when he's not in the hospital, you can still claim Child Benefit for him during his hospital stays.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T13:14:00.402169 [actor]: No, my income is well below £60,000 per year. I work part-time and earn around £24,000 annually.

2026-01-26T13:14:01.914026 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your income is below £60,000 per year, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Is Arthur a UK citizen, or does he have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:14:02.773134 [actor]: Yes, Arthur was born here in the UK and is a British citizen.

2026-01-26T13:14:05.955783 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Arthur is a UK citizen.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have responsibility for Arthur, who is 7 years old
- He normally lives with you when not in hospital
- Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold
- Arthur is a UK citizen

You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Arthur. This includes the periods when he's in hospital, as temporary hospital stays don't affect eligibility.

Would you like information about how to claim Child Benefit or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-26T13:14:08.325208 [actor]: I'm a bit concerned about the length of Arthur's hospital stays. I read somewhere that if a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks, it might affect Child Benefit. Since he was in for 10 weeks, home for 2 weeks, and now back in for 3 weeks already, does that matter? Or is it only counted if it's one continuous stay?

2026-01-26T13:14:12.395823 [root_agent]: That's a very good question about Arthur's hospital stays.

For Child Benefit purposes, if a child goes home for any period, even a short visit, the clock resets on counting consecutive weeks in hospital. So in your situation, since Arthur came home for about 2 weeks between his hospital stays, the 10-week period and the current 3-week period are counted separately, not continuously.

This means the 12-week rule hasn't been triggered in Arthur's case. Even if a child does stay in hospital for more than 12 consecutive weeks, you can still usually get Child Benefit if you regularly spend money on things for them and visit them regularly.

So Arthur's hospital stays, as you've described them, do not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit at all.

2026-01-26T13:14:15.212900 [actor]: Oh, that's a relief. Thank you for clarifying that. I was worried about it because his stays have been quite long. I do visit him every day at the hospital and bring him clothes, books, and his favorite toys. So it's good to know I'll still receive Child Benefit while he's recovering. Hopefully, he'll be home again soon.

2026-01-26T13:14:17.485141 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility during hospital stays, correctly explaining that when a child returns home (even briefly), the 12-week hospital stay count resets.
