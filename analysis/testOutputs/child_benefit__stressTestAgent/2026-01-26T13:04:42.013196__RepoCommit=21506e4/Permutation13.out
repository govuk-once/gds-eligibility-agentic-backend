2026-01-26T13:09:37.616123 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T13:09:39.998042 [actor]: I'm a prospective adopter looking into Child Benefit. Yes, I have responsibility for a child. My partner and I have been approved as adopters and a 4-year-old girl named Maya has been placed with us by the adoption agency. She's living with us now, though we're still waiting for the final adoption order to be granted by the court. I wasn't sure if I could apply for Child Benefit now or if I need to wait until the adoption is legally finalized.

2026-01-26T13:09:42.825854 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context about your situation as a prospective adopter with Maya living with you.

Based on the UK government guidance, you can indeed claim Child Benefit for Maya while she's placed with you, even before the adoption is finalized. When a child is placed with you by an adoption agency, you're considered responsible for that child and eligible to claim Child Benefit.

When you apply, you'll need to include documentation from the adoption agency showing that Maya has been placed with you. This will serve as evidence of your responsibility for her.

Would you like me to explain how to apply for Child Benefit or provide any other information about the process?

2026-01-26T13:09:45.349050 [actor]: Oh, that's great news! I'm relieved to hear we don't need to wait for the final adoption order to be granted before applying for Child Benefit. So we can claim it right away since Maya is already living with us.

Yes, we have all the placement documentation from the adoption agency that shows she's been placed with us officially. 

Could you please explain how we should apply for the Child Benefit? And roughly how long might it take to process our application?

2026-01-26T13:09:51.056230 [root_agent]: I'm glad that's helpful news. Yes, you can claim Child Benefit right away since Maya is living with you under the official placement from the adoption agency.

To apply for Child Benefit:

1. You'll need to fill out form CH2, which is the Child Benefit claim form. You can download and print this from the GOV.UK website, or request it by phone from the Child Benefit Office.

2. Along with the completed form, include your placement documentation from the adoption agency as evidence.

3. If you have Maya's birth certificate, include this as well. If not, the placement documentation should be sufficient.

4. Send everything to the address on the form: Child Benefit Office, Washington, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE88 1ZD.

Regarding processing time, applications typically take around 6-12 weeks to be processed, though this can vary. If your application is successful, Child Benefit can be backdated for up to 3 months from the date the Child Benefit Office receives your claim.

Once your claim is processed, payments are usually made every 4 weeks, typically on a Monday or Tuesday, directly into your bank account.

Is there anything specific about the application process you'd like me to clarify further?

2026-01-26T13:09:54.661914 [actor]: Thank you for explaining the application process so clearly! It's good to know we can apply right away using form CH2 and our placement documentation. 

We do have Maya's birth certificate, so we'll include that along with the adoption agency paperwork when we submit everything. 

The 6-12 week processing time is helpful to know for planning purposes, and it's great that payments can be backdated up to 3 months. We'll get the application submitted right away.

I think that answers all my questions about Child Benefit eligibility. You've been really helpful - I feel much clearer now about what we need to do.

2026-01-26T13:09:57.263549 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that as a prospective adopter with a child placed with you by an adoption agency, you can claim Child Benefit before the adoption is finalized, which aligns with government guidance.
