2026-01-26T13:08:26.029261 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

Do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:08:27.650759 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Yes, I have a 12-year-old boy named Liam who lives with me. I'm fostering him - he was placed with me by the local council.

2026-01-26T13:08:28.931704 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you mentioned you're fostering Liam, I need to understand more about your situation.

Have you been formally approved as a foster carer by the local authority for Liam?

2026-01-26T13:08:29.933080 [actor]: Yes, I've been formally approved as a foster carer by the local authority. They placed Liam with me about 8 months ago now.

2026-01-26T13:08:31.457920 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're an approved foster carer and Liam has been placed with you by the local authority, I need to understand how the fostering arrangement is structured.

Are you receiving fostering allowance from the local authority for looking after Liam?

2026-01-26T13:08:32.594745 [actor]: Yes, I do receive a fostering allowance from the local council. They pay me to cover Liam's accommodation, food, clothes, and other things he needs.

2026-01-26T13:08:35.670000 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared, I need to inform you that you're likely not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam.

When a child is being looked after by a local authority and they're placed with an approved foster carer who receives a fostering allowance (as in your case with Liam), Child Benefit is typically not payable. The fostering allowance you receive is designed to cover the costs of caring for Liam.

The local authority is considered to be looking after Liam, and in such cases, Child Benefit payments are usually suspended while the child is in local authority care.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation or any other aspects of Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T13:08:37.842236 [actor]: Oh, I see. I didn't realize that the fostering allowance meant I couldn't get Child Benefit as well. That makes sense though, since the council is already paying for his care. 

I think that answers my question about eligibility. Thank you for explaining that to me so clearly.

2026-01-26T13:08:40.135200 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that foster carers receiving fostering allowance from a local authority are not eligible for Child Benefit, as the child is considered to be looked after by the local authority.
