2026-01-26T13:25:10.987324 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. Let me ask you questions one at a time to assess your situation.

Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:25:13.470550 [actor]: I'll help you by acting as a person seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll respond to questions from the agent testing your system.

I see the agent has asked if I'm responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if in approved education or training. Based on my assigned scenario, I'll respond appropriately.

"Yes, I have a daughter named Emily who is 18 years old. She's studying at our local college."

2026-01-26T13:25:15.666027 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Emily is 18 and studying at a local college, I need to confirm a few more details.

Is Emily's education considered "approved education" by UK standards? This generally includes A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, home education (if started before age 16), or other similar qualifying education.

2026-01-26T13:25:17.299767 [actor]: "Emily has finished her A-Levels already. She's now doing a Higher National Certificate course - that's a HNC - at the college. It's a level 4 qualification. She started it a few months ago."

2026-01-26T13:25:19.798615 [root_agent]: I see, thank you for that information. 

To clarify about Emily's education status: Child Benefit can typically continue for children in approved education up to age 20, but approved education generally covers education up to level 3 qualifications (such as A-levels). 

Since Emily is now studying for a Higher National Certificate (HNC), which is a level 4 qualification, this would not typically qualify as "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes.

Let me ask you another question: Does Emily live with you?

2026-01-26T13:25:20.724616 [actor]: "Yes, Emily does live with me at home. She commutes to the college each day for her HNC course."

2026-01-26T13:25:24.033455 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Emily lives with you. 

Based on the information you've provided, it appears that you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Emily at this time. This is because:

1. Emily is over 16 years old
2. She is studying for a Higher National Certificate (HNC), which is a level 4 qualification
3. Child Benefit typically only continues for children in approved education up to age 20, but "approved education" generally only covers up to level 3 qualifications

Since Emily's course (HNC) is a level 4 qualification, it falls outside the definition of approved education for Child Benefit purposes.

Is there anything else about your situation that you think might affect your Child Benefit eligibility that I should know about?

2026-01-26T13:25:25.944257 [actor]: "I see, so I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore now that Emily is doing her HNC. I didn't realize that advanced education like this wouldn't qualify. Thank you for explaining that to me."

2026-01-26T13:25:28.338887 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available for a child studying a level 4 qualification (HNC), as approved education for Child Benefit only covers up to level 3 qualifications.
