2026-01-26T13:10:53.776574 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To give you an accurate assessment, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:10:54.808460 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Oliver who is 14 years old.

2026-01-26T13:10:56.528428 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know that you have a son named Oliver who is 14 years old.

Next question: Does Oliver normally live with you, or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent in kind) towards looking after him?

2026-01-26T13:10:58.215100 [actor]: Well, my situation is a bit complicated. Oliver has a rare condition and he's currently in a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I'm still living in the UK, but I pay for his incidental costs and visit him whenever I can.

2026-01-26T13:10:59.938669 [root_agent]: I understand your situation with Oliver being in a specialist hospital in the USA. Thank you for sharing those details.

For my next question: Is Oliver's hospital stay expected to be temporary, and do you still maintain responsibility for him despite his current placement in the hospital?

2026-01-26T13:11:01.731919 [actor]: Yes, his hospital stay is temporary, though we don't know exactly how long the treatment will take. I absolutely still maintain responsibility for him - I'm his mother and I make all decisions about his care, plus I'm paying for costs not covered by insurance and traveling to visit him when possible.

2026-01-26T13:11:02.920313 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. I understand that Oliver's hospital stay is temporary and you maintain responsibility for him as his mother.

Next question: Before Oliver went to the USA for treatment, was he living with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:11:04.000557 [actor]: Yes, Oliver has always lived with me in the UK before he was sent to the specialist hospital in the USA for treatment.

2026-01-26T13:11:07.893542 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Oliver lived with you in the UK before his hospital treatment in the USA.

Based on the information you've provided, you would still be eligible for Child Benefit for Oliver. The UK government maintains eligibility for Child Benefit when a child is temporarily in hospital or receiving medical treatment, even when that treatment is abroad. Since you continue to maintain responsibility for Oliver, make decisions about his care, and his stay in the hospital is temporary, your eligibility should continue.

However, if Oliver's stay abroad extends beyond a certain period (typically 12 weeks for medical treatment), it would be advisable to inform the Child Benefit Office about his absence from the UK to ensure your payments continue correctly.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement in these circumstances?

2026-01-26T13:11:09.583316 [actor]: That's a relief to hear I'm still eligible. Since Oliver has already been in the hospital for 15 weeks, should I contact the Child Benefit Office right away to let them know about his situation? I wouldn't want to have any issues with my payments.

2026-01-26T13:11:13.494517 [root_agent]: Yes, you should definitely contact the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible. Since Oliver has already been abroad for 15 weeks (which is beyond the typical 12-week notification period for medical treatment), it's important to inform them about his situation.

When you contact them, explain that Oliver is receiving specialized medical treatment in the USA, that the stay is temporary, and that you continue to maintain responsibility for him as his mother. Make sure to emphasize that you're still making decisions about his care and contributing financially to his support.

This notification will help ensure that your Child Benefit payments continue correctly without interruption. The Child Benefit Office can also provide specific guidance for your situation and let you know if they need any supporting documentation regarding Oliver's medical treatment abroad.

You can contact the Child Benefit Office by phone at 0300 200 3100 (Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm) or by writing to them at the address listed on any correspondence you've received from them.

2026-01-26T13:11:15.370969 [actor]: Thank you for that information. I'll call the Child Benefit Office tomorrow to explain Oliver's situation and make sure my payments continue correctly. I appreciate your help in confirming that I'm still eligible while he's receiving treatment abroad.

2026-01-26T13:11:17.894279 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the user remains eligible for Child Benefit while their child is temporarily receiving medical treatment abroad, and correctly advised notifying the Child Benefit Office since the absence has exceeded 12 weeks.
