2026-01-26T13:08:03.603178 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:08:04.717838 [actor]: I'm looking for information about Child Benefit. Yes, I have a 5-year-old son named Hans who I'm responsible for.

2026-01-26T13:08:05.961799 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit for your 5-year-old son Hans, I need to ask:

Does Hans normally live with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T13:08:06.819473 [actor]: Yes, Hans lives with me here in the UK. We moved here recently from Germany.

2026-01-26T13:08:08.230327 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you've recently moved from Germany to the UK, I need to understand your immigration status.

Do you have the right to live in the UK (for example, do you have UK citizenship, settled status, or a valid visa that allows you to live here)?

2026-01-26T13:08:09.164133 [actor]: I'm German and I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme. I moved here recently.

2026-01-26T13:08:10.345131 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Having Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme is relevant to your Child Benefit eligibility.

Is your son Hans a German citizen as well?

2026-01-26T13:08:11.156523 [actor]: Yes, Hans is also a German citizen like me.

2026-01-26T13:08:12.705417 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information. 

Since both you and Hans are German citizens and you have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme, this is relevant to your eligibility.

Does anyone else (such as Hans's other parent) claim Child Benefit for Hans already?

2026-01-26T13:08:13.448618 [actor]: No, nobody else claims Child Benefit for Hans.

2026-01-26T13:08:14.715508 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) earn over £60,000 per year in taxable income?

2026-01-26T13:08:15.828441 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that amount. I'm actually currently unemployed and looking for work. I've registered as a jobseeker here in the UK.

2026-01-26T13:08:19.854487 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on what you've told me, it appears you are likely eligible for Child Benefit for your son Hans because:

1. You have responsibility for a child under 16 (your 5-year-old son Hans)
2. Hans lives with you in the UK
3. You have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme, which generally allows you to access benefits
4. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Hans
5. Your income is below the £60,000 threshold that would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge

As an EU citizen with Pre-Settled Status who is registered as a jobseeker, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit. 

To apply for Child Benefit, you would need to complete the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can find on the UK government website. You'll need to include Hans's birth certificate or passport when you apply.

Would you like any additional information about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T13:08:21.949639 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know I'm likely eligible for Child Benefit for my son Hans. That's really helpful information. I'll look for the CH2 form on the government website and make sure to include his birth certificate when I apply. No additional information needed at this time.

2026-01-26T13:08:24.496560 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information throughout the conversation and correctly advised that a German citizen with Pre-Settled Status and responsibility for a child living in the UK would likely be eligible for Child Benefit.
