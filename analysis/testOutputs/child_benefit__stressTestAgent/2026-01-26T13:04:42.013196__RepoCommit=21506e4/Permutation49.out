2026-01-26T13:25:30.065712 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you several questions one by one to assess your eligibility according to UK government rules.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:25:31.726279 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hello! Yes, I have my son Tom who is 17 years old. He's taking a computer coding course right now.

2026-01-26T13:25:34.867490 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. 

Since your son Tom is 17 and taking a computer coding course, I need to understand more about his education to determine eligibility.

Is Tom's computer coding course considered approved education or training in the UK? Approved education generally includes:
- A-levels or similar qualifications
- T levels
- International Baccalaureate
- NVQs and other vocational qualifications up to level 3
- Home education (if it started before your child turned 16 or after 16 if they have special needs)
- Traineeships in England

2026-01-26T13:25:36.531091 [actor]: The computer coding course isn't any of those types you mentioned. Tom isn't getting paid for it, but his future employer is paying for the course fees. They have an agreement that he'll join their company after he completes the course. It's specifically designed to prepare him for working at that company.

2026-01-26T13:25:40.229453 [root_agent]: I understand. Based on what you've shared, it sounds like Tom's computer coding course doesn't fall under the approved education or training categories required for Child Benefit eligibility for children aged 16-19.

For Child Benefit to continue past age 16, the child must be in what's considered "approved education" (like A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, etc.) or "approved training" (which must be unpaid and typically includes government training programs).

While Tom's course is unpaid, it appears to be company-specific training arranged by a future employer rather than one of the qualifying education or training programs recognized by the UK government for Child Benefit purposes.

May I ask, has Tom recently left approved education (like school or college) to start this coding course?

2026-01-26T13:25:42.366385 [actor]: Yes, Tom left school after finishing his GCSEs a few months ago. He decided to take this coding course instead of doing A-levels because he's really interested in programming and the company promised him a job afterward. The company approached him directly because he did so well in his computing GCSE.

2026-01-26T13:25:46.289372 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared, it appears that Tom would not qualify for continued Child Benefit payments because:

1. He is over 16 years old
2. He has left approved education after completing his GCSEs
3. The coding course he's currently taking is not on the list of approved education or training programs recognized by the UK government for Child Benefit purposes

Child Benefit typically stops after August 31st following a child's 16th birthday if they leave education or training. Since Tom has left school after GCSEs and is now in company-specific training rather than approved education or training, you would likely not be eligible for Child Benefit for him.

If Tom were to enroll in qualifying education or approved training (such as A-levels, T levels, NVQs up to level 3, etc.), you might become eligible again.

Would you like me to ask about any other children you might have, or do you need any additional information about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T13:25:49.020663 [actor]: I understand now. So since Tom's coding course is with an employer agreement and not one of those approved education programs, I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore. That's disappointing, but it makes sense given the rules you've explained.

I don't have any other children, so I guess that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining the situation clearly.

2026-01-26T13:25:51.345489 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit isn't available for a 17-year-old who left school after GCSEs and is now in company-specific training rather than approved education or training.
