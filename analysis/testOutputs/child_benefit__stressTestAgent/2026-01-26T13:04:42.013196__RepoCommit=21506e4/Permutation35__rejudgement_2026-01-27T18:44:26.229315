2026-01-27T18:48:17.596853 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that Rashid's father is not eligible for Child Benefit. According to the exception rule, if a married child lives with the parent and the parent is not financially supporting the child's spouse (or the spouse is also in education/dependent), the parent can still claim Child Benefit. The expected outcome was "Eligible (via Exception)" but the agent concluded ineligibility.
