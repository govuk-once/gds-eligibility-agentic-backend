According to the government guidelines, Child Benefit does typically stop after 12 weeks of a child being in hospital, but exceptions apply when parents continue spending money on the child's upkeep - which is the case here. The agent should have acknowledged the 12-week rule for hospital stays but explained that Mary remains eligible due to the exception, not claimed hospital stays are exempt from the rule.
