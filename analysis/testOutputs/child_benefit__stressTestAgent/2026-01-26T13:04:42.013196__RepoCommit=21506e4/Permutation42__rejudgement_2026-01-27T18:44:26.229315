While the agent correctly determined that the parent is eligible for Child Benefit (as Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales do qualify as approved education), they incorrectly stated that income below £50,000 doesn't affect the benefit when actually the High Income Child Benefit Charge begins to apply when income exceeds £50,000.
