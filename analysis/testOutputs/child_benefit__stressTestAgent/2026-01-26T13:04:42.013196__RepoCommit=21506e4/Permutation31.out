2026-01-26T13:18:06.124731 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To give you accurate information, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:18:07.856341 [actor]: Hello there. Yes, I have a daughter, Emma. She's 18 years old and has just started university. She finished college recently and has now started a 3-year Bachelor's degree program. She still lives at home with me and commutes to university daily.

2026-01-26T13:18:10.061772 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know that Emma is 18 and has started university.

Could you please tell me if Emma's university course is considered "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes? Generally, approved education includes A-levels, NVQs, and other full-time courses (more than 12 hours a week) that aren't advanced education like a university degree.

2026-01-26T13:18:11.493252 [actor]: As far as I understand, Emma's university course is a Bachelor's degree, so it would be considered "advanced education" rather than "approved education." She's studying for a full 3-year university degree, not A-levels or NVQs.

2026-01-26T13:18:14.206176 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. You're correct - a Bachelor's degree at university is considered advanced education, not approved education for Child Benefit purposes.

Based on this information, I need to inform you that you wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit for Emma. Child Benefit can continue for children until they're 20 years old, but only if they're in approved education (such as A-levels, NVQs, or other non-advanced courses). Since Emma is now in advanced education (university for a Bachelor's degree), she no longer qualifies for Child Benefit.

Was Child Benefit being paid for Emma before she started university?

2026-01-26T13:18:16.590788 [actor]: Yes, I was receiving Child Benefit for Emma while she was in college before she started university. I wasn't aware that university education would affect her eligibility. So you're saying that because she's now in advanced education at university rather than approved education, I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-26T13:18:18.455852 [actor]: I'll exit the conversation now as the agent has clearly informed me about my eligibility status for Child Benefit regarding my daughter Emma. The agent explained that since Emma is now in advanced education (university for a Bachelor's degree) rather than approved education, I am no longer eligible for Child Benefit, even though she is 18 and still lives at home.

2026-01-26T13:18:19.801247 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available for children in advanced education like university degrees, only for those in approved non-advanced education up to age 20.
