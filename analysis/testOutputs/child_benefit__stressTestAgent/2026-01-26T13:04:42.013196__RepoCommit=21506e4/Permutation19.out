2026-01-26T13:12:07.764938 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children under 16 years of age, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:12:09.098004 [actor]: I'm Pete, and I have a 9-year-old daughter named Holly. She lives with me 3 days a week and with her mother Sue for 4 days a week. We're separated.

2026-01-26T13:12:11.370263 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Pete. I understand that you have a 9-year-old daughter named Holly who lives with you for 3 days a week and with her mother Sue for 4 days a week.

Since Holly spends more time with her mother, typically the person who has the child living with them most of the time would receive the Child Benefit. 

Do you know if Sue is currently claiming Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-26T13:12:13.546401 [actor]: I'm not entirely sure if Sue is claiming it right now, but I think she might be. We've both submitted claims to HMRC because we can't agree on who should get it. I contribute a lot to Holly's upbringing - I buy her clothes and food when she's with me, and I'm very much involved in her life. Does that mean I can't get Child Benefit at all?

2026-01-26T13:12:17.573662 [root_agent]: I understand your situation, Pete. When both parents submit claims for Child Benefit for the same child, HMRC will make a decision about who should receive it.

Since Holly lives with Sue for 4 days a week and with you for 3 days, Sue would generally be considered the main carer as Holly spends more time with her. In cases where a child lives with someone else for more than half the time, that person usually gets the Child Benefit.

However, your involvement and financial contributions to Holly's upbringing are important. While you may not be eligible for the regular Child Benefit payment if Sue is determined to be the main carer, you might still be eligible for National Insurance credits which can help protect your State Pension.

Have you and Sue discussed the possibility of making a family-based arrangement regarding the Child Benefit, such as sharing some of the payment?

2026-01-26T13:12:20.459447 [actor]: No, we haven't really been able to discuss sharing the payment. Things are a bit tense between us right now, which is why we both just submitted claims. I didn't realize about the National Insurance credits - that's good to know at least.

So from what you're saying, because Holly stays with Sue for 4 days versus my 3 days, HMRC will likely give her the Child Benefit even though I contribute significantly to Holly's needs? Is there any appeal process or way I can challenge this if HMRC decides to give it to Sue?

2026-01-26T13:12:25.010329 [root_agent]: I understand this is a difficult situation, Pete, especially when communications are tense.

You're right - because Holly stays with Sue for 4 days versus your 3 days, HMRC will likely determine that Sue should receive the Child Benefit as she has Holly living with her for more time each week.

There is an appeal process if you disagree with HMRC's decision. If HMRC decides to award the benefit to Sue, you would receive a decision letter explaining why. You can then appeal this decision by writing to HMRC within one month of the date on the letter. You would need to explain why you believe you should receive the benefit instead, including any special circumstances.

It's worth noting that the decision is typically based on who the child lives with for the majority of the time, but HMRC will consider all aspects of the situation.

Would you like me to explain more about the National Insurance credits you mentioned being interested in?

2026-01-26T13:12:27.017712 [actor]: Yes, I would like to know more about the National Insurance credits. If I can't get the Child Benefit payment, at least understanding the other benefits would be helpful.

Also, when you say I would need to explain why I believe I should receive the benefit instead, what kind of special circumstances might HMRC consider? I'm wondering if the fact that I pay for a lot of Holly's expenses even when she's not with me would make any difference.

2026-01-26T13:12:34.377975 [root_agent]: I'm happy to explain more about both topics, Pete.

Regarding National Insurance credits:
If you're not awarded Child Benefit but are caring for a child under 12, you may still be eligible for National Insurance credits, which count toward your State Pension. These credits help fill gaps in your National Insurance record when you're unable to work or earn enough to pay National Insurance contributions. To claim these credits without receiving Child Benefit payments, you can complete the CH2 Child Benefit claim form but tick the box to opt out of receiving the actual payments (this is usually done by higher earners affected by the High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge, but can be useful in your situation too).

Regarding special circumstances for appeals:
When considering appeals, HMRC may take into account various factors, but they primarily focus on who has the main caring responsibility for the child. Some circumstances they might consider include:

1. If there's an exact equal split in time (which isn't your case)
2. If there are formal care arrangements ordered by courts
3. Who covers the majority of expenses related to the child's daily needs
4. Who handles most of the child's everyday care (school arrangements, medical appointments, etc.)

While your financial contributions to Holly's expenses are important, they would typically be weighed against the fact that Holly spends more time with her mother. Unfortunately, financial contribution alone usually isn't enough to override the consideration of who the child lives with most of the time.

Would you like to know more about the appeal process itself if HMRC does award the benefit to Sue?

2026-01-26T13:12:36.315656 [actor]: Thanks for explaining that. The National Insurance credits sound useful - I'll definitely look into that option using the CH2 form.

I understand now that HMRC will likely favor Sue because Holly spends more time with her, even though I contribute financially. Yes, I would like to know more about the appeal process in case I decide to go that route after HMRC makes their decision.

2026-01-26T13:12:43.079292 [root_agent]: I'm glad the information about National Insurance credits was helpful, Pete.

Regarding the appeal process if HMRC awards Child Benefit to Sue:

1. **Receiving the decision**: HMRC will send you a letter explaining their decision and the reasons for it.

2. **Mandatory reconsideration**: Before a formal appeal, you must first ask HMRC to reconsider their decision. This is called a "mandatory reconsideration." You need to do this within one month of the date on the decision letter. You can request this by writing to the address on your decision letter, explaining why you think the decision is wrong and providing any additional evidence.

3. **Formal appeal**: If you're still unhappy after the mandatory reconsideration, you can make a formal appeal to the Social Security and Child Support Tribunal. You'll need to do this within one month of getting the mandatory reconsideration decision. You can appeal using form SSCS1, which you can find on the GOV.UK website.

4. **The tribunal hearing**: If your case goes to tribunal, you may need to attend a hearing. You can represent yourself or have someone represent you, such as a welfare rights adviser or solicitor.

Throughout this process, it would be helpful to keep records of:
- Your financial contributions to Holly's upbringing
- Any formal or informal arrangements regarding Holly's care
- Evidence of your involvement in important aspects of Holly's life (school, healthcare, etc.)

Remember that the appeal process can take time, and maintaining open communication with Sue, if possible, might be beneficial for Holly's wellbeing during this period.

Is there anything specific about the appeal process you'd like me to clarify further?

2026-01-26T13:12:47.070242 [actor]: Thank you for explaining the appeal process so clearly. I think I understand it now - I'd need to request a mandatory reconsideration first within a month of their decision, and then if I'm still not satisfied, I can make a formal appeal to the tribunal within a month after that.

I'll start keeping better records of my financial contributions and involvement in Holly's life, just in case I need them. But from what you've told me, it sounds like HMRC will most likely award the Child Benefit to Sue because Holly stays with her more nights per week, and my appeal might not be successful unless there are other significant factors.

I think I have all the information I need now about Child Benefit eligibility and my options. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-26T13:12:49.701831 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that since the child lives with the mother for 4 days versus 3 days with the father, the mother would likely receive Child Benefit as the main carer.
