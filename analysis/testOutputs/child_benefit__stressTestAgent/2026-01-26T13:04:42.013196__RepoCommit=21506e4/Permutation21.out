2026-01-26T13:13:21.337452 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:13:22.928988 [actor]: I'll help by role-playing as someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Yes, I have two children. I recently divorced my wife Tina, and we have two children - Sam who is 10 and lives with me, and Ella who is 8 and lives with her mother.

2026-01-26T13:13:24.796042 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you have two children after your divorce - Sam (10) who lives with you, and Ella (8) who lives with her mother.

For Sam who lives with you, are you responsible for their day-to-day care? This would typically mean they live with you and you're responsible for their needs such as providing a home and meals.

2026-01-26T13:13:26.397189 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for Sam's day-to-day care. He lives with me full-time, and I take care of all his needs - providing his home, meals, school arrangements, and everything else. His mother Tina has visitation rights, but Sam's primary residence is with me.

2026-01-26T13:13:28.000402 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Sam lives with you full-time and you're responsible for his day-to-day care, that's helpful to know.

Regarding your financial situation, is your individual income (or your new partner's if you have one) over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T13:13:29.155981 [actor]: No, my income is around £45,000 per year. I don't have a new partner at the moment.

2026-01-26T13:13:32.272800 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your income is around £45,000 per year, you would be eligible for Child Benefit for Sam, though you may be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge since your income is over £50,000. However, I need to correct myself - the High Income Child Benefit Charge actually starts at £50,000, so at £45,000 you would receive the full amount without any tax charge.

Regarding your daughter Ella who lives with her mother, typically the person who Ella lives with (in this case, her mother) would be the one to claim Child Benefit for her.

Let me ask you: Has either you or Ella's mother already made a claim for Child Benefit for either of the children?

2026-01-26T13:13:33.950276 [actor]: No, neither of us has made a claim for Child Benefit yet. We've only recently divorced, and we're trying to figure out how all these benefits work now that we have separate households. Tina hasn't filed for Ella yet, as far as I know.

2026-01-26T13:13:37.277949 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since you and your ex-wife haven't made any Child Benefit claims yet, here's what you should know:

For Sam (10) who lives with you full-time: You can claim Child Benefit for him since you're responsible for his day-to-day care. With your income at £45,000, you'll receive the full Child Benefit amount without any High Income Child Benefit Charge.

For Ella (8) who lives with her mother: Your ex-wife Tina would typically be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ella since she has day-to-day responsibility for her. She would need to make her own separate claim.

Only one person can receive Child Benefit for each child. Since the children live in separate households, each responsible parent can claim for the child they care for.

Would you like me to explain how to apply for Child Benefit for Sam?

2026-01-26T13:13:39.730263 [actor]: Yes, I'd appreciate information on how to apply for Child Benefit for Sam. This is all new to me since the divorce. So just to be clear, I can claim for Sam at the full rate even though he's not the eldest of all our children? And Tina will be able to claim for Ella separately?

2026-01-26T13:13:44.660412 [root_agent]: You've raised a good question about birth order. Let me clarify:

Yes, you can claim Child Benefit for Sam at the full rate even though he's not the eldest child. Since you and your ex-wife Tina are separate claimants in different households, the birth order only matters within each individual claim.

For your claim: Sam would be considered your only child for Child Benefit purposes, so you would receive the higher rate (currently £24.00 per week).

For Tina's claim: Ella would be considered her only child, so she would also receive the higher rate for Ella.

The different rates (higher rate for eldest/only child, lower rate for additional children) only apply within the same household/claim.

To apply for Child Benefit for Sam, you'll need to fill out form CH2, which you can download from the GOV.UK website or get from your local post office. You'll need to provide:
- Your personal details
- Sam's birth certificate
- Your bank or building society account details
- Your National Insurance number

Would you like more specific information about completing the application?

2026-01-26T13:13:47.452508 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you! So both Tina and I will get the higher rate for our respective children since they're in separate households. That makes sense.

I think I can handle the application process now that I know what form to look for and what documents I'll need. I'll download the CH2 form and get Sam's birth certificate ready. Thanks for clearing everything up about my eligibility.

2026-01-26T13:13:50.459664 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility in divorced families where children live in separate households, correctly explaining that the user can claim the higher rate for Sam while his ex-wife can claim separately for Ella.
