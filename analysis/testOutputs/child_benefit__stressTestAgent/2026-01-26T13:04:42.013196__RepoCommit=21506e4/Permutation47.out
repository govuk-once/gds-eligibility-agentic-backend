2026-01-26T13:24:51.597985 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T13:24:53.391686 [actor]: I'll assume the role of a user in this scenario about Child Benefit eligibility.

I'm James, and I have a child, but they don't live with me. I pay £50 a week for my child's maintenance, but only because there's a court order that makes me do it. I wouldn't pay voluntarily.

2026-01-26T13:24:54.864015 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context, James. I understand you have a child who doesn't live with you, and you pay £50 a week for child maintenance due to a court order.

Since your child doesn't live with you, I need to understand more about the situation. Who does your child currently live with?

2026-01-26T13:24:56.535461 [actor]: The child lives with my ex-partner. We separated about two years ago, and the court decided the child should live with her. That's when they ordered me to pay the £50 a week. I didn't want to pay anything, but I had no choice.

2026-01-26T13:24:59.602712 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, James. I understand your child lives with your ex-partner following a court decision, and you're paying £50 per week in child maintenance due to a court order.

Based on UK government rules, Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who has main responsibility for caring for the child - which in this case appears to be your ex-partner rather than yourself.

Since your child doesn't live with you, and you don't have main responsibility for their day-to-day care, you wouldn't normally be eligible to claim Child Benefit for this child.

Your ex-partner would likely be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit if they meet the other eligibility criteria.

Is there any other aspect of your situation regarding responsibility for the child that you think might affect eligibility?

2026-01-26T13:25:01.646854 [actor]: No, that's pretty much the situation. The child lives full-time with my ex, and I just pay what I'm ordered to pay. I was just wondering if I could claim anything since I'm contributing financially, even if it's not by choice. But from what you're saying, it sounds like I'm not eligible for Child Benefit.

2026-01-26T13:25:04.405712 [root_agent]: That's correct, James. Based on the situation you've described, you wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit.

Child Benefit eligibility primarily depends on who has the main responsibility for caring for the child, not just financial contributions. Since your child lives full-time with your ex-partner and she has the day-to-day caring responsibility, she would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit, not you.

The financial contribution you make through the court-ordered maintenance payments, while important for supporting your child, doesn't qualify you for Child Benefit under the UK government rules.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about benefits or support that might be available to you in your situation?

2026-01-26T13:25:06.697883 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. I just wanted to check if I might be eligible for anything since I'm paying that money each week. Thanks for explaining it clearly. I understand now that Child Benefit goes to the person who has day-to-day care of the child, not just someone who contributes financially.

2026-01-26T13:25:09.258871 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is paid to the person with main responsibility for the child's day-to-day care (the ex-partner), not someone who only makes financial contributions through court-ordered maintenance payments.
