2026-01-27T18:48:26.771130 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent provided incorrect information. According to UK government rules, a child who has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks is not eligible for Child Benefit unless the parent regularly spends money on their upkeep. The mother does not buy food, clothes, or gifts since the hospital provides everything, so she does not meet the expenditure exception. The correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
