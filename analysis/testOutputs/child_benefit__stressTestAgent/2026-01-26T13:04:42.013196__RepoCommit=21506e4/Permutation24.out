2026-01-26T13:14:38.557542 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:14:39.576251 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Tom who is 14 years old. He has severe behavioral needs, so he's currently attending a residential school.

2026-01-26T13:14:41.200313 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand your son Tom is 14 years old and is attending a residential school due to his severe behavioral needs.

To better understand your eligibility, could you please tell me how often Tom comes home to stay with you? For example, does he return home for weekends or holidays?

2026-01-26T13:14:42.670375 [actor]: Tom actually lives full-time at the residential school because of his special needs. He's been there for about 10 weeks now. The local council is paying for his placement there. I do visit him sometimes, but he stays at the school.

2026-01-26T13:14:44.199622 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Since Tom is living full-time at the residential school paid for by the local council, I need to understand a bit more about this arrangement.

Can you tell me if you were receiving Child Benefit for Tom before he went to the residential school?

2026-01-26T13:14:45.423894 [actor]: Yes, I was receiving Child Benefit for Tom before he went to the residential school. I've been getting it since he was born actually.

2026-01-26T13:14:49.472035 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've shared, I need to clarify an important point about your situation.

Since Tom is now in residential accommodation paid for by the local council, this affects your Child Benefit eligibility. When a child goes into care or residential accommodation that's paid for by a local authority or government body, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks of the child being away from home.

Since Tom has been at the residential school for about 10 weeks now and it's funded by the local council, you may no longer be eligible for Child Benefit for him.

However, I would recommend that you contact the Child Benefit Office directly to discuss your specific situation, as there can sometimes be exceptions depending on your circumstances and the exact nature of the care arrangement.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T13:14:51.887267 [actor]: I'm a bit confused. I thought that since Tom is in residential accommodation for education due to his behavioral needs, rather than being "in care" in the foster care sense, that the time limit would be different? I remember reading something about a 12-week rule for children in residential accommodation, which is different from the 8-week rule for children in care. Since he's only been there for 10 weeks, shouldn't I still be eligible?

2026-01-26T13:14:56.029121 [root_agent]: You've raised an important distinction, and I need to clarify this further.

You're correct, and I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. There is indeed a difference between a child who is "in care" (such as foster care) and a child who is in residential accommodation for educational purposes.

For children who are in residential accommodation for educational purposes, like Tom, Child Benefit can continue to be paid for up to 12 weeks. Since Tom has only been at the residential school for about 10 weeks, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit at this time.

However, if the placement extends beyond 12 weeks, your eligibility may change. The rules can be complex depending on the exact nature of the arrangement, who is paying for it, and how often Tom returns home.

Thank you for bringing this up, as it's an important distinction. Would you like more information about what might happen after the 12-week period?

2026-01-26T13:14:57.715666 [actor]: Yes, that makes more sense now, thank you for clarifying. So I should still be eligible since he's only been there for 10 weeks. Could you please tell me what might happen after the 12-week period? Will my Child Benefit stop completely at that point?

2026-01-26T13:15:03.128959 [root_agent]: I'm glad that clarification was helpful. Regarding what happens after the 12-week period, here's what you should know:

After 12 weeks in residential accommodation for educational purposes, your Child Benefit eligibility will depend on several factors:

1. If Tom comes home regularly (such as weekends or holidays), you may still be eligible to receive Child Benefit even after the 12-week period. The key factor is whether you're still incurring costs for his maintenance.

2. If Tom doesn't come home regularly but you contribute toward his maintenance costs at the residential school (beyond what the council covers), you might still qualify for Child Benefit.

3. If the local council is covering all costs and Tom rarely or never comes home, then Child Benefit would typically stop after the 12-week period.

In your case, since you mentioned you do visit Tom but he stays at the school full-time, whether you continue to receive Child Benefit after 12 weeks may depend on:
- Whether Tom starts coming home for visits
- Whether you contribute financially to his care beyond what the council provides

I would recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office before the 12-week mark to explain your specific situation and get definitive guidance. They can provide the most accurate information based on your exact circumstances.

2026-01-26T13:15:05.531164 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that so clearly. I understand now that I'm still eligible for the next couple of weeks since he's only been there for 10 weeks. I'll make sure to contact the Child Benefit Office before the 12-week period ends to discuss my situation in more detail. I do contribute to some of his personal expenses even though the council pays for the main accommodation, so that might help with continuing eligibility.

2026-01-26T13:15:08.103158 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that for a child in residential accommodation for educational purposes, Child Benefit continues for up to 12 weeks, and since the child has only been there for 10 weeks, the parent is still eligible.
