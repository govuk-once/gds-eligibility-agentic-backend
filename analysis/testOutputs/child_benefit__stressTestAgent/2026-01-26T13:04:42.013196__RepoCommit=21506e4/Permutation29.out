2026-01-26T13:17:06.487195 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one by one.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:17:07.445471 [actor]: I have my son, Jordan. He's 17 years old. He finished his GCSEs last year.

2026-01-26T13:17:09.274641 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Jordan is 17 and has finished his GCSEs, I need to know about his current situation.

Is Jordan currently in approved education or training? This would include things like A-levels, NVQs, BTECs, T levels, apprenticeships, or other approved education or training courses.

2026-01-26T13:17:10.769163 [actor]: No, he's not in any education or training at the moment. He finished his GCSEs last year but didn't go on to college or anything. He's just been at home since then.

2026-01-26T13:17:13.571394 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Jordan.

Child Benefit can be paid for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. Since Jordan is 17 and not currently in approved education or training, he doesn't meet the eligibility criteria.

If Jordan's circumstances change in the future and he decides to enroll in approved education or training before he turns 20, you could become eligible again.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support options that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T13:17:15.269725 [actor]: Oh, I see. So there's no way for me to get Child Benefit since he's not in school or training? Is there anything we need to do since he's no longer eligible? We were getting payments before when he was in school.

2026-01-26T13:17:18.688953 [root_agent]: That's correct. Since Jordan is 17 and not currently in approved education or training, you're no longer eligible for Child Benefit for him.

Since your circumstances have changed, you should notify the Child Benefit Office about this change. If you continue to receive payments that you're not entitled to, you may have to pay them back.

You can report this change by:
- Contacting the Child Benefit Office by phone
- Using your Government Gateway account to report changes online
- Writing to the Child Benefit Office

If Jordan decides to return to approved education or training before he turns 20, you could reapply or have your claim reinstated.

Would you like information about any other financial support that might be available to you and Jordan given the current situation?

2026-01-26T13:17:20.386703 [actor]: Thanks for letting me know. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office to update them. Are there any other benefits we might be eligible for since he's 17 and not working or studying? It's just me and him at home - I'm his dad, Steve.

2026-01-26T13:17:25.240967 [root_agent]: I appreciate you sharing that information, Steve. Since Jordan is 17, not in education or training, and not working, there might be other support options to consider:

1. Universal Credit - Jordan might be eligible to claim in his own right as a young person not in education or training. You might also be eligible as a single parent household.

2. Council Tax Reduction - As a single adult household (since Jordan is over 16), you might qualify for a discount.

3. Housing Benefit or housing element of Universal Credit - To help with rent costs.

4. Jobseeker's Allowance - If Jordan is actively looking for work, he might be eligible.

5. If Jordan has any health conditions or disabilities, you might want to look into Personal Independence Payment (PIP).

6. Local council support schemes - Some councils offer support for families facing financial difficulties.

To get the most accurate advice tailored to your specific situation, I'd recommend:
- Contacting your local Jobcentre Plus
- Using benefit calculators on the GOV.UK website
- Getting advice from Citizens Advice

Would you like me to provide more details about any of these specific options?

2026-01-26T13:17:27.213093 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you for all this information. I'll look into Universal Credit and talk to Jordan about going to the Jobcentre. We could definitely use some support right now.

2026-01-26T13:17:29.377135 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit is not available for a 17-year-old who is not in approved education or training, and provided appropriate guidance on notifying the Child Benefit Office.
