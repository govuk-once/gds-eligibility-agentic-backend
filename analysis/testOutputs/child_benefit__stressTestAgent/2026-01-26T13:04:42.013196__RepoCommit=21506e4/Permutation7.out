2026-01-26T13:06:53.358406 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your situation.

Do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T13:06:55.032549 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility.

Yes, I have a son named Jack. He's 14 years old.

2026-01-26T13:06:56.001101 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your son Jack. 

Is Jack living with you? Or is he living with someone else?

2026-01-26T13:06:57.565653 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. Jack was placed in local authority care about 3 months ago. But he still comes home to stay with me every weekend - he arrives Friday evening and leaves Sunday evening. I'm a single father, by the way.

2026-01-26T13:07:00.875958 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation. I understand that Jack is in local authority care during weekdays but stays with you on weekends.

Since Jack is in local authority care, this affects your Child Benefit eligibility. When a child goes into care, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks. However, since Jack regularly stays with you on weekends, you may still be eligible for some payment.

For children who regularly spend time with you (like weekends), you might be eligible for a weekly rate of Child Benefit for each week the child stays with you, if they stay for at least 2 nights per week.

May I ask if you've already been receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into care?

2026-01-26T13:07:02.344123 [actor]: Yes, I was receiving Child Benefit for Jack before he went into care. I've been raising him on my own for several years now. The arrangement with him coming home every weekend started right from the beginning when he went into care three months ago.

2026-01-26T13:07:05.641024 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Jack has been in care for about 3 months (more than 8 weeks) but spends weekends with you (2 nights per week), your situation requires specific consideration.

In this case, you may be eligible for what's called "weekly Child Benefit" - which means you could receive Child Benefit for each week that Jack stays with you. Since he stays with you regularly every weekend for 2 nights, you should still be eligible for some Child Benefit payments.

You should contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them about your current situation if you haven't already done so. They can adjust your payments based on Jack's current living arrangements.

Would you like me to ask any more questions to clarify your eligibility further?

2026-01-26T13:07:07.497657 [actor]: So I'm still eligible for some Child Benefit even though Jack has been in care for more than 8 weeks? That's good to know. I wasn't sure if I would still get anything since he's technically in care now. 

Is there anything special I need to tell the Child Benefit Office when I contact them? Should I mention specifically about the weekend arrangements?

2026-01-26T13:07:10.766799 [root_agent]: Yes, you're still eligible for some Child Benefit because Jack regularly stays with you on weekends, even though he's been in care for more than 8 weeks.

When contacting the Child Benefit Office, you should definitely mention:

1. That Jack is in local authority care
2. The exact start date when he went into care (3 months ago)
3. Your specific weekend arrangement - that Jack stays with you every weekend from Friday evening to Sunday evening (2 nights per week)
4. That this arrangement has been consistent since he went into care

This information will help them calculate the correct weekly Child Benefit amount you're entitled to. It's important to be precise about the number of nights Jack stays with you each week, as this directly affects your eligibility.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement?

2026-01-26T13:07:12.686698 [actor]: That's very helpful, thank you. I'll make sure to tell them all those details when I contact them. So just to be clear, I'm still eligible for Child Benefit because Jack stays with me for 2 nights in a row every weekend, even though he's been in care for more than 8 weeks. I think I understand the situation now.

2026-01-26T13:07:15.409607 [root_agent]: That's exactly right. You're still eligible for Child Benefit because Jack stays with you for 2 nights every weekend, even though he's been in care for more than 8 weeks. 

You'll receive Child Benefit for each week that Jack stays with you for at least those 2 nights. This is different from the full Child Benefit you received before, but it recognizes that you're still providing care for Jack during those weekend stays.

I'm glad I could help clarify your situation. If you have any other questions about Child Benefit or need any other assistance, please feel free to ask.

2026-01-26T13:07:17.238132 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that. It's a relief to know I'm still eligible for some support while Jack is in care. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office with all the information you suggested.

2026-01-26T13:07:19.923365 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that when a child is in local authority care but stays with the parent regularly (at least 2 nights per week), the parent remains eligible for weekly Child Benefit even after the standard 8-week period.
