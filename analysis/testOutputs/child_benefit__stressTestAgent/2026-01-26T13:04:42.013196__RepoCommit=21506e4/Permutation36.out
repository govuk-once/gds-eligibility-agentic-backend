2026-01-26T13:19:50.969493 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T13:19:53.187449 [actor]: I need to play the role of a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll respond as Joan, Kelly's mother.

Hello there. Yes, I have a daughter named Kelly who is 16 years old. She just finished her GCSEs in June and has been accepted to start her A-levels at college in September. I'm a bit worried because it's August now, and she's technically not in school at the moment. I'm wondering if I can still claim Child Benefit for her during this summer break.

2026-01-26T13:19:55.856949 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Joan. I understand your situation with your 16-year-old daughter Kelly who's between finishing GCSEs and starting A-levels.

Based on UK Child Benefit rules, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for Kelly during this summer break period. This is because she's under 20 years old and will be continuing in approved education (A-levels) in September. The summer break is considered a normal part of her education journey between GCSEs and A-levels.

To confirm this further, could you tell me if Kelly lives with you most of the time?

2026-01-26T13:19:57.115230 [actor]: Yes, Kelly lives with me full-time. She's always lived with me. I'm her mother and her primary caregiver. We live together in our family home.

2026-01-26T13:20:00.138911 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Kelly lives with you full-time as her mother and primary caregiver. That's an important eligibility factor.

Since Kelly lives with you, is under 20, and will be continuing in approved education with her A-levels in September, you should remain eligible for Child Benefit during this summer break period.

May I ask if you or your partner (if you have one) has an individual income over £60,000 per year? This wouldn't affect your eligibility to claim, but it might affect how much benefit you actually receive due to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-26T13:20:01.622112 [actor]: No, neither myself nor my partner earns over £60,000 per year. Our household income is well below that threshold. I work part-time at a local shop, and my partner works in construction, but our combined income isn't anywhere near that amount.

2026-01-26T13:20:03.546113 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about your household income, Joan. Since both you and your partner earn less than £60,000 individually, you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge. This means you should be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit payment for Kelly.

To further confirm your eligibility, may I ask if Kelly has any special circumstances, such as being in hospital for an extended period, or receiving any specialized care?

2026-01-26T13:20:05.185060 [actor]: No, Kelly doesn't have any special circumstances. She's a typical teenager who's just finished her GCSEs and is enjoying her summer break before starting A-levels in September. She's healthy and living at home with us. No hospital stays or specialized care needed.

2026-01-26T13:20:08.600116 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Joan. Based on all the information you've provided, I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit for Kelly, including during this summer break between her GCSEs and A-levels.

To summarize why you're eligible:
- Kelly is 16 years old and will be continuing in approved education (A-levels) in September
- She lives with you full-time as her primary caregiver
- Neither you nor your partner earns over £60,000 individually
- Kelly has no special circumstances that would affect eligibility

Child Benefit will continue automatically during the summer break as it's considered a normal part of the education journey. You'll continue to receive payments until Kelly turns 20, as long as she remains in approved education.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit entitlement?

2026-01-26T13:20:11.341628 [actor]: That's perfect, thank you so much for confirming! I was really worried that I might lose the Child Benefit during this summer break while Kelly isn't technically in school. It's a relief to know that the payments will continue as normal until she starts her A-levels in September. This money really helps with looking after her, especially as we're buying all her college supplies at the moment. I appreciate your help with clearing this up.

2026-01-26T13:20:13.749309 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit continues during the summer break between GCSEs and A-levels for a 16-year-old continuing in approved education.
