2026-01-19T14:55:17.774968 [root_agent]: I'll help you assess whether you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. To determine this, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T14:55:18.803793 [actor]: child who lives with me not mine yet adopting maya 4 years old

2026-01-19T14:55:20.309781 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that you're in the process of adopting Maya, who is 4 years old and currently living with you.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask if you're currently the legal guardian or have formal responsibility for Maya while the adoption process is ongoing?

2026-01-19T14:55:21.191963 [actor]: adoption agency placed her with us not final court order yet

2026-01-19T14:55:22.983984 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on your situation with Maya being placed with you by an adoption agency but without a final court order yet, this is helpful information for determining your eligibility.

May I ask if you're receiving any financial support from the local authority (such as foster care payments) for looking after Maya during this pre-adoption period?

2026-01-19T14:55:24.015936 [actor]: no payments just normal adoption process approved adopters

2026-01-19T14:55:26.373124 [root_agent]: I understand - you're not receiving any payments from the local authority and you're going through the normal adoption process as approved adopters.

For Child Benefit eligibility purposes, this is important to know. Since Maya is living with you as approved adopters, even though the adoption isn't finalized yet, you may be considered as "responsible for a child" for Child Benefit purposes.

Have you been told by the adoption agency or social services that you can apply for benefits during this pre-adoption placement period?

2026-01-19T14:55:27.591794 [actor]: didn't discuss benefits with them just want to know if eligible

2026-01-19T14:55:30.383290 [root_agent]: I understand you haven't discussed benefits specifically with the adoption agency yet.

Based on UK government rules, you may be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have a child (Maya) living with you
2. You're approved adopters with Maya placed in your care
3. You're responsible for her day-to-day care

While the adoption isn't finalized, Child Benefit can generally be claimed by someone who is responsible for raising a child, even if they're not the biological parent or if the adoption process is still ongoing.

Would you like me to explain what you would need to do to make an application for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T14:55:31.245502 [actor]: So I can get child benefit now? Don't have to wait?

2026-01-19T14:55:34.819039 [root_agent]: Based on UK government guidelines, you should be able to apply for Child Benefit now without waiting for the final adoption order. This is because:

1. Maya is living with you
2. You're responsible for her day-to-day care
3. You're approved adopters with the child placed in your home
4. You're not receiving local authority payments for her care

You're considered to have responsibility for Maya even during this pre-adoption placement period. The key eligibility factor is that you're responsible for raising her, not whether the adoption is legally finalized.

I would recommend applying for Child Benefit as soon as possible, as claims can only be backdated for up to 3 months. When applying, you may need to provide documentation from the adoption agency showing that Maya has been placed with you.

2026-01-19T14:55:36.585226 [actor]: Okay thanks I understand I am eligible for child benefit now, don't need to wait for final adoption order

2026-01-19T14:55:39.017933 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that approved adopters with a child placed in their care are eligible for Child Benefit even before the final adoption order, as long as they're responsible for the child's day-to-day care and not receiving local authority payments.
