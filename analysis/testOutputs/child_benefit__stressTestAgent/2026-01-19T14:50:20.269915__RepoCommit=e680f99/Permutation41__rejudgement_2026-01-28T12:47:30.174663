2026-01-28T12:53:11.577805 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent did not communicate the expected outcome. The agent incorrectly stated that Martin is not eligible for any Child Benefit, whereas the expected outcome was that he should be eligible for Ben at full rate but not for Jerry. The agent failed to address the unequal contribution allocation option that would allow Martin to qualify for Child Benefit for Ben.
