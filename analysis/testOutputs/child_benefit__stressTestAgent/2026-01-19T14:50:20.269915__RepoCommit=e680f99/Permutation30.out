2026-01-19T15:04:03.059040 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you several questions, one at a time, to understand your situation.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T15:04:04.036486 [actor]: child benefit eligibility check have 2 kids

2026-01-19T15:04:05.670673 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. To assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand your situation better.

How old are your two children? (Child Benefit is typically available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)

2026-01-19T15:04:06.827669 [actor]: thomas 8 sophie 4 both living with us

2026-01-19T15:04:08.497506 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have Thomas who is 8 and Sophie who is 4, both living with you. 

Are you or your partner responsible for raising these children? By responsible, I mean providing a home for them and arranging for their day-to-day care.

2026-01-19T15:04:09.425394 [actor]: yes wife and me looking after them

2026-01-19T15:04:10.545329 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Are you or your partner living in the UK?

2026-01-19T15:04:11.303514 [actor]: yes stockport

2026-01-19T15:04:12.623322 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in Stockport, which is in the UK.

Is either you or your partner earning over £60,000 per year before tax?

2026-01-19T15:04:13.468522 [actor]: wife earns 65k i earn 18k

2026-01-19T15:04:18.177471 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Since your wife earns over £60,000 per year, this affects your Child Benefit situation. You can still claim Child Benefit, but:

1. If your wife claims it, she would need to pay back the full amount through the High Income Child Benefit Charge when she does her Self Assessment tax return.

2. If you claim it (as the lower earner at £18k), you would receive the full amount without any tax charge since it's based on the highest earner's income.

3. Alternatively, you could claim Child Benefit but opt out of receiving payments to avoid the tax charge. This would still help protect your State Pension and ensure your children get their National Insurance number automatically before age 16.

Based on the information provided, you are eligible to claim Child Benefit for both Thomas and Sophie. Would you like to know the current payment rates or how to make a claim?

2026-01-19T15:04:19.174361 [actor]: am I getting money if I claim it

2026-01-19T15:04:22.925335 [root_agent]: Based on your situation, if you (as the parent earning £18k) claim the Child Benefit:

Yes, you would receive money. Since your income is below £50,000, you would receive the full Child Benefit amount without having to pay any of it back.

The current rates are:
- £25.60 per week for your eldest child (Thomas)
- £16.95 per week for your second child (Sophie)

This would total £42.55 per week (approximately £2,212.60 per year) for both children.

If your wife claims it instead (as she earns £65k), she would receive the same amount initially, but would need to pay back 100% of it through the High Income Child Benefit Charge when she completes her Self Assessment tax return.

2026-01-19T15:04:24.124521 [actor]: if I claim it who pays tax my wife or me

2026-01-19T15:04:27.958250 [root_agent]: If you claim the Child Benefit (as the parent earning £18k):

- You would receive the full payment (£42.55 per week for both children)
- Neither you nor your wife would pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge
- This is because the tax charge only applies to the higher earner in a household who claims Child Benefit OR whose partner claims Child Benefit

So if you claim it, since your income is below the £50,000 threshold, there would be no additional tax to pay by either of you.

The High Income Child Benefit Charge only applies to the person with the higher income (in your case, your wife), but only if Child Benefit is being paid to either of you. If you claim it, your wife would not have to pay the tax charge on your claim.

2026-01-19T15:04:28.990581 [actor]: my wife earns over 60k who pays tax charge

2026-01-19T15:04:33.385923 [root_agent]: I need to clarify my previous response, as I provided incorrect information. Here's the accurate information:

When a family receives Child Benefit and one parent earns over £50,000, the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies to the higher earner - regardless of which parent actually claims the benefit.

In your situation:
- If you claim Child Benefit, your wife (earning £65k) would still have to pay the tax charge through her Self Assessment tax return
- Since she earns over £60,000, the tax charge would be equal to 100% of the Child Benefit received
- The tax is effectively paying back the entire benefit

So even if you claim it, your wife would still be liable for the tax charge because she's the higher earner in your household with an income above the threshold. The charge is linked to the household receiving the benefit, not to who makes the claim.

I apologize for my earlier confusion on this point.

2026-01-19T15:04:37.669297 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the family is eligible for Child Benefit for both children, but since the wife earns over £60,000, the High Income Child Benefit Charge would apply, requiring 100% of the benefit to be repaid regardless of which parent makes the claim.
