2026-01-19T15:10:52.450157 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T15:10:54.472728 [actor]: I need to understand your situation better to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Based on what I understand, I'll play the role of Hans, a 30-year-old with Pre-Settled Status who has been claiming Child Benefit as a "Jobseeker" for 95 days and has no imminent job offer.

kids yes looking work

2026-01-19T15:10:55.784183 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hans. I understand you have children and are currently looking for work.

How old are your children? This will help me determine if they meet the age requirements for Child Benefit.

2026-01-19T15:10:56.689913 [actor]: two children 4 and 6

2026-01-19T15:10:57.816799 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your two children, ages 4 and 6. 

Do your children live with you most of the time, or are they living with someone else?

2026-01-19T15:10:58.806335 [actor]: yes with me home all day no job

2026-01-19T15:11:00.806280 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that your children live with you, and you're at home all day as you don't currently have a job.

You mentioned you have Pre-Settled Status. Are you and your children from the UK, EU, EEA, or Switzerland?

2026-01-19T15:11:01.702573 [actor]: EU germany moved here 2020

2026-01-19T15:11:03.827811 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're from Germany (EU) and moved to the UK in 2020 with Pre-Settled Status.

Since you mentioned you're claiming Child Benefit as a "Jobseeker" for 95 days, I need to understand your right to reside status. As an EU citizen with Pre-Settled Status, are you actively looking for work and registered with the relevant employment services?

2026-01-19T15:11:05.013071 [actor]: yes looking jobs every day apply online benefit office knows

2026-01-19T15:11:07.754713 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're actively looking for jobs every day, applying online, and that the benefit office is aware of your situation.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to understand your current status regarding the right to reside in the UK. Since you have Pre-Settled Status and are currently a jobseeker, there's an important consideration: EU citizens with Pre-Settled Status who are jobseekers typically have a limited period during which they maintain their right to reside for benefit purposes.

Have you been informed of any time limit regarding how long you can claim benefits as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status?

2026-01-19T15:11:08.948949 [actor]: no time limit never told anything 95 days looking still claim money

2026-01-19T15:11:12.945424 [root_agent]: I understand you haven't been told about any time limit and you've been looking for work for 95 days while still receiving benefits.

This is important information. For EU citizens with Pre-Settled Status who are claiming benefits as jobseekers, there are typically certain limitations. Under UK rules following Brexit, the right to reside as a jobseeker for benefit purposes is usually limited to a period of time (often around 6 months), during which you need to show you're genuinely seeking work and have a reasonable chance of finding employment.

Do you have any other right to reside status in the UK besides being a jobseeker? For example, are you or have you previously been employed in the UK, self-employed, or do you have a family member who is working in the UK?

2026-01-19T15:11:14.121332 [actor]: no job before only looking been here two years pre-settled

2026-01-19T15:11:18.764576 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. I understand you've been in the UK for two years with Pre-Settled Status, but haven't had a job before and have only been looking for work.

Based on the information you've provided, here's my assessment of your Child Benefit eligibility:

You likely qualify for Child Benefit for your 4 and 6-year-old children living with you, as they meet the age requirements and are in your care. However, there is an important consideration regarding your right to reside as an EU citizen with Pre-Settled Status who is a jobseeker.

While you currently receive benefits as a jobseeker, please be aware that there may be time limitations for how long you can claim benefits solely as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status. The typical period is around 6 months, during which you need to demonstrate you're genuinely seeking work and have reasonable prospects of finding employment.

Since you've been looking for work for 95 days (just over 3 months), you may continue to be eligible now, but should be prepared for a possible review of your status in the coming months if you don't secure employment.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-19T15:11:22.907393 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Hans is currently eligible for Child Benefit with his 4 and 6-year-old children living with him, but also correctly warned about the limited period (typically 6 months) during which EU citizens with Pre-Settled Status can claim benefits as jobseekers.
