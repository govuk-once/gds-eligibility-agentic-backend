2026-01-19T15:03:48.212243 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you several questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T15:03:50.352926 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit for your son, I need to understand your situation better.

How old is your son?

2026-01-19T15:03:51.231566 [actor]: Jordan 17 finished school

2026-01-19T15:03:52.697952 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Jordan is 17 and has finished school, I need to understand a bit more about his current situation.

Is Jordan currently in any form of approved education or training?

2026-01-19T15:03:53.548455 [actor]: not studying not working

2026-01-19T15:03:57.510781 [root_agent]: I understand that Jordan is 17, has finished school, and is currently not studying or working.

Based on the UK government's Child Benefit eligibility criteria, Child Benefit can be paid for children under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training.

Since Jordan is 17 and not in approved education or training, I'm afraid he would not qualify for Child Benefit at this time. Child Benefit typically stops on August 31st on or after a child's 16th birthday if they leave education or training.

If Jordan decides to return to approved education or training in the future (before turning 20), you may become eligible again and could make a new claim at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available?

2026-01-19T15:03:58.815275 [actor]: Benefits for son no job no school

2026-01-19T15:04:01.622138 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit isn't available for a 17-year-old who has left education/training, as benefits typically stop on August 31st after a child's 16th birthday if they leave education.
