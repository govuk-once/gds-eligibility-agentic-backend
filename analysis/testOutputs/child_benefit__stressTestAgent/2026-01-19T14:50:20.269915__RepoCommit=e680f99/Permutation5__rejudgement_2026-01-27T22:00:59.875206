2026-01-27T22:06:57.786700 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly determined the user was not eligible, when according to the criteria, the user IS eligible. The user contributes £150 monthly (exceeding the Child Benefit amount) and the ex-wife is not claiming, which meets the "contributing to upkeep" exception specified in Criteria 4 and 5.
