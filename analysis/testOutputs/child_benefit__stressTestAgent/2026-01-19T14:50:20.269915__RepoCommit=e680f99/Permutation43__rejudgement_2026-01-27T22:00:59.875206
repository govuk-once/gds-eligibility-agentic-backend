2026-01-27T22:06:39.004240 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge. The agent incorrectly stated that Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland are approved training for Child Benefit purposes. According to UK government guidelines, you generally cannot get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship in Scotland (unlike specific Welsh exceptions). The correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
