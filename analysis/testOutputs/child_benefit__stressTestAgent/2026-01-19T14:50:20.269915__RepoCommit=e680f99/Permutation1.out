2026-01-19T14:50:22.325069 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To determine this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child or children under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T14:50:24.492135 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a son named Leo who attends school in Manchester. 

To help determine your Child Benefit eligibility, may I ask how old your son Leo is?

2026-01-19T14:50:25.340682 [actor]: He's 8 primary school

2026-01-19T14:50:26.630068 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son Leo is 8 years old and in primary school, he's within the age range for Child Benefit eligibility.

My next question is: Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-19T14:50:27.399979 [actor]: manchester house uk citizens

2026-01-19T14:50:28.799051 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in a house in Manchester and are UK citizens. That information is helpful.

Next, I need to ask: Are you primarily responsible for Leo's care? This typically means he lives with you all or most of the time.

2026-01-19T14:50:29.773321 [actor]: married family home

2026-01-19T14:50:31.219581 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're married and Leo lives with you in your family home.

Next question: Is either you or your spouse/partner earning more than £60,000 per year? (This relates to the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-19T14:50:32.604556 [actor]: teacher £35,000 part time £15,000

2026-01-19T14:50:36.062265 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Based on what you've told me:

1. You have an 8-year-old son named Leo who attends primary school in Manchester
2. You live in the UK (Manchester) and are UK citizens
3. Leo lives with you in your family home
4. Your household income appears to be approximately £50,000 in total (£35,000 + £15,000)

Based on this information, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Since your household income is below £60,000, you would receive the full Child Benefit amount without being subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T14:50:37.679000 [actor]: I understand now about my eligibility for Child Benefit. Thank you.

2026-01-19T14:50:40.394679 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that a parent with an 8-year-old child living in the UK, who is responsible for the child's care, and has a household income below £60,000, is fully eligible for Child Benefit without the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
