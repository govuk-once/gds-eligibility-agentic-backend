2026-01-19T15:10:06.138134 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T15:10:07.055196 [actor]: child in care visits home saturday

2026-01-19T15:10:08.334241 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. To clarify, is the child primarily in care (such as foster care or local authority care), but visits your home on Saturdays?

2026-01-19T15:10:09.466187 [actor]: leo 12 comes home saturday morning back sunday morning local authority care

2026-01-19T15:10:12.590661 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. I understand that Leo, who is 12 years old, is in local authority care but visits your home from Saturday morning to Sunday morning each week.

Based on this information, I need to understand your specific arrangement with the local authority. 

If Leo is in local authority care, Child Benefit is usually paid to the local authority rather than to you. However, there are special rules for when a child in care visits home.

Can you tell me if you receive any financial support from the local authority for these weekend visits?

2026-01-19T15:10:13.814677 [actor]: no money visits saturday 10am sunday 11am

2026-01-19T15:10:16.855261 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Leo visits you from Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am, and you don't receive any financial support from the local authority for these visits.

For children in local authority care, the general rule is that the local authority receives the Child Benefit. However, if a child regularly comes home to visit for at least 24 hours at a time, the person they visit may be able to get Child Benefit for those days.

Based on the information you've provided, Leo stays with you for about 25 hours each weekend. This might make you eligible for a portion of Child Benefit for those days.

May I ask, do you have parental responsibility for Leo, or what is your relationship to him?

2026-01-19T15:10:17.551481 [actor]: leo's mother

2026-01-19T15:10:21.480893 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that you're Leo's mother. This is important information for determining your eligibility.

Since you're Leo's mother and he regularly visits you for more than 24 hours each week, you may be eligible for what's called "apportioned" Child Benefit. This means you could receive Child Benefit for the days Leo stays with you.

To claim Child Benefit in this situation, you would need to:

1. Apply for Child Benefit using the CH2 form
2. Provide details about Leo's care arrangements
3. Explain that he's in local authority care but regularly visits you for more than 24 hours each week

The local authority should also acknowledge these visits in their claim.

The amount you receive would be a proportion of the weekly rate based on the number of days Leo stays with you.

Would you like to know about the next steps to apply for this benefit?

2026-01-19T15:10:24.910020 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the mother may be eligible for apportioned Child Benefit since the child is in local authority care but visits for more than 24 hours weekly.
