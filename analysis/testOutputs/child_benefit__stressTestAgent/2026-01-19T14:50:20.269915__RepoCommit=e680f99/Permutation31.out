2026-01-19T15:04:39.266992 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T15:04:40.071812 [actor]: Daughter university student

2026-01-19T15:04:41.158534 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To clarify, is your daughter under 20 years old and in approved education or training at the university?

2026-01-19T15:04:41.978064 [actor]: Emma 18 living at home university started

2026-01-19T15:04:43.808405 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your daughter Emma is 18, living at home, and has started university.

Is Emma studying full-time for a qualifying education course? (Qualifying courses typically include A levels, NVQs up to level 3, undergraduate degrees, or other approved education/training courses.)

2026-01-19T15:04:44.710563 [actor]: Bachelor's degree 3 years commuting daily

2026-01-19T15:04:46.050742 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Is Emma normally living with you in the UK? (I understand she's commuting daily to university, but I just want to confirm she's primarily living at your home in the UK.)

2026-01-19T15:04:46.974247 [actor]: Yes home every night UK address

2026-01-19T15:04:48.408018 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Emma lives with you at a UK address.

Now I need to ask about your income: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T15:04:49.303533 [actor]: No income below that amount

2026-01-19T15:04:50.398541 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Is anyone else (such as another family member or Emma herself) claiming Child Benefit for Emma?

2026-01-19T15:04:51.121096 [actor]: nobody else claiming benefit

2026-01-19T15:04:52.287779 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Does Emma have any children of her own that she is responsible for?

2026-01-19T15:04:53.121207 [actor]: no children single student

2026-01-19T15:04:54.249441 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Is Emma receiving any other benefits in her own right, such as Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance, or Universal Credit?

2026-01-19T15:04:55.042238 [actor]: No other benefits student loan only

2026-01-19T15:04:59.128636 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter Emma because:

1. Emma is under 20 years old (she's 18)
2. She's in approved full-time education (studying for a Bachelor's degree)
3. She normally lives with you in the UK
4. Your income is below £60,000 per year
5. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
6. Emma doesn't have children of her own
7. Emma isn't receiving other benefits that would affect eligibility

You can claim Child Benefit for Emma until she completes her approved education course or reaches age 20, whichever comes first.

If you haven't already applied, you would need to fill out a Child Benefit claim form (CH2) which can be obtained from the government website or by contacting the Child Benefit Office.

Would you like me to explain how you can apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T15:05:00.772333 [actor]: I understand that I'm eligible for Child Benefit for my daughter Emma until she completes her Bachelor's degree or reaches age 20, whichever comes first. Thank you for clarifying this information.

2026-01-19T15:05:03.517001 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the parent is eligible for Child Benefit for their 18-year-old daughter who is in approved education (university), living at home in the UK, with the parent's income below £60,000.
