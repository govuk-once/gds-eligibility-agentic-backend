2026-01-19T14:57:23.976453 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T14:57:24.847982 [actor]: dev 19 at school

2026-01-19T14:57:27.066074 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. To clarify, you have a 19-year-old who is still in school. 

Is your 19-year-old in approved education or training? Approved education typically includes A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, home education (if it started before age 16), or other qualified education courses.

2026-01-19T14:57:28.023225 [actor]: a levels full time

2026-01-19T14:57:29.657642 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your 19-year-old studying A-levels full-time is in approved education, which is positive for Child Benefit eligibility.

Do you usually live in the UK? (This includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland)

2026-01-19T14:57:30.420609 [actor]: yes UK home

2026-01-19T14:57:32.371477 [root_agent]: Thank you. Living in the UK is a key eligibility requirement.

Next question: Are you or your partner responsible for the 19-year-old? By "responsible," this means they live with you or you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit rates toward their care.

2026-01-19T14:57:33.193195 [actor]: son dev lives with me

2026-01-19T14:57:34.955017 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your son Dev lives with you. That helps establish your responsibility for him.

Does either you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year? (This is important because of the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-19T14:57:35.827232 [actor]: 50k salary

2026-01-19T14:57:40.309834 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Since your income is £50,000 per year, you may be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge, but you would still be eligible to receive at least a portion of the Child Benefit.

The High Income Child Benefit Charge begins to apply when an individual income exceeds £50,000, and the benefit is gradually reduced until income reaches £60,000, at which point the charge equals the full amount of the benefit.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have a 19-year-old son (Dev) in full-time approved education (A-levels)
- Your son lives with you
- You live in the UK
- Your income is £50,000 per year

You are eligible for Child Benefit. However, since your income is exactly at the £50,000 threshold, you may need to pay back a small portion of the benefit through the tax system. You would need to register for Self Assessment and declare the Child Benefit you receive.

Would you like to know about the current Child Benefit payment rates or how to apply?

2026-01-19T14:57:41.475507 [actor]: dev birthday next month turns 20

2026-01-19T14:57:46.046066 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing this important information. This changes the assessment significantly.

Since your son Dev will be turning 20 next month, I need to inform you that Child Benefit stops on August 31st after a child turns 19 if they're in approved education or training.

Based on this information:
- Your son is 19 now but turning 20 next month
- He is in approved education (A-levels)
- Child Benefit eligibility ends when a child turns 20, or specifically on August 31st following their 19th birthday if they're in education

Unfortunately, this means your eligibility for Child Benefit for Dev will end when he turns 20 next month. If you're currently receiving Child Benefit for him, it will stop at that point.

Would you like information about notifying the Child Benefit Office about this change or any other support you might be eligible for after Child Benefit ends?

2026-01-19T14:57:50.055201 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops when a child turns 20, even if they're still in approved education, and informed the user that their eligibility will end when their son turns 20 next month.
