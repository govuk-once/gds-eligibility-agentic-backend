The expected outcome is "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)" but the agent stated the user would need to pay back 100% of the benefit due to income over £60,000. This is incorrect - at £75,000, they would pay back a portion (not 100%) as the tax charge is 1% for every £200 over £60k, and the income is between the £60,000 threshold and £80,000 upper limit.
