2026-01-28T12:53:45.328993 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly advised that the parent would be eligible for Child Benefit. According to gov.uk guidance, a parent stops getting Child Benefit if the child starts getting Universal Credit in their own right, which is exactly the situation described here. The agent should have communicated that the parent is not eligible.
