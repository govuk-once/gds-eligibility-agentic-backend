2026-01-28T12:52:50.962892 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly determined that Rashid is not eligible for Child Benefit. The expected outcome was "Eligible (via Exception)" because an exception applies when a married child lives with the claimant and the claimant supports the child (and doesn't financially support the spouse). The agent failed to identify this exception.
