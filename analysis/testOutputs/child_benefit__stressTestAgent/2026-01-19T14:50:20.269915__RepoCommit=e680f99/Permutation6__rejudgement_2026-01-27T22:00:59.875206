2026-01-27T22:06:51.919314 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. While the agent correctly determined eligibility, they gave incorrect information by stating "There's no time limit on how long you can claim Child Benefit while your child is in hospital." This is incorrect as Child Benefit normally stops after 12 weeks of hospitalization, but continues in this case because the mother spends money regularly on the child's upkeep (£30/week on books, pajamas, and special food), which qualifies her for an exception to the 12-week rule.
