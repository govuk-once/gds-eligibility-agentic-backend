2026-01-27T22:09:31.828879 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent didn't definitively conclude the user is "Not Eligible" as required by the expected outcome. Instead, they said the course "may not qualify" and recommended contacting the Child Benefit Office for a definitive answer, which is an inconclusive response rather than the clear "Not Eligible" determination that was expected.
