2026-01-16T16:31:06.385625 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:31:07.036333 [actor]: child benefit residential school

2026-01-16T16:31:08.607478 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit regarding a child in residential school, I need to understand your specific situation better.

Does the child who attends residential school live with you for any period of time, such as during holidays or weekends?

2026-01-16T16:31:09.658715 [actor]: son at residential school 10 weeks council paying

2026-01-16T16:31:11.447502 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son is at a residential school for 10 weeks and the council is paying for this placement.

To clarify your Child Benefit eligibility in this situation, I need to ask: Does your son normally live with you when not at the residential school? For example, does he return home during holidays and weekends?

2026-01-16T16:31:12.218563 [actor]: yes returns home holidays severe behavior needs

2026-01-16T16:31:15.586385 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your son returns home during holidays and has severe behavioral needs.

Based on this information, you would generally still be eligible for Child Benefit even while your son is attending the residential school. When a child stays in residential accommodation for educational purposes but regularly returns home to you (during holidays), you can continue to receive Child Benefit as you are still considered responsible for the child.

The fact that the council is paying for the residential placement doesn't automatically disqualify you from receiving Child Benefit in this situation.

Would you like me to provide more information about how to claim Child Benefit or any specific aspects of eligibility related to your situation?

2026-01-16T16:31:16.292082 [actor]: he's 14 years old

2026-01-16T16:31:19.031493 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming your son's age. At 14 years old, he is under 16, which means he meets the age requirement for Child Benefit.

Since your son:
- Is 14 years old (under 16)
- Returns home during holidays
- Is at residential school for educational/behavioral needs
- Lives with you when not at the residential school

You should remain eligible for Child Benefit during his residential school placement. The fact that the council is paying for the 10-week placement doesn't affect your eligibility as long as you maintain responsibility for him and he returns to your home during holidays.

Is there anything specific about your Child Benefit claim or payments that you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-16T16:31:22.014980 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed that Child Benefit eligibility continues when a child attends residential school but returns home during holidays, as the parent still maintains responsibility for the child.
