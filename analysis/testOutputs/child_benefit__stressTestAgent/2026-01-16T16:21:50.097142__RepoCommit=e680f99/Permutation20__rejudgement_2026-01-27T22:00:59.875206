The agent correctly determined that the grandmother is eligible for Child Benefit as she meets all requirements: she's responsible for a child under 16, both are UK residents, she's not subject to immigration control, her income is below £60,000, and an informal family arrangement for guardianship is valid for Child Benefit claims.
