2026-01-27T22:08:41.428052 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment. The agent correctly identified that the combined contributions of £30 (£15 from Mo and £15 from the grandmother) exceed the Child Benefit rate of £25.60, making Mo eligible. The agent also properly explained the additional requirements about getting the aunt's agreement and contacting HMRC.
