2026-01-28T12:55:24.128768 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly determined the person was not eligible for Child Benefit. According to the expected outcome and UK Child Benefit rules, a non-resident parent who contributes at least the equivalent of the weekly Child Benefit rate is eligible. The person contributes £120 every 4 weeks (averaging £30/week), which exceeds the £26.05 threshold, making them eligible despite not providing day-to-day care.
