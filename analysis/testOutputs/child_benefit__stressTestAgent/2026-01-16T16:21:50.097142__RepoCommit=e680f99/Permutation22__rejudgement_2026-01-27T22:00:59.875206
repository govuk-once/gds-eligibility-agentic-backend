2026-01-27T22:08:54.750541 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent failed to recognize the "linking rule" - when a child returns to hospital within 28 days, the hospital stays are counted together. Since Arthur was in hospital for 10 weeks, home for 2 weeks, then back in hospital for 3 more weeks (total 13 weeks), he exceeds the 12-week limit. The correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
