The agent correctly determined that the user is eligible for Child Benefit as they have a 17-year-old daughter (Sian) in approved education (Foundation Apprenticeship in Wales counts as approved training in Wales), and the household income is below the £60,000 threshold. This matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."
