2026-01-16T16:40:30.024331 [root_agent]: I understand your children are young enough to potentially qualify for Child Benefit and that you have pre-settled status. Let me continue with my assessment.

Are your children living with you in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:40:30.988341 [actor]: yes uk living with me jobseeker status looking for work

2026-01-16T16:40:32.575134 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your children live with you in the UK. 

Are you responsible for raising these children? By this I mean, do you pay towards their upbringing and are they living with you?

2026-01-16T16:40:33.353694 [actor]: raising children yes my home my responsibility

2026-01-16T16:40:34.775490 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are responsible for raising your children in your home.

Since you mentioned having pre-settled status, may I ask if you have the right to reside in the UK? This is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-16T16:40:36.211243 [actor]: pre-settled status looking for work 95 days jobseeker

2026-01-16T16:40:38.618894 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, you have pre-settled status and are currently looking for work as a jobseeker.

I need to understand your right to reside status better. As someone with pre-settled status who is a jobseeker, there may be limitations on your right to claim certain benefits after a period of unemployment.

Have you been informed of any limitations on your right to reside or access to benefits given your current jobseeker status?

2026-01-16T16:40:40.105958 [actor]: looking for work 95 days no job offer yet

2026-01-16T16:40:43.677698 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

This is an important consideration for your Child Benefit eligibility. As someone with pre-settled status who has been looking for work for 95 days without a job offer yet, I should explain that there may be implications for your right to reside as a jobseeker.

Under current rules, EEA citizens with pre-settled status generally maintain their right to reside as a jobseeker for a reasonable period (often considered to be around 3 months or 91 days), but this can be extended if you can show you're genuinely continuing to seek work and have a realistic chance of finding employment.

Given that you're at 95 days of job seeking, have you been providing evidence to authorities that you're genuinely looking for work and have reasonable chances of finding employment?

2026-01-16T16:40:44.695634 [actor]: looking job applications no success yet

2026-01-16T16:40:48.336461 [root_agent]: I understand you're actively looking for work and submitting applications, though you haven't had success yet.

This is important information regarding your right to reside status. Based on what you've shared, here's my assessment of your Child Benefit eligibility:

You may be eligible for Child Benefit because:
- You have children who live with you in the UK
- You're responsible for raising these children

However, there's an important consideration with your pre-settled status: Since you've been job seeking for over 90 days (95 days specifically), your continued right to reside as a jobseeker - which affects benefit eligibility - may depend on being able to demonstrate that you're genuinely seeking employment and have reasonable prospects of finding work.

Would you like me to explain what steps you might take to apply for Child Benefit or to clarify your right to reside status?

2026-01-16T16:40:49.326486 [actor]: so eligible or not eligible?

2026-01-16T16:40:54.242422 [root_agent]: I need to be clear about your Child Benefit eligibility situation:

Based on the information you've provided, your eligibility is conditional:

- You meet the basic requirements for Child Benefit as you have children living with you in the UK and you're responsible for them.

- However, your eligibility may be affected by your right to reside status. With pre-settled status and having been job seeking for 95 days (which is beyond the typical 91-day period often considered reasonable for jobseekers), your continued right to reside - and thus benefit eligibility - depends on whether you can demonstrate you're genuinely seeking work with reasonable prospects of finding employment.

I would recommend that you:

1. Apply for Child Benefit anyway, as the Child Benefit Office will make the final determination
2. Include evidence of your job search efforts with your application
3. Consider seeking advice from a benefits advisor or citizens advice service for specific guidance on your situation

Your case isn't straightforward "yes" or "no" - it depends on how your right to reside as a jobseeker with pre-settled status is currently being assessed.

2026-01-16T16:40:55.954167 [actor]: I see. So I may not be eligible for Child Benefit because I've been job seeking for 95 days, which is beyond the 91-day period typically allowed for jobseekers with pre-settled status.

2026-01-16T16:40:58.652069 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that eligibility is conditional based on the right to reside status, noting that while the basic requirements are met, the extended jobseeker period (95 days) beyond the typical 91-day period may affect eligibility depending on evidence of genuine job seeking.
