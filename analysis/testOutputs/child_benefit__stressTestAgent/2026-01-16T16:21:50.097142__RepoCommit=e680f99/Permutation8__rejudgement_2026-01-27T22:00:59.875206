2026-01-27T22:09:08.341523 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment but for a different reason. The agent incorrectly stated that at £75,000 income, the tax charge would "effectively cancel out the full amount of the benefit." However, the full charge applies when income exceeds £60,000, so this part was actually correct. The agent's mistake was in the explanation of the graduated rate, incorrectly saying it's "1% for every £100 over £50,000" when it should be 1% for every £200 over £60,000. The expected outcome was "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)" which matches the agent's overall conclusion, but the details provided were inaccurate.
