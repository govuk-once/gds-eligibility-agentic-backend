2026-01-16T16:29:29.292699 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your situation.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-16T16:29:30.533087 [actor]: child living with me is 14

2026-01-16T16:29:32.005262 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since the child living with you is 14, they are under the age of 16, which meets one of the basic requirements.

Are you responsible for raising this 14-year-old child who lives with you?

2026-01-16T16:29:33.001127 [actor]: granddaughter lives with me

2026-01-16T16:29:34.219170 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Are you the primary person responsible for raising your 14-year-old granddaughter who lives with you? This would mean you're the main person providing day-to-day care for her.

2026-01-16T16:29:34.909966 [actor]: I pay for everything lucia parents not around

2026-01-16T16:29:36.442301 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Since you're taking care of your 14-year-old granddaughter Lucia, paying for everything, and her parents are not around, it sounds like you are the person primarily responsible for her.

Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-16T16:29:37.390082 [actor]: Croydon flat

2026-01-16T16:29:38.831963 [root_agent]: Thank you. Since you live in Croydon, which is in the UK, that meets another eligibility requirement.

Is your granddaughter a UK resident?

2026-01-16T16:29:39.703390 [actor]: born royal free hospital lived here whole life

2026-01-16T16:29:41.119059 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your granddaughter was born at the Royal Free Hospital and has lived in the UK her whole life, she is a UK resident.

Are you subject to immigration control that would restrict your access to public funds?

2026-01-16T16:29:42.204460 [actor]: British citizen 60 years

2026-01-16T16:29:43.526064 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're a British citizen, you're not subject to immigration control that would restrict access to public funds.

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-16T16:29:44.442344 [actor]: pension only not much money

2026-01-16T16:29:48.317344 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're on a pension with "not much money," it appears your individual income is below £60,000 per year.

Based on all the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for your 14-year-old granddaughter because:

1. You are responsible for raising her
2. She is under 16 years old
3. She lives with you
4. You both are UK residents
5. You are a British citizen not subject to immigration control
6. Your income appears to be below the higher income threshold

You should be eligible to claim Child Benefit. To apply, you would need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or from your local post office. Since you are the child's grandparent rather than parent, you may need to provide additional information about why you are the primary caregiver.

2026-01-16T16:29:52.261758 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a grandparent who is the primary caregiver for a 14-year-old UK resident granddaughter while being a British citizen with income below £60,000 is eligible for Child Benefit.
