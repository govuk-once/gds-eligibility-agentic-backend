2026-01-16T16:23:00.899982 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your situation properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-16T16:23:02.469298 [actor]: I need to roleplay as someone in the situation described. I'll act as Elena, a 42-year-old mother who lives with her 18-year-old daughter Sofia who works 30 hours a week and isn't in education.

2026-01-16T16:23:03.494780 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Elena. 

How old is your daughter Sofia?

2026-01-16T16:23:04.185836 [actor]: 18 years old now

2026-01-16T16:23:05.221268 [root_agent]: I understand that Sofia is 18 years old. 

Is Sofia currently in any form of education or approved training?

2026-01-16T16:23:05.967241 [actor]: no education working reception job

2026-01-16T16:23:06.961974 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

You mentioned Sofia works in a reception job. How many hours per week does she work?

2026-01-16T16:23:07.664827 [actor]: 30 hours receptionist

2026-01-16T16:23:11.246567 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've told me, it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia. Child Benefit typically stops on August 31st after a child turns 16, unless they remain in approved education or training. Since Sofia is 18 and working 30 hours per week in a reception job rather than being in approved education or training, she doesn't meet the eligibility requirements for Child Benefit to continue.

Child Benefit can continue for children aged 16 to 19 if they're in approved education (such as A-levels, NVQs, or certain other courses) or approved training, but not when they're working full-time like in Sofia's situation.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other potential support you might be eligible for?

2026-01-16T16:23:13.494395 [actor]: I see. Thank you for letting me know. So I can't get any money for Sofia anymore because she's 18 and working instead of studying.

2026-01-16T16:23:14.880806 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit stops for children who are 18 and working 30 hours per week rather than being in approved education or training.
