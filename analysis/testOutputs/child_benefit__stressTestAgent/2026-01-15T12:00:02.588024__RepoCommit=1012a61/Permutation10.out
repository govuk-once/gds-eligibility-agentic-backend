2026-01-15T12:02:58.697936 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:02:59.666482 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please confirm how old the child is that you are asking about?

2026-01-15T12:03:00.463727 [actor]: 12 years old foster child

2026-01-15T12:03:01.202113 [root_agent]: Thank you. And is the local council paying you a fostering allowance that covers the child's accommodation and maintenance?

2026-01-15T12:03:02.211455 [actor]: yes council pays me fostering allowance

2026-01-15T12:03:03.793857 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. 

Based on the information you've provided, and the rules around Child Benefit, you wouldn’t be eligible to claim Child Benefit for this child. This is because the local council is paying a fostering allowance that covers their accommodation and maintenance.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T12:03:05.810442 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know. That's all I needed to know about child benefit.

2026-01-15T12:03:07.328061 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed Brenda that she cannot claim Child Benefit for a foster child when the council pays a fostering allowance for the child's accommodation and maintenance.
