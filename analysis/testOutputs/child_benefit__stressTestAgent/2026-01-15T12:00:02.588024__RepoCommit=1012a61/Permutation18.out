2026-01-15T12:04:59.037365 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you with that. 

To start, could you please tell me your age?


2026-01-15T12:04:59.871976 [actor]: 50 age

2026-01-15T12:05:00.434615 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is the child you are claiming for?

2026-01-15T12:05:01.276403 [actor]: son dev 19 studying a levels

2026-01-15T12:05:01.849408 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information.

Is your son in full-time education?

2026-01-15T12:05:02.733968 [actor]: yes a levels full time

2026-01-15T12:05:03.647769 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. 

Just to confirm, has your son turned 20 yet? This is important as there's an age limit for Child Benefit.

2026-01-15T12:05:04.480792 [actor]: birthday next week turning 20

2026-01-15T12:05:06.823015 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know.

According to the current rules, Child Benefit can continue to be paid as long as the young person is under 20 *and* in approved full-time education. However, once they turn 20, eligibility stops, even if they are still studying.

Therefore, your Child Benefit will continue until your son's 20th birthday. After that date, you will no longer be eligible to claim for him.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this?





2026-01-15T12:05:07.842356 [actor]: no thank you

2026-01-15T12:05:09.957105 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit stops when a child turns 20, even if they are still in approved education.
