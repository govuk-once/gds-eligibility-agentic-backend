2026-01-15T12:01:53.485350 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:01:54.360448 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:01:55.148486 [actor]: 55

2026-01-15T12:01:55.787276 [root_agent]: Thank you. And how old is the child you are claiming for?

2026-01-15T12:01:56.640655 [actor]: son Jack 14

2026-01-15T12:01:57.501226 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Is Jack currently living with you?



I'm checking the rules around Child Benefit and where the child lives is important for determining eligibility.

2026-01-15T12:01:58.455108 [actor]: jack care authority weekends home

2026-01-15T12:01:59.625929 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Just to be sure I understand correctly, Jack is currently in the care of the local authority, but he comes home to stay with you every weekend, arriving Friday evening and leaving Sunday evening? Is that right?

2026-01-15T12:02:00.553931 [actor]: yes every weekend friday sunday

2026-01-15T12:02:01.527921 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Has Jack been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks?



I need to understand this as the rules change after a certain period of time in care.

2026-01-15T12:02:02.247042 [actor]: 3 months care

2026-01-15T12:02:04.094719 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So Jack has been in local authority care for 3 months. 

Now, considering he's in care but comes home every weekend, does Jack spend at least two nights in a row with you, or does he spend a total of at least 24 hours with you each week?



This is important as there are exceptions to the rules around Child Benefit and children in care.

2026-01-15T12:02:05.004878 [actor]: friday saturday nights home

2026-01-15T12:02:07.575494 [root_agent]: Thank you. As Jack spends Friday and Saturday nights with you, that means he spends two nights in a row at home. 

Based on the information you've provided, and the rules around Child Benefit for children in care, it appears you *are* likely still eligible to receive Child Benefit for Jack. Even though he's in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, the fact he spends two nights in a row with you each week means an exception applies.



Would you like me to summarise anything, or perhaps check if there are any other benefits you might be eligible for?

2026-01-15T12:02:11.437747 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that despite Jack being in care for more than 8 weeks (3 months), David remains eligible for Child Benefit because Jack spends two consecutive nights (Friday and Saturday) at home each weekend, which meets the exception criteria.
