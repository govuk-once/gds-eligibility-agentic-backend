2026-01-15T12:03:51.006696 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T12:03:51.795538 [root_agent]: Hello! I can help you with that. To assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T12:03:52.609662 [actor]: 28 years old

2026-01-15T12:03:53.258343 [root_agent]: Thank you. And do you have a child or children under 16 years old?





2026-01-15T12:03:54.225435 [actor]: Yes my son Noah 6

2026-01-15T12:03:54.791340 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Currently, is Noah living with you?

2026-01-15T12:03:55.719108 [actor]: No grandmother taking care of him while recovering from surgery

2026-01-15T12:03:56.452336 [root_agent]: I understand. And how long has Noah been living with his grandmother? Please could you give me an approximate number of weeks.

2026-01-15T12:03:57.311591 [actor]: 6 weeks grandmother helping after my surgery

2026-01-15T12:03:57.968022 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just to confirm, is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Noah?

2026-01-15T12:03:58.798540 [actor]: No grandmother not claiming

2026-01-15T12:04:00.783982 [root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. Based on the information you've provided so far, it appears you are likely still eligible for Child Benefit. As Noah has been living with his grandmother for less than 8 weeks, and she is not claiming Child Benefit for him, you can generally continue to receive payments. 

Just to be absolutely certain, and to double check my understanding - is your surgery the reason Noah is currently staying with his grandmother?

2026-01-15T12:04:01.649822 [actor]: Yes recovery reason he's with grandmother

2026-01-15T12:04:03.530642 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on everything you've told me, you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit for Noah. The rules allow for continued payment for up to 8 weeks when a child is living with someone else temporarily, as long as no one else is claiming for them, and this situation aligns with that.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or any other questions you may have?





2026-01-15T12:04:06.686221 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Sophie remains eligible for Child Benefit because Noah has been staying with his grandmother for less than 8 weeks (6 weeks) and no one else is claiming.
