2026-01-27T17:16:08.103693 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-27T17:16:09.344457 [actor]: I have a son, Leo, who's 8 years old. He lives with me and my husband in Manchester. Would that make us eligible?

2026-01-27T17:16:11.622641 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Based on what you've shared, your son Leo is 8 years old and lives with you, which is within the age requirement for Child Benefit.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you or your husband responsible for Leo's care? By "responsible," I mean providing a home for him and arranging and paying for his food, clothes, and other necessities.

2026-01-27T17:16:13.243428 [actor]: Yes, my husband Tom and I are both responsible for Leo. We provide his home, food, clothes, and everything else he needs. We're his parents and he lives with us full-time.

2026-01-27T17:16:15.261805 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you and your husband are responsible for Leo's care, that's an important eligibility requirement met.

Next question: Do you or your husband have an individual income over £60,000 per year? (This affects whether you'll need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, though you can still claim Child Benefit regardless.)

2026-01-27T17:16:17.129507 [actor]: No, neither of us earns that much. I work part-time and earn about £15,000 a year, and my husband Tom is a teacher earning £35,000 annually.

2026-01-27T17:16:18.843591 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since neither you nor your husband have an individual income over £60,000 per year, you would be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit amount without having to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Now I need to ask: Are you and your husband both UK residents? This is another important eligibility criterion for Child Benefit.

2026-01-27T17:16:19.845823 [actor]: Yes, we're both UK nationals and live permanently in Manchester.

2026-01-27T17:16:22.946329 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you and your husband are UK nationals living permanently in Manchester, which satisfies the UK residency requirement.

Based on all the information you've provided:
- Your son Leo is 8 years old (under 16)
- You and your husband are responsible for Leo's care
- Neither of you earn over £60,000 per year
- You are both UK residents

I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit. You would receive the full amount (currently £25.60 per week for your first or only child) without needing to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2, which you can get online from GOV.UK or by calling the Child Benefit Office.

2026-01-27T17:16:25.291037 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for Child Benefit. It's good to know we can receive the full amount of £25.60 per week for Leo without having to worry about the High Income Child Benefit Charge. I'll look into filling out the CH2 form online to make our claim. Thanks for your help!

2026-01-27T17:16:27.335294 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The assessment was accurate as the child is under 16, lives with the parents who are responsible for his care, they are UK residents, and neither parent earns over £60,000 annually.
