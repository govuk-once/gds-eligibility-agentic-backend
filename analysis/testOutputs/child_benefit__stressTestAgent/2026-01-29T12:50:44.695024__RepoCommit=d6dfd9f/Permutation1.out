2026-01-29T12:50:47.231233 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T12:50:48.920487 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who's 8 years old and he's in primary school.

2026-01-29T12:50:51.254066 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Are you responsible for your son? This means do you live with him and are you the person who looks after him day-to-day (for example, providing his food, clothing, and paying for things he needs)?**

2026-01-29T12:50:53.520258 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. He lives with me and my husband, and we look after him day-to-day. We provide everything he needs - his food, clothes, school things, all of that.

2026-01-29T12:50:55.169133 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Next question: **Do you or your husband currently live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:50:56.606116 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. We're in Manchester.

2026-01-29T12:50:58.521575 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Are you or your husband from the UK, or if not, do either of you have the right to live or work in the UK (for example, through settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another immigration status)?**

2026-01-29T12:51:00.296033 [actor]: Yes, we're both UK nationals. We were both born here.

2026-01-29T12:51:02.475577 [root_agent]: Perfect, that's very clear.

One final question: **Is there anyone else who is also responsible for your son - for example, does he live with anyone else for part of the time, or is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-29T12:51:04.270978 [actor]: No, it's just us. He lives with us full-time and no one else is claiming Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-29T12:51:08.218616 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit**. 

Here's why:
- You have a child under 16 who is in full-time education
- You are responsible for him - he lives with you and you provide for his day-to-day needs
- You live in the UK
- You are a UK national
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

You can make a claim for Child Benefit. Only one person can claim for each child, so either you or your husband can claim (but not both). 

One thing to be aware of: if either you or your husband earns over £60,000 a year, you may need to pay some or all of the Child Benefit back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge, but you can still claim it.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:51:11.188750 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you. I understand now - we're eligible and can make a claim. Our income is below that £60,000 threshold anyway, so that's good to know. Thanks for your help!

2026-01-29T12:51:15.371383 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all relevant criteria (child under 16 in education, responsible parent living with child, UK residency, UK national status, no duplicate claims) and correctly concluded eligibility for Child Benefit, while also appropriately mentioning the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.
