2026-01-29T12:51:50.602999 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T12:51:52.203927 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Ben. He's 17 years old.

2026-01-29T12:51:53.765210 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Ben live with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T12:51:55.403363 [actor]: Yes, Ben lives with me.

2026-01-29T12:51:57.521660 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now I need to understand Ben's current situation a bit better.

Is Ben currently in full-time non-advanced education or approved training?

2026-01-29T12:51:59.177147 [actor]: No, he's not in education anymore. He left school back in June. But he has registered with the local youth careers service and he's actively looking for an apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T12:52:02.101943 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is important for determining eligibility.

Since Ben left education in June and is now 17, I need to ask: has Ben started claiming any benefits in his own name, such as Universal Credit or Jobseeker's Allowance?

2026-01-29T12:52:03.827421 [actor]: No, he hasn't claimed any benefits in his own name. He's just registered with the careers service and looking for an apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T12:52:05.870837 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Let me ask one more question to complete the assessment:

Are you the person responsible for Ben - meaning, do you live with him and are you responsible for his upbringing and care?

2026-01-29T12:52:07.528787 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm his father and he lives with me. I'm responsible for him.

2026-01-29T12:52:13.504421 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, I need to give you some important guidance about your eligibility.

**The situation with Child Benefit eligibility:**

Child Benefit can continue after a child turns 16 if they stay in approved education or training. However, when a young person leaves education or training, Child Benefit usually stops.

In Ben's case, since he:
- Is 17 years old
- Left school in June
- Is not currently in full-time non-advanced education or approved training
- Has not started an apprenticeship yet

**Child Benefit would typically have stopped** after he left education in June. There's usually a short extension period (often until the end of August following the school leaving date) to cover the summer holidays, but once that period ends, eligibility stops until the young person either:
- Starts approved education or training, OR
- Turns 20 (if they were already in approved education/training before turning 20)

Simply being registered with a careers service and looking for an apprenticeship unfortunately doesn't maintain eligibility - the young person needs to have actually started the approved training or education.

Do you have any questions about this, or would you like to know what happens if Ben does start an apprenticeship?

2026-01-29T12:52:15.878922 [actor]: Oh, I see. So just to be clear - even though Ben is registered with the careers service and actively looking for work or an apprenticeship, that doesn't count for Child Benefit? I thought there might be some extension while he's registered and looking?

2026-01-29T12:52:20.204763 [root_agent]: That's a really good question, and I want to make sure I'm giving you accurate information. Let me reconsider this carefully.

You're right to question this - the situation for 16-17 year olds who have left education can have some specific provisions. The key factor is whether Ben is registered with a careers service (which you've confirmed he is) and whether he's in that transition period after leaving education.

Let me ask you this to clarify the timeline:

When exactly did Ben turn 17 - was it before or after he left school in June?

This timing is important because there are specific rules about Child Benefit continuing for young people aged 16-17 who have left education but are registered with careers services, and the rules can depend on their exact age when they left education.

2026-01-29T12:52:21.949183 [actor]: He turned 17 in May, so he was already 17 when he left school in June.

2026-01-29T12:52:26.208469 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that timeline. Let me reconsider the eligibility rules more carefully.

For 16 and 17 year olds who have left education, there are specific provisions. Since Ben:
- Is 17 years old
- Left education in June
- Is registered with the careers service
- Is not in approved education or training yet

I need to check one more important detail to give you the most accurate assessment:

Is Ben registered with a **government-approved careers service** or youth support service (such as the National Careers Service or a local authority careers service)? And do you know if he's been given what's sometimes called a "registration certificate" or formal confirmation of his registration?

This matters because registration with an approved service can potentially extend Child Benefit eligibility for young people in Ben's situation.

2026-01-29T12:52:28.505680 [actor]: Yes, he's registered with the local youth careers service - the one run by the local authority. I'm not sure about a certificate, but he definitely registered with them officially.

2026-01-29T12:52:32.847326 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. This is an important detail.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to give you more nuanced guidance:

**For young people aged 16-17 who have left education:**

Child Benefit can continue beyond the usual end date (typically the end of August after leaving school) **if** the young person is registered with certain approved careers services or youth support services.

Since Ben:
- Is 17 years old
- Left school in June
- Is registered with the local authority youth careers service
- Is not claiming benefits in his own name

**You may still be eligible for Child Benefit** during this transition period while he's registered and looking for work or training.

However, I should note that I want to be completely certain about the specific extension rules and time limits that apply. 

Can you tell me: have you been receiving Child Benefit payments since Ben left school in June, or have they stopped? This will help me understand your current status and whether you need to make a claim or inquiry with HMRC.

2026-01-29T12:52:35.017551 [actor]: I'm not sure about the payments to be honest - that's why I'm asking about eligibility. So you're saying I might still be eligible then? Is there a time limit on how long this extension lasts while he's registered with the careers service?

2026-01-29T12:52:41.296720 [root_agent]: You're asking exactly the right question about time limits, and I want to be completely honest with you: I need to be careful here because the specific rules about extensions for 16-17 year olds registered with careers services, and any time limits that apply, are not entirely clear from the information I have access to.

What I can tell you with confidence is:

**The basic position:**
- Child Benefit normally stops when a young person leaves approved education or training
- There are provisions that can extend eligibility for 16-17 year olds in certain circumstances
- Registration with an approved careers service is relevant to eligibility

**What you should do:**

Given the complexity of your specific situation and to get definitive guidance on:
- Whether the extension applies in Ben's case
- How long any extension period lasts
- Whether you need to inform HMRC of Ben's status

You should contact HMRC's Child Benefit Office directly. They can:
- Check your current claim status
- Confirm whether you remain eligible
- Tell you about any time limits
- Advise if you need to provide evidence of Ben's careers service registration

The Child Benefit helpline can give you the specific, authoritative answer about your individual circumstances.

Is there anything else about the general eligibility criteria I can help clarify?

2026-01-29T12:52:44.227776 [actor]: So just to summarise what you're telling me - you think I *might* still be eligible because Ben is registered with the careers service, but you're not certain about the time limits or exact rules, and I need to contact HMRC directly to find out for sure? Is that right?

2026-01-29T12:52:49.633993 [root_agent]: Yes, that's exactly right, and I apologize for not being able to give you a more definitive answer.

To summarize clearly:

**What I know:**
- Child Benefit eligibility for 16-17 year olds who've left education can be affected by registration with careers services
- Your situation (Ben being 17, registered with local authority careers service, not in education/training, not claiming benefits) suggests there *may* be eligibility

**What I'm uncertain about:**
- The specific time limits for any extension period
- The exact conditions that must be met for the extension to apply
- Whether Ben's particular circumstances qualify

**What you should do:**
- Contact HMRC Child Benefit Office directly to get a definitive answer based on your specific circumstances
- Have details ready about when Ben left school and his careers service registration

I wish I could give you complete certainty, but given the specific nature of the extension rules for this age group, HMRC is the best source for accurate, authoritative guidance on your individual case.

Is there anything else I can help with?

2026-01-29T12:52:51.871594 [actor]: Alright, I understand. I'll contact HMRC directly then. Thanks for your help.

2026-01-29T12:52:56.545784 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent was uncertain and failed to provide the correct information about Child Benefit extension for 16-17 year olds registered with careers services. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit continues for up to 20 weeks for young people aged 16-17 who have left education and are registered with an approved careers service or Connexions service. The agent should have known this specific rule and confirmed eligibility for up to 20 weeks, but instead expressed uncertainty and directed the user to HMRC without providing the correct answer.
