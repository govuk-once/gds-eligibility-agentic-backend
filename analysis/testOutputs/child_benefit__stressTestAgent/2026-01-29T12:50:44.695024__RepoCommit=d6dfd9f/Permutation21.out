2026-01-29T13:02:55.725637 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

(This includes children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)

2026-01-29T13:02:57.981164 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Sam, who's 10 years old. He lives with me. My ex-wife and I recently divorced, and our daughter Ella, who's 8, lives with her mum.

2026-01-29T13:03:00.484699 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know about your situation with Sam and Ella.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you currently responsible for Sam on a day-to-day basis?** 

(By this I mean, is Sam living with you regularly and are you the one mainly looking after him?)

2026-01-29T13:03:02.600569 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Sam lives with me full-time. I'm the one who looks after him day-to-day - I make sure he gets to school, feed him, all of that. He's with me regularly.

2026-01-29T13:03:05.112745 [root_agent]: That's good to know. Since Sam lives with you full-time and you're responsible for his day-to-day care, that's an important factor.

Now, let me ask you about your residency status:

**Do you live in the UK, and if so, are you a British citizen, or do you have the right to reside in the UK?**

2026-01-29T13:03:06.609221 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK and I'm a British citizen.

2026-01-29T13:03:08.981336 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your daughter Ella:

**Is your ex-wife currently claiming Child Benefit for Ella, or do you know if anyone else is claiming for her?**

2026-01-29T13:03:10.752578 [actor]: Yes, my ex-wife Tina is claiming Child Benefit for Ella since Ella lives with her.

2026-01-29T13:03:13.476137 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now I have an important question about your income:

**Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £50,000 a year?**

(This is important because it may affect whether you need to pay a tax charge, known as the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-29T13:03:15.418123 [actor]: No, I don't have a partner at the moment, and my income is under £50,000 a year.

2026-01-29T13:03:19.095772 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Sam**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Sam) under 16 who lives with you
✓ You're responsible for Sam on a day-to-day basis
✓ You live in the UK and are a British citizen
✓ Your income is under £50,000, so you wouldn't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge

Regarding Ella, since she lives with your ex-wife and your ex-wife is already claiming Child Benefit for her, only one person can claim Child Benefit for each child - so that arrangement is correct.

**You should be able to claim Child Benefit for Sam.** You can make a claim through the government's Child Benefit service.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-29T13:03:21.453912 [actor]: That's great, thank you for explaining that. So just to confirm - I can claim the Child Benefit for Sam even though my ex-wife is claiming for Ella? That all sounds straightforward then. I appreciate your help!

2026-01-29T13:03:25.801643 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for Sam (who lives with them) while correctly noting that the ex-wife can claim for Ella (who lives with her), and properly verified all eligibility criteria including residency, responsibility for day-to-day care, and income thresholds.
