2026-01-29T13:08:27.589297 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T13:08:29.772272 [actor]: I'm asking about my son, Jordan. He's 17 and lives with me.

2026-01-29T13:08:32.080923 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Jordan is 17 and lives with you, I need to ask:

**Is Jordan in approved education or training?**

(This could include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or certain training programs.)

2026-01-29T13:08:33.966468 [actor]: No, he's not. He finished his GCSEs last year and hasn't gone to college or anything like that.

2026-01-29T13:08:37.284987 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Unfortunately, based on the information you've provided, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Jordan** because:

- Child Benefit is available for children under 16, OR under 20 if they're in approved education or training
- Jordan is 17 and not in approved education or training

Child Benefit stops when a young person reaches 16 unless they continue in approved education or training, in which case it can continue until they turn 20 (or until they leave education/training if that's sooner).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, or do you have any other children you'd like to ask about?

2026-01-29T13:08:42.970131 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available for a 17-year-old who is not in approved education or training, as the benefit only continues past age 16 if the young person remains in qualifying education or training until age 20.
