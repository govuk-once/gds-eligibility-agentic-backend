2026-01-29T12:59:04.596389 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child or children who you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T12:59:06.792301 [actor]: Yes, I have a daughter. She's 12 years old, her name's Emma. But she doesn't live with me - she lives with her mum.

2026-01-29T12:59:09.162080 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your daughter Emma lives with her mum.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or more) towards your daughter's upkeep each week?

2026-01-29T12:59:10.858114 [actor]: I send £10 a week to her mum for food, and I also send Emma a birthday present once a year. Does that count?

2026-01-29T12:59:12.585186 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Let me ask another important question to assess your situation:

Does Emma's mum currently claim Child Benefit for Emma?

2026-01-29T12:59:14.550193 [actor]: No, her mum doesn't claim Child Benefit.

2026-01-29T12:59:16.419248 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. I have a few more questions to help determine your eligibility.

Are you and Emma's mum separated or divorced, or were you never in a relationship together?

2026-01-29T12:59:18.386782 [actor]: We're separated - we live apart now.

2026-01-29T12:59:20.180176 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you this:

Does Emma ever stay with you, and if so, how often does she stay with you compared to staying with her mum?

2026-01-29T12:59:21.730959 [actor]: No, she doesn't stay with me. She lives with her mum full-time.

2026-01-29T12:59:23.794462 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me ask one more important question:

Are you or Emma's mum currently receiving any other benefits or support for Emma, such as Universal Credit that includes an amount for her?

2026-01-29T12:59:25.461737 [actor]: No, her mum isn't receiving any other benefits for Emma as far as I know. So can I claim the Child Benefit then?

2026-01-29T12:59:30.651496 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, I need to explain the eligibility criteria carefully.

For Child Benefit, the key principle is that it's usually claimed by the person the child lives with. Since Emma lives with her mum full-time and doesn't stay with you, her mum would typically be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit.

However, there is a specific situation where you might be able to claim: if you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or more) towards Emma's care each week, you could potentially claim instead of her mum.

Currently, Child Benefit is approximately £25 per week for the eldest or only child. You mentioned you send £10 a week for food. This would be below the Child Benefit amount.

Let me ask: Would you be able and willing to increase your contributions to at least match the Child Benefit rate (around £25 per week or more) towards Emma's upkeep?

2026-01-29T12:59:32.956916 [actor]: Well, I'm sending £10 a week now, that's what I can manage at the moment. So based on what I'm currently contributing, am I eligible or not?

2026-01-29T12:59:36.763554 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided and the current eligibility rules, **you would not be eligible** to claim Child Benefit for Emma at this time.

Here's why: Since Emma lives with her mum full-time and doesn't stay with you, the general rule is that Child Benefit should be claimed by the person the child lives with - which is her mum.

There is an exception where you could claim if you contribute at least as much as the Child Benefit rate (approximately £25 per week) towards Emma's care. However, your current contribution of £10 per week falls below this threshold.

**The eligible person to claim Child Benefit for Emma would be her mum**, as Emma lives with her full-time. If her mum isn't currently claiming it, she should consider making a claim as she appears to meet the eligibility criteria.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T12:59:42.517421 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rules that Child Benefit is normally claimed by the person the child lives with, correctly identified that the £10/week contribution falls below the Child Benefit threshold of approximately £25/week required for the exception, and properly concluded that the user is not eligible while the mother would be the eligible claimant.
