2026-01-29T13:08:45.146123 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T13:08:46.724179 [actor]: Yes, I do have a child who's under 16.

2026-01-29T13:08:48.965057 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next, I need to ask: Is the child living with you, or are you responsible for the child in some way (such as contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards their upkeep)?

2026-01-29T13:08:50.535830 [actor]: Yes, the child lives with me. I'm the one who filled out the Child Benefit form and I receive the payments into my bank account.

2026-01-29T13:08:53.289914 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It sounds like you're already receiving Child Benefit, which is great.

Just to ensure everything is still in order, let me ask: Are you or your partner responsible for the child? In other words, is the child your own, adopted, or are you their legal guardian or appointed special guardian?

2026-01-29T13:08:55.261783 [actor]: Yes, the child is my own child. I live with my wife and our child.

2026-01-29T13:08:58.162828 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have a child under 16
- The child lives with you
- The child is your own
- You're responsible for the child

**You are eligible for Child Benefit**, and it sounds like you're already receiving it correctly.

Is there anything specific about your Child Benefit that you'd like to check or any changes in your circumstances that you're concerned about?

2026-01-29T13:09:00.366681 [actor]: Well, actually I was wondering about something. I earn £18,000 a year, but my wife earns £65,000. Does her income affect anything with the Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T13:09:04.691994 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the individual is eligible for Child Benefit based on having a child under 16 living with them, and correctly noted they are already receiving it. However, the agent failed to address the High Income Child Benefit Charge when informed that the wife earns £65,000, which exceeds the £50,000 threshold requiring tax payment on the benefit received.
