2026-01-29T13:06:26.238951 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T13:06:27.786351 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Zahid, he's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T13:06:29.502482 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does Zahid normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T13:06:31.152192 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me. He lives with his aunt.

2026-01-29T13:06:33.578843 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. This is an important detail.

Let me ask: **Do you contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate (currently £25.60 per week for the eldest child) towards Zahid's upkeep?**

2026-01-29T13:06:35.815634 [actor]: Well, I send £15 a week to his aunt for Zahid. And his grandmother - that's my mother - she also sends £15 a week to the aunt for him. So together that's £30 a week going towards his care.

2026-01-29T13:06:38.750645 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. I need to clarify something important here.

**Are you and your mother (Zahid's grandmother) contributing this money jointly as a household, or are these two separate, individual contributions from different households?**

In other words, do you and your mother live together, or do you live separately?

2026-01-29T13:06:41.061313 [actor]: No, we live separately. We're in different households. We each send our own money - I send £15 from my place, and she sends £15 from hers.

2026-01-29T13:06:45.140224 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you've told me, let me reflect on your situation:

- Zahid lives with his aunt, not with you
- You personally contribute £15 per week towards his upkeep
- Your mother (from a separate household) contributes another £15 per week

For Child Benefit eligibility when a child doesn't live with you, **you personally need to contribute at least the Child Benefit rate (£25.60 per week for an eldest or only child) towards the child's upkeep.**

Since you contribute £15 per week personally, which is less than the £25.60 threshold, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Zahid based on current rules**.

However, let me ask: **Does Zahid's aunt claim Child Benefit for him?** The person the child lives with may be eligible instead.

2026-01-29T13:06:46.815464 [actor]: No, his aunt doesn't claim Child Benefit for him. She's not claiming anything.

2026-01-29T13:06:49.378542 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Since Zahid's aunt isn't claiming Child Benefit and she's the person he lives with, let me ask you this:

**Would you be willing and able to increase your personal contribution to at least £25.60 per week towards Zahid's upkeep?**

If you could do this, you would meet the financial contribution requirement for Child Benefit eligibility, even though Zahid doesn't live with you.

2026-01-29T13:06:52.377099 [actor]: I'm not really in a position to increase what I'm sending right now. But hang on - doesn't it matter that between me and his grandmother we're sending £30 a week total? That's more than the £25.60 isn't it? We're both contributing to his upkeep.

2026-01-29T13:06:57.712251 [root_agent]: I understand your question, and I can see why you might think the combined amount should count.

Let me reflect carefully on this: The rules for Child Benefit when a child doesn't live with you require that **you personally** must contribute at least the Child Benefit rate towards the child's upkeep. 

The requirement is based on your individual contribution, not a combined contribution from multiple people in different households. This is because only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child at any given time, and that person must individually meet the eligibility criteria.

So while the total of £30 per week going to Zahid is more than £25.60, your personal contribution of £15 per week unfortunately doesn't meet the threshold for **you** to be eligible for Child Benefit.

**Have you considered whether your mother might want to claim Child Benefit for Zahid instead?** If she contributes £15 per week, she would face the same issue, but if she could increase her contribution to £25.60 per week, she could potentially be eligible.

Alternatively, has anyone discussed with Zahid's aunt whether she might claim, since she's the one he lives with?

2026-01-29T13:07:00.430824 [actor]: Look, I've been reading on the government website and it says that contributions can count even if more than one person is contributing, as long as the total is at least the Child Benefit amount. So if me and my mum are both putting money in for Zahid, and it adds up to £30 total, shouldn't that count?

2026-01-29T13:07:05.120023 [root_agent]: Thank you for raising that point - you're right to question me on this, and I need to reconsider carefully.

Let me reflect on the guidance more thoroughly. You're correct that I should look at this more carefully.

The key question is whether contributions from multiple people can be counted together when the child doesn't live with any of them. Let me ask you an important clarifying question:

**When you and your mother each send your £15, are you doing this as part of a joint agreement or arrangement between the two of you to support Zahid together? Or are these completely independent decisions that you each made separately?**

This distinction may be important in understanding whether the contributions could potentially be viewed as a combined arrangement for his upkeep.

2026-01-29T13:07:07.729106 [actor]: Well, we both care about Zahid and we both want to help support him. We've talked about it and we both agreed we'd send money to help with his costs. So yes, it's something we discussed and arranged together - we're both contributing because we want to make sure he's looked after properly.

2026-01-29T13:07:13.069493 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that - it's helpful to understand that you and your mother have a joint arrangement to support Zahid together.

I need to be honest with you: I've been reflecting on the government guidance, and the rules around contributions from multiple people when a child lives elsewhere are not entirely clear-cut in the standard guidance I'm working from.

Given that:
- You and your mother have a joint arrangement
- Together you contribute £30 per week (above the £25.60 threshold)
- You're both contributing towards Zahid's upkeep in a coordinated way

**I would recommend that you contact the Child Benefit Office directly to discuss your specific situation.** They can provide definitive guidance on whether joint contributions from two people in separate households can be combined to meet the eligibility threshold.

You can call the Child Benefit helpline on **0300 200 3100** to explain your situation and get a clear answer.

Is there anything else about your circumstances that might be relevant to your eligibility that we haven't discussed yet?

2026-01-29T13:07:15.375451 [actor]: So just to be clear - you're saying you're not sure whether I'm eligible or not? What's your best assessment based on what I've told you? Am I eligible for Child Benefit or not?

2026-01-29T13:07:21.572914 [root_agent]: You're right to ask me for a clear answer. Let me give you my honest assessment based on the information you've provided and the guidance I have access to.

**My assessment is that you are NOT eligible for Child Benefit for Zahid under the current rules.**

Here's why: The standard rule when a child doesn't live with you is that **you personally** must contribute at least the Child Benefit rate (£25.60 per week) towards the child's upkeep. Your personal contribution is £15 per week, which falls short of this threshold.

While you and your mother have a joint arrangement and together contribute £30 per week, the guidance indicates that the person claiming Child Benefit must individually meet the contribution requirement. Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, and that person must meet the eligibility criteria in their own right.

**However**, I acknowledge that there may be complexities in how joint family arrangements are assessed that go beyond the standard guidance I have access to. That's why I recommended contacting the Child Benefit Office - but based on the rules as I understand them, you would not be eligible with a £15 per week personal contribution.

Does this make sense?

2026-01-29T13:07:23.468405 [actor]: Right, I understand what you're saying. Thanks for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T13:07:28.363004 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit eligibility when the child lives with someone else, contributions from multiple people can be combined to meet the threshold, provided there is a joint arrangement to support the child. The user and their mother have a coordinated arrangement contributing £30/week total (above the £25.60 threshold), which should make the user eligible.
