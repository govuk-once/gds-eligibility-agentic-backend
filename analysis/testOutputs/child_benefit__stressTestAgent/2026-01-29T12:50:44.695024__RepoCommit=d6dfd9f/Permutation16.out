2026-01-29T12:59:44.618938 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child (or children) who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T12:59:46.714723 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who is 14 years old.

2026-01-29T12:59:48.669034 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question:

**Is your son living with you, or are you responsible for paying towards his upbringing (for example, contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay)?**

2026-01-29T12:59:51.000775 [actor]: Well, he's not living with me at the moment. He has a rare condition and has been sent to a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. But I'm still responsible for him - I pay for his incidental costs while he's there and I visit him when I can.

2026-01-29T12:59:54.067094 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this must be a difficult time for your family.

Let me ask you this:

**Is your son expected to be in the hospital in the USA for more than 12 weeks in total, or has it already been confirmed that his stay will exceed 12 weeks?**

(This is important because there are specific rules about Child Benefit when a child is in hospital for extended periods.)

2026-01-29T12:59:55.821455 [actor]: Yes, he's already been there for 15 weeks, so it's definitely been more than 12 weeks.

2026-01-29T12:59:58.434554 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Is the hospital where your son is receiving treatment run by the NHS or funded by the UK government, or is it a private hospital in the USA with no NHS/UK government involvement?**

2026-01-29T13:00:00.586964 [actor]: It's a private specialist hospital in the USA - there's no NHS or UK government involvement. He had to go there specifically because they have expertise in treating his rare condition that wasn't available here in the UK.

2026-01-29T13:00:02.657513 [root_agent]: Thank you for that important clarification.

Now, let me ask you:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your son, or are you applying for it for the first time?**

(This helps me understand your specific situation and provide the most accurate guidance.)

2026-01-29T13:00:04.633702 [actor]: I'm currently receiving Child Benefit for him. I'm just worried about whether I can continue to receive it now that he's been in the hospital abroad for this long.

2026-01-29T13:00:06.649220 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your concern.

Let me ask you one more important question:

**Before your son went to the USA for treatment, was he normally living with you in the UK?**

2026-01-29T13:00:08.279259 [actor]: Yes, he was living with me here in the UK before he went to the USA for the treatment.

2026-01-29T13:00:13.873345 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on the rules for Child Benefit:**

I'm afraid that **you are no longer eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit** for your son in this situation.

Here's why:

When a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks, you can normally continue to receive Child Benefit - BUT this only applies if the child is in a hospital or care home **paid for by the NHS or local authority**.

Since your son is in a private hospital in the USA with no NHS or UK government funding, the exception for children in hospital does not apply. After 12 weeks in this private facility, your entitlement to Child Benefit would have ended.

**What you should do:**

You should contact the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible to inform them of your son's situation. You can call them on **0300 200 3100** to discuss your circumstances and avoid any overpayment issues.

I'm very sorry this isn't better news, especially during such a challenging time for your family. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-29T13:00:21.288302 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital or care, Child Benefit can continue for up to 12 weeks when a child is in hospital, but this applies to ANY hospital (not just NHS-funded ones). After 12 weeks, eligibility ends regardless of whether it's NHS or private. However, the critical error is that the agent failed to recognize that treatment abroad for a condition unavailable in the UK can qualify as an exception where Child Benefit may continue beyond 12 weeks, which should have prompted further investigation or referral to HMRC for a determination rather than a definitive "not eligible" ruling.
