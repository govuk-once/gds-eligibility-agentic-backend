2026-01-29T12:58:33.162913 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T12:58:34.659665 [actor]: Yes, I have a son, Noah, he's 6 years old.

2026-01-29T12:58:36.004430 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does Noah normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T12:58:38.195837 [actor]: Well, that's the thing - he's currently living with his grandmother. I had to have surgery and I'm recovering, so he's been staying with her for about 6 weeks now. But it's just temporary because of my medical situation.

2026-01-29T12:58:40.880633 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. I understand this is a temporary arrangement due to your recovery.

Let me ask: **During this time while Noah is staying with his grandmother, are you still contributing to the cost of raising him (for example, buying clothes, food, or other items for him), or do you expect to resume full responsibility once you've recovered?**

2026-01-29T12:58:43.872062 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm still paying for his things - his clothes, school supplies, and I give my mum money for his food and expenses while he's there. It's only temporary while I recover, and he'll be coming back home to live with me once I'm better. I'm still his mum and responsible for him financially.

2026-01-29T12:58:45.698311 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like you're maintaining your financial responsibility for Noah during this temporary period.

Next question: **Do you (or your partner if you have one) normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:58:47.252840 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I'm a single mother, so it's just me and Noah.

2026-01-29T12:58:48.952025 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: **Are you subject to immigration control (for example, do you have a visa with "no recourse to public funds" written on it, or any other immigration restrictions)?**

2026-01-29T12:58:50.919672 [actor]: No, I'm not subject to immigration control. I don't have any visa restrictions or anything like that.

2026-01-29T12:58:55.816914 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

✓ You are responsible for Noah, who is 6 years old (under 16)
✓ You normally live in the UK
✓ You are not subject to immigration control
✓ Although Noah is temporarily living with his grandmother while you recover from surgery, you are still financially responsible for him and this is a temporary arrangement due to your medical circumstances

The fact that Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother during your recovery does not affect your eligibility, as long as:
- It remains a temporary arrangement
- You continue to contribute to his upbringing financially (which you are doing)
- He will return to live with you once you've recovered

You can claim Child Benefit for Noah. If your circumstances change significantly (for example, if the living arrangement becomes more permanent), you should inform the Child Benefit Office.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:59:00.102133 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you! I'm relieved to know I can still claim Child Benefit even though Noah is with his gran temporarily. I'll go ahead and make sure everything is sorted with my claim.

2026-01-29T12:59:02.661719 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that temporary living arrangements due to medical recovery do not affect Child Benefit eligibility when the parent maintains financial responsibility and the arrangement is temporary, which aligns with the expected "Eligible" outcome and is consistent with gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility.
