2026-01-29T12:55:44.426647 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or young person who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:55:46.200772 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. I have a son, Hans, who is 5 years old.

2026-01-29T12:55:47.871263 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Does Hans normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T12:55:49.317536 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me.

2026-01-29T12:55:51.399287 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

**Are you responsible for Hans? This means you're the person who is mainly responsible for his day-to-day care, such as providing food, clothing, and a place to live.**

2026-01-29T12:55:52.960716 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for him. I take care of him day-to-day.

2026-01-29T12:55:54.582438 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

**Do you normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:55:56.161686 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK now. I'm originally from Germany and moved here recently.

2026-01-29T12:55:58.714157 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**When did you move to the UK? And are you currently working or exercising treaty rights in the UK?**

(This helps me understand if you meet the residency requirements, as EU/EEA nationals may need to be working or exercising treaty rights to be eligible.)

2026-01-29T12:56:00.741239 [actor]: I moved to the UK recently. I'm not currently working - I'm unemployed at the moment, but I am actively looking for work and I've registered as a jobseeker.

2026-01-29T12:56:02.870918 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

**When specifically did you move to the UK? For example, what month and year?**

(This is important because the timing of your move and your immigration status can affect eligibility, particularly for EU/EEA nationals after Brexit.)

2026-01-29T12:56:04.550882 [actor]: I moved to the UK about 3 months ago. And I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme.

2026-01-29T12:56:06.709029 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail.

**Are you currently receiving any UK benefits or have you worked in the UK at all since arriving 3 months ago?**

(This helps me understand your right to reside status, which is a requirement for Child Benefit eligibility.)

2026-01-29T12:56:08.576257 [actor]: No, I haven't worked in the UK yet since I arrived. I'm just registered as a jobseeker and actively looking for work. I haven't received any other UK benefits so far.

2026-01-29T12:56:13.390371 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me reflect on your situation based on what you've told me:

- You have a 5-year-old son (Hans) who lives with you
- You're responsible for his day-to-day care
- You live in the UK
- You're an EU national (German) with Pre-Settled Status
- You moved to the UK 3 months ago
- You're currently unemployed but actively seeking work
- You haven't worked in the UK or received UK benefits yet

**Based on the eligibility criteria, I need to inform you that you may not currently be eligible for Child Benefit.**

The reason is that to qualify for Child Benefit, you must have a "right to reside" in the UK. While you have Pre-Settled Status, simply being a jobseeker alone may not provide a sufficient right to reside for Child Benefit purposes unless you can demonstrate you have a genuine chance of being engaged in work.

However, **if you do find work in the UK (even part-time), your right to reside status would likely be established, and you would then become eligible for Child Benefit.**

Would you like me to clarify anything about this assessment?

2026-01-29T12:56:16.208571 [actor]: I understand what you're saying, but I am registered as a jobseeker and I am genuinely looking for work. I've been applying for jobs and going to interviews. Does that not count towards having a right to reside? I thought being a registered jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work would be enough.

2026-01-29T12:56:21.531610 [root_agent]: You raise an excellent point, and I apologize for not being sufficiently clear. Let me reconsider this carefully.

You're absolutely right that being a registered jobseeker with a genuine prospect of finding work can establish a right to reside for benefit purposes, including Child Benefit.

**Let me ask you: Are you registered with Jobcentre Plus or another official UK employment service, and can you demonstrate that you have a genuine chance of being engaged in work (for example, through your job applications, interviews, and active job search)?**

If the answer is yes - which it sounds like it is from what you've described - then you may well have the right to reside as a jobseeker, which would mean you could be eligible for Child Benefit.

The key is that you need to be able to show you're genuinely seeking employment and have a realistic chance of finding work, which it sounds like you are doing.

Does this more accurately reflect your situation?

2026-01-29T12:56:24.023478 [actor]: Yes, exactly! I am registered as a jobseeker and I can show that I'm genuinely looking for work. I've been applying to jobs regularly and I've had some interviews already. I have a realistic chance of finding work.

2026-01-29T12:56:28.741104 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, and I apologize for the earlier confusion.

Based on what you've told me, let me reassess your eligibility:

✓ You have a child (Hans, age 5) living with you
✓ You're responsible for his day-to-day care
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme
✓ You're registered as a jobseeker and can demonstrate you're genuinely seeking employment with a realistic prospect of finding work

**This means you should be eligible for Child Benefit.** As a jobseeker who can demonstrate genuine prospects of employment, you have the right to reside in the UK, which satisfies the residency requirements for Child Benefit.

**You can apply for Child Benefit for Hans.** The application typically needs to be made within 3 months of your circumstances changing (in this case, arriving in the UK with your son) to receive backdated payments, though you can still apply after that time period.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-29T12:56:34.938671 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent initially made an error by suggesting the user might not be eligible, but then corrected this mistake after the user challenged the assessment, ultimately reaching the correct conclusion that a registered jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status who can demonstrate genuine prospects of employment does have the right to reside and is therefore eligible for Child Benefit.
