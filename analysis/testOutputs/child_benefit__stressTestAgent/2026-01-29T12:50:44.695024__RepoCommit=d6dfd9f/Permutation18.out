2026-01-29T13:00:47.402508 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T13:00:49.180502 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Dev. He's studying full-time for his A-levels, but he just turned 20 recently.

2026-01-29T13:00:51.554217 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Dev has just turned 20 and is studying for his A-levels, I need to ask:

Is Dev enrolled in approved education or training that is **non-advanced** (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or NVQs up to level 3)?

2026-01-29T13:00:53.783959 [actor]: Yes, he is. He's doing his A-levels full-time - he's still in the middle of his course actually. He turned 20 mid-way through the term.

2026-01-29T13:00:56.203473 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since Dev turned 20 during his A-level course, I need to understand when exactly this happened.

Can you tell me the specific date when Dev turned 20, or at least which month and year? This is important because there are specific rules about continuing Child Benefit when a young person turns 20 during their course.

2026-01-29T13:00:58.170849 [actor]: He turned 20 last month - it was in February. He's still attending his classes and everything, just carrying on with his A-levels as normal.

2026-01-29T13:01:00.146688 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Now, another important question: Does Dev normally live with you, and are you responsible for him?

2026-01-29T13:01:02.511657 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me and I'm responsible for him. I've been claiming Child Benefit for him all along while he's been studying.

2026-01-29T13:01:04.410609 [root_agent]: That's good to know. Let me ask you another important question:

Are you or your partner a UK resident, or do you work in the UK and pay UK National Insurance contributions?

2026-01-29T13:01:06.187788 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK resident. I live and work here in the UK.

2026-01-29T13:01:08.256746 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me ask one more question to complete the assessment:

Is there anyone else who might also be claiming Child Benefit for Dev, or is Dev living with anyone else who might be claiming for him?

2026-01-29T13:01:09.918378 [actor]: No, there's no one else claiming for him. He lives with me and I'm the only one who's been claiming Child Benefit for Dev.

2026-01-29T13:01:15.341367 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

**You should still be eligible for Child Benefit for Dev**, even though he has turned 20. Here's why:

✓ Dev is enrolled in approved non-advanced education (A-levels)
✓ He turned 20 while still in the middle of his course
✓ He lives with you and you're responsible for him
✓ You're a UK resident
✓ No one else is claiming for him

**Important point:** When a young person turns 20 during their course, Child Benefit can continue until they finish that course, or until the end of the academic term or year in which they turn 20 (whichever comes first). Since Dev turned 20 in February and is still continuing his A-levels, you should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit at least until the end of his current academic year.

However, I'd recommend that you inform HMRC about Dev turning 20, as they may need to review when exactly the payments should stop based on when his course ends. Child Benefit payments typically cannot continue beyond the week containing 31 August following their 20th birthday if they're still in education.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-29T13:01:20.501914 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that I should still be eligible for Child Benefit for Dev after he turned 20 in February, but according to gov.uk rules, Child Benefit stops on the child's 20th birthday even if they are still in approved education or training. The eligibility ceases immediately on the 20th birthday, not at the end of the academic term or year.
