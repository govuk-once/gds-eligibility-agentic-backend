2026-01-29T13:09:06.955876 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T13:09:08.962361 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter who's 18 and she's just started university - a Bachelor's degree. She lives at home with me and commutes to uni.

2026-01-29T13:09:11.304145 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know about your daughter.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you responsible for your daughter - meaning do you live with her and either pay for things like food, clothes, or pocket money, or she lives with you and you're responsible for her care?**

2026-01-29T13:09:13.210838 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. She lives with me at home and I pay for all her food, clothes, and general living expenses. I'm her mum and she's completely dependent on me while she's at university.

2026-01-29T13:09:16.258270 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's really helpful.

Now I need to ask:

**Is your daughter in full-time approved education or training that is not a university degree course (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or equivalent non-advanced education)?**

I ask because you mentioned she's doing a Bachelor's degree at university, and the rules for Child Benefit typically cover children under 20 who are in approved education or training - but this usually refers to non-advanced education rather than university degree courses.

2026-01-29T13:09:18.455220 [actor]: No, she's not doing A-levels or anything like that - she's finished college now. She's doing a full Bachelor's degree at university, so I suppose that would be advanced education, not the approved education you're talking about.

2026-01-29T13:09:23.065769 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. 

Based on the information you've provided, I need to let you know that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter**.

Here's why:

Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in **approved education or training**. However, approved education or training refers to non-advanced education such as:
- A-levels
- Scottish Highers  
- NVQs up to level 3
- Similar non-advanced courses

Unfortunately, **university degree courses (like the Bachelor's degree your daughter is studying) do not count as approved education or training** for Child Benefit purposes. This means that once a young person starts university, even if they're under 20 and living at home with you supporting them, Child Benefit stops.

Child Benefit would have ended when your daughter finished her non-advanced education (like college/sixth form) and started her university degree.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T13:09:25.610901 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but thank you for explaining it clearly. I understand now - it's because she's doing a university degree rather than A-levels or that kind of thing. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T13:09:29.098050 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education such as a university degree, and correctly determined that the user is not eligible because their 18-year-old daughter is studying for a Bachelor's degree rather than non-advanced education like A-levels.
