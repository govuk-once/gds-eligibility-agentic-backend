2026-01-15T17:26:32.094157 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-15T17:26:33.624379 [actor]: I need to role-play as a UK resident seeking child benefit information. I'll engage with the agent as directed in the scenario.

My kid Liam is 18 lives with me does A levels gets universal credit

2026-01-15T17:26:35.327201 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Okay, so your son Liam is 18, lives with you, is studying A-Levels and receives Universal Credit.

Just to clarify, is Liam in full-time, non-advanced education? (A-Levels *are* considered advanced education, so I need to confirm if he's still within the relevant age range for continuing to receive Child Benefit while studying).

2026-01-15T17:26:36.524306 [actor]: Full time A levels Jessica 40 I'm his mum he doesn't see his dad

2026-01-15T17:26:38.324586 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Jessica. So Liam is 18, doing full-time A-Levels, lives with you as his mum, and doesn’t have contact with his father.

To confirm, are you currently employed or self-employed, and if so, approximately what is your annual income? (This is to check if your income affects eligibility). Don’t need the exact figure, just a range is fine.

2026-01-15T17:26:39.055347 [actor]: Office admin work 32000 yearly

2026-01-15T17:26:42.901333 [root_agent]: Thank you, Jessica. So you work as an office administrator and earn approximately £32,000 per year.

Given the information you’ve provided so far – Liam is 18, doing A-Levels, lives with you, doesn’t have contact with his father, and your income is £32,000 – it appears you *may* still be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Generally, Child Benefit stops when a child turns 18. However, it can continue if they are:

*   Under 20 and remain in approved full-time education.
*   Under 20 and looking for work, or training for work.

Since Liam is doing A-Levels, he falls into the first category. Also, your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold.

To be absolutely certain, could you confirm that Liam's A-Level course is expected to last for at least two years?

2026-01-15T17:26:43.831453 [actor]: Two years yes started last September

2026-01-15T17:26:46.163980 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you Jessica. 

Based on all the information you’ve provided – Liam being 18, in full-time A-Level studies expected to last two years, living with you, having no contact with his father, and your income being £32,000 – it appears you **are** eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Liam.

However, it’s always best to double check with the official government website or HMRC directly, as circumstances can be complex. Would you like me to summarise the key reasons why you appear eligible?

2026-01-15T17:26:47.210149 [actor]: you said I'm eligible but what about his universal credit

2026-01-15T17:26:50.660669 [root_agent]: You are absolutely right to ask about the Universal Credit, Jessica. My apologies for not mentioning that earlier - it's an important consideration.

Liam receiving Universal Credit *could* affect your Child Benefit entitlement, but not necessarily stop it completely. Universal Credit usually takes into account the child element, which covers some of the costs already addressed by Child Benefit.

However, the amount of Universal Credit Liam receives won't directly reduce your Child Benefit payment. Both can be paid. The Universal Credit calculation will adjust based on the fact you are also receiving Child Benefit.

Essentially, both benefits can be received, but the total amount of financial support you receive overall will be affected by the interaction between the two.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to explain it in a different way, or perhaps point you to resources that explain how Universal Credit and Child Benefit interact?

2026-01-15T17:26:51.463370 [actor]: but Liam gets universal credit himself his own claim

2026-01-15T17:26:55.288560 [root_agent]: You are absolutely correct to point that out, Jessica! My apologies for the continued misunderstanding. I should have clarified that immediately.

If Liam has his *own* Universal Credit claim, that changes things. Because Liam is receiving Universal Credit in his own right, and is over 18, this usually means you are **not** eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for him. The Universal Credit claim already includes support for his living costs.

I sincerely apologise for the previous incorrect assessments. I am still under development and learning to accurately process more complex scenarios.

To be 100% sure, you might want to double-check on the Gov.uk website or contact HMRC directly, but based on the information now, it appears you are unlikely to be eligible for ongoing Child Benefit for Liam.

Again, I apologise for the confusion. Would you like me to provide a link to the relevant page on the Gov.uk website about Child Benefit and Universal Credit?

2026-01-15T17:26:56.763732 [actor]: So not eligible because of his universal credit claim?

2026-01-15T17:26:59.072366 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent initially made a mistake but correctly revised their assessment, explaining that Child Benefit is not payable when an 18-year-old has their own Universal Credit claim.
