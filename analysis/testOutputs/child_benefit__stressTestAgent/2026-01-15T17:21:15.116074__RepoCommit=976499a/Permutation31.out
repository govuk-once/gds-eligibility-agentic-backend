2026-01-15T17:37:24.794567 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? This is one of the initial criteria for eligibility.



**My thought process:**

I am beginning the process of assessing eligibility. The first step, according to the provided documentation, is to determine if *you* (the claimant) meet the age requirements. I must ask one question at a time and focus only on the person I am speaking to. I am being polite and setting the stage for further questions.

2026-01-15T17:37:26.656140 [actor]: I need to play the role of Sarah, a 45-year-old mother who wants to claim Child Benefit for her 18-year-old daughter Emma who has started university. Based on the scenario, I should be obtuse, not answer questions directly, and speak like I'm entering search terms.

child benefit university daughter 18

2026-01-15T17:37:30.743576 [root_agent]: Okay, I understand you’re Sarah, and you're looking into Child Benefit for your 18-year-old daughter Emma who is at university. 

To clarify, regarding your eligibility to *claim* Child Benefit, are you currently responsible for Emma's care and maintenance? I need to understand your relationship to Emma for the claim itself.



**My thought process:**

The user has indicated they are roleplaying. I have acknowledged this and will proceed as if speaking to “Sarah”. The initial information suggests Emma is 18 and at university, which immediately brings up specific rules regarding continuing eligibility. However, eligibility hinges on *who* is claiming the benefit. The provided links state that the person claiming must meet certain criteria. Therefore, I need to establish Sarah's role and responsibilities regarding Emma. I’m phrasing the question neutrally, avoiding leading language, and sticking to one question at a time. I anticipate the response might be indirect given the instructions to play an "obtuse" role.

2026-01-15T17:37:31.611966 [actor]: yes daughter lives home commutes daily to university classes

2026-01-15T17:37:34.429780 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To confirm, as Emma is 18 and attending university, does she have a valid Certificate of Initial Assessment from her education provider confirming she's undertaking a qualifying course?



**My thought process:**

The response confirms Emma lives at home and commutes to university. This is key information. The rules state that Child Benefit can continue for 18-20 year olds if they are in approved education. However, proof of that education is needed. I’m focusing on the documentary requirement, as specified in the eligibility guidance, and asking a direct question to elicit that information. I'm keeping the question focused and avoiding multiple inquiries.

2026-01-15T17:37:35.362196 [actor]: university degree bachelors 3 years just started

2026-01-15T17:37:37.903528 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful. And just to be certain, is Emma financially dependent on you? Specifically, do you provide her with more than a small amount of money each week?



**My thought process:**

Knowing Emma is undertaking a Bachelor's degree is good, confirming it's a qualifying course. However, the rules also address financial dependency. Even with a qualifying course, there can be implications for eligibility if the young person is financially independent. I’m phrasing the question carefully to avoid ambiguity – “small amount” is deliberately vague to gauge Sarah's understanding of the threshold. Again, sticking to one question.

2026-01-15T17:37:38.623387 [actor]: pay for food rent clothes pocket money

2026-01-15T17:37:41.382366 [root_agent]: Thank you. And to clarify, regardless of you providing for those things, does Emma herself have an income exceeding £223 per week *before* tax?



**My thought process:**

The response clearly indicates financial support from Sarah, which points towards dependency. However, there's a specific income threshold for the 18-20 year old education rule. I need to establish if Emma has a significant income of her own. I am quoting the exact income threshold as per the eligibility guidance to avoid any misinterpretation. I'm keeping the question tightly focused on Emma’s income and preceding it with a disclaimer to acknowledge the previous discussion about Sarah’s contributions.

2026-01-15T17:37:42.119114 [actor]: no income student full time

2026-01-15T17:37:44.724382 [root_agent]: Excellent. Finally, just to be absolutely sure, are you, as Emma’s mother, currently working more than 16 hours a week, or claiming certain benefits?



**My thought process:**

Emma having no income is positive for eligibility. Now I need to check Sarah’s eligibility to *claim* the benefit. The rules outline certain conditions relating to the claimant’s work status or benefit claims. I’m phrasing the question broadly to cover both scenarios, but still keeping it singular and focused on Sarah’s circumstances. I’m using “absolutely sure” to convey thoroughness and demonstrate I'm nearing a conclusion.

2026-01-15T17:37:45.403763 [actor]: work full time office job

2026-01-15T17:37:49.452790 [root_agent]: Okay, based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you *are* likely eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Emma while she attends university, as she meets the criteria of being under 20 and in full-time education, and you meet the requirements as the claimant.

However, it’s important to remember that this is my assessment based on the information given. To be completely certain, I recommend reviewing the official guidance on the gov.uk website.



**My thought process:**

Sarah works full-time, which doesn’t disqualify her from claiming. Emma meets the age and education criteria, and appears financially dependent. Therefore, based on the provided information and the guidance documents, she likely *is* eligible.

I am being cautious and qualifying my assessment by stating it’s based on provided information and recommending official confirmation. I am adhering to the instructions *not* to provide direct links but acknowledging the official source of information. I have completed the assessment using a question-by-question approach.

2026-01-15T17:37:52.666857 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately concluded that a parent can claim Child Benefit for an 18-year-old in full-time education who lives at home, is financially dependent, and has no substantial income.
