2026-01-15T17:22:35.435256 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (Child Benefit eligibility depends on your age and whether you are responsible for a child).

2026-01-15T17:22:36.840203 [actor]: I'll role-play as the user described in the scenario.

Ten years old son child benefit claim divorce payment food clothes

2026-01-15T17:22:37.931836 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, are *you* the parent or legal guardian making the claim for your ten-year-old son? Or are you ten years old? I need to understand who I am assessing for eligibility.





2026-01-15T17:22:38.794139 [actor]: Son lives with ex-wife pay 150 pounds monthly for food clothes

2026-01-15T17:22:40.209518 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So you are the father making a claim for Child Benefit for your son who lives with your ex-wife, and you pay £150 per month towards his food and clothes.

To help me assess your eligibility, could you please tell me - are you currently employed or self-employed?

2026-01-15T17:22:40.969114 [actor]: Forty divorced want child benefit ex-wife not claiming

2026-01-15T17:22:42.108470 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you are 40 and divorced, and that your ex-wife is not claiming Child Benefit. 

Given this information, and that your son lives with his mother, are you named on your son’s birth certificate?

2026-01-15T17:22:42.811230 [actor]: Yes birth certificate named

2026-01-15T17:22:44.065100 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know. Being named on the birth certificate is important.

Now, regarding your income – do you have a total annual income of more than £50,000? This is because Child Benefit starts to reduce if you earn over this amount.

2026-01-15T17:22:44.836071 [actor]: Earn less than fifty thousand

2026-01-15T17:22:46.054234 [root_agent]: Great, that means your income doesn’t affect your eligibility.

Finally, to confirm, does your son live with you for more than half the time, even though you mention he lives with his ex-wife? I understand situations can be complex.





2026-01-15T17:22:46.905390 [actor]: No lives with mother but contribute 150 pounds monthly

2026-01-15T17:22:51.085075 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that your son lives with his mother.

Based on the information you’ve provided: you are the father, named on the birth certificate, earn under £50,000 per year, your ex-wife is not claiming Child Benefit, and your son lives primarily with his mother although you contribute financially.

According to the information available, you *may* be eligible to claim Child Benefit. Even though your son lives with his mother, you can claim if you are responsible for him and meet the other criteria, and your ex-wife isn't already claiming.

However, it’s important to note that HMRC will need to assess the specific details of your arrangement. I recommend you review the guidance on the government website regarding claiming when a child lives with someone else: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else.

Would you like me to summarise the key points, or is there anything else I can help you with?





2026-01-15T17:22:52.262254 [actor]: Eligible child benefit good news

2026-01-15T17:22:54.901405 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. Since the child lives with the mother and doesn't live with the father for at least the same amount of time, the father would not normally be eligible for Child Benefit unless there was a family-based arrangement or court order specifically stating this.
