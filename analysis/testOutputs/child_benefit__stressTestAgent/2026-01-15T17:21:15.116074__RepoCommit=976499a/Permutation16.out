2026-01-15T17:28:34.939988 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (I need to assess *your* eligibility as the person claiming, not the child's).

2026-01-15T17:28:35.825246 [actor]: Child benefit eligibility UK son hospital America

2026-01-15T17:28:37.594371 [root_agent]: Thank you for the additional context. It sounds like your son is currently in hospital in America. 

Before we delve into that specific situation, let's start with some basic eligibility questions. Could you please tell me how old *you* are? (I need to assess *your* eligibility as the person claiming, not the child's). Knowing your age is a fundamental first step.





2026-01-15T17:28:38.337468 [actor]: 39 years old.

2026-01-15T17:28:39.751398 [root_agent]: Thank you. At 39 years old, you are within the age range to potentially claim Child Benefit.

Now, to clarify – is the child you would be claiming for your biological child? Or are you responsible for them in another way (e.g., adopted, foster parent, legal guardian)?

2026-01-15T17:28:40.625904 [actor]: My son. Oliver. 14.

2026-01-15T17:28:42.383399 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Oliver is your son and that he is 14 years old. That means he *is* old enough for you to potentially receive Child Benefit, as it's generally payable until a child turns 16.

Given you previously mentioned Oliver is in hospital in America, could you tell me how long he has been in hospital, and is this a temporary or long-term arrangement?

2026-01-15T17:28:43.123435 [actor]: America hospital treatment 15 weeks rare condition specialist

2026-01-15T17:28:44.443471 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It sounds like Oliver is receiving specialist treatment for a rare condition in America, and has been there for 15 weeks.

To clarify, is Oliver still living with you usually, when he is not receiving this hospital treatment? Or does he normally live with someone else?





2026-01-15T17:28:45.330046 [actor]: Normally lives with me UK. In USA for treatment only.

2026-01-15T17:28:46.702984 [root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Oliver normally lives with you in the UK and is only in the USA for treatment. 

Now, regarding your National Insurance number – do you have a valid UK National Insurance number? (It doesn't need to be a qualifying year, just a valid number).

2026-01-15T17:28:47.421418 [actor]: Yes national insurance

2026-01-15T17:28:48.915295 [root_agent]: Great. Having a valid National Insurance number is a positive step!

Finally, to help me understand your situation fully, are you working, or do you receive a taxable benefit? (This relates to the High Income Child Benefit Charge - HICBC). It’s okay if you're not working, just let me know.

2026-01-15T17:28:49.840681 [actor]: Working part-time income twenty thousand

2026-01-15T17:28:54.053447 [root_agent]: Thank you. An income of twenty thousand pounds from part-time work is useful information.

Based on everything you've told me, it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit for Oliver. Your age is within the range, he is your biological son and under 16, normally lives with you, you have a National Insurance number, and your income is below the threshold (£50,000) that would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

However, because Oliver is receiving treatment in America, it’s worth noting that there are specific rules around children who are abroad. The fact he's there for medical treatment *shouldn't* affect your eligibility, as long as he normally lives with you in the UK.

Would you like me to summarise the key points, or are you happy with this initial assessment?



**Disclaimer:** I am an AI and cannot provide financial advice. This assessment is based on the information you have provided and my understanding of the current guidelines. It is always best to confirm your eligibility directly with HMRC.

2026-01-15T17:28:55.145919 [actor]: Good happy with assessment.

2026-01-15T17:28:57.703822 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly assessed that a parent of a 14-year-old who normally lives in the UK but is temporarily abroad for medical treatment would be eligible for Child Benefit, especially with an income below the HICBC threshold.
