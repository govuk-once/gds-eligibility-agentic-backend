2026-01-15T17:21:16.568405 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the person claiming for a child, or are a young person potentially eligible yourself).

2026-01-15T17:21:17.612822 [actor]: I'll role-play as the user in this situation based on the provided context.

Manchester family child benefit check

2026-01-15T17:21:18.687607 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. To assess eligibility for Child Benefit, let's start with the child(ren) in question. 

Could you please tell me the date of birth of the child you are claiming for?





2026-01-15T17:21:19.439014 [actor]: Leo age 8 school

2026-01-15T17:21:20.695974 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. Leo is 8 years old, which means he *is* within the eligible age range (under 16). 

Now, are you Leo's parent, or do you have legal care of him? (This includes being appointed a guardian).

2026-01-15T17:21:21.602167 [actor]: Parent boy lives with us in Manchester

2026-01-15T17:21:23.071936 [root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. So you are Leo's parent and he lives with you in Manchester.

To clarify, are you working, and if so, approximately how many hours per week do you work? (This is to check the earnings limits). Don’t need an exact number, an estimate is fine.

2026-01-15T17:21:24.209522 [actor]: Husband teacher £35,000 me part-time £15,000

2026-01-15T17:21:25.681070 [root_agent]: Thank you. Your husband earns £35,000 as a teacher and you earn £15,000 part-time. Both of these incomes are below the threshold that would prevent you from receiving Child Benefit.

Now, is either you or your husband claiming any other benefits, such as Universal Credit?

2026-01-15T17:21:26.480895 [actor]: No benefits British citizens

2026-01-15T17:21:27.635979 [root_agent]: Okay, good to know you aren't claiming any other benefits and that you are both British citizens.

Just to confirm, are you and Leo's father married, or are you both the registered parents of Leo? (This relates to parental responsibility).

2026-01-15T17:21:28.735296 [actor]: Married both Leo's parents

2026-01-15T17:21:31.051021 [root_agent]: Excellent. You are married and both Leo’s parents.

Based on the information you've provided – that Leo is under 16, lives with you, you are his parents, your combined income is under the threshold, you aren’t claiming other benefits, and you are both British citizens – it appears you *are* eligible for Child Benefit.

However, to be absolutely certain, and to initiate a claim, you would need to formally apply through the government website. Would you like me to summarise the key eligibility points we've covered?

2026-01-15T17:21:33.033603 [actor]: Thank you for confirming our eligibility. Will check government website for application forms.

2026-01-15T17:21:34.796257 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent provided incorrect information about income thresholds - Child Benefit is not means-tested in that way, though there is a High Income Child Benefit Charge that applies when an individual earns over £50,000.
