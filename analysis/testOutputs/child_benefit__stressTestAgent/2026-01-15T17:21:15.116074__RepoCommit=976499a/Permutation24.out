2026-01-15T17:33:54.937923 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-15T17:33:55.725002 [actor]: son tom residential school benefits

2026-01-15T17:33:56.715896 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for the additional context. It sounds like you are claiming for a son, Tom, who is at residential school.

To clarify, are you Tom's parent or legal guardian?

2026-01-15T17:33:57.510168 [actor]: yes parent son in residential school 10 weeks

2026-01-15T17:33:58.802386 [root_agent]: Okay, so you are Tom's parent and he's been at residential school for 10 weeks. That's good to know. 

According to the rules, children in residential school can still be eligible for Child Benefit. To confirm, is Tom aged under 20?

2026-01-15T17:33:59.459760 [actor]: tom 14 years old special needs behavioral

2026-01-15T17:34:00.735193 [root_agent]: Thank you. Tom is 14 years old and has special needs relating to behaviour – that's helpful information.

Now, is Tom living with you *most* of the time, even though he is currently at residential school? The rules consider where the child normally lives.

2026-01-15T17:34:01.572358 [actor]: no residential school weekdays council pays

2026-01-15T17:34:02.915932 [root_agent]: Okay, so Tom isn't living with you most of the time, and the council pays for his residential school placement. This is important.

To clarify, does Tom come home to stay with you at weekends, or during school holidays? Even occasional time at home can affect eligibility.

2026-01-15T17:34:03.664594 [actor]: rarely comes home too difficult behavioral needs

2026-01-15T17:34:06.022223 [root_agent]: I understand. It sounds like Tom rarely comes home due to his behavioural needs, which is completely understandable. 

Given that Tom is 14, at residential school, and rarely returns home, it seems likely you may *not* be eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state that if a child is living away from home and receiving care from the local authority (which the council paying for the school suggests), it affects eligibility.

However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm if the council has legal responsibility for Tom? (i.e. are they his legal guardian).

2026-01-15T17:34:06.885394 [actor]: council not guardian just pays school special needs residential accommodation

2026-01-15T17:34:09.325717 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So the council pays for Tom’s school and accommodation due to his special needs, but they are *not* his legal guardian.

This is a key distinction. Because the council is paying for Tom’s care but doesn’t have legal guardianship, and he’s living away from home for the majority of the time, you are likely **not** eligible for Child Benefit. The benefit is generally for children living with their parents or guardians.

Would you like me to summarise this, or would you like me to revisit any part of the questions?





2026-01-15T17:34:10.333485 [actor]: no still paying for him been 10 weeks only residential not care

2026-01-15T17:34:12.804836 [root_agent]: You are right to question that – thank you for pointing that out. I need to review my assessment based on your clarification. You’re still paying for him, and it’s a residential school placement, not a care arrangement, even though it’s for 10 weeks.

My apologies for the previous incorrect assessment. I was too quick to assume ineligibility based on the council contribution.

Let’s revisit this. Because Tom is 14 and at residential school, but you are still financially responsible for him, are you receiving any other benefits for him, such as Disability Living Allowance?

2026-01-15T17:34:13.725323 [actor]: residential accommodation special needs school 10 weeks paid by council

2026-01-15T17:34:15.314944 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for repeating that the residential accommodation and special needs school are paid for by the council for 10 weeks.

To be absolutely clear, even though the council is paying for the school and accommodation, are *you* still providing Tom with pocket money or contributing to any of his expenses while he is at school? Even small contributions are relevant.

2026-01-15T17:34:16.059438 [actor]: yes clothes pocket money holidays expenses

2026-01-15T17:34:19.067798 [root_agent]: That’s very helpful to know. The fact that you are still providing for Tom with clothes, pocket money, and covering holiday/other expenses is important.

Given all the information – Tom is 14, at residential school for 10 weeks, the council pays for the school and accommodation, but *you* continue to financially support him with clothes, pocket money and other expenses – it is likely you **are** still eligible for Child Benefit.

The key factor here is that you are still providing financial support despite the council's contribution toward his residential placement.

Would you like me to summarise the reasons why you are likely eligible, or would you prefer I double-check any specific piece of information?

2026-01-15T17:34:19.854289 [actor]: I'm eligible?

2026-01-15T17:34:22.935507 [root_agent]: Yes, based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you *are* eligible for Child Benefit for Tom. 

Here's a summary of why:

*   Tom is under 20.
*   He is at residential school.
*   Even though the council pays for his accommodation and school fees, you continue to provide financial support for him through clothing, pocket money, and expenses.

This ongoing financial support means you still meet the criteria for claiming Child Benefit.



It's always best to double-check with the official government website to be completely sure, but based on our conversation, you seem to be eligible. Would you like me to provide you with the link to the Child Benefit section of the Gov.uk website?

2026-01-15T17:34:26.504164 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly noted that the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit because they continue to financially support their child (with clothes, pocket money, etc.) even though the child is in residential school paid for by the council.
