2026-01-15T17:45:22.735739 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This is to determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-15T17:45:23.525552 [actor]: benefits check child benefit

2026-01-15T17:45:24.352970 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for the clarification. So you're asking about eligibility for Child Benefit as a parent or guardian.

First, how many children do you have?

2026-01-15T17:45:25.144773 [actor]: one boy

2026-01-15T17:45:25.599250 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. And how old is your son?

2026-01-15T17:45:26.291411 [actor]: he is 7

2026-01-15T17:45:27.494750 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now, are you currently working, and if so, approximately how many hours per week do you work? (Even if it's a very small amount, please let me know). This helps determine if your income affects eligibility.

2026-01-15T17:45:28.529353 [actor]: looking for job

2026-01-15T17:45:29.549284 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you are currently looking for work. 

To clarify, are you currently earning any income at all - even from part-time work, self-employment, or any other source?

2026-01-15T17:45:30.195233 [actor]: no job yet

2026-01-15T17:45:31.047209 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now, is there another parent involved in raising your son? (For example, are you separated, divorced, or do you live with the other parent?)

2026-01-15T17:45:31.707926 [actor]: no wife left

2026-01-15T17:45:32.569909 [root_agent]: I understand. So you are raising your son alone, and there is no other parent actively involved in his care. Is that correct? Just want to be sure I've understood correctly.

2026-01-15T17:45:33.402060 [actor]: yes raising alone she left long ago

2026-01-15T17:45:34.227519 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming.

Now, is your son living with you full-time? This means does he normally live at your address and sleep there most nights?

2026-01-15T17:45:34.883218 [actor]: yes with me always

2026-01-15T17:45:35.698860 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. Finally, are you a UK resident? (Meaning you live in the UK for at least 28 days a year).

2026-01-15T17:45:36.451604 [actor]: pre-settled

2026-01-15T17:45:40.381030 [root_agent]: Thank you. Having pre-settled status *generally* means you are eligible for Child Benefit, but eligibility can depend on your residency situation.

Based on the information you've provided:

*   You have a son who is 7 years old.
*   You are currently not working but actively looking for a job.
*   You are raising your son alone.
*   He lives with you full-time.
*   You have pre-settled status.

**It appears you are likely eligible for Child Benefit.** However, pre-settled status has specific requirements regarding continued residency, so it’s important to ensure you meet those conditions.

Would you like me to summarise the key things to be aware of regarding pre-settled status and Child Benefit, or would you prefer a link to the official guidance? (I can’t *provide* the link directly, but I can describe where to find it on gov.uk).

2026-01-15T17:45:41.152418 [actor]: jobseeker 95 days

2026-01-15T17:45:43.368471 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you've been a jobseeker for 95 days. This doesn't directly affect your eligibility for Child Benefit, but it's good to be aware of as it could influence other benefits you might be entitled to.

Just to be absolutely certain, and to cover all bases, could you confirm your National Insurance number? (You don’t need to share the full number with me, just confirmation you *have* one). This is a standard check for claiming benefits.

2026-01-15T17:45:44.202662 [actor]: yes have it but been jobseeker too long yes?

2026-01-15T17:45:48.046398 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming you have a National Insurance number.

Regarding your concern about being a jobseeker for too long, that relates to Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA) or Universal Credit, *not* Child Benefit. Your length of time as a jobseeker does **not** affect your eligibility for Child Benefit.

So, to reiterate, based on everything you’ve told me:

*   You have a 7-year-old son.
*   You are the sole carer.
*   He lives with you full-time.
*   You have pre-settled status.
*   You have a National Insurance number.
*   You are currently seeking employment.

**You are very likely eligible for Child Benefit.**

Would you like me to explain where on the gov.uk website you can find the official information and start a claim? I can tell you the keywords to search for.

2026-01-15T17:45:49.187770 [actor]: pre settled and jobseeker does it stop after 91 days?

2026-01-15T17:45:54.287995 [root_agent]: You're right to double-check about the 91-day point – that's a very important detail relating to your immigration status and benefit eligibility.

My apologies, I should have flagged this earlier. While pre-settled status *generally* allows you to claim Child Benefit, there is a condition relating to continuous residence.

**If you have pre-settled status and have been claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance (or Universal Credit with a limited jobseeker component) for more than 91 days, your Child Benefit claim may be affected.** Specifically, it could be suspended until you either:

*   Secure employment, or
*   Have a good reason for not working (e.g., illness), or
*   Have been in the UK for 5 years and can switch to settled status.

I should have asked about this earlier – my apologies for the oversight.

Here's what you need to do: You should search on gov.uk for "Child Benefit pre-settled status" to find the detailed guidance on how this rule applies and what your options are. It’s crucial to understand your particular situation, as there are exceptions.



Does that clarify things? I am still under development and learning to ask all the right questions.

2026-01-15T17:45:55.531724 [actor]: so my child benefit will stop?

2026-01-15T17:45:59.342482 [root_agent]: It *could* stop, yes. Based on what you've told me – being a jobseeker with pre-settled status for 95 days – you are now within the period where Child Benefit could be suspended.

However, it hasn’t necessarily stopped *yet*. The most important thing is to inform HMRC (the people who pay benefits) about your jobseeking status and the length of time you’ve been looking for work. They will then review your claim based on the specific rules.

To be clear:

*   **If you do nothing, your Child Benefit *may* be stopped.**
*   **You need to contact HMRC to explain your situation.**

Would you like me to explain how to contact HMRC and what information you should have ready? Or would you prefer I guide you to the relevant page on gov.uk (again, I can't provide a direct link, but I can tell you what to search for)?

2026-01-15T17:46:03.083278 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately informed me that as a pre-settled status individual who has been a jobseeker for over 91 days (95 days), my Child Benefit could be suspended, which aligns with UK government rules for pre-settled status benefit claimants.
