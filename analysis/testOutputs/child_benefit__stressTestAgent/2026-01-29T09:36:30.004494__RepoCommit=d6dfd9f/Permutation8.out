2026-01-29T09:40:53.312424 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T09:40:54.890847 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter who's 4 years old.

2026-01-29T09:40:57.044390 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next, I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for your daughter? This means do you live with her and are you the person who looks after her day-to-day (for example, providing food, clothing, and a place to live)?**

2026-01-29T09:40:58.672602 [actor]: Yes, I am. She lives with me and my partner, and we look after her.

2026-01-29T09:41:00.537882 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Now I need to ask:

**Do you or your partner currently live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T09:41:01.964573 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK.

2026-01-29T09:41:03.907927 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question:

**Does anyone else already claim Child Benefit for your daughter? For example, does your partner or anyone else receive Child Benefit payments for her?**

2026-01-29T09:41:05.361207 [actor]: No, nobody is currently claiming Child Benefit for her.

2026-01-29T09:41:08.564472 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

✓ You have a child under 16 years old
✓ You are responsible for her (she lives with you and you look after her)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ Nobody else is currently claiming Child Benefit for her

However, there's one important thing to be aware of:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

This won't affect your eligibility to claim, but it may affect whether you need to pay some or all of the Child Benefit back through a tax charge called the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-29T09:41:10.102922 [actor]: Yes, I earn £75,000 per year, and my partner earns £20,000.

2026-01-29T09:41:15.865055 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on everything you've told me, here's your situation:

**You are eligible to claim Child Benefit.** However, because you earn £75,000 per year (which is over £50,000), you would be subject to the **High Income Child Benefit Charge**.

This means:
- You can still claim and receive Child Benefit payments
- However, you would need to pay back some of the Child Benefit through your Self Assessment tax return
- At £75,000 income, you would pay back 100% of the Child Benefit received (the charge is 1% for every £100 earned over £50,000, up to £60,000 where it reaches 100%)

**You have two options:**

1. **Claim Child Benefit and pay it back** through the tax charge - this still has benefits as your National Insurance credits are protected (important for State Pension)

2. **Claim Child Benefit but opt not to receive the payments** - you'd still get the National Insurance credits without receiving money you'd have to pay back

Does this make sense, or do you have any questions about your eligibility or these options?

2026-01-29T09:41:19.316618 [actor]: That makes sense, thank you for explaining it all clearly. I appreciate you letting me know about the options.

2026-01-29T09:41:22.125463 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately established that the user is eligible for Child Benefit and correctly identified that they would be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge due to their £75,000 income, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)."
