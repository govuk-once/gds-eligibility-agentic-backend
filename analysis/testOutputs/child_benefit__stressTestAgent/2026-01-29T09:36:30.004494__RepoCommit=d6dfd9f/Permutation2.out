2026-01-29T09:37:09.509362 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T09:37:11.286728 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter who's 17, and she's studying full-time for her A-levels at a sixth-form college here in London.

2026-01-29T09:37:12.995562 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know your daughter is 17 and studying full-time for her A-levels.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Does your daughter normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T09:37:14.931417 [actor]: Yes, she lives with me. It's just the two of us at home.

2026-01-29T09:37:17.537303 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now I need to ask:

**Are you currently responsible for your daughter? By this I mean, do you provide for her care and support, such as paying for her food, clothing, and other needs?**

2026-01-29T09:37:19.473823 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm her father and I'm responsible for everything - her food, clothing, all her needs. I'm a single parent, so it's just me taking care of her.

2026-01-29T09:37:21.742048 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Now I need to ask about your residence status:

**Do you live in the UK, and are you either a UK citizen, or do you have the right to live in the UK (for example, through settled status, pre-settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits)?**

2026-01-29T09:37:24.036223 [actor]: Yes, I live in London and I'm a UK resident. I have the right to live here and claim benefits.

2026-01-29T09:37:26.046523 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

I have one more important question:

**Is anyone else also claiming Child Benefit for your daughter? For example, does her mother or anyone else receive Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-29T09:37:27.956528 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for her. It's just me - I'm a single father and she lives with me, so no one else would be claiming for her.

2026-01-29T09:37:33.795680 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:

✓ You have a daughter who is 17 and in full-time approved education (A-levels at sixth-form college), which meets the requirement for children under 20 in approved education or training

✓ She normally lives with you

✓ You are responsible for her - providing for her care, food, clothing and other needs

✓ You live in the UK and have the right to claim benefits

✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for your daughter. 

**Please note:** If your individual income is over £60,000 a year (or your partner's income if you have one), you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means you'd have to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through your tax return. However, you can still claim it, or you can choose to opt out of receiving the payments but still register for Child Benefit to protect your daughter's National Insurance record.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T09:37:36.298471 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you. I earn £40,000, so I don't think I need to worry about that high income charge. I appreciate you walking me through all of this - it's good to know I'm eligible!

2026-01-29T09:37:39.918270 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria: the child is under 20 and in approved education (A-levels), lives with the claimant, the claimant is responsible for the child's care, the claimant is a UK resident with the right to claim benefits, and no one else is claiming for the child.
