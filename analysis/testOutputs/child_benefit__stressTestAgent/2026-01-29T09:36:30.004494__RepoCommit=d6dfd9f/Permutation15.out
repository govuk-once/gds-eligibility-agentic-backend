2026-01-29T09:44:48.531331 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T09:44:50.104389 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Emma. She's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T09:44:51.687856 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Do you live with Emma, or does she live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T09:44:53.497640 [actor]: She lives with someone else - she lives with her mother. I live separately from them.

2026-01-29T09:44:55.817020 [root_agent]: I understand. Since Emma lives with her mother rather than with you, this is an important factor for Child Benefit eligibility.

**Do you contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate towards Emma's upkeep, or contribute to the cost of providing for her?**

2026-01-29T09:44:57.509362 [actor]: I send £10 a week to her mother for food, and I also send Emma a birthday present once a year.

2026-01-29T09:44:59.453928 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me ask another question to better understand your situation.

**Does Emma ever stay with you, and if so, how often does she stay overnight at your home?**

2026-01-29T09:45:01.232281 [actor]: No, she doesn't stay with me. She lives full-time with her mother.

2026-01-29T09:45:03.093085 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Let me ask one more question:

**Does Emma's mother currently claim Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-29T09:45:04.497255 [actor]: No, her mother doesn't claim Child Benefit.

2026-01-29T09:45:09.143072 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, I need to assess your eligibility carefully.

From the information you've provided:
- Emma lives full-time with her mother
- You contribute £10 per week towards her food and send a birthday present annually
- Emma doesn't stay overnight with you
- Her mother doesn't currently claim Child Benefit

**Based on the current Child Benefit rates (which are over £20 per week for one child), your contribution of £10 per week appears to be less than the Child Benefit rate.**

This means you would likely **not be eligible** for Child Benefit, as the rules state that if a child lives with someone else, you can only claim if you contribute at least as much as the Child Benefit rate toward the child's upkeep.

However, Emma's mother would likely be eligible to claim Child Benefit since Emma lives with her full-time. Has her mother considered applying for Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T09:45:13.506509 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but I understand. No, I'm not sure why she hasn't claimed it - that's between her and the benefits office I suppose. Thank you for explaining this to me.

2026-01-29T09:45:15.608098 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my contribution of £10 per week is less than the Child Benefit rate (over £20 per week for one child), and the child lives full-time with her mother, not with me.
