2026-01-29T09:47:56.340205 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T09:47:58.541583 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a 10-year-old son who lives with me. My ex-wife and I recently divorced, and our children live separately now - my son Sam lives with me and my daughter Ella lives with her mum.

2026-01-29T09:48:00.870796 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a 10-year-old son named Sam who lives with you.

**Are you responsible for Sam? By this I mean, do you provide for his day-to-day care and meet the costs of looking after him (such as food, clothing, and other living expenses)?**

2026-01-29T09:48:02.864610 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Sam lives with me full-time and I'm responsible for all his day-to-day care - I provide his food, clothing, pay for his school things, and cover all his living expenses. I look after him completely.

2026-01-29T09:48:04.859622 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful information.

**Do you normally live in the UK? And is Sam also normally living in the UK with you?**

2026-01-29T09:48:06.473111 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK. Sam and I are here full-time, this is our home.

2026-01-29T09:48:08.197082 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Sam? For example, is your ex-wife claiming Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-29T09:48:10.545327 [actor]: No, she's not claiming for Sam. She's claiming for our daughter Ella who lives with her. We each claim for the child that lives with us.

2026-01-29T09:48:13.042385 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's clear.

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control - meaning do you have any restrictions on your right to remain in the UK or access to public funds?**

2026-01-29T09:48:14.486481 [actor]: No, I'm not subject to immigration control. I have no restrictions on my right to remain in the UK or access to public funds.

2026-01-29T09:48:17.851431 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for your son Sam**. 

Here's why:
- You have a child under 16 (Sam is 10 years old)
- You are responsible for him - you provide his day-to-day care and meet the costs of looking after him
- You both normally live in the UK
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Sam
- You're not subject to immigration control

You meet the main eligibility criteria for Child Benefit. You should be able to make a claim for Sam.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-29T09:48:19.902383 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your help!
