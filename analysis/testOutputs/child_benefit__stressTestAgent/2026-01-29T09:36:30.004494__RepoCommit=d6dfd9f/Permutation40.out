2026-01-29T10:00:13.196516 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T10:00:14.718129 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T10:00:16.527390 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Does your son normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards his upkeep?**

2026-01-29T10:00:18.359113 [actor]: Well, he normally does live with me, but he's currently in a secure psychiatric unit. He was detained under the Mental Health Act about 10 weeks ago. Does that affect things?

2026-01-29T10:00:20.229819 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. That's an important detail.

Let me ask you this:

**Before your son was detained in the secure psychiatric unit, was he normally living with you?**

2026-01-29T10:00:21.770473 [actor]: Yes, he was living with me before he was detained.

2026-01-29T10:00:23.255719 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

**Do you expect your son to return to live with you after he leaves the secure psychiatric unit?**

2026-01-29T10:00:25.467811 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I expect him to come back home once his treatment is finished.

2026-01-29T10:00:28.135732 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question:

**Has your son been in the secure psychiatric unit for more than 12 weeks continuously, or will he have been there for more than 12 weeks?**

(You mentioned he's been there for about 10 weeks, so I want to clarify the timeframe.)

2026-01-29T10:00:29.888940 [actor]: No, he's been there for 10 weeks, so not more than 12 weeks yet.

2026-01-29T10:00:32.645836 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying all of that information.

Now I need to ask you a couple more questions about your personal circumstances:

**Are you responsible for your son (meaning you're his parent or you're looking after him), and do you normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T10:00:34.738976 [actor]: Yes, I'm his parent and I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T10:00:36.696159 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One final question to complete the assessment:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your son?**

2026-01-29T10:00:38.152374 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-29T10:00:42.013896 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your son.

Here's why:

✓ Your son is under 16 years old
✓ He normally lives with you
✓ You are his parent and live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him
✓ Although he's currently in a secure psychiatric unit under the Mental Health Act, he's been there for less than 12 weeks, and you expect him to return home

**Important:** You can continue to receive Child Benefit while your son is in the secure psychiatric unit for up to 12 weeks. If his stay extends beyond 12 weeks, you should contact the Child Benefit Office to discuss your situation, as the rules may change at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-29T10:00:47.806802 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the claimant is eligible for Child Benefit while their son has been in the secure psychiatric unit for 10 weeks (under the 12-week threshold), and correctly advised that eligibility may change if the stay exceeds 12 weeks.
