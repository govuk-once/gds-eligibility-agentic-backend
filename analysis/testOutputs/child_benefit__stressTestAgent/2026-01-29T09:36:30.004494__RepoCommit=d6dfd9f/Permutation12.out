2026-01-29T09:42:52.362648 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a few questions to assess your eligibility.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T09:42:54.127624 [actor]: Yes, I am. My son Liam is 18 and he's studying for his A-levels right now.

2026-01-29T09:42:56.245141 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your son being 18 and studying for his A-levels is relevant - Child Benefit can continue for young people under 20 if they're in approved education or training.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T09:42:57.789294 [actor]: Yes, I do. I live here in the UK with my son.

2026-01-29T09:42:59.905548 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

Next question: **Are you the only person responsible for Liam, or does someone else also look after him (for example, a partner or ex-partner)?**

2026-01-29T09:43:01.828091 [actor]: I'm the only one responsible for him. His father and I are no longer together, and Liam is estranged from his father. It's just me looking after him.

2026-01-29T09:43:03.888324 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Next question: **Are you or your son currently receiving any benefits or support from another country (outside the UK), or are either of you subject to immigration control?**

2026-01-29T09:43:05.552774 [actor]: No, nothing like that. We're both UK residents and we're not receiving any benefits from another country or subject to immigration control.

2026-01-29T09:43:08.255742 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: **Do you (or your partner if you have one) have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

This is important because if either you or a partner has income over this threshold, it affects how Child Benefit works - you can still claim it, but may need to pay some or all of it back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-29T09:43:09.964898 [actor]: No, I don't have a partner and my income is well below £50,000.

2026-01-29T09:43:15.080112 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your son Liam. Here's why:

✓ You're responsible for a child (Liam, age 18)
✓ He's under 20 and in approved education (studying for A-levels)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You're the person responsible for him
✓ Neither of you are subject to immigration control or receiving benefits from another country
✓ Your income is below £50,000, so you won't be affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge

**Important to note:** Child Benefit for young people aged 16-19 in approved education or training continues until they turn 20, or until 31 August following their 16th birthday if they leave education or training before then.

Since Liam is studying for his A-levels (which is approved education), you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him until he either turns 20 or stops being in approved education or training.

Would you like any further clarification about your eligibility or the claiming process?

2026-01-29T09:43:16.910794 [actor]: Actually, there's something I should mention - Liam is claiming Universal Credit in his own right to help with his personal living costs. Does that affect anything?

2026-01-29T09:43:20.124066 [root_agent]: That's an important detail to mention, thank you. Let me think about this carefully.

To clarify: **Is Liam living with you in your household, or is he living independently elsewhere?**

This is important because if a young person is claiming Universal Credit in their own right, it can sometimes indicate they're living independently rather than being supported by a parent or guardian, which could affect Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-29T09:43:22.169665 [actor]: Yes, he's living with me in my household. We live together. He's just claiming the Universal Credit to help with his own personal costs while he's studying.

2026-01-29T09:43:24.830571 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is an important situation that needs careful consideration.

Let me ask you this: **Does Liam's Universal Credit claim include any amount for housing costs or accommodation, or is it just for his basic personal living expenses?**

This distinction is important because it helps determine whether Liam is being treated as living independently for benefits purposes, which could affect your Child Benefit eligibility - even though he physically lives with you.

2026-01-29T09:43:26.420341 [actor]: No, it doesn't include anything for housing costs. It's just for his basic personal living expenses while he's studying.

2026-01-29T09:43:31.089374 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. This is a complex situation that requires careful consideration.

The key issue here is that when a young person claims Universal Credit in their own right, they are generally considered to be responsible for themselves rather than being a dependant of their parent - even if they're living in the family home.

**Important question:** When Liam applied for Universal Credit, **was he treated as a separate household or claimant unit from you, even though you live at the same address?**

This matters because if he's claiming as an independent adult (which Universal Credit in his own name would typically indicate), this could mean he's not considered a child or qualifying young person for Child Benefit purposes, as he would be financially responsible for himself.

I want to make sure I understand the full picture before giving you a final assessment on your eligibility.

2026-01-29T09:43:33.292674 [actor]: Yes, he was treated as a separate claimant. He has his own Universal Credit claim, separate from me. Like I said, he needed it for his personal living costs while studying for his A-levels.

2026-01-29T09:43:38.331618 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that detail. This is a crucial piece of information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to reconsider your eligibility situation:

**You may NOT be eligible for Child Benefit for Liam in this situation.** Here's why:

When a young person claims Universal Credit in their own right as a separate claimant (even while living with a parent), they are generally treated as financially independent and responsible for themselves. This means they would typically not be considered a "qualifying young person" for Child Benefit purposes, even though they're under 20 and in approved education.

The principle is that a young person cannot be treated as both:
- A dependant child/qualifying young person (for Child Benefit purposes), AND
- An independent adult responsible for their own maintenance (through their own Universal Credit claim)

at the same time.

**However**, this is a complex area of benefits law, and I would strongly recommend that you:
1. Contact the Child Benefit Office directly to discuss your specific circumstances
2. Explain that Liam is claiming Universal Credit in his own right while living with you and studying

They will be able to give you a definitive answer based on the specific details of both claims.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-29T09:43:43.966892 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly identified that a young person claiming Universal Credit in their own right as a separate claimant cannot simultaneously be treated as a qualifying young person for Child Benefit purposes, even while living with the parent and studying, and correctly concluded the user is not eligible.
