2026-01-29T10:06:58.268242 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T10:06:59.985404 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who's 17 years old. He's doing a computer coding course at the moment.

2026-01-29T10:07:02.454810 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful.

To determine if your son's course counts as approved education or training, I need to ask: Is his computer coding course full-time (more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience)?

2026-01-29T10:07:04.535631 [actor]: Yes, it's full-time. But I should mention - he's not being paid for it. His future employer is actually paying for the course fees as part of an agreement that he'll join them after he finishes the course.

2026-01-29T10:07:07.043398 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like your son is in full-time approved education or training, which is good.

Now I need to ask about your living arrangements with your son: Does your son live with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T10:07:08.605603 [actor]: He lives with me.

2026-01-29T10:07:10.529487 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now I need to understand your responsibility for him.

Are you responsible for your son? By this I mean, do you have the main day-to-day responsibility for looking after him and meeting his care needs?

2026-01-29T10:07:12.448819 [actor]: Yes, I am. I'm responsible for him and take care of him on a day-to-day basis.

2026-01-29T10:07:14.551495 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Now I need to ask about your residency status.

Do you live in the UK? And if so, are you a UK citizen, or do you have settled status, pre-settled status, or another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits?

2026-01-29T10:07:16.270024 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK and I'm a UK citizen.

2026-01-29T10:07:18.787770 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me also ask: Is there anyone else who might also be claiming Child Benefit for your son, or who might have an equal claim to it (such as another parent or guardian)?

2026-01-29T10:07:20.353623 [actor]: No, there's no one else claiming Child Benefit for him. It's just me.

2026-01-29T10:07:24.068895 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. Your son is 17 years old and in full-time approved education or training (his computer coding course)
2. He lives with you
3. You are responsible for him on a day-to-day basis
4. You live in the UK and are a UK citizen
5. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

You can claim Child Benefit for a young person up to the age of 20 if they're in approved education or training, which your son's full-time course qualifies as.

However, please be aware that if either you or your partner has an individual income over £60,000 per year, you may need to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge when you complete your tax return.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T10:07:25.716970 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T10:07:29.456265 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated the user is eligible for Child Benefit, but according to the scenario the expected outcome is "Not Eligible" - the agent failed to identify that the son's course is employer-funded training with a guaranteed job afterward, which may not qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.
