2026-01-29T09:51:34.795950 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T09:51:36.351025 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Leo. He's 5 years old.

2026-01-29T09:51:37.801395 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Leo live with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T09:51:39.567244 [actor]: He doesn't live with me at the moment. He's been in local authority care for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-29T09:51:41.986829 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. I understand Leo is currently in local authority care.

Are you still contributing to the cost of looking after Leo? For example, are you paying at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate or the local authority towards his care?

2026-01-29T09:51:44.055160 [actor]: Well, I don't have any income myself, so I can't contribute anything. But my husband - he's Leo's stepfather - he sends £30 a week to Leo's carer to help with his upkeep. We live together.

2026-01-29T09:51:46.455418 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask a clarifying question:

Is your husband (Leo's stepfather) responsible for Leo? By this I mean, was he living with you and Leo and acting as Leo's parent before Leo went into care?

2026-01-29T09:51:48.566741 [actor]: Yes, that's right. My husband was living with us before Leo went into care, and he was acting as Leo's parent. We're still living together now.

2026-01-29T09:51:50.709104 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

One more question: Do you know if the local authority is contributing to the cost of looking after Leo while he's in their care?

2026-01-29T09:51:52.311694 [actor]: Yes, the local authority is contributing to his care costs since he's in their care.

2026-01-29T09:51:57.633598 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**You may be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation. Here's why:

Even though Leo is in local authority care, you can still claim Child Benefit if you (or your husband) are contributing at least as much as the Child Benefit rate towards Leo's upkeep. 

Your husband is contributing £30 per week to Leo's carer. The current Child Benefit rate for the eldest or only child is less than £30 per week, which means your household is meeting the contribution threshold.

Since your husband was acting as Leo's parent before he went into care and you live together as a household, either you or your husband could potentially claim Child Benefit for Leo.

**I recommend that you apply for Child Benefit.** You should explain in your application that:
- Leo is in local authority care
- Your husband contributes £30 per week towards Leo's upkeep
- Your husband was responsible for Leo before he went into care

The decision will ultimately be made by HMRC when you apply, but based on the eligibility criteria, you appear to meet the requirements.

2026-01-29T09:52:03.719507 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the claimant may be eligible for Child Benefit because their husband contributes £30 per week (which exceeds the Child Benefit rate) towards Leo's upkeep while he is in local authority care, and the husband was responsible for Leo before he went into care.
