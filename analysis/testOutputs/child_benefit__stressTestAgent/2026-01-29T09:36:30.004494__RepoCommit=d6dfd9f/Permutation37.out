2026-01-29T09:58:20.748952 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T09:58:23.245570 [actor]: Yes, I am. I'm currently caring for my best friend's daughter, Nina. She's 10 years old and has come to live with me because her mother is ill. It's a private arrangement between us, but the local council does know about the situation.

2026-01-29T09:58:25.754728 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. I understand you're caring for your friend's daughter Nina in a private arrangement.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Does Nina live with you for the majority of the time, and are you providing for her day-to-day needs (such as food, clothing, and shelter)?**

2026-01-29T09:58:28.231642 [actor]: Yes, Nina lives with me full-time now - it's for the foreseeable future while her mother recovers. I'm providing everything for her - all her meals, clothing, a place to stay, and taking care of all her day-to-day needs. I'm covering all the costs myself for looking after her.

2026-01-29T09:58:30.116942 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like you're providing full-time care for Nina.

Next question: **Is Nina's mother still claiming Child Benefit for her, or has she stopped claiming it?**

2026-01-29T09:58:32.570909 [actor]: I'm not entirely sure about that. Nina's mum has been quite ill, so I haven't really discussed the Child Benefit situation with her yet. Should I check with her about whether she's still claiming it?

2026-01-29T09:58:35.142001 [root_agent]: That's actually an important point to clarify. Let me ask you this first: **Are you living in the UK?**

(And yes, it would be helpful to find out about Nina's mother's Child Benefit claim, as this will affect your eligibility - but let me gather a bit more information about your situation first.)

2026-01-29T09:58:37.131588 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I've lived here all my life. Nina's mother lives here too - that's how we became such close friends over the years.

2026-01-29T09:58:40.114033 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now, going back to the Child Benefit claim - since you're unsure whether Nina's mother is still claiming Child Benefit for her, let me ask: **Would you be willing to find out from Nina's mother whether she is currently claiming Child Benefit for Nina, or would you like me to explain how this affects your eligibility first?**

This is important because only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child at any given time.

2026-01-29T09:58:42.248837 [actor]: Could you explain how it affects my eligibility first? That would help me understand the situation better before I speak to her about it. I want to make sure I know what I'm talking about when I bring it up with her.

2026-01-29T09:58:47.691269 [root_agent]: Of course, let me explain how this works.

**Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child at any one time.** So if Nina's mother is still claiming Child Benefit for her, you wouldn't be able to claim it as well - even though Nina is living with you full-time.

However, if Nina's mother is **not** claiming Child Benefit (or stops claiming it), then you could potentially claim it yourself, as long as you meet the eligibility criteria - which it sounds like you do, since you're responsible for Nina and she lives with you.

The key thing to understand is: **the person who claims Child Benefit should be the person who the child is living with and who is responsible for them.** Since Nina is living with you full-time and you're providing all her care, it would make sense for you to be the claimant - but Nina's mother would need to stop her claim first (if she has one).

Now, my next question: **Once you've had a chance to check with Nina's mother about her Child Benefit claim, would you also be able to confirm whether there's any formal arrangement in place - such as a child arrangement order from the courts, or is this purely an informal private arrangement between you and her mother?**

2026-01-29T09:58:50.534260 [actor]: This is purely an informal private arrangement between me and Nina's mum. There's no court order or anything formal like that - it's just something we agreed between ourselves because of her illness. The local council knows Nina is living with me, but they're not paying me anything - no fostering allowance or anything like that. I'm just doing this to help my friend and to look after Nina.

2026-01-29T09:58:54.694659 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's helpful to know this is a private arrangement and you're not receiving any fostering payments from the local council.

Based on what you've told me, it does sound like you could potentially be eligible for Child Benefit for Nina, **provided that Nina's mother is not currently claiming it** (or stops claiming it).

The key points are:
- Nina lives with you full-time
- You're responsible for her and meeting all her day-to-day needs
- You're not being paid by the local authority to look after her
- This is a private arrangement

So my next question is: **Do you have any income? Specifically, do you (or a partner if you have one) have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

This is important because it affects whether you'd need to pay a tax charge on the Child Benefit.

2026-01-29T09:58:56.664439 [actor]: Yes, I do work. My income is around £35,000 a year, and I don't have a partner - it's just me. So I'm under that £50,000 threshold you mentioned.

2026-01-29T09:59:00.612580 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on everything you've told me, **you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina**, as long as Nina's mother is not currently claiming it (or stops her claim first).

To summarize your situation:
- Nina (age 10) lives with you full-time in the UK
- You're responsible for her and providing all her care and support
- This is a private arrangement (not local authority fostering)
- Your income is £35,000, which is below the £50,000 threshold, so you wouldn't face any tax charge
- You live in the UK

**The only remaining step is to confirm with Nina's mother whether she is currently claiming Child Benefit.** If she is, she would need to stop her claim before you could start yours. Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child at any given time.

Once you've confirmed that Nina's mother isn't claiming (or has stopped claiming), you would be able to apply for Child Benefit yourself.

Do you have any other questions about your eligibility or the next steps?

2026-01-29T09:59:03.724576 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you. I understand now - I need to speak with Nina's mum to find out if she's still claiming, and if she is, she'll need to stop before I can apply. But otherwise, I'm eligible to claim. That's a relief to know, as the extra support would definitely help with all of Nina's expenses. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.

2026-01-29T09:59:08.092705 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I would be eligible for Child Benefit for Nina, correctly identified all the relevant eligibility criteria (child under 16 living with me in the UK, providing day-to-day care, private arrangement, income below £50,000), and properly explained that only one person can claim at a time so I would need to confirm Nina's mother isn't claiming or has stopped claiming before I can apply.
