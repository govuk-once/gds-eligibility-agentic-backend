2026-01-29T09:50:17.285078 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, are you responsible for a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T09:50:18.797530 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have a daughter, Sarah, she's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T09:50:20.321683 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Do you live in the UK?

2026-01-29T09:50:21.639035 [actor]: Yes, I do live in the UK.

2026-01-29T09:50:23.752430 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Now, does Sarah normally live with you? In other words, are you the person responsible for her on a day-to-day basis?

2026-01-29T09:50:25.181123 [actor]: No, she doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother.

2026-01-29T09:50:27.869251 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

In that case, let me ask: Do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards Sarah's upkeep? (This would currently be at least £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, or £16.95 per week for additional children.)

2026-01-29T09:50:29.666761 [actor]: Well, I don't pay weekly, but every 4 weeks I buy a large bulk order of groceries and clothes for Sarah that costs £120 and I deliver them to her mother.

2026-01-29T09:50:31.793261 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail.

Let me ask a follow-up question: Is Sarah's mother claiming Child Benefit for Sarah, or is anyone else currently claiming it for her?

2026-01-29T09:50:33.557784 [actor]: I'm not sure if her mother is claiming it or not. Does that affect whether I can claim it?

2026-01-29T09:50:37.138574 [root_agent]: Yes, it does affect your eligibility. Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child at any given time.

Let me explain: If Sarah's mother (or anyone else) is already claiming Child Benefit for Sarah, then you cannot also claim it. However, if no one is currently claiming it, you may be eligible to claim if you meet certain conditions.

Since Sarah doesn't live with you, the key factor is whether you contribute at least the equivalent amount of Child Benefit towards her costs. Based on what you've told me - that you spend £120 every 4 weeks on groceries and clothes - this works out to £30 per week, which is more than the current Child Benefit rate.

My next question is: Would you be able to find out whether Sarah's mother (or anyone else) is currently claiming Child Benefit for Sarah?

2026-01-29T09:50:39.150740 [actor]: I can ask her mother about that. So if she's not claiming it, then I would be eligible based on the contributions I'm making?

2026-01-29T09:50:43.690001 [root_agent]: Let me think carefully about this before confirming.

Based on the rules, if Sarah doesn't live with you but you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay (which you do - £30 per week is above the threshold), you may be able to claim Child Benefit, but only if no one else is claiming it for her.

However, there's an important point: even in situations where the child doesn't live with you, the person who the child normally lives with usually has the priority claim. So if Sarah's mother wanted to claim Child Benefit herself, she would likely have the stronger claim since Sarah lives with her.

Before I can give you a definitive answer on your eligibility, I need to ask: Are there any other circumstances that might apply - for example, is Sarah in hospital long-term, in local authority care, or living with someone else under a formal arrangement?

2026-01-29T09:50:46.067041 [actor]: No, none of those circumstances apply. She just lives with her mother in a normal arrangement. We separated, and Sarah stayed with her mum. I just want to make sure I'm doing right by Sarah financially, so I bring her groceries and clothes regularly.

2026-01-29T09:50:51.956116 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining the full situation. That's very clear.

Based on what you've told me, here's the position on your eligibility:

**You would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sarah in this situation.**

Here's why: Sarah lives with her mother in a normal arrangement, and her mother is the person responsible for her day-to-day care. This means her mother would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit, regardless of whether she's currently claiming it or not.

The contributions you're making (£120 every 4 weeks) are commendable and show you're supporting Sarah financially. However, when a child lives with one parent, that parent is the one who can claim Child Benefit - the rules don't allow the non-resident parent to claim it instead, even if they're making financial contributions.

If you want to ensure Sarah is getting the financial support she's entitled to, you could encourage her mother to claim Child Benefit if she isn't already doing so. The money would go to her as the person Sarah lives with.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T09:50:54.399067 [actor]: No, that makes sense. Thank you for explaining it clearly. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T09:50:59.733352 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to the government guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, a person who does not live with the child may still be eligible for Child Benefit if they contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards the child's upkeep. The user contributes £120 every 4 weeks (£30/week), which exceeds the Child Benefit rate of £25.60/week. The agent incorrectly stated the user "would not be eligible" when in fact they could be eligible to claim if the mother is not currently claiming it, as only one person can claim at a time but the non-resident parent who contributes sufficiently can make that claim.
