2026-01-29T09:52:05.938031 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T09:52:07.421853 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Zahid - he's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T09:52:09.215738 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Does Zahid normally live with you, or does he live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T09:52:10.797712 [actor]: He lives with his aunt actually. She's been looking after him.

2026-01-29T09:52:13.764030 [root_agent]: I see. Thank you for sharing that.

**Do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards Zahid's upkeep?** 

(For context, Child Benefit is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, and £16.95 per week for each additional child.)

2026-01-29T09:52:15.782120 [actor]: Well, I send £15 a week to the aunt for Zahid. And his grandmother - that's my mother - she also sends £15 a week to the aunt for him. So together that's £30 a week.

2026-01-29T09:52:17.496460 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Are you and your mother living together in the same household?**

2026-01-29T09:52:19.047075 [actor]: No, we don't live together. We live separately.

2026-01-29T09:52:23.914192 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to explain how Child Benefit works when a child lives with someone else:

**Only one person can claim Child Benefit for Zahid.** Since he lives with his aunt, she would typically be the person eligible to claim, as she's the one actually caring for him day-to-day.

However, there is a situation where you could potentially claim instead: if you contribute **at least as much as Child Benefit would pay** (which is £25.60 per week for one child) towards Zahid's upkeep, you may be able to claim.

You mentioned you send £15 per week. Even though your mother also sends £15 (totaling £30), because you live in separate households, your individual contribution of £15 per week is less than the Child Benefit rate of £25.60 per week.

**One more question to fully assess your situation: Is anyone currently claiming Child Benefit for Zahid - such as his aunt?**

2026-01-29T09:52:25.459178 [actor]: No, the aunt doesn't claim Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-29T09:52:29.902365 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've told me, here's my assessment of your eligibility:

**Unfortunately, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid in this situation.**

Here's why:

1. **Zahid lives with his aunt**, not with you - so normally she would be the person eligible to claim as his primary caregiver.

2. **Your individual contribution (£15 per week) is less than the Child Benefit rate** of £25.60 per week. To claim Child Benefit when a child lives elsewhere, you must contribute at least as much as Child Benefit would pay towards their upkeep.

3. Even though you and your mother together contribute £30 per week, the rules look at individual contributions from separate households, not combined amounts.

**However, Zahid's aunt would likely be eligible** to claim Child Benefit since she's the one looking after him on a day-to-day basis.

If you wanted to become eligible yourself, you would need to either:
- Have Zahid live with you, OR
- Increase your individual contribution to at least £25.60 per week

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T09:52:35.882463 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to the scenario, the expected outcome is "Eligible" but the agent concluded "you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid." The agent failed to recognize that the combined contributions from the parent (£15) and grandmother (£15) totaling £30 per week exceed the Child Benefit threshold of £25.60, and under the rules at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, a parent can claim if they contribute at least the Child Benefit amount even when living separately from other contributors.
