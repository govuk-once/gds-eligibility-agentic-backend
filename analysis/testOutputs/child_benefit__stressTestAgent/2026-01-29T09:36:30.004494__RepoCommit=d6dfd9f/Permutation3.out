2026-01-29T09:37:42.622422 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T09:37:44.717486 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who's 17. He finished school in June and he's registered with the local youth careers service. He's been actively looking for an apprenticeship since then.

2026-01-29T09:37:47.739883 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know that your 17-year-old son is registered with the local youth careers service and looking for an apprenticeship.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is your son currently enrolled in approved education or training?** 

(For example, is he attending college, doing A-levels, taking vocational courses, or already started an apprenticeship? Or is he only registered with the careers service but not yet in any formal education or training program?)

2026-01-29T09:37:49.812642 [actor]: No, he's not in any education or training at the moment. He just left school in June and hasn't started anything yet. He's only registered with the careers service and looking for opportunities. It's only been a couple of months since he left school - we're in August now.

2026-01-29T09:37:51.713212 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is an important detail.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Do you live in the UK, or are you treated as living in the UK for tax purposes?**

2026-01-29T09:37:53.215827 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T09:37:55.474962 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask:

**Does your son normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent rate in your country) towards his costs?**

2026-01-29T09:37:57.200908 [actor]: Yes, he lives with me. We live together.

2026-01-29T09:38:01.544960 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to give you some important information about your eligibility:

**You may be eligible for Child Benefit, but there's a time limit that applies to your situation.**

Since your son is 17 and has left approved education or training, Child Benefit can continue for a limited period. Specifically:

- Child Benefit can continue for up to **20 weeks** after a young person leaves approved education or training (as long as they're under 20).
- Your son left school in June, so you would need to count from when he finished his approved education.

This gives young people time to find work, training, or further education opportunities.

Let me ask one final question to complete the assessment:

**Are you already claiming Child Benefit for your son, or would this be a new claim?**

2026-01-29T09:38:03.493978 [actor]: I'm already claiming it. I've been claiming since he was born, so I just wanted to make sure I'm still eligible now that he's left school.

2026-01-29T09:38:09.439410 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on all the information you've provided, here's your situation:

**You can continue to claim Child Benefit for your son, but only until the 20-week period ends after he left approved education.**

Since your son left school in June and it's now August, you're currently within that 20-week extension period. However, you should be aware that:

- Child Benefit will stop at the end of the 20 weeks from when he left school (which would be sometime around late October/early November, depending on his exact finish date)
- **Unless** he starts approved education or training before the 20 weeks end

If your son enrolls in:
- Further education (like college or A-levels)
- An apprenticeship
- Approved training

...then your Child Benefit can continue until he turns 20 (as long as he remains in that approved education or training).

**My recommendation:** Keep track of when the 20-week period ends, and if your son starts an apprenticeship or training before then, make sure to notify the Child Benefit Office so your payments can continue.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T09:38:11.887063 [actor]: No, that's very helpful. Thank you for explaining everything clearly. I understand now that I can keep claiming until the 20 weeks are up, and I'll make sure to let them know if Ben starts an apprenticeship before then.

2026-01-29T09:38:16.035485 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the claimant is eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks after their 17-year-old son left school in June, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)."
