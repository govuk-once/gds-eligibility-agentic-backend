2026-01-29T09:43:45.868771 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T09:43:48.123557 [actor]: Yes, I do. We have a little girl, Maya, she's 4 years old. She's been placed with us by the adoption agency and has moved into our home. The final adoption order hasn't been granted yet though - we're still waiting for that to go through the court.

2026-01-29T09:43:50.512255 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's lovely that Maya is now living with you.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for Maya? This means, are you the person who is primarily looking after her day-to-day needs, such as providing her food, clothing, and general care?

2026-01-29T09:43:53.032475 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. My partner and I are responsible for Maya. She lives with us full-time and we look after all her day-to-day needs - her food, clothing, everything she needs really. We've been caring for her since she moved in with us.

2026-01-29T09:43:55.064211 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's very helpful.

Now I need to ask: Do you normally live in the UK? This means the UK is your permanent home where you usually reside.

2026-01-29T09:43:56.593343 [actor]: Yes, we do. The UK is our permanent home - we live here all the time.

2026-01-29T09:43:58.795092 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: Is there anyone else who is also claiming Child Benefit for Maya, or has anyone else claimed it for her?

2026-01-29T09:44:00.253716 [actor]: No, there's no one else claiming Child Benefit for Maya. It's just us looking after her now that she's been placed with us.

2026-01-29T09:44:04.709832 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Maya. Here's why:

1. **You have a qualifying child** - Maya is 4 years old, which is under 16
2. **You are responsible for her** - You and your partner are providing her day-to-day care, including food, clothing, and meeting all her needs
3. **You normally live in the UK** - This is your permanent home
4. **No one else is claiming for her** - There's no duplicate claim

**Important point about adoption:** You don't need to wait for the final adoption order to be granted. The fact that Maya has been placed with you by the adoption agency and is living in your home means you can claim Child Benefit now, even while the adoption process is still going through the courts.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for Maya. Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, so you and your partner will need to decide which one of you will make the claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T09:44:07.407757 [actor]: No, that's brilliant - thank you so much for clarifying that! I'm really pleased to hear we can claim now and don't have to wait for the final order. That's really helpful information. We'll decide between us who will make the claim and get that sorted. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T09:44:11.664501 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am eligible for Child Benefit for Maya, correctly identifying that a child placed with prospective adopters (even before the final adoption order) qualifies, and properly verified all eligibility criteria including that the child is under 16, I am responsible for her care, I live in the UK, and no one else is claiming for her.
