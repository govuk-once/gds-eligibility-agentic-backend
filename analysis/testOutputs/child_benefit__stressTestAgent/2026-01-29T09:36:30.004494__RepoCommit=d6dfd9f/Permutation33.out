2026-01-29T09:55:59.682713 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T09:56:01.391955 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Bella. She's 16 years old and lives with me.

2026-01-29T09:56:03.769790 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Is Bella in full-time non-advanced education or approved training?**

(This is relevant because 16-year-olds can qualify for Child Benefit if they're in education or training that meets certain criteria.)

2026-01-29T09:56:05.639383 [actor]: Yes, she is. She's started a training course to become a travel agent. It's paid for by a local travel agency that's employed her - they cover the full cost of the training.

2026-01-29T09:56:08.855479 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: **Is this training course approved training, and does Bella work 24 hours a week or less (excluding overtime)?**

(For Child Benefit purposes, approved training must be unpaid or paid at a rate below a certain threshold, and the young person must not work more than 24 hours per week in average paid work.)

2026-01-29T09:56:11.041124 [actor]: She works for the travel agency that's providing the training. I'm not entirely sure about the exact hours, but since they employed her and are paying for the training as part of her employment, I assume she's working regular hours for them.

2026-01-29T09:56:13.454734 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Next question: **How many hours per week does Bella work for the travel agency?**

(This is important because if she's working more than 24 hours a week in average paid work, she may not qualify under the approved training route, even though she's under 20 and in training.)

2026-01-29T09:56:14.849107 [actor]: She works about 30 hours a week for the travel agency.

2026-01-29T09:56:17.684654 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Let me ask one more question to complete my assessment: **Has Bella left full-time non-advanced education, and if so, when did she leave?**

(I need to understand if she was previously in full-time education like school or college, and when that ended, as this affects when Child Benefit eligibility stops.)

2026-01-29T09:56:19.364252 [actor]: She finished school in June when the school year ended. She started this training course with the travel agency in September.

2026-01-29T09:56:25.283090 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me assess your eligibility for Child Benefit based on what you've told me.

**Assessment:**

Based on the information you've provided, **you are likely not eligible for Child Benefit for Bella** at this time. Here's why:

1. **Age and education status**: Bella is 16 and has left full-time non-advanced education (she finished school in June).

2. **Work hours**: Bella is working 30 hours per week for the travel agency, which exceeds the 24-hour weekly limit for approved training.

3. **Approved training requirements**: For a young person aged 16-19 to qualify for Child Benefit through approved training, they must be working 24 hours a week or less (excluding overtime) in average paid work. Since Bella works 30 hours per week, she doesn't meet this criterion.

**When Child Benefit would have stopped:**

Child Benefit typically continues until the 31st August following a child's 16th birthday if they've left education. However, since Bella turned 16 while still in school, your Child Benefit would continue until the end of August (after she finished school in June), and then stop from the beginning of September.

Does this answer your question, or is there anything else you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T09:56:27.582697 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing, but I understand. So because she's working more than 24 hours a week, she doesn't qualify even though she's doing training. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T09:56:31.342865 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter Bella works 30 hours per week, which exceeds the 24-hour weekly limit required for approved training eligibility, and correctly explained that Child Benefit stops at the end of August following the completion of full-time education.
