2026-01-29T09:53:26.042880 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T09:53:27.968472 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Jordan. He's 17 years old.

2026-01-29T09:53:29.613331 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Jordan live with you?

2026-01-29T09:53:31.088555 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me. He lives with his father, Steve.

2026-01-29T09:53:33.980297 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. 

Even though Jordan lives with his father, do you contribute at least the same amount towards his upkeep as someone who is getting Child Benefit for him would receive in Child Benefit payments? (This would be at least £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, or £16.95 per week for additional children.)

2026-01-29T09:53:35.858519 [actor]: No, I don't contribute that amount. Steve is the one who looks after Jordan full-time and covers all his costs.

2026-01-29T09:53:40.440130 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to let you know that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.

This is because:
- Jordan lives with his father (Steve), not with you
- You are not contributing at least the equivalent amount of Child Benefit toward Jordan's upkeep

Child Benefit is generally paid to the person who is responsible for the child and who the child lives with. In this case, that would be Steve, Jordan's father. He would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for Jordan (assuming Jordan meets the other eligibility criteria regarding age and education/training status).

If your circumstances change in the future - for example, if Jordan comes to live with you, or if you start contributing at least the Child Benefit amount toward his costs - your eligibility could change.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T09:53:42.500592 [actor]: Oh, I think there's been a misunderstanding - I'm Steve, Jordan's father. He lives with me. Sorry, I should have been clearer about that from the start!

2026-01-29T09:53:45.364221 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Steve! No problem at all - let me reassess based on this correct information.

So to confirm: you are Steve, Jordan is your 17-year-old son, and he lives with you. That's helpful.

Now, is Jordan currently in full-time non-advanced education or approved training? (For example, is he studying for A-levels, doing a vocational course at college, or in an apprenticeship?)

2026-01-29T09:53:47.134599 [actor]: No, he's not in college or any training. He finished his GCSEs last year and hasn't done anything since then. He's not working either.

2026-01-29T09:53:51.350455 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Steve.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Jordan** in this situation.

Here's why:

- Jordan is 17 years old
- He is not in full-time non-advanced education or approved training
- Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19, but only if they are in approved education or training

Since Jordan finished his GCSEs last year and is not currently in education, training, or an apprenticeship, Child Benefit eligibility would have ended when he turned 16 or left full-time education (whichever was later).

However, if Jordan's circumstances change - for example, if he enrolls in college, sixth form, or an approved training program - you could become eligible for Child Benefit again, as long as he remains under 20 years old.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or Jordan's situation?

2026-01-29T09:53:52.997724 [actor]: No, that's clear. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T09:53:56.709774 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that Steve is not eligible for Child Benefit because Jordan (age 17) is not in full-time non-advanced education or approved training, which is a requirement for Child Benefit to continue beyond age 16.
