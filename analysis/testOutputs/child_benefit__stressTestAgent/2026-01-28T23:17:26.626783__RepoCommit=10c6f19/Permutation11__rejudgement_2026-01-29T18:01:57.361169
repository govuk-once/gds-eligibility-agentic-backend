**Justification:**

The agent communicated an **incorrect eligibility outcome** that does not agree with the expected outcome.

**Expected Outcome:** Not Eligible (Karen must stop her claim)

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** The agent repeatedly told Karen she was "likely still eligible" and could "KEEP Child Benefit," stating this was "a positive situation" and that "the most likely outcome" was confirmation she could continue receiving it.

**Why this is incorrect:**

According to GOV.UK guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, when a young person starts an apprenticeship in England and receives a salary, they are generally **not** in approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes. The key facts are:

1. Ryan (17) has **left school**
2. He started a **full-time paid apprenticeship** (as an apprentice mechanic)
3. He is receiving **wages/salary** from his employer
4. It's a government-funded **Intermediate Apprenticeship in England**

The agent incorrectly focused on the earnings threshold and Level 2 qualification status, suggesting these factors meant Karen was "likely still eligible." However, the fundamental issue is that paid apprenticeships in England are a disqualifying event - the young person is no longer in approved education/training once they start receiving a salary as an apprentice, regardless of the wage level or qualification level.

The agent should have clearly communicated that Karen was **not eligible** and must stop her claim, rather than repeatedly reassuring her she could likely continue receiving Child Benefit.
