**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, stating that "your right to reside as a jobseeker alone is not sufficient for Child Benefit eligibility."

However, the expected outcome is **Eligible**.

According to the scenario details and HMRC guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, holders of Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme can claim Child Benefit if they meet specific "right to reside" tests, including being a registered jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work. Lars explicitly confirmed he:
- Has Pre-Settled Status from Germany
- Is registered as a jobseeker
- Is actively looking for work with genuine prospects

The agent's determination contradicts the expected outcome. The user meets all three criteria:
1. **Responsibility**: Yes (responsible for 5-year-old son Hans)
2. **Child's Age**: Yes (Hans is 5 years old)
3. **Residency and Right to Reside**: Yes (Pre-Settled Status holder who is a registered jobseeker with genuine prospect of work)

The agent incorrectly assessed the right to reside requirement for jobseekers with Pre-Settled Status, leading to an erroneous "not eligible" determination when the correct outcome should be "eligible."
