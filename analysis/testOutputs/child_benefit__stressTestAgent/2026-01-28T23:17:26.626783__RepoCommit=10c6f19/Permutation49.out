2026-01-28T23:45:13.896262 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T23:45:15.420859 [actor]: benfit for 17 year old coding cours

2026-01-28T23:45:20.028380 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me clarify an important point:

**Is your 17-year-old in approved education or training?**

To help you understand what counts as "approved" - this typically includes:
- Full-time non-advanced education (like A-levels, Scottish Highers, or equivalent)
- Approved training courses (like some vocational training)

A coding course *might* qualify, but it depends on whether it's:
- Full-time (more than 12 hours per week of supervised study)
- Non-advanced (not a degree-level course)
- At an approved educational establishment or training provider

**Could you tell me more about this coding course - specifically, is it full-time and through a recognized school, college, or approved training provider?**

2026-01-28T23:45:21.514025 [actor]: employer pays for cours he joins them after

2026-01-28T23:45:26.732408 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. This is an important detail.

If your 17-year-old is doing a coding course that is **paid for by an employer** and they will **join that employer afterwards**, this sounds like it could be:
- An apprenticeship, or
- Work-based training, or
- Employment with training

Let me ask you directly:

**Is this an officially recognized apprenticeship, or is your 17-year-old already considered an employee of this company while doing the course?**

This matters because Child Benefit generally stops when a young person:
- Starts paid work for 24 hours or more per week, OR
- Leaves approved education or training

However, approved apprenticeships can sometimes still qualify. I need to understand the exact nature of this arrangement to give you accurate guidance.

2026-01-28T23:45:28.155129 [actor]: not paid employer agreement cours then job

2026-01-28T23:45:32.533317 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your 17-year-old is:
- NOT currently being paid
- Has an agreement with an employer
- Will do the course first, then get a job afterwards

This helps, but I need one more key piece of information:

**Is this coding course full-time (more than 12 hours per week of supervised study) and is it provided by a recognized educational establishment like a college, sixth form, or an approved training provider?**

The key issue is whether this counts as "approved education or training" under Child Benefit rules. Generally:
- Full-time education at a school or college usually qualifies
- Some approved vocational training qualifies
- Courses that are mainly preparation for a specific job might not qualify if they're not through approved providers

Could you tell me where/how this course is being delivered - is it through a college, training provider, or directly by the employer?

2026-01-28T23:45:34.014699 [actor]: coding cours specific employer pays not paid yet

2026-01-28T23:45:37.702072 [root_agent]: Thank you for your patience. Let me ask this more directly:

**Where is the coding course taking place - is it at a college, a training center, or at the employer's premises?**

And a related question:

**How many hours per week is your 17-year-old attending this course?**

I'm asking because for Child Benefit purposes, the course needs to be:
- Full-time (more than 12 hours per week of supervised study), AND
- At an approved educational establishment or training provider

If the course is being delivered directly by the employer at their workplace, and it's primarily job preparation rather than recognized education/training, it typically wouldn't count as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes - even if your child isn't being paid yet.

However, if it's through a recognized college or approved training provider (even if the employer is funding it), it might still qualify.

2026-01-28T23:45:39.289200 [actor]: tom 17 computer coding employer pays fees agreement join after

2026-01-28T23:45:42.943830 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. So Tom is 17, doing a computer coding course, the employer pays the fees, and he has an agreement to join them after.

To assess Tom's eligibility for Child Benefit, I still need to know:

**Is this coding course delivered by a college, university, or an official training provider (like a registered training organization), OR is it being delivered directly by the employer themselves?**

This is the crucial factor - even though the employer is paying the fees, if the course is being provided by a recognized educational institution and is full-time, it may still count as approved education for Child Benefit purposes.

Could you tell me who is actually providing/delivering the course?

2026-01-28T23:45:44.323094 [actor]: specific computer coding course future employer pays course fees

2026-01-28T23:45:47.509235 [root_agent]: I understand - the future employer is paying the course fees. However, I still need to know one critical piece of information that I haven't received yet:

**Who is actually teaching and delivering this computer coding course? Is it:**
- A college or university?
- A registered training provider?
- The employer themselves at their workplace?
- An online course provider?

The key distinction for Child Benefit eligibility is whether this is recognized "approved education or training" - and that depends on who is providing the course and whether it meets the criteria of being full-time non-advanced education.

Could you please tell me specifically where Tom attends this course or which organization is delivering it?

2026-01-28T23:45:48.933004 [actor]: employer agreement get job after not approved education

2026-01-28T23:45:52.653683 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification - you've told me this is **not approved education**.

That's very helpful information. If the course is not approved education or training, then Tom would not qualify for Child Benefit based on being in education/training.

However, let me ask you a few more questions to fully assess your eligibility:

**Are you (the person claiming) responsible for Tom? In other words:**
- Do you live with Tom, OR
- Do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards Tom's upbringing (even if he lives elsewhere)?

This is important because Child Benefit eligibility also depends on your relationship and responsibility for the child, not just the child's circumstances.

2026-01-28T23:45:53.992374 [actor]: im responsible for tom live with him

2026-01-28T23:45:58.573392 [root_agent]: Thank you. So to summarize what I understand:

- Tom is 17 years old
- You are responsible for Tom and live with him
- Tom is doing a computer coding course that is **not approved education**
- The course is paid for by a future employer, with an agreement for Tom to join them after

Based on this information and the Child Benefit rules:

**Child Benefit generally covers children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training.**

Since Tom is 17 and this coding course is not approved education or training, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Tom** under current rules.

Child Benefit would have stopped when Tom either:
- Left approved education, or
- Reached 16 (if he wasn't in approved education or training)

Let me ask one final question to be thorough:

**Was Tom previously in approved education (like school or college) that ended recently, or has he been out of approved education for some time?**

This helps confirm the timing of when Child Benefit eligibility would have ended.

2026-01-28T23:45:59.933761 [actor]: ok so not eligble understand

2026-01-28T23:46:03.019706 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct. Based on what you've told me:

- Tom is 17
- He's doing a coding course that is not approved education or training
- You are responsible for him and live with him

**You are not eligible for Child Benefit for Tom** because he is over 16 and not in approved education or training.

I'm glad I could help clarify this for you. If Tom's circumstances change in the future - for example, if he goes back into full-time approved education at a college - you could potentially become eligible again (as long as he's under 20).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or Tom's situation?

2026-01-28T23:46:04.510257 [actor]: no thats all thanks

2026-01-28T23:46:08.399634 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that a 17-year-old in a non-approved education coding course (employer-sponsored training leading to employment) does not qualify for Child Benefit, since eligibility requires the child to be either under 16 or under 20 and in approved education or training.
