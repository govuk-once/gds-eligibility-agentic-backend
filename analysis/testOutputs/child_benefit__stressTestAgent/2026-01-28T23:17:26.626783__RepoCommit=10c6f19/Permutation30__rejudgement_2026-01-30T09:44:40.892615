**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user (Lucas) **is eligible** for Child Benefit and can claim it. The agent accurately explained that:

1. Lucas meets all the basic eligibility criteria (child under 16, lives in UK, responsible for child's care)
2. Since his wife Emily earns £65,000 (over £60,000), there would be a High Income Child Benefit Charge
3. The benefit would need to be paid back through a Self Assessment tax return
4. Lucas has the option to claim and pay back, or claim without receiving payments

This outcome aligns with the expected outcome: **Eligible (Lucas receives money; Emily pays the tax)**. The agent confirmed eligibility for Lucas to claim and receive the benefit, and correctly identified that Emily (as the higher earner) would be liable for the tax charge through the High Income Child Benefit Charge. The agent's explanation was accurate and comprehensive regarding both the eligibility and the tax implications.
