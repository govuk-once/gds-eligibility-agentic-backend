**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, stating that "your right to reside as a jobseeker alone is **not sufficient** for Child Benefit eligibility."

However, the expected outcome is: **Eligible.**

According to the scenario details and HMRC guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, holders of Pre-Settled Status can claim Child Benefit if they meet specific "right to reside" tests, including being a registered jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work. Lars (the user) explicitly confirmed he:
- Has Pre-Settled Status from Germany
- Is registered as a jobseeker
- Is actively looking for work with genuine prospects

The Gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility confirms that EEA nationals with pre-settled status who are registered jobseekers with genuine prospects of finding work have a qualifying right to reside for benefits purposes, including Child Benefit.

The agent's assessment was incorrect. The user **should be eligible** for Child Benefit based on their Pre-Settled Status combined with their registered jobseeker status with genuine work prospects. The agent communicated an outcome (not eligible) that directly contradicts the expected outcome (eligible).
