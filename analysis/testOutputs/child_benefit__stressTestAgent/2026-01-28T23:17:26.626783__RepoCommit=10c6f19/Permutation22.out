2026-01-28T23:29:18.946821 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:29:20.432582 [actor]: child in hosptal son arthur hes been sick

2026-01-28T23:29:22.892799 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I'm sorry to hear that your son Arthur has been unwell and is in hospital.

Let me ask you the next question to help assess your eligibility:

**Are you responsible for Arthur?** (This means you live with him when he's not in hospital, or you're contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards his upkeep)

2026-01-28T23:29:24.239763 [actor]: yes hes my son lives with me when hes home

2026-01-28T23:29:25.675655 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful to know.

**How old is Arthur?**

2026-01-28T23:29:26.915999 [actor]: 7 years old been in hosptal long time

2026-01-28T23:29:28.941525 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. At 7 years old, Arthur is within the age range for Child Benefit (which covers children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training).

Now, let me ask you:

**How long has Arthur been in hospital - is it more than 12 weeks (84 days)?**

2026-01-28T23:29:30.640597 [actor]: he was in for 10 weeks then came home then went back in

2026-01-28T23:29:32.706166 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. That's important information.

Let me ask you:

**When Arthur went back into hospital the second time, has that stay been more than 12 weeks, or are the two hospital stays (the 10 weeks and the current stay) separated by less than 28 days?**

2026-01-28T23:29:34.431184 [actor]: came home for 2 weeks then went back after 15 days hes been back 3 weeks now

2026-01-28T23:29:36.695510 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details. Let me make sure I understand correctly:

- First hospital stay: 10 weeks
- Home for 2 weeks (15 days based on your clarification)
- Second hospital stay: 3 weeks (and ongoing)

**Just to confirm - is Arthur's treatment and care in the hospital being paid for by the NHS, or is it being paid for privately or by a local authority?**

2026-01-28T23:29:37.942685 [actor]: nhs hospital

2026-01-28T23:29:39.556387 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Arthur is in an NHS hospital.

Now let me ask you:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Arthur, or would this be a new claim?**

2026-01-28T23:29:41.284953 [actor]: i get child benefit already just worried about if i still can

2026-01-28T23:29:43.198218 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you already receive Child Benefit for Arthur and are concerned about whether you can continue to receive it.

Based on the information you've provided, let me ask one more important question:

**During Arthur's hospital stays, have you been visiting him and maintaining your responsibility for him?**

2026-01-28T23:29:44.523001 [actor]: yes visit him all the time hes my son

2026-01-28T23:29:50.073915 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's really important.

Based on all the information you've provided, I have good news for you:

**You should still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Arthur.**

Here's why:

1. **Arthur is under 16** (he's 7 years old), so he meets the age requirement.

2. **You are responsible for him** - he lives with you when he's at home, and you visit him regularly in hospital.

3. **The NHS is paying for his hospital care** - this is a key factor.

4. **The gap between hospital stays matters** - Arthur was only home for 15 days between his two hospital stays, which is less than 28 days. However, because the NHS is paying for his care (rather than a local authority), you can continue to receive Child Benefit throughout his hospital stays, regardless of how long they last.

When a child is in hospital and the NHS is paying for their care, parents can continue to receive Child Benefit for as long as the child is there, as long as they remain responsible for the child.

**You should be able to keep receiving your Child Benefit for Arthur.** There's no need to stop your claim or worry about losing it while he's in hospital receiving NHS care.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-28T23:29:56.831310 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital or care, Child Benefit stops after a child has been in hospital for 12 consecutive weeks when the NHS pays for their treatment. While the agent correctly identified that the two hospital stays (10 weeks + 3 weeks so far) are linked because they're separated by less than 28 days, this means the cumulative stay counts as continuous, totaling 13 weeks. Therefore, Child Benefit should stop after the cumulative 12th week, but the agent incorrectly stated the parent "can continue to receive Child Benefit throughout his hospital stays, regardless of how long they last" when NHS pays.
