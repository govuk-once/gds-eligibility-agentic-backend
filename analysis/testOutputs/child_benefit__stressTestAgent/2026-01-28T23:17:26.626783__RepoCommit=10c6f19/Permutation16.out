2026-01-28T23:26:05.493718 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T23:26:07.528481 [actor]: son 14 hospital america treatment expensive need help

2026-01-28T23:26:09.895570 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand your son is 14 and is in hospital in America receiving treatment, which is expensive.

Let me ask you an important question to help assess your eligibility:

Are you (or your partner) responsible for your son, and does he normally live with you in the UK? Or has he moved to America permanently?

2026-01-28T23:26:11.405617 [actor]: uk resident me son hospital treatmetn rare conditon paying costs

2026-01-28T23:26:13.590290 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you are a UK resident and your son is in hospital in America receiving treatment for a rare condition, and you are paying the costs.

Let me ask you this important question:

Is your son only temporarily in America for medical treatment, or has he moved there permanently? In other words, does he still normally live with you in the UK when he's not receiving this treatment?

2026-01-28T23:26:15.188983 [actor]: son went america only for hospital specalist treatment not permenant

2026-01-28T23:26:17.079640 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your son is only temporarily in America for specialist hospital treatment and this is not a permanent move.

Let me ask you another important question:

How long has your son been in the hospital in America receiving this treatment, or how long is he expected to be there?

2026-01-28T23:26:18.509601 [actor]: 15 weeks been there specalist treatmnet rare conditon

2026-01-28T23:26:20.383482 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. So your son has been in America for 15 weeks receiving specialist treatment for a rare condition.

Let me ask you this:

Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your son, or are you applying for the first time?

2026-01-28T23:26:22.088467 [actor]: need to know if eligible still paying for him visiting when can

2026-01-28T23:26:24.434366 [root_agent]: I understand - you want to know if you're still eligible for Child Benefit while your son is in hospital in America, given that you're paying for his treatment and visiting when you can.

Let me ask you one more question to help determine your eligibility:

Are you or your partner working and living in the UK? And do either of you pay UK National Insurance contributions?

2026-01-28T23:26:25.922569 [actor]: yes uk resident working paying for sons costs visiting him

2026-01-28T23:26:31.174692 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me reflect on your situation based on the Child Benefit eligibility rules.

Based on what you've told me:
- You are a UK resident and working
- Your son is 14 years old
- He is temporarily in hospital in America (for 15 weeks) receiving specialist treatment for a rare condition
- This is not a permanent move - he normally lives with you in the UK
- You are responsible for him and paying for his treatment costs

**Good news: You should still be eligible for Child Benefit.**

According to the rules, you can continue to receive Child Benefit if your child is temporarily in hospital, even if that hospital is abroad, as long as:
- You remain responsible for the child
- The child normally lives with you
- The absence is temporary (not permanent)

Your situation appears to meet these criteria since your son is only in America for medical treatment and will return to the UK.

However, I should ask: Have you informed the Child Benefit Office about your son being in hospital abroad? It's important to keep them updated about any changes in your circumstances.

2026-01-28T23:26:32.726144 [actor]: so eligible yes can claim child benefit then

2026-01-28T23:26:35.545633 [root_agent]: Yes, based on the information you've provided, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit (or continue receiving it if you already do).

However, let me ask you an important follow-up question:

Have you already claimed Child Benefit for your son, or do you need to make a new claim? And have you notified the Child Benefit Office that he is currently in hospital abroad?

It's important to keep the Child Benefit Office informed about your son's situation, as they may need to know he's temporarily abroad for medical treatment.

2026-01-28T23:26:41.013618 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that I remain eligible for Child Benefit while my son is temporarily in hospital in America for specialist treatment, correctly applying the rule that Child Benefit continues when a child is temporarily in hospital abroad, provided the child normally lives with the claimant in the UK and the absence is temporary rather than permanent.
