**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of custody rules**: The agent properly identified that Child Benefit stops when a child is in youth custody, regardless of age (under 20).

2. **Accurate timeline assessment**: The child has been in custody for 10 weeks, which exceeds the 8-week threshold mentioned in the criteria. The agent correctly determined this disqualifies the claimant.

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you are not eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit while your son is in youth custody" and explained the reasoning.

4. **Appropriate guidance**: The agent advised the user to report the change in circumstances and stop the claim, and informed them they could reclaim after release.

The agent's determination aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible" based on Criteria 3 (child in custody for more than 8 weeks).
