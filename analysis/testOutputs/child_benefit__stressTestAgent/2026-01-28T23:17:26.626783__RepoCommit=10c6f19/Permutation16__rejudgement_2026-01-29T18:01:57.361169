**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct application of hospitalization rules:** The agent recognized that while the child has been in hospital for 15 weeks (exceeding the standard 12-week threshold), there is an important exception for international cases.

2. **Correct application of international exception:** The agent properly identified and applied the rule that when a child goes abroad specifically for hospital treatment (not for a permanent move), Child Benefit eligibility continues, provided:
   - The parent remains responsible for the child
   - The child normally lives with the parent in the UK
   - The parent is paying for the child's costs

3. **Clear communication:** The agent explicitly stated "Good news: You should still be eligible for Child Benefit" and explained the reasoning, demonstrating understanding of the exception to the 12-week hospitalization rule.

4. **Verification against official guidance:** According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital or care, the rule allows continued eligibility when a child is in hospital abroad specifically for treatment, which matches this scenario exactly.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**, and the reasoning is sound and well-communicated.
