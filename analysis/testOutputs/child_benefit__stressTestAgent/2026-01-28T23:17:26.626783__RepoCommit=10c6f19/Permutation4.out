2026-01-28T23:18:55.340693 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:18:59.110231 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I can see that Sofia is 18 and works in reception.

Let me ask you a key question: **Is Sofia currently in approved education or training?**

This is important because Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training (such as A-levels, T-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or similar qualifications).

2026-01-28T23:19:04.672503 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on what you've told me:

- Sofia is 18 years old
- She left school 2 years ago
- She's not in approved education or training
- She works 30 hours a week as a receptionist

**Unfortunately, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia** because:

1. She is over 16 years old
2. She is not in approved education or training

Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 16, unless they continue in approved education or training, in which case it can continue until they turn 20 (or until the 31st August after their 19th birthday). Since Sofia left school 2 years ago and is working rather than studying, she doesn't meet the criteria.

**Do you have any other children under 16, or aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training?** If so, you may be eligible for Child Benefit for them.

2026-01-28T23:19:09.330147 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because Sofia is 18, not in approved education or training, and working full-time, which means she doesn't meet the criteria for the 16-20 age extension that requires approved education or training.
