**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated an eligibility outcome that aligns with the expected outcome: **Eligible (Lucas receives money; Emily pays the tax).**

**Analysis:**

1. **Eligibility Determination:** The agent correctly determined that the user (Lucas) IS eligible to claim Child Benefit based on:
   - Having a 14-year-old child (under 16)
   - Living in the UK
   - Being responsible for the child's day-to-day care

2. **Tax Liability:** The agent correctly identified that since Emily (the wife) earns £65,000 (over £60,000), there would be a High Income Child Benefit Charge that would require paying back ALL of the benefit received.

3. **Who Pays the Tax:** While the agent didn't explicitly state "Emily will pay the tax" by name, the agent correctly explained the mechanism: the higher earner is responsible for the charge through Self Assessment. Given that Emily earns £65,000 and Lucas earns £18,000, Emily is clearly the higher earner and would be liable for the tax charge.

4. **Options Presented:** The agent appropriately presented both options (claim and pay back, or claim without receiving payments), which is consistent with Lucas being able to receive the money while Emily handles the tax obligation.

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome that Lucas is eligible to receive Child Benefit payments, with Emily being responsible for the associated tax charge due to her higher income.
