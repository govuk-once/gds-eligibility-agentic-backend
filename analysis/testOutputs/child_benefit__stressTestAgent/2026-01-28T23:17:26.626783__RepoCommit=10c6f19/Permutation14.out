2026-01-28T23:25:12.912622 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T23:25:14.376600 [actor]: child living with grandma temporary

2026-01-28T23:25:16.787325 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand the situation better.

**Is the child temporarily living with their grandma, and are you still responsible for the child (for example, you're still contributing to their costs or they'll be returning to live with you)?**

2026-01-28T23:25:18.094873 [actor]: son with grandma recover from surgery

2026-01-28T23:25:20.024838 [root_agent]: I understand - your son is with his grandma while recovering from surgery. That's helpful context.

**Are you still paying towards your son's upbringing costs (such as food, clothes, or other expenses) while he's staying with his grandma during his recovery?**

2026-01-28T23:25:21.470564 [actor]: paying for his things yes

2026-01-28T23:25:22.945416 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you're still paying for his things.

**How old is your son?**

2026-01-28T23:25:24.436199 [actor]: 6 years old

2026-01-28T23:25:26.453493 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now I need to understand your living situation a bit better.

**Do you normally live with your son in the UK (and is this stay with his grandma just temporary while he recovers from surgery)?**

2026-01-28T23:25:27.832706 [actor]: live in uk yes temporary stay

2026-01-28T23:25:29.990439 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Just a couple more questions to complete the assessment.

**Are you (or your partner if you have one) responsible for your son - meaning you're the one who normally looks after him and makes decisions about his upbringing?**

2026-01-28T23:25:31.284623 [actor]: single mother responsible for him

2026-01-28T23:25:34.821123 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on your circumstances, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ You have a 6-year-old son (under 16)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are responsible for your son
✓ You are still paying for his upbringing costs
✓ His stay with his grandma is temporary while he recovers from surgery

When a child is temporarily living elsewhere (such as with a grandparent) but you remain responsible for them and continue to contribute to their costs, you can still claim Child Benefit. The temporary nature of the arrangement during his recovery from surgery doesn't affect your eligibility.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-28T23:25:37.731489 [actor]: ok thank you

2026-01-28T23:25:40.235866 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a single mother who remains responsible for her 6-year-old son and continues paying for his expenses retains Child Benefit eligibility even when the child is temporarily living with grandma during surgical recovery, which aligns with the rules that temporary absences don't affect eligibility when parental responsibility and financial support continue.
