**Justification:**

The agent communicated an **incorrect eligibility outcome**. 

**The Expected Outcome:** Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)

**What the Agent Said:** The parent "should still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Arthur" and can "continue to receive Child Benefit throughout his hospital stays, regardless of how long they last" when the NHS is paying.

**Why This Is Wrong:**

1. **The agent correctly identified the linking rule applies** - Arthur returned to hospital within 28 days (after 15 days), so the stays are treated as continuous: 10 weeks + 3 weeks = 13 cumulative weeks

2. **However, the agent failed to apply the 12-week rule** - According to [gov.uk guidance](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks when a child is in hospital and the NHS pays for treatment

3. **The agent's critical error** was stating that because "the NHS is paying for his care...you can continue to receive Child Benefit for as long as the child is there" - this directly contradicts the 12-week limit for NHS-funded hospital stays

4. **The cumulative stay (13 weeks) exceeds the 12-week threshold**, meaning Jenny should **not be eligible** for Child Benefit after the 12th cumulative week

The agent provided reassurance when they should have explained that eligibility would cease after the cumulative 12-week period in hospital.
