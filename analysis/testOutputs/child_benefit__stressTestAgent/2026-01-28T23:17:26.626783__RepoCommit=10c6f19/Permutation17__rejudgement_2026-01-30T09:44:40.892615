**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible."

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Crown servant exception properly applied**: The agent correctly identified that as a Crown servant (British Armed Forces member) posted to Germany, the residency requirement is satisfied despite living abroad. This is accurate per UK government guidance that Crown servants working abroad are treated as ordinarily resident in the UK.

2. **All eligibility criteria met**:
   - Children under 16 (ages 8 and 10) ✓
   - Responsible for the children ✓
   - Crown servant status exempts from UK residency requirement ✓

3. **Correct guidance on claimant**: The agent appropriately noted that the wife should claim since she has primary day-to-day responsibility, which is procedurally correct but doesn't affect the family's overall eligibility status.

4. **Additional helpful information**: The agent provided relevant information about the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which is appropriate context but doesn't affect eligibility.

The agent's conclusion that "Your wife appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" clearly communicates an **eligible** outcome, matching the expected outcome of the scenario.
