2026-01-30T09:52:17.686141 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that **agrees with the expected outcome of "Eligible."**

**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is eligible for Child Benefit and clearly communicated this outcome with the statement: "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit."

The agent's reasoning was sound and comprehensive:

1. **Correctly identified the Welsh exception**: The agent recognized that a Welsh Government Foundation Apprenticeship is "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes, which is the critical distinction in this scenario. While apprenticeships in England are typically disqualifying, Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are treated differently.

2. **Verified all necessary criteria**: The agent systematically confirmed:
   - Child is 17 (under 20) ✓
   - Child is in approved training (Welsh Foundation Apprenticeship) ✓
   - User is responsible for the child ✓
   - Both live in the UK (Cardiff, Wales) ✓
   - User is British citizen ✓
   - Child lives with user full-time ✓
   - No one else is claiming ✓

3. **Provided appropriate additional guidance**: The agent mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge as a potential consideration while affirming eligibility.

The agent's conclusion aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of "Eligible" based on the regional exception for Welsh Foundation Apprenticeships.
