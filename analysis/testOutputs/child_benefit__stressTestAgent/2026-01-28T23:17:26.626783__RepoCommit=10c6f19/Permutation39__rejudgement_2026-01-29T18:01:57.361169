**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct eligibility determination**: The agent clearly stated "You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided accurate reasoning:
   - Two adopted children aged 6 and 8 (both under 16) ✓
   - Children live with the user ✓
   - User is responsible for day-to-day care ✓
   - User lives in the UK ✓

2. **Critical distinction handled correctly**: The agent properly addressed the adoption allowance issue, explicitly stating: "The fact that you receive adoption allowance and council payments for your children's special needs does **not** prevent you from claiming Child Benefit. These are separate benefits and you can receive both."

3. **Accurate application of criteria**: According to the gov.uk guidance, adoption allowances (unlike fostering allowances) do not disqualify someone from Child Benefit. The agent correctly applied this rule.

4. **Complete assessment**: The agent gathered all necessary information systematically and reached the correct conclusion that matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and appropriately concluded with an eligibility determination that agrees with the expected outcome.
