**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user "should still be eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit" and stated "there's no reason for you to stop your claim" without any time limitation mentioned. This implies ongoing, indefinite eligibility.

However, the expected outcome is: **Eligible (until week 12)**.

According to the scenario details and gov.uk guidance on children in residential accommodation, when a child is in residential accommodation paid for by the local authority, Child Benefit eligibility is limited to 12 weeks. Since the child has been there for 10 weeks, the parent is eligible for only 2 more weeks (until week 12), not indefinitely.

The agent failed to:
1. Identify that residential accommodation paid for by the local authority triggers the 12-week rule
2. Communicate the critical time limitation to the user
3. Inform the user they would lose eligibility after week 12

The agent's conclusion of continued indefinite eligibility fundamentally contradicts the expected outcome of time-limited eligibility (until week 12). This is a material misstatement of the user's entitlement that could lead to overpayment issues and future repayment obligations.
