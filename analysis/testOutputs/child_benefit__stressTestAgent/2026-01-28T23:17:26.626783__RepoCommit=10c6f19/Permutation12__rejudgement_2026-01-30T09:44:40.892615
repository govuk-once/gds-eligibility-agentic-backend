**Justification:**

The agent **incorrectly communicated that Jessica was eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

**Critical Error:** The agent explicitly stated "The fact that Liam receives Universal Credit himself doesn't affect your eligibility for Child Benefit - these are separate benefits." This is factually incorrect.

**According to gov.uk guidance** (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility), Child Benefit stops when a young person aged 16-19 **starts receiving certain benefits in their own right**, specifically including:
- Universal Credit
- Employment and Support Allowance
- Income Support
- Jobseeker's Allowance (income-based)

Since Liam (18) is receiving Universal Credit in his own right, he does **not** qualify as a "qualifying young person" for Child Benefit purposes, even though he is under 20 and in approved education (A-levels). Therefore, Jessica is **not eligible** to claim Child Benefit for him.

The agent failed to identify this disqualifying factor despite Jessica clearly stating "liam gets universal credit" early in the conversation. The agent's final determination directly contradicts the eligibility rules and the expected outcome.
