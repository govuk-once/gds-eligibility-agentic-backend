**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that David is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, there is a clear exception to the 8-week care rule.

**Key Facts:**
- Jack (14) has been in local authority care for 3 months (exceeding 8 weeks)
- Jack stays with David every weekend: Friday evening to Sunday evening
- This means Jack spends **2 consecutive nights** at home each week

**The Exception:**
The gov.uk guidance states that Child Benefit can continue even after 8 weeks in care if the child regularly spends time at home - specifically:
- At least one night a week, OR
- Two nights in a row, OR  
- 24 hours or more per week

David's situation clearly meets this exception as Jack spends Friday night AND Saturday night (2 consecutive nights) at home every single week.

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible (via Exception)

**Agent's Outcome:** Not Eligible

The agent failed to recognize or apply the exception for children in care who regularly stay overnight with the claimant. This is a significant error that would deny David benefits he is legally entitled to receive.
