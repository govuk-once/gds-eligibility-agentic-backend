2026-01-28T23:38:38.625274 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T23:38:40.575892 [actor]: adopted 2 kids get adoption alowance can i get child benfit

2026-01-28T23:38:42.814471 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have 2 adopted children and you're receiving adoption allowance.

To help assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask: Are you responsible for your adopted children? By this I mean, do they live with you and are you the person who looks after them day-to-day?

2026-01-28T23:38:44.254588 [actor]: kids live with me both special needs council pays us money for them

2026-01-28T23:38:46.496216 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know that both children live with you and you receive payments from the council for their care due to their special needs.

Let me ask you: Are your adopted children currently living with you as part of your family, or are they placed with you under a formal foster care or local authority care arrangement?

This distinction is important because it affects Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-28T23:38:47.964009 [actor]: we adopted them not fostering adopted legal adoption papers

2026-01-28T23:38:50.595731 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that - you have legally adopted them with formal adoption papers, and they live with you as part of your family.

Now I need to ask: Are you or your partner (if you have one) responsible for their care? In other words, are you the main person who looks after them day-to-day, rather than them being looked after by a local authority or being in hospital or residential care?

2026-01-28T23:38:52.005159 [actor]: yes we look after them everyday feed them take them school everything

2026-01-28T23:38:54.276651 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. It's clear that you are responsible for their day-to-day care.

Now, let me ask: Are either or both of your adopted children under 16 years old? Or if they're 16 or over, are they under 20 and in approved education or training (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or similar qualifications)?

2026-01-28T23:38:55.649765 [actor]: they are 6 and 8 years old

2026-01-28T23:38:58.180910 [root_agent]: Thank you. So both children are 6 and 8 years old, which means they're both under 16.

Let me ask one more important question: Do you normally live in the UK? By this I mean, is the UK where you usually reside?

2026-01-28T23:38:59.505815 [actor]: yes live in uk always lived here

2026-01-28T23:39:03.401708 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility.

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

- You have two adopted children (aged 6 and 8) who are both under 16
- The children live with you 
- You are responsible for their day-to-day care (feeding them, taking them to school, etc.)
- You normally live in the UK

**Important point about the adoption allowance:** The fact that you receive adoption allowance and council payments for your children's special needs does **not** prevent you from claiming Child Benefit. These are separate benefits and you can receive both.

However, please be aware that:
- Only one person can claim Child Benefit for each child
- If you or your partner earn over £60,000 a year, you may have to pay a tax charge (called the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

Would you like me to clarify anything about your eligibility or the next steps for claiming?

2026-01-28T23:39:08.083485 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on having two legally adopted children under 16 who live with them in the UK, correctly noted that adoption allowance does not prevent Child Benefit claims, and provided accurate information throughout the conversation without making any errors.
