**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome is that the user should be **eligible**.

According to the scenario context provided (Permutation 47), payments made under a **court order** count towards the maintenance requirement for Child Benefit eligibility. The key criterion states: "Yes. Payments made under a court order or agreement count towards the maintenance requirement for Child Benefit eligibility."

The agent's reasoning was flawed because:
1. The agent dismissed the court-ordered payments as insufficient without proper assessment
2. The agent assumed £50/week wouldn't equal what the resident parent spends, but made no effort to verify this
3. Most critically, the agent failed to recognize that court-ordered payments are valid contributions toward eligibility

The agent should have asked more questions to determine if the £50/week payment equals or exceeds the resident parent's contributions, rather than making an assumption. Given that £50/week equals approximately £217/month or £2,600/year, this could very well meet or exceed the contribution threshold depending on the specific circumstances.

The agent's conclusion contradicts the expected outcome that this user is eligible for Child Benefit.
