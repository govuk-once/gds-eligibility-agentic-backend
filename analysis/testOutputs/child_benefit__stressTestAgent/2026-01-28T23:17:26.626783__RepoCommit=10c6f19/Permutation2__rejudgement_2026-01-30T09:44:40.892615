**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user (Amit) is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct assessment of all criteria:**
   - The agent properly identified that Priya (17) is under 20 and in approved education (A-levels)
   - Confirmed Amit is responsible for her (she lives with him)
   - Verified UK residency/British citizenship
   - Confirmed no one else is claiming
   - Appropriately mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold (£60,000)

2. **Clear communication:** The agent explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided a clear checklist of why each criterion was met.

3. **Accurate guidance:** The agent provided additional helpful information about the application process and the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which is relevant to Amit's situation (income £40,000, below the threshold).

The agent's eligibility determination aligns perfectly with the expected outcome. The evaluation judge also marked this as a pass (✓), agreeing with this assessment.
