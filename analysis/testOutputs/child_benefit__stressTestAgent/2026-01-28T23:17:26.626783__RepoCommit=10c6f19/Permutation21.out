2026-01-28T23:28:42.046201 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T23:28:43.514649 [actor]: child benfit eligable 10 year old

2026-01-28T23:28:45.837206 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 10-year-old child, which meets the age requirement.

Now, my next question is: **Are you responsible for this child?** 

By this I mean - does the child normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards looking after them?

2026-01-28T23:28:47.361706 [actor]: yes my son sam lives with me after divorse

2026-01-28T23:28:49.647050 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like your son Sam lives with you, which is good for eligibility purposes.

Let me ask you this: **Are you or your partner currently receiving Child Benefit for Sam from someone else, or is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T23:28:51.384827 [actor]: no but ex wife claming for my other child ella she lives with her mum

2026-01-28T23:28:53.960071 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So to confirm - your ex-wife is claiming Child Benefit for Ella who lives with her, but nobody is currently claiming Child Benefit for Sam who lives with you. That's helpful to know.

Next question: **Do you normally live in the UK?** 

(There are some exceptions for people working abroad or serving in HM Forces, but I need to understand your general living situation first)

2026-01-28T23:28:55.719492 [actor]: yes live in uk now work here normal job

2026-01-28T23:28:57.773113 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you. You live and work in the UK.

Now I need to ask about your immigration status: **Are you a British citizen, or do you have settled status, pre-settled status, or another type of immigration permission to be in the UK?**

2026-01-28T23:28:59.316451 [actor]: british citizen born here

2026-01-28T23:29:01.804811 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your income situation: **Do you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year?**

(This is important because there's a High Income Child Benefit Charge that may apply if either you or your partner earns above this threshold)

2026-01-28T23:29:03.373560 [actor]: no income under that amount single now

2026-01-28T23:29:07.220506 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your son Sam. Let me summarize why:

✓ Sam is 10 years old (under 16)
✓ He lives with you (you're responsible for him)
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Sam
✓ You live and work in the UK
✓ You're a British citizen
✓ Your income is under £60,000
✓ You're not currently in a partnership where your partner earns over £60,000

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for Sam. It's quite right that your ex-wife claims for Ella since Ella lives with her.

**One final question to ensure I've covered everything: Is Sam currently in hospital long-term or in local authority care, or does he live with you full-time at home?**

2026-01-28T23:29:08.475281 [actor]: sam lives with me full time at home

2026-01-28T23:29:11.144845 [root_agent]: Perfect! That confirms everything I need to know.

**You are eligible for Child Benefit for your son Sam.**

Since Sam lives with you full-time, you're responsible for him, no one else is claiming for him, you live in the UK, you're a British citizen, and your income is under £60,000, you meet all the eligibility criteria.

You can now go ahead and apply for Child Benefit for Sam. The application process is straightforward, and once approved, you'll receive payments to help with the costs of raising him.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-28T23:29:16.979669 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for their son Sam based on all the relevant criteria: the child is under 16, lives with the claimant, no one else is claiming for this child, the claimant lives in the UK, is a British citizen, and has income under £60,000. The agent also correctly noted that the ex-wife's separate claim for the other child (Ella) who lives with her is appropriate and doesn't affect this claim.
