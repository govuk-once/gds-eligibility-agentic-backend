**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors the agent properly identified:**

1. **Responsibility criterion met**: The user is caring for Nina (10 years old) who lives with them for the foreseeable future due to the mother's ongoing illness. The agent confirmed the user provides day-to-day care and meets Nina's needs.

2. **Financial support criterion met**: This is a private fostering arrangement. The agent correctly identified there is no formal council involvement or payment. Critically, the agent recognized that in private fostering situations (unlike council fostering), the person providing care CAN claim Child Benefit because they are financially supporting the child.

3. **No duplicate claims**: The agent confirmed no one else is currently receiving Child Benefit for Nina.

4. **UK residency**: The user is a British citizen living and working in the UK.

5. **Mother's agreement**: The arrangement has the mother's knowledge and agreement.

The agent's conclusion that the user "appears to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina" is correct and matches the expected outcome for this private fostering scenario (Permutation 37). The agent demonstrated proper understanding that private fosterers, unlike council-paid foster carers, can claim Child Benefit when they are financially responsible for the child.
