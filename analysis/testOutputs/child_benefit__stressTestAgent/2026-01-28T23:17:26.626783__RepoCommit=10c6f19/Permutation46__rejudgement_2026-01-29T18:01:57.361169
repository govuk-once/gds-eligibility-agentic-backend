**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Expired)."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of the time limit**: The agent accurately explained that EU citizens with pre-settled status who are jobseekers have a right to reside for up to 91 days while genuinely seeking work.

2. **Proper application to the user's situation**: The agent recognized that the user has been in the UK for 95 days (exceeding the 91-day limit) without finding employment.

3. **Clear eligibility determination**: The agent explicitly stated: "it does appear that you may not currently be eligible for Child Benefit" because "After 91 days without employment, that right to reside as a jobseeker generally ends" and "Child Benefit requires you to have a right to reside in the UK."

4. **Appropriate reasoning**: The agent connected all the relevant facts (pre-settled status, jobseeker status, 95 days elapsed, no employment found) to reach the correct conclusion about expired eligibility.

The agent's communication was accurate, well-reasoned, and matches the expected outcome that the user's jobseeker right to reside has expired, making them ineligible for Child Benefit.
