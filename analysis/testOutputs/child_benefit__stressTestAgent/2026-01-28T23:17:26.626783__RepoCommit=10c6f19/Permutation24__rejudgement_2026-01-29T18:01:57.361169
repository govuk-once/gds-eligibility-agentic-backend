**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user "should still be eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit" without any time limitation, stating the user should "continue claiming" indefinitely based on retaining parental responsibility and contributing to upkeep.

However, the expected outcome is: **Eligible (until week 12)**.

According to the government guidance on Child Benefit, when a child is in residential accommodation paid for by the local authority, there is a specific 12-week time limit on eligibility. The child has been there for 10 weeks, meaning the parent is eligible for only 2 more weeks (until week 12), after which eligibility ceases.

The agent failed to communicate this critical time limitation. While the agent correctly identified that the user is currently eligible, they did not inform the user that this eligibility will end at the 12-week mark. This is a significant omission that could lead to the user incorrectly continuing to claim Child Benefit beyond week 12, which would be improper.

The agent's outcome (eligible indefinitely) does not agree with the expected outcome (eligible only until week 12).
