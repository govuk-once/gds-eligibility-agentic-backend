2026-01-28T23:28:15.451483 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T23:28:16.803191 [actor]: grandaughter lives with me 14 years old

2026-01-28T23:28:19.107515 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your 14-year-old granddaughter lives with you.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for your granddaughter? This means are you the main person looking after her and paying towards her upbringing (such as for food, clothes, or other living costs)?

2026-01-28T23:28:20.632623 [actor]: yes i pay for evrything food clothes school stuff evrything

2026-01-28T23:28:22.306461 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It sounds like you are responsible for your granddaughter.

Now I need to ask: Do you normally live in the UK? (This includes England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland)

2026-01-28T23:28:23.702953 [actor]: live in uk yes

2026-01-28T23:28:25.507396 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming you live in the UK.

Now I need to ask about your granddaughter's parents: Does anyone else claim Child Benefit for your granddaughter, such as her mother or father?

2026-01-28T23:28:27.072366 [actor]: parents dont claim anything they cant look after her no money from them

2026-01-28T23:28:29.360182 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's helpful to know that the parents aren't claiming Child Benefit and aren't providing support.

One more important question: Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on your right to remain in the UK that might affect your access to public funds?

2026-01-28T23:28:30.841719 [actor]: no immigration issues born here

2026-01-28T23:28:34.811231 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your granddaughter. Here's why:

✓ Your granddaughter is 14 years old (under 16)
✓ She lives with you
✓ You are responsible for her - you pay for her food, clothes, school supplies, and everything else
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ You have no immigration restrictions

Since you're the main person looking after your granddaughter and paying towards her upbringing, you can claim Child Benefit even though you're her grandparent rather than her parent.

You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit. Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or the claiming process?

2026-01-28T23:28:39.894373 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly established that the grandparent is responsible for the child, lives in the UK, no one else claims the benefit, and there are no immigration issues, which are all correct criteria for Child Benefit eligibility for a grandparent caring for their grandchild.
