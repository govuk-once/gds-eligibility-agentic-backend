2026-01-28T23:17:55.570459 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T23:17:57.137851 [actor]: daughtr at colege a levels

2026-01-28T23:17:59.009845 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a daughter doing A-levels at college.

**Is your daughter under 20 years old?**

2026-01-28T23:18:00.290379 [actor]: yes shes 17

2026-01-28T23:18:02.978327 [root_agent]: Great, that's helpful to know. Your daughter is 17 and doing A-levels, which means she meets the age requirement.

Next question: **Are you responsible for your daughter? This means - does she live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards her upkeep?**

2026-01-28T23:18:04.333989 [actor]: she lives with me in london

2026-01-28T23:18:06.505996 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your 17-year-old daughter lives with you in London and is doing A-levels.

Next question: **Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do either of you have "no recourse to public funds" as a condition of your stay in the UK?**

2026-01-28T23:18:07.810694 [actor]: uk resident

2026-01-28T23:18:09.989039 [root_agent]: That's good to know you're a UK resident.

To clarify further: **Do you have the right to reside in the UK? For example, are you a British citizen, or do you have settled status, pre-settled status, or another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits?**

2026-01-28T23:18:11.336935 [actor]: british citizen amit single father

2026-01-28T23:18:13.291603 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Amit. So you're a British citizen and a single father with your 17-year-old daughter living with you while she does A-levels.

One final question: **Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for your daughter?**

2026-01-28T23:18:14.537216 [actor]: no one else claiming

2026-01-28T23:18:18.951854 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:
- ✓ You have a daughter who is 17 years old (under 20)
- ✓ She's in approved education (doing A-levels)
- ✓ She lives with you, so you're responsible for her
- ✓ You're a British citizen with the right to reside in the UK
- ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

**You can apply for Child Benefit for your daughter.**

A couple of important things to note:
- You'll need to apply and provide details about your daughter and her education
- If your individual income is over £60,000 per year, you may have to pay a tax charge (the High Income Child Benefit Charge)
- Even if you earn over this amount, you can still claim Child Benefit but may choose not to receive the payments to avoid the tax charge, while still getting National Insurance credits

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T23:18:23.912179 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Amit is eligible for Child Benefit based on his daughter being 17, in approved education (A-levels), living with him, him being a British citizen, and no one else claiming for her.
