**Justification:**

The expected outcome for this scenario is: "Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible."

In the transcript, the user is Pete (staying with the daughter 3 days/week) and Sue is the mother (staying with the daughter 4 days/week). 

The agent communicated that:
- HMRC would "likely" determine that the mother (Sue) should receive the Child Benefit based on the 4 days vs 3 days arrangement
- The mother would likely be considered the main carer since the daughter spends most time with her
- Only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child

This communication aligns with the expected outcome that Sue is eligible and Pete is not eligible. While the evaluation judge criticized the agent for oversimplifying the decision-making process (which is a valid procedural concern), the actual eligibility outcome communicated - that Sue would likely receive the benefit and Pete would not - matches the expected outcome.

The agent correctly conveyed that in this disputed claim scenario, the person with whom the child lives most of the time (Sue, 4 days) would likely be awarded the benefit over the person with less time (Pete, 3 days), which is consistent with HMRC's priority rules for disputed claims.
