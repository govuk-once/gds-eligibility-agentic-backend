**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct application of hospitalization rules**: The agent recognized that even though the child has been in hospital for 15 weeks (exceeding the typical 12-week threshold), there is an important exception for children hospitalized abroad.

2. **Correct application of international exception**: The agent properly identified and applied the rule that when a child goes abroad specifically for hospital treatment (not permanently), Child Benefit eligibility continues, provided:
   - The parent remains responsible for the child
   - The parent is paying for the child's costs
   - The child normally lives with the parent in the UK
   - The absence is temporary

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "Good news: You should still be eligible for Child Benefit" and "Yes, based on the information you've provided, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit."

4. **Alignment with criteria**: The scenario confirms that:
   - Oliver went abroad specifically for hospital treatment (Criteria 2 met)
   - Hannah is still spending money on him (required condition met)
   - This makes Hannah eligible despite the >12 week hospitalization

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
