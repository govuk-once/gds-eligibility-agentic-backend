**Justification:**

The agent concluded that Mo is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and the official guidance, Mo should be **eligible**.

Here's why the agent's assessment was incorrect:

1. **The Contribution Rule:** According to [gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else), a person can claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with them if they contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit toward the child's upkeep.

2. **Weekly Child Benefit Amount:** Child Benefit for one child is £25.60 per week (or thereabouts - the scenario uses £26.05).

3. **Combined Contributions:** The guidance explicitly states that contributions from multiple people can be combined. Mo contributes £15/week and his mother contributes £15/week, totaling £30/week - which exceeds the £26.05 threshold.

4. **Aunt Not Claiming:** The aunt is not claiming Child Benefit, which is a key factor. When the person the child lives with doesn't claim, someone else who contributes sufficiently can claim.

The agent incorrectly focused solely on physical custody and day-to-day care, dismissing the financial contribution pathway to eligibility. The agent specifically stated "the financial contribution alone doesn't make you eligible," which contradicts the actual rules when contributions meet the threshold and the resident carer isn't claiming.

**Expected outcome: Eligible**
**Agent's communicated outcome: Not eligible**
**These do not agree.**
