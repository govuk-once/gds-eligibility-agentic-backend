**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user **is eligible** for Child Benefit, stating "You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit!" However, the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

The critical error is that the agent failed to verify whether the college course qualifies as "approved education." According to the scenario details, John's course involves only **6 hours per week of supervised study**. To count as approved education for Child Benefit purposes, a course must average **more than 12 hours a week** of supervised study or tuition (as specified in the gov.uk guidance on approved education or training).

The agent incorrectly assumed that attending college for GCSEs automatically constitutes "approved education" without checking the study hours requirement. Since 6 hours/week falls well short of the 12+ hours threshold, John does not meet the education criteria, and Pete (the father) is **not eligible** for Child Benefit.

The agent's communicated outcome (Eligible) directly contradicts the expected outcome (Not Eligible), therefore this is a failure.
