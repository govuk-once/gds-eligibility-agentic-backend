**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Approved Training Verification**: The agent correctly recognized the "No One Left Behind" programme as approved training for Child Benefit purposes in Scotland. This is crucial since the permutation explicitly states this programme is "explicitly listed as approved training for Child Benefit."

2. **Systematic Eligibility Check**: The agent methodically verified all necessary criteria:
   - Child under 20 in approved training ✓
   - User lives with the child ✓
   - No other claimant ✓
   - Income under £60,000 (no tax charge) ✓
   - UK residency ✓

3. **Clear Communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided a clear breakdown of why all criteria were met.

4. **Accurate Information**: The agent provided correct guidance about the High Income Child Benefit Charge thresholds (£60,000-£80,000) and correctly noted that the user can claim without tax implications.

The evaluation judge also marked this with ✓, agreeing that eligibility was correctly determined. The agent's outcome communication matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
