**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct identification of the education status**: The agent appropriately determined that Tom's employer-sponsored coding course with an agreement to join the employer afterwards does NOT qualify as "approved education." This aligns with HMRC guidance that explicitly excludes "doing a course with an employer's agreement - for example, to get a job" from approved education.

2. **Correct application of eligibility criteria**: The agent properly applied the rule that Child Benefit covers children under 16, or under 20 if in approved education or training. Since Tom is 17 and NOT in approved education, he does not meet the criteria.

3. **Clear communication of outcome**: The agent explicitly stated multiple times that the user is "not eligible for Child Benefit for Tom" and explained why this is the case.

4. **Thorough questioning**: The agent asked appropriate follow-up questions to understand the nature of the course and confirmed the living arrangements before reaching the conclusion.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**, and the reasoning is sound according to the Child Benefit eligibility rules at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility.
