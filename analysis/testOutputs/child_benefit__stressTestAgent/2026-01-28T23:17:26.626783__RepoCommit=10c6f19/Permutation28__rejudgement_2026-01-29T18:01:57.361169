**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.

The agent's reasoning was sound:
1. The agent identified the critical issue: the user is a US citizen on a standard 6-month tourist visa
2. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit requires the claimant to be "ordinarily resident in the UK"
3. The agent appropriately distinguished between temporary visitors and those habitually/normally living in the UK on a settled basis
4. The agent concluded the user is not eligible due to their temporary visitor status

This aligns with the scenario details, which specify that under Criteria 2 (Immigration Status/Right to Reside), the user has no right to reside for benefit purposes - a standard visitor visa subjects the holder to "Immigration Control" with no recourse to public funds, and the user does not have settled status or qualifying right to reside.

The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome clearly and with appropriate explanation.
