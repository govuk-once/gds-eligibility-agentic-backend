**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Criteria 1 - Hospital Limit (>12 weeks):** The child has been in hospital for 14 weeks, exceeding the 12-week threshold.

2. **Criteria 2 - Expenditure Exception:** The user visits daily but explicitly stated the hospital provides "everything" (food, clothes, etc.) and confirmed "hospital pays everything." There is no indication that the parent regularly spends money on the child's upkeep, treats, or personal items.

3. **Agent's conclusion:** The agent properly applied the rule that Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks of continuous hospital care when the hospital/local authority covers maintenance costs and the parent does not meet the expenditure exception.

The agent's determination of "NOT eligible" matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** for this scenario where the parent visits but does not spend money on the child's upkeep after the 12-week hospital limit.
