**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible (Though potentially financially suboptimal)."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct eligibility determination**: The agent accurately identified that a 15-year-old can claim Child Benefit for their own child, stating "The fact that you're 15 years old doesn't prevent you from claiming Child Benefit."

2. **Proper criteria verification**: The agent systematically verified:
   - Child under 16: ✓ (6-month-old Mia)
   - Lives in UK: ✓
   - Responsible for the child: ✓ (primary caregiver)
   - No one else claiming: ✓
   - Income under £60,000: ✓

3. **Acknowledgment of the special circumstance**: The agent specifically addressed the unusual situation of a minor parent claiming for their own child, correctly noting this is permissible.

**Regarding the "financially suboptimal" aspect**: While the agent did not explicitly mention that Chloe's parents might receive more benefit by claiming on her behalf (which would have been ideal), the agent's primary task was to determine and communicate eligibility, which was done correctly. The expected outcome acknowledges eligibility despite potential financial suboptimality, and the agent's determination of "eligible" matches this outcome.
