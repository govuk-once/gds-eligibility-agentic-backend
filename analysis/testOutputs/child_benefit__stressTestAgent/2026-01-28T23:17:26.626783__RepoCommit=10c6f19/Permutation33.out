2026-01-28T23:35:20.481890 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T23:35:22.239127 [actor]: bella 16 travel agent training employer pays

2026-01-28T23:35:24.546803 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Bella is 16 and in training as a travel agent with an employer who pays for the training.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Is Bella your child, and do you have responsibility for her?

2026-01-28T23:35:26.064897 [actor]: yes she lives with me im her mum

2026-01-28T23:35:28.931765 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Bella is your daughter, she's 16, lives with you, and is in employer-paid training as a travel agent.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for Bella? By this I mean, do you pay for things like her food, clothes, and other living costs?

2026-01-28T23:35:30.325757 [actor]: yes i pay for everything food clothes bills she lives here

2026-01-28T23:35:34.264358 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now I need to check an important detail about Bella's training. Is the training she's doing considered "approved education or training"? 

Specifically, is it:
- Full-time education (at least 12 hours a week of supervised study or course-related work experience), or
- Approved training with an approved training provider, or
- Non-advanced education (like A levels, Scottish Highers, or equivalent)?

Or is it purely work-based training provided directly by her employer?

2026-01-28T23:35:35.695493 [actor]: employer training local travel agency paid by them

2026-01-28T23:35:37.966476 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So this is work-based training provided and paid for directly by her employer at a local travel agency.

I need to ask: Is Bella registered with Careers Wales, Careers Scotland, or similar careers service for any approved training program, or is this purely an employment arrangement with the travel agency?

2026-01-28T23:35:39.483133 [actor]: just employment travel agency no careers service

2026-01-28T23:35:43.710509 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. 

Based on the information you've provided:

- Bella is 16 years old
- She lives with you and you're her mother
- You're responsible for her (paying for food, clothes, bills)
- She's in employer-paid training at a local travel agency
- This is just an employment arrangement, not registered with any careers service as approved training

Unfortunately, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Bella** in this situation. 

Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds is only available if the young person is in **approved education or training**. Since Bella is in direct employment with training provided by her employer (rather than approved education or a recognized training program), this doesn't meet the criteria for Child Benefit beyond age 16.

However, let me ask: Do you have any other children under 16 years old? If so, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit for them.

2026-01-28T23:35:46.510624 [actor]: no just bella thanks

2026-01-28T23:35:48.719097 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that employer-provided work-based training at a travel agency does not qualify as "approved education or training" under Child Benefit rules, and correctly concluded that the claimant is not eligible for Child Benefit for a 16-year-old in such circumstances.
