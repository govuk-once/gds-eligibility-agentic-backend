**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated the eligibility outcome that aligns with the expected outcome: **Eligible (but only for the last 3 months; they lose the first month's money).**

The agent:
1. Confirmed the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on all required criteria
2. Clearly explained the 3-month backdating limit
3. Explicitly stated that the user "will have lost out on that first month's payment"
4. Confirmed when the user asked directly: "you won't be able to get all 4 months back" and "you'll receive payments for the last 3 months"

This matches the expected outcome perfectly - the user is eligible but can only claim for 3 of the 4 months, losing one month's payment due to the backdating limitation.
