**Justification:**

The expected outcome states: "Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible."

In the transcript, the agent communicates that:
1. Only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child
2. Based on the daughter living with her mother (Sue) 4 days a week versus Pete's 3 days, HMRC would "likely" determine that the mother is the main carer
3. The mother would likely receive the Child Benefit

The agent's conclusion aligns with the expected outcome - that Sue (the mother) is eligible and Pete is not eligible. While the evaluation judge criticizes the agent for oversimplifying the decision-making process and not being neutral enough, the agent did ultimately communicate the correct eligibility outcome that matches the expected result.

The judge's concern is about the methodology and certainty expressed, not about whether the wrong person was identified as eligible. The agent correctly identified that Sue would likely receive the benefit, which matches "Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible."
