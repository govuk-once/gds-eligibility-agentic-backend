2026-01-28T23:19:11.466210 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine whether you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T23:19:13.094775 [actor]: child benefit money for lucas hes 10 need to kno if i can cliam

2026-01-28T23:19:16.119943 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Lucas is 10 years old, which means he's under 16 - that's good for the age requirement.

Now I need to ask you:

**Are you responsible for Lucas? This means - do you live with him and are you the main person looking after him (for example, providing his food, clothing, and general care)?**

2026-01-28T23:19:17.970087 [actor]: no dont live with him but i send jenny money every month for lucas 150 pounds for his food and cloths

2026-01-28T23:19:19.839023 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. So you don't live with Lucas but you contribute £150 monthly towards his care.

Let me ask you this:

**Does Jenny live with Lucas and is she the main person responsible for looking after him day-to-day?**

2026-01-28T23:19:21.498800 [actor]: yes jenny lives with lucas shes his mum she looks after him

2026-01-28T23:19:25.058835 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is an important situation.

Since Jenny lives with Lucas and is the main person responsible for looking after him day-to-day, she would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit - not you.

Child Benefit is generally paid to the person who is responsible for the child and who the child lives with. Even though you're contributing financially towards Lucas's care, the fact that you don't live with him and Jenny is his main carer means **Jenny would be the eligible person to claim Child Benefit for Lucas, not you**.

Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child at any given time.

**Is Jenny currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucas, or is she the person who needs to know if she can claim?**

2026-01-28T23:19:26.753643 [actor]: no jenny not claiming she dosnt want it i want to claim can i claim it

2026-01-28T23:19:29.475765 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask an important follow-up question:

**Even though Jenny doesn't want to claim Child Benefit herself, does she agree that you should claim it instead? In other words, has Jenny given her consent for you to be the person who claims Child Benefit for Lucas?**

This is important because the rules around claiming when the child lives with someone else require understanding of the living arrangements and who has responsibility.

2026-01-28T23:19:31.007507 [actor]: she said fine i can claim it if i want to dosnt matter to her

2026-01-28T23:19:34.582387 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. However, I need to be clear about the eligibility rules here.

Even though Jenny has said you can claim it, **you are not eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas** based on what you've told me.

Here's why: Child Benefit can only be claimed by someone who:
- The child lives with, AND
- Is responsible for the child

Since Lucas lives with Jenny and she is responsible for his day-to-day care, only Jenny is eligible to claim Child Benefit for him - even if she chooses not to claim it.

The fact that you contribute money towards Lucas's care doesn't make you eligible if you don't live with him and aren't his main carer.

**So to answer your original question: No, you cannot claim Child Benefit for Lucas under these circumstances.**

Is there anything else about this decision you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T23:19:36.647563 [actor]: but i pay more than the child benefit amount doesnt that count for somthing i pay 150 a month

2026-01-28T23:19:41.311541 [root_agent]: I understand your frustration, and I can see that you're contributing a significant amount to Lucas's care - £150 a month is more than the Child Benefit amount (which is around £25 per week for the eldest or only child, so roughly £100-£108 per month).

However, **the amount of money you contribute doesn't change the eligibility rules for Child Benefit.**

Child Benefit eligibility is based on:
- **Who the child lives with**, AND
- **Who is responsible for the child's day-to-day care**

It's not based on who pays the most money towards the child's upkeep.

Since Lucas lives with Jenny and she provides his day-to-day care, only she is eligible to claim Child Benefit - regardless of how much you contribute financially or whether she wants to claim it or not.

Your financial contributions are separate from Child Benefit eligibility. The money you're sending is helping to support Lucas, which is important, but it doesn't give you the right to claim Child Benefit when you don't live with him.

**Is there anything else about Child Benefit or this situation that you'd like me to explain?**

2026-01-28T23:19:42.859958 [actor]: so im defintely not eligible even tho i pay for his upkeep and jenny not claiming it

2026-01-28T23:19:46.796451 [root_agent]: **That's correct - you are definitely not eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas, even though you contribute to his upkeep and even though Jenny is not claiming it.**

The rules are clear:
- Lucas lives with Jenny
- Jenny is responsible for his day-to-day care
- Therefore, only Jenny is eligible to claim Child Benefit for him

The fact that:
- You pay £150 per month towards his care
- Jenny doesn't want to claim it herself
- Jenny has given you permission to claim it

...none of these things change your eligibility. You still cannot claim because you don't meet the basic requirement of the child living with you.

It's unfortunate that the benefit will go unclaimed if Jenny chooses not to claim it, but that doesn't transfer eligibility to you.

**I know this isn't the answer you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help clarify about this decision?**

2026-01-28T23:19:48.373524 [actor]: ok understand now thanks for help

2026-01-28T23:19:51.994941 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the Child Benefit rules, correctly explaining that only the person the child lives with and who is responsible for day-to-day care can claim the benefit, and that financial contributions alone do not establish eligibility when the child lives elsewhere.
