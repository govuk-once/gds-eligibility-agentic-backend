**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome is that the user should be **Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)**.

According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, there is a specific "extension period" that applies in this scenario. When a 16 or 17-year-old leaves approved education or training, Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks if the young person registers with a careers service (or Connexions in some areas) and is looking for work or training.

In this case:
- The son is 17 years old
- He left school in June (within the 20-week window since it's currently August)
- He is registered with the careers service
- He is actively looking for an apprenticeship

All of these factors mean the user qualifies for the extension period, making them eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when the son left education.

The agent failed to recognize this extension provision and incorrectly stated that the user is not eligible. The agent only mentioned that eligibility would resume if the son starts an apprenticeship, but missed the crucial interim extension period that applies to this exact situation.
