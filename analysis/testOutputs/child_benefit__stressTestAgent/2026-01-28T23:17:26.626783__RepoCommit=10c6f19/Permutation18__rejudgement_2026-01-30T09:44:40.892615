**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user is eligible for Child Benefit. Here's why this is wrong:

**Critical Error - Age Eligibility:**
The user clearly stated their son "dev 20 years old" at the start of the conversation. According to GOV.UK guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, a child must be:
- Under 16, OR
- Under 20 if in approved education or training

The key phrase is "**under 20**" - this means the child must not have yet reached their 20th birthday. Once a child turns 20, they are no longer eligible for Child Benefit, **even if they are still completing their approved education or training**.

**The Agent's Mistake:**
The agent stated: "You have a son who is under 20 years old" - this is factually incorrect based on the user's statement that Dev is 20 years old (not 19 years old).

The agent then concluded the user is eligible and can claim "up until he turns 20" - but Dev has already turned 20, so eligibility has already ceased.

**Expected Outcome:**
The expected outcome clearly states: "**Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)**"

**Conclusion:**
The agent communicated an outcome of "eligible" when the correct outcome should have been "not eligible" because Dev has already reached his 20th birthday. This is a fundamental error in applying the age criteria for Child Benefit eligibility.
