2026-01-30T09:50:39.843086 [confirmation_judge]: Looking at this transcript, I need to assess whether the agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

## Analysis:

**The Agent's Determination:**
The agent clearly stated: "Based on what you've told me, you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina."

**Key Facts from the Scenario:**
- Nina (10 years old) lives with Carol (the applicant)
- This is a private fostering arrangement due to mother's illness
- The arrangement is for the foreseeable future
- The local council is NOT paying Carol a fostering allowance or accommodation costs
- Carol is financially supporting Nina

**Verification Against Gov.uk Guidance:**
According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, you can claim Child Benefit if you're responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if in approved education/training) and the child lives with you.

The critical distinction here is between:
1. **Council/Local Authority Fostering** - where the council pays an allowance (NOT eligible for Child Benefit)
2. **Private Fostering** - where the individual is financially supporting the child (ELIGIBLE for Child Benefit)

The scenario explicitly states this is a private arrangement and the council is NOT paying Carol. This means Carol is bearing the financial responsibility and is therefore eligible to claim Child Benefit.

**Agent's Assessment:**
The agent correctly identified:
- Nina lives with the applicant ✓
- The applicant is responsible for day-to-day care ✓
- It's for the foreseeable future (not temporary) ✓
- No one else is claiming ✓
- Mother has agreed ✓
- Applicant meets residency/citizenship requirements ✓

The agent appropriately recognized that "private arrangements are accepted" and that formal documentation isn't required.

**Conclusion:**
The agent's determination of **Eligible** matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**. The agent correctly understood that in private fostering arrangements where the council is not providing financial support, the private fosterer can claim Child Benefit.

👍 The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome.
