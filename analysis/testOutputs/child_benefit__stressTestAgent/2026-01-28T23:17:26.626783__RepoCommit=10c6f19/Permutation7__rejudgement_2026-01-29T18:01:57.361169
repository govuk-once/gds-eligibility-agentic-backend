**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation."

However, the **expected outcome** is that the user should be **Eligible (via Exception)**.

According to the official gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit for children in care (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), there is a specific exception to the 8-week rule: Child Benefit can continue to be paid if the child regularly stays with the claimant for at least one night per week (or spends at least 24 hours per week with them).

In this scenario:
- The child has been in local authority care for 3 months (exceeding the 8-week threshold)
- The child stays with David every weekend from Friday evening to Sunday evening
- This constitutes 2 consecutive nights per week (Friday and Saturday nights)

This clearly meets the exception criteria. The agent failed to recognize or apply this exception rule and incorrectly concluded the user was ineligible. The agent should have determined that David remains entitled to Child Benefit because his son spends at least 2 nights in a row at home each week.

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent does **not** agree with the expected outcome.
