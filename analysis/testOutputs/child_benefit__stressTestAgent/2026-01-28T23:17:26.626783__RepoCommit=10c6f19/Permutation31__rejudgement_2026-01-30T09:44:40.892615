**Justification:**

The agent clearly and correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns perfectly with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Clear ineligibility statement**: The agent explicitly stated "Unfortunately, you are not eligible for Child Benefit for your 18-year-old daughter who is at university doing a degree course."

2. **Accurate reasoning**: The agent correctly identified that university degree courses are "advanced education" and do not qualify for Child Benefit, as opposed to "approved education" (A-levels, Scottish Highers, etc.) which would qualify.

3. **Consistent messaging**: The agent reinforced this message multiple times, including the confirmation: "That's correct - no Child Benefit for students doing university degree courses."

4. **Proper application of criteria**: The agent correctly distinguished between "approved non-advanced education" and "advanced education," applying the guidance that Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education like a university degree.

The expected outcome states that Child Benefit stops when a child starts "advanced" education such as a university degree, and the agent communicated exactly this outcome to the user.
