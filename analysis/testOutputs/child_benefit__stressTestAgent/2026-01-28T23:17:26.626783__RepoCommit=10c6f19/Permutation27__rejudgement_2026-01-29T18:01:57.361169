**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible (Though potentially financially suboptimal)."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct eligibility determination**: The agent properly identified that a 15-year-old can claim Child Benefit for their own child, stating "The fact that you're 15 years old doesn't prevent you from claiming Child Benefit."

2. **Accurate criteria assessment**: The agent verified all relevant eligibility criteria:
   - Child under 16 (Mia is 6 months old) ✓
   - Lives in the UK ✓
   - Responsible for the child ✓
   - No one else claiming ✓
   - Income under £60,000 ✓

3. **Appropriate outcome communication**: The agent clearly stated "You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided next steps for application.

**Note on financial suboptimality**: While the expected outcome mentions "potentially financially suboptimal," the agent did not address this nuance. According to the scenario notes, Chloe's parents might lose Child Benefit for Chloe herself if she claims for Mia. However, the agent's primary task was to determine and communicate eligibility, which was done correctly. The agent confirmed Chloe IS eligible to claim, which matches the expected outcome.
