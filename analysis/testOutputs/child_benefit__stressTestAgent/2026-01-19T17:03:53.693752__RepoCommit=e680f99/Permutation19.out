2026-01-19T17:11:08.331894 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a series of questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-19T17:11:09.216820 [actor]: child benefit holly nine years

2026-01-19T17:11:11.160118 [root_agent]: I'll help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit for Holly who is nine years old.

To confirm, are you responsible for looking after Holly? By responsible, I mean Holly lives with you or you contribute to the cost of looking after her.

2026-01-19T17:11:11.962282 [actor]: holly lives with me and ex

2026-01-19T17:11:14.513768 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since Holly lives with both you and your ex-partner, I need to understand the living arrangement a bit better to determine eligibility.

Who would you say has the main responsibility for Holly's day-to-day care? If you and your ex share care equally, have you agreed between yourselves who should claim Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T17:11:15.582161 [actor]: holly me 3 days sue 4 days we both buy clothes food

2026-01-19T17:11:19.659916 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining the arrangement. I understand that Holly stays with you for 3 days and with Sue (your ex) for 4 days each week, and you both contribute to Holly's expenses like clothes and food.

In situations where a child spends time with both parents, only one person can receive Child Benefit for that child. Usually, Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with the most days of the week.

Since Holly spends more days with Sue (4 days) than with you (3 days), Sue would typically be considered the main carer and would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Holly.

However, if Sue doesn't want to claim, or if you both have an agreement that you should receive it instead, you could apply. But do note that if Sue is already claiming Child Benefit for Holly, you cannot also claim for the same child.

Would you like to know what steps to take next regarding your situation?

2026-01-19T17:11:20.455220 [actor]: we both sent claim hmrc

2026-01-19T17:11:23.950717 [root_agent]: I understand that both you and Sue have sent claims to HMRC for Child Benefit for Holly.

In this situation, HMRC will need to determine who should receive the Child Benefit. Since Holly spends more time with Sue (4 days versus your 3 days), HMRC will likely award the benefit to her as she appears to be the main carer based on the number of days Holly lives with her.

When two people claim for the same child, HMRC will typically:
1. Look at who the child lives with for more days per week
2. Consider who has the main responsibility for the child's care
3. May contact both parties to gather more information

If HMRC has received both claims, they should contact you to resolve the situation. You may need to provide additional information about your care arrangements.

Have you received any correspondence from HMRC about your claim yet?

2026-01-19T17:11:24.847670 [actor]: who gets the money in this case

2026-01-19T17:11:28.441313 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided about your situation with Holly, since she spends more time with Sue (4 days per week) compared to you (3 days per week), HMRC would likely determine that Sue is the main carer and award the Child Benefit payment to her.

When HMRC receives competing claims for Child Benefit for the same child, they typically award the benefit to the person who has the child living with them for more days of the week. This is because Child Benefit is generally paid to the person who has the main day-to-day responsibility for the child.

If you disagree with HMRC's decision once it's made, you would have the option to appeal and provide additional information about your care arrangements for Holly.

Would you like to know more about what factors HMRC considers when making these decisions?

2026-01-19T17:11:31.122357 [actor]: I understand that HMRC will likely give the Child Benefit to Sue since Holly stays with her 4 days compared to my 3 days. Thanks for explaining this situation.

2026-01-19T17:11:33.013748 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that when a child splits time between parents, the benefit is typically awarded to the parent the child lives with most days (in this case Sue with 4 days vs. the user with 3 days).
