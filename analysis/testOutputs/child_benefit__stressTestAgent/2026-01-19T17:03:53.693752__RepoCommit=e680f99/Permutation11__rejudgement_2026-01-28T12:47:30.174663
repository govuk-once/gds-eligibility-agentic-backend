2026-01-28T12:48:51.730053 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly told the user they were eligible for Child Benefit. According to gov.uk guidelines, an apprenticeship in England is actually a disqualifying event for Child Benefit, unlike staying in school for A-levels. The expected outcome was "Not Eligible" but the agent concluded the opposite.
