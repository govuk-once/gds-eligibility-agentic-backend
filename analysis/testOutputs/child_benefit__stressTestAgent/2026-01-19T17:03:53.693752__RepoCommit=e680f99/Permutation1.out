2026-01-19T17:03:55.382463 [root_agent]: I'll help you assess your eligibility for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to determine this.

Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T17:03:56.314237 [actor]: Manchester child benefit Leo 8 Tom teacher income

2026-01-19T17:03:57.386827 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To clarify, do you have a child named Leo who is 8 years old living with you in Manchester?

2026-01-19T17:03:58.322723 [actor]: yes child lives with us primary school

2026-01-19T17:03:59.382277 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Leo lives with you. 

Is Leo under 16 years old, or under 20 and in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:04:00.180806 [actor]: 8 years old primary school Manchester

2026-01-19T17:04:01.530410 [root_agent]: I understand that Leo is 8 years old and attending primary school in Manchester. 

Are you or your partner responsible for caring for Leo? By this I mean providing for their day-to-day needs.

2026-01-19T17:04:02.585467 [actor]: married couple Sarah Tom parents of Leo

2026-01-19T17:04:04.282049 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're part of a married couple, Sarah and Tom, who are Leo's parents.

Do either you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T17:04:05.126303 [actor]: Tom teacher £35,000 Sarah part-time £15,000

2026-01-19T17:04:08.830691 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your income details. I understand that Tom earns £35,000 as a teacher and Sarah works part-time earning £15,000.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have a child (Leo, aged 8) living with you
2. Leo is under 16 and in approved education (primary school)
3. You and your partner are responsible for Leo as his parents
4. Your individual incomes are both below £60,000 (Tom: £35,000, Sarah: £15,000)

Since your combined household income is £50,000, you should be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount without the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which only starts to reduce the benefit when an individual income exceeds £50,000.

Would you like information about how to claim Child Benefit or the current payment rates?

2026-01-19T17:04:12.481503 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the family is eligible for Child Benefit based on having a child under 16 living with them, both parents having incomes below the £60,000 threshold, and providing the correct information about the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
