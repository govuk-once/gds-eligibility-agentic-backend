The agent correctly determined eligibility for Child Benefit as Amit meets all requirements: his daughter is under 20 and in approved education, she lives with him, he's responsible for her, they live in the UK, and his income is below the £60,000 threshold. The outcome matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."
