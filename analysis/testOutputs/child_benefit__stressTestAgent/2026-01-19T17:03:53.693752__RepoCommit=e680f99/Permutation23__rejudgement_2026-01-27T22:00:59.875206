The agent incorrectly suggested the user could potentially claim Child Benefit if the mother wasn't claiming, when in fact the eligibility rules state that the person the child lives with has the primary claim, and the non-resident parent can only claim if they're paying at least the equivalent Child Benefit rate to the person caring for the child. Since the father is already providing support directly through groceries, not paying the mother, he wouldn't be eligible to claim separately.
