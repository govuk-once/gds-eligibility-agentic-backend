2026-01-19T17:04:13.709137 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To determine this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-19T17:04:15.143069 [actor]: I'll role-play as Amit, a 45-year-old single father from London with a 17-year-old daughter named Priya who is studying A-levels.

Is Priya under 20 years old and in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:04:17.472484 [actor]: yes a levels college student

2026-01-19T17:04:18.786104 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Amit. That's helpful to know.

Are you responsible for raising Priya? (This typically means you're the main person looking after her and providing for her needs.)

2026-01-19T17:04:19.618356 [actor]: single father raising daughter yes

2026-01-19T17:04:20.536448 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Amit. 

Do you normally live in the UK?

Is your, or your partner's (if you have one), individual income more than £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T17:04:23.161550 [actor]: 40k salary

2026-01-19T17:04:27.009418 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Amit.

Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have a 17-year-old daughter (Priya) who lives with you
2. Priya is under 20 years old and in approved education (A-levels)
3. You are responsible for raising her as a single father
4. You normally live in the UK (London)
5. Your income (£40,000) is below the £60,000 threshold where Child Benefit starts to be reduced

Since your income is between £50,000 and £60,000, you would receive the full Child Benefit amount.

The current rates are £24.00 per week for your first child and £15.90 for each additional child.

You can apply for Child Benefit online through the UK government website or by filling out a CH2 claim form.
