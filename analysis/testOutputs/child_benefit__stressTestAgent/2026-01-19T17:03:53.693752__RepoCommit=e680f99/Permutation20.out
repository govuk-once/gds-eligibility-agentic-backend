2026-01-19T17:11:34.609275 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility correctly, I'll need to ask you some questions one by one.

First question: Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:11:35.441444 [actor]: grandchild lives with me

2026-01-19T17:11:36.717061 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To better understand your situation with your grandchild, I need to ask: Are you legally responsible for raising this grandchild who lives with you?

2026-01-19T17:11:37.607764 [actor]: take care everything pay for school clothes food

2026-01-19T17:11:39.576845 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you're taking care of your grandchild's needs including school, clothes, and food.

To properly assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand the legal status of your arrangement. 

Could you tell me if you have any formal legal responsibility for your grandchild, such as a child arrangements order, special guardianship order, or any other legal arrangement?

2026-01-19T17:11:40.474639 [actor]: no papers family arrangement parents cannot care

2026-01-19T17:11:43.200185 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. I understand this is an informal family arrangement where you're caring for your grandchild because the parents cannot provide care.

For Child Benefit purposes, even without formal legal documentation, you may still be considered responsible for the child if you're the person who has the main responsibility for raising them and providing for their daily needs - which sounds like your situation.

Would you say you have the main day-to-day responsibility for raising your grandchild, while the parents are not substantially involved in their care?

2026-01-19T17:11:44.220688 [actor]: yes i do everything grandchild 14 years old

2026-01-19T17:11:46.294229 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you have full day-to-day responsibility for your 14-year-old grandchild. This is important information for determining Child Benefit eligibility.

Since you're providing all the care for your grandchild who is under 16 years old and living with you, you may indeed be eligible for Child Benefit, even without formal legal documentation.

Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for this grandchild, such as either of the parents?

2026-01-19T17:11:47.151015 [actor]: nobody claims money parents not involved

2026-01-19T17:11:50.393300 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that nobody is currently claiming Child Benefit for your grandchild and that the parents are not involved.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your 14-year-old grandchild since:

1. The child is under 16 years old
2. The child lives with you
3. You have day-to-day responsibility for raising the child
4. You provide for their needs (food, clothing, school expenses)
5. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for them

One more question to complete my assessment: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T17:11:51.254456 [actor]: pension only not rich

2026-01-19T17:11:55.425599 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your income situation. Since you're on a pension and have indicated your income is not high, this suggests you're likely below the income threshold that would affect Child Benefit eligibility.

Based on all the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your 14-year-old grandchild because:

1. The child is under 16 years old
2. The child lives with you
3. You have full day-to-day responsibility for raising the child
4. You provide for their needs (food, clothing, school expenses)
5. No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for them
6. Your income appears to be below the threshold that would reduce Child Benefit

To claim Child Benefit, you would need to complete form CH2, which you can do online or by post. You may need to provide additional information about why the child lives with you rather than their parents.

Would you like information about how to make a claim for Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T17:11:59.013889 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly established that a grandparent with day-to-day responsibility for a 14-year-old grandchild living with them is eligible for Child Benefit, even without formal legal documentation.
