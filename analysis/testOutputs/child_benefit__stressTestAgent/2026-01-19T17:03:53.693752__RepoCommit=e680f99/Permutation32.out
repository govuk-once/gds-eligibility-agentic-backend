2026-01-19T17:19:02.730484 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your situation.

Do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T17:19:03.419329 [actor]: child lives with me

2026-01-19T17:19:04.600280 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's a good start for determining your eligibility.

Do you currently live in the UK?

2026-01-19T17:19:05.337627 [actor]: UK yes

2026-01-19T17:19:06.333659 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know.

How old is the child who lives with you?

2026-01-19T17:19:07.083665 [actor]: john 17

2026-01-19T17:19:08.499508 [root_agent]: I understand that John is 17 years old. Thank you for sharing that.

Is John in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:19:09.268098 [actor]: college 

2026-01-19T17:19:10.284784 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Is John studying full-time at college (for at least 12 hours a week)?

2026-01-19T17:19:11.087144 [actor]: 6 hours resit gcse

2026-01-19T17:19:14.461064 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, John is studying 6 hours a week for GCSE resits. To clarify my understanding about the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit in this situation:

Child Benefit can typically be paid for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. For education to be considered "approved," it generally needs to be full-time, which is usually defined as more than 12 hours per week of supervised study.

Since John is 17 and studying for 6 hours per week, this would likely not meet the criteria for approved education under Child Benefit rules.

May I ask if John has any special circumstances or if there are any other children you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T17:19:15.331974 [actor]: gaming at home

2026-01-19T17:19:19.164194 [root_agent]: I understand John is 17, studying GCSE resits for 6 hours per week, and spending the rest of his time gaming at home.

Based on the information you've provided, it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for John because:

1. John is over 16 years old
2. He is not in what would be considered approved full-time education (which typically requires at least 12 hours of supervised study per week)
3. The gaming at home would not count as approved education or training

Child Benefit is generally available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved full-time education or training. Since John's current situation doesn't meet these requirements, you would likely not qualify for Child Benefit.

If John's circumstances change - for example, if he increases his study hours to at least 12 hours per week in approved education - you might become eligible again.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available?

2026-01-19T17:19:22.562962 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly identified that since John is 17 and only studying 6 hours per week (less than the required 12 hours for approved education), the user would not be eligible for Child Benefit.
