2026-01-28T12:47:57.419248 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that Jenny is eligible for Child Benefit, when according to the expected outcome she should be "Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)." The agent failed to apply the "Linking Rule" which states that when a child returns to hospital within 28 days (Arthur returned after 15 days), the hospital stays are linked and count cumulatively toward the 12-week limit. Arthur has been in hospital for a total of 13 weeks (10+3), exceeding the 12-week limit, which should make Jenny ineligible.
