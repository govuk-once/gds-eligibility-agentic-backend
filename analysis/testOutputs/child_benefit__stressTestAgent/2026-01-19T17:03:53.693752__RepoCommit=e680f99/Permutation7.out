2026-01-19T17:06:45.665130 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T17:06:46.639701 [actor]: child son David care weekends

2026-01-19T17:06:47.672741 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you care for your son David on weekends. 

How old is your son David?

2026-01-19T17:06:48.887511 [actor]: Jack 14 authority care 3 months weekends with me

2026-01-19T17:06:51.356482 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand that your son Jack is 14 years old and has been in authority care for 3 months, but spends weekends with you.

For a child who is in local authority care, Child Benefit eligibility depends on certain factors. Since Jack spends weekends with you, I need to understand a bit more about the arrangement.

Does the local authority provide any financial support or allowance to you for Jack's care during the weekends?

2026-01-19T17:06:52.407066 [actor]: No payments from them. Friday evening until Sunday evening every week.

2026-01-19T17:06:55.983338 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that Jack is 14, in local authority care, spends weekends with you from Friday evening to Sunday evening each week, and you receive no payments from the local authority.

Based on UK Child Benefit rules, if a child is in local authority care, the situation is specific:

Generally, you cannot receive Child Benefit for a child who is being looked after by a local authority for more than 8 weeks. However, if you're still contributing financially to your child's upkeep and the child regularly spends time with you (as in your case with weekends), you might be eligible for what's called a "continued payment" of Child Benefit.

Do you make any financial contributions to Jack's maintenance or upkeep beyond the weekends he spends with you?

2026-01-19T17:06:56.984014 [actor]: Buy clothes food weekend own money

2026-01-19T17:06:59.244085 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you're using your own money to buy clothes and food for Jack during the weekends he stays with you.

Since Jack is in local authority care but regularly spends weekends with you, and you're contributing financially to his upkeep through providing clothes and food, you may be eligible for a continued payment of Child Benefit.

To determine this definitively, I need to understand one more thing: Was Jack living with you before going into local authority care, and were you receiving Child Benefit for him at that time?

2026-01-19T17:07:00.098260 [actor]: Yes lived with me before. Receiving child benefit then.

2026-01-19T17:07:04.370718 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Jack lived with you before going into local authority care and that you were receiving Child Benefit for him at that time.

Based on this information, you may be eligible for continued Child Benefit payments. When a child goes into local authority care, Child Benefit usually stops after 8 weeks. However, since you:

1. Were receiving Child Benefit before Jack went into care
2. Have Jack staying with you regularly (every weekend)
3. Continue to contribute financially to his upkeep (clothes and food)

You should contact the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible to inform them about Jack's current situation. They can assess your specific case and may continue payments at a weekly rate of £1.00 for the periods when Jack is with you.

You'll need to keep the Child Benefit Office updated about any changes in circumstances, such as if the frequency of Jack's visits changes or if his care situation changes.

Would you like me to explain what steps you should take to contact the Child Benefit Office?

2026-01-19T17:07:08.359236 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that when a child is in local authority care but regularly spends time with a parent who contributes to their upkeep, continued Child Benefit payments (at a reduced rate) may be available, especially when the parent was receiving Child Benefit before the child went into care.
