2026-01-27T22:01:02.164166 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent gave incorrect information. Child Benefit is not available for children in "advanced education" such as university degree courses. University education is considered "advanced education" not "approved education" under the eligibility rules, making the daughter ineligible.
