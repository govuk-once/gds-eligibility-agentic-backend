2026-01-27T22:02:14.858295 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The expected outcome was "Eligible" but the agent incorrectly determined the user is not eligible. According to gov.uk guidance, a non-resident parent who contributes more than the Child Benefit amount to the child's upkeep (which the user does at £150/month) can be eligible when the resident parent is not claiming.
