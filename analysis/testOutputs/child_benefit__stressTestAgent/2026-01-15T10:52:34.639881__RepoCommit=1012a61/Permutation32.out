2026-01-15T11:02:22.843556 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:02:23.833309 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

First, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-15T11:02:24.647123 [actor]: pete son john 17

2026-01-15T11:02:25.718058 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know your son, John, is 17. That's helpful.

Now, is John currently in approved education? This means is he in full-time education or approved training?

2026-01-15T11:02:26.632883 [actor]: college part time gcses

2026-01-15T11:02:27.847895 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. So John is attending college part-time to re-sit his GCSEs.

To clarify, roughly how many hours a week does John spend in supervised study or tuition at college? This includes time with a teacher or instructor.

2026-01-15T11:02:28.591289 [actor]: 6 hours

2026-01-15T11:02:30.468158 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that John has 6 hours of supervised study a week. 

According to the rules, to be considered in approved education and potentially eligible for Child Benefit, a course needs to involve more than 12 hours a week of supervised study. As John's course is 6 hours, this unfortunately doesn’t meet that requirement.

Is John living with you, Pete, the majority of the time?

2026-01-15T11:02:31.162551 [actor]: at home gaming

2026-01-15T11:02:32.390108 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So John is living at home with you. 

Just to confirm, does John contribute financially to the household in any way? For example, does he have a job and use his earnings to help with household expenses?

2026-01-15T11:02:33.266434 [actor]: no job gaming all day

2026-01-15T11:02:36.522770 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that John doesn’t have a job and spends most of his time gaming.

Based on the information you've provided: John is 17, attends college part-time (less than 12 hours of supervised study per week), and lives at home with you without contributing financially.

Unfortunately, under these circumstances, you are likely **not** eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for John. Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 16, unless they are in approved education. As his course doesn’t meet the full-time education criteria, he wouldn’t be eligible beyond 16.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, or would you like me to clarify anything?





2026-01-15T11:02:40.152348 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that 6 hours of supervised study per week doesn't meet the minimum requirement of 12 hours needed for approved education, making John ineligible for Child Benefit.
