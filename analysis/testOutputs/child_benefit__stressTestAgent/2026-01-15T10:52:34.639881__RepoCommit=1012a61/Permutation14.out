2026-01-15T10:56:23.071471 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:56:23.913179 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you assess your eligibility for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T10:56:24.659570 [actor]: 28 years old

2026-01-15T10:56:25.174631 [root_agent]: Thank you. And do you have any children?





2026-01-15T10:56:25.991857 [actor]: son Noah 6 years old

2026-01-15T10:56:26.778068 [root_agent]: Thank you. Currently, where does your son, Noah, primarily live? (i.e., with you, with another family member, etc.)





2026-01-15T10:56:27.542969 [actor]: grandma house now surgery recovery

2026-01-15T10:56:28.333863 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Just to clarify, is Noah living with his grandmother due to your recent surgery and recovery?





2026-01-15T10:56:29.103943 [actor]: yes temporary 6 weeks

2026-01-15T10:56:29.736249 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Has anyone else claimed Child Benefit for Noah while he has been living with his grandmother?

2026-01-15T10:56:30.580331 [actor]: no grandmother not claimed

2026-01-15T10:56:31.464744 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. And just to be certain, how long has Noah been living with his grandmother? Approximately how many weeks has it been?

2026-01-15T10:56:32.323208 [actor]: 6 weeks recovery time

2026-01-15T10:56:34.731510 [root_agent]: Thank you. Based on the information you've provided, you are likely still eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state you can usually continue to receive it for up to 8 weeks while your child is living with someone else, *as long as* no one else is claiming for them. Since it has only been 6 weeks and his grandmother isn’t claiming, you should continue to be eligible.

However, I'm not a financial advisor and this isn't definitive advice. Would you like me to confirm anything further, or would you like to move on?





2026-01-15T10:56:38.110651 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Sophie remains eligible for Child Benefit since Noah has been away for only 6 weeks (less than the 8-week threshold) and the grandmother has not made a claim.
