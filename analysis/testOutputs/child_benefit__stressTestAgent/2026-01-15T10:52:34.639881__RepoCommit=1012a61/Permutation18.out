2026-01-15T10:57:41.740406 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:57:42.660590 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


2026-01-15T10:57:43.543676 [actor]: im 50 raj

2026-01-15T10:57:44.511783 [root_agent]: Thank you, Raj. That's helpful.

Now, are you claiming Child Benefit for a child? If so, could you please tell me how old *the child* is?

2026-01-15T10:57:45.472812 [actor]: dev 20 student full time

2026-01-15T10:57:46.668447 [root_agent]: Thank you, Raj. So Dev is 20 years old and a full-time student. 

Just to clarify, did Dev turn 20 *before* starting his current full-time education, or *during* it?





2026-01-15T10:57:47.561482 [actor]: turned 20 this term during a levels

2026-01-15T10:57:50.132510 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that Dev turned 20 during his A-level studies this term.

According to the rules, Child Benefit usually stops when a child turns 20, even if they are still in full-time education. However, there is an exception if they started their course before they turned 20.

Given that Dev turned 20 *during* his A-level course, it seems you may no longer be eligible for Child Benefit. However, I want to be certain.

To confirm, was Dev already studying his A-levels *before* he turned 20?

2026-01-15T10:57:50.953870 [actor]: yes studying before birthday

2026-01-15T10:57:52.792630 [root_agent]: Thank you, Raj. That’s very helpful.

Since Dev was already studying his A-levels *before* his 20th birthday, you *are* still eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for him, as long as he continues to meet the requirements for full-time education. It doesn't matter that he turned 20 during the course.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-15T10:57:56.114345 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. Once a child turns 20, they are no longer eligible for Child Benefit, even if they were in approved education before their 20th birthday.
