2026-01-15T11:03:55.133068 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:03:55.996744 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, do you live with the child you are claiming for?


2026-01-15T11:03:56.682586 [actor]: yes living with child

2026-01-15T11:03:57.500645 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. 

To clarify, are you financially responsible for the care of this child? In other words, are you providing the financial support for them?

2026-01-15T11:03:58.370437 [actor]: supporting nina since mothers illness private arrangement

2026-01-15T11:03:59.128801 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to be certain, is the local council paying for Nina’s accommodation as part of this private arrangement?

2026-01-15T11:03:59.967231 [actor]: no council not paying private fostering arrangement

2026-01-15T11:04:01.918344 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. 

Based on what you've told me – that you are financially supporting Nina, she lives with you, and this is a private fostering arrangement with the council not contributing financially – you *are* likely eligible to claim Child Benefit. Private fosterers can claim Child Benefit, unlike those receiving a fostering allowance from the council.

Would you like me to summarise this, or do you have any other questions?





2026-01-15T11:04:02.998861 [actor]: thanks for help understand eligibility

2026-01-15T11:04:05.323782 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility because private fosterers who financially support a child living with them under a private arrangement (not funded by the council) are eligible for Child Benefit.
