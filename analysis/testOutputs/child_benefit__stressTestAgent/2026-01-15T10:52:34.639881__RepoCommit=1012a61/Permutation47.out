2026-01-15T11:07:06.691540 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:07:07.646130 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-15T11:07:08.458217 [actor]: old enough to have a kid

2026-01-15T11:07:09.233960 [root_agent]: Okay, good to know you're of an age where you could have a child! 

Now, is the child living with you?

2026-01-15T11:07:10.063990 [actor]: pays maintenance order court

2026-01-15T11:07:11.004107 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So, you are making maintenance payments because of a court order. 

To clarify, does the child live with the other parent, or someone else?

2026-01-15T11:07:11.717977 [actor]: child with mother

2026-01-15T11:07:12.633089 [root_agent]: Okay, so the child lives with their mother.

And just to confirm, the court order requires you to pay £50 a week in maintenance? Is that correct?

2026-01-15T11:07:13.385756 [actor]: correct maintenance payment weekly

2026-01-15T11:07:14.154051 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming. 

Now, are you married to, or in a civil partnership with, the child’s mother?

2026-01-15T11:07:14.824834 [actor]: not married separated

2026-01-15T11:07:16.219689 [root_agent]: Okay, you are separated and not married to the child’s mother.

Just to be absolutely sure I understand the situation correctly - are you contributing towards the child’s maintenance *solely* because of the court order, or are you providing any additional financial support voluntarily?

2026-01-15T11:07:17.032150 [actor]: just court order payment

2026-01-15T11:07:19.942948 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that the payments are solely due to the court order.

Based on the information you've provided so far – that the child lives with their mother, you are making maintenance payments due to a court order, and you are separated and not married – you *are* likely to be eligible for Child Benefit, as long as you meet the other eligibility requirements such as being responsible for the child. The fact that the payments are mandated by a court order doesn't disqualify you.

To be certain, could you please tell me your National Insurance number? (You can tell me if you’d prefer not to share this, and we can proceed without it, but it helps to confirm eligibility).

2026-01-15T11:07:22.230922 [actor]: Thank you for the information. I don't want to share my national insurance number. So I am eligible even though the payments are court ordered?

2026-01-15T11:07:24.147669 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent is incorrect because a person paying child maintenance through a court order but not otherwise caring for the child is not eligible for Child Benefit - only the person with whom the child lives (the mother in this case) would be eligible.
