2026-01-15T11:04:06.026055 [actor]: am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:04:07.010885 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old your child is?


2026-01-15T11:04:07.705118 [actor]: baby 4 months

2026-01-15T11:04:08.479889 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your baby is 4 months old.

To confirm, are you the parent or legal guardian of this child?

2026-01-15T11:04:09.311721 [actor]: yes have baby

2026-01-15T11:04:09.838637 [root_agent]: Great. And just to clarify, are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-15T11:04:10.695388 [actor]: uk yes

2026-01-15T11:04:11.738560 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you. 

Do you have parental responsibility for the child? Parental responsibility means all the rights, duties, powers, responsibilities and authority that a parent has for a child and their property.

2026-01-15T11:04:12.483225 [actor]: yes parent

2026-01-15T11:04:13.413387 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming.

To help me understand your situation better, are you working, or are you currently not working? (Even part-time work counts as working).

2026-01-15T11:04:14.109103 [actor]: working job

2026-01-15T11:04:15.021717 [root_agent]: Okay, you have a job. 

Roughly, what is your annual income before tax? (An approximate figure is fine). This helps determine if your income affects eligibility.

2026-01-15T11:04:15.820579 [actor]: £55000

2026-01-15T11:04:17.035341 [root_agent]: Thank you. £55,000 is helpful to know.

Now, regarding the child's other parent - are they also involved in the child's upbringing, and do they live at the same address as you and the child?

2026-01-15T11:04:17.712755 [actor]: yes partner here

2026-01-15T11:04:18.771586 [root_agent]: Okay, so your partner is also involved in the child’s upbringing and lives at the same address.

Just to be clear, is either you or your partner receiving any other benefits, such as Universal Credit?

2026-01-15T11:04:19.495794 [actor]: no

2026-01-15T11:04:21.116020 [root_agent]: Okay, neither of you are currently receiving Universal Credit or any other benefits.

You mentioned having a baby 4 months ago and only applying for Child Benefit today. I understand you’re wondering if you can claim for those previous months. 

To confirm, you are aware that Child Benefit can be backdated, but would like to know the limit?

2026-01-15T11:04:22.039527 [actor]: forgot to apply can I get money

2026-01-15T11:04:23.476871 [root_agent]: Yes, you can claim for those previous months, but Child Benefit can only be backdated up to a maximum of 3 months. 

So, you will be able to claim for the last 3 months, but unfortunately not the full 4 months since you are applying now. Does that make sense?

2026-01-15T11:04:24.203551 [actor]: yes understand

2026-01-15T11:04:26.590748 [root_agent]: Wonderful! I'm glad that's clear.

Based on the information you've provided – that you're the parent, living in the UK, earning £55,000, and your partner also lives with you and the child – you *are* eligible for Child Benefit, although you can only backdate the claim for 3 months.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or perhaps any other questions you have?

2026-01-15T11:04:29.940295 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly explained that Child Benefit can only be backdated up to 3 months, which matches the criteria that backdating is limited to 3 months.
