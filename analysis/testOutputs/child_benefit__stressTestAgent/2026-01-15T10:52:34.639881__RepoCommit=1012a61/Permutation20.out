2026-01-15T10:58:14.438723 [actor]: I'll help by roleplaying as Maria in this scenario.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T10:58:15.294829 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-15T10:58:16.142331 [actor]: 60 years old looking after granddaughter

2026-01-15T10:58:17.201000 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you are 60 years old.

Now, could you please tell me, does Lucia, your granddaughter, live with you full-time?

2026-01-15T10:58:18.250771 [actor]: yes she stays with me all the time parents can't look after her

2026-01-15T10:58:19.493577 [root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. It sounds like Lucia lives with you permanently.

My understanding is that you are looking after your granddaughter because her parents are unable to care for her. Do her parents contribute financially to Lucia’s care at all?

2026-01-15T10:58:20.443459 [actor]: no financial help from parents i pay everything

2026-01-15T10:58:21.768575 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. So, you cover all the costs associated with Lucia's care.

Is there a formal arrangement in place with the local council for Lucia’s care, such as a fostering agreement, or is this a private arrangement between you and Lucia’s parents?

2026-01-15T10:58:22.808978 [actor]: private family arrangement no council involved

2026-01-15T10:58:23.884363 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that this is a private family arrangement and the council isn’t involved. 

Just to be absolutely sure, is the local council paying for any of Lucia’s accommodation or care?

2026-01-15T10:58:24.684479 [actor]: no council money no formal arrangement

2026-01-15T10:58:27.284778 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that the council isn't providing any financial support and there’s no formal arrangement in place.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it *appears* you may be eligible for Child Benefit as an informal carer. However, I need to be certain.

To confirm, you said you are looking after your granddaughter because her parents are unable to care for her. Are you Lucia's legal guardian, or is this an informal arrangement? (I understand you've said it's informal, but I just want to be absolutely clear for the rules).

2026-01-15T10:58:28.181220 [actor]: informal nobody signed papers she just lives with me

2026-01-15T10:58:32.415110 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that it’s an informal arrangement with no legal paperwork in place.

Based on everything you've told me – you are 60 years old, Lucia lives with you full-time, her parents don't contribute financially, the local council isn’t involved, and there’s no formal legal arrangement – it seems likely you *are* eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucia.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. I strongly recommend you review the information at [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility) and [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else) to be absolutely sure, or contact the Child Benefit helpline directly to discuss your specific circumstances.



Do you have any other questions I can help with?

2026-01-15T10:58:36.121849 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that Maria is eligible for Child Benefit because she has an informal arrangement to look after her granddaughter, provides full financial support, and the local council is not involved in the arrangement.
