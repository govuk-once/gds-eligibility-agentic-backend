2026-01-15T11:02:41.765408 [actor]: I'll help you test the agent by roleplaying as Bella's mother seeking child benefit information. I'll be obtuse, answer indirectly, and speak in search-engine style responses as instructed.

am i eligible for child benefit

2026-01-15T11:02:43.139169 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (I need to know your age, not the age of the child the benefit would be for).





2026-01-15T11:02:44.027302 [actor]: age 42 mother single parent

2026-01-15T11:02:44.967730 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you are 42 and a single parent.

Now, to understand the situation better - is the child you would be claiming for living with you?

2026-01-15T11:02:46.014774 [actor]: daughter bella lives with me yes house together

2026-01-15T11:02:46.693795 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming that your daughter, Bella, lives with you. 

Is Bella currently in full-time education?

2026-01-15T11:02:47.500573 [actor]: bella training travel agent course

2026-01-15T11:02:48.232548 [root_agent]: Okay, Bella is in a training course to become a travel agent. 

Is this training course a government-approved apprenticeship?

2026-01-15T11:02:49.214368 [actor]: not government travel agency pays course employed there

2026-01-15T11:02:50.461321 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So the travel agency is paying for Bella’s training course, and she is employed by them.

Just to be absolutely sure I have this right, is the training course a requirement of her job with the travel agency?

2026-01-15T11:02:51.379027 [actor]: yes training job travel agency they pay everything

2026-01-15T11:02:54.211443 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that the training is a requirement of her job and the travel agency pays for everything.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it seems you might *not* be eligible for Child Benefit for Bella. This is because the rules state that education is only 'approved' for Child Benefit purposes if it’s not funded by an employer. As the travel agency is paying for Bella’s training as part of her employment, it unfortunately doesn’t meet the criteria for ‘approved education’.

Would you like me to explain this in a bit more detail, or would you like me to double-check any of the information we've gone through?





2026-01-15T11:02:55.380723 [actor]: not eligible then ok

2026-01-15T11:02:57.680357 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that the mother isn't eligible for Child Benefit since Bella's training is employer-funded, which doesn't qualify as "approved education" under Child Benefit rules.
