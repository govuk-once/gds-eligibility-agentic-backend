2026-01-16T13:23:44.989048 [root_agent]: Hello! I can certainly help you explore whether you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are eligible as the person claiming, not the child).

2026-01-16T13:23:46.031643 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Emily college HNC 18

2026-01-16T13:23:47.311332 [root_agent]: Thank you, Emily. Just to clarify, your age is 18.

Now, are you currently responsible for a child under 16? (This includes biological, adopted, step, foster, or other children living with you).

2026-01-16T13:23:48.181637 [actor]: I am Emily no kids studying HNC at college

2026-01-16T13:23:50.800035 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming, Emily. So you are 18, studying for an HNC at college, and currently do not have any children under 16.

Based on this information, you are **not currently eligible** to claim Child Benefit. Child Benefit is paid to people responsible for a child under 16. 

However, if you *do* have a child in the future, or become responsible for one, your eligibility would then need reassessing.

Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information about other benefits you *might* be eligible for as a student?

2026-01-16T13:23:53.993734 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly informed the user that they are not eligible for Child Benefit since they are 18 with no children under 16.
