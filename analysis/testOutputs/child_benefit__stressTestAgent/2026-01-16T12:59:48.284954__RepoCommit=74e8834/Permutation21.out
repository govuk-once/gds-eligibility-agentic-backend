2026-01-16T13:09:44.766941 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-16T13:09:45.903377 [actor]: I'll help by role-playing as a user seeking child benefit information.

child benefit eligibility check

2026-01-16T13:09:47.026318 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you are role-playing as the person applying for Child Benefit. That’s helpful!

To begin assessing your eligibility, could you please tell me how old you are?

2026-01-16T13:09:47.805687 [actor]: age 41

2026-01-16T13:09:48.982458 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's good to know.

Now, could you tell me, are you responsible for a child who is under 16 years old? (This includes biological, adopted, step-children, and other children living with you).

2026-01-16T13:09:49.918055 [actor]: yes robert has sam i have ella after divorce

2026-01-16T13:09:50.805736 [root_agent]: Okay, so you have a child named Ella. That’s good to know.

To clarify, is Ella under 16 years old?

2026-01-16T13:09:51.551205 [actor]: ella 8

2026-01-16T13:09:52.531317 [root_agent]: Excellent, Ella is 8 years old, which means she meets the age requirement.

Now, are you living with Ella, or does she live primarily with someone else?

2026-01-16T13:09:53.270184 [actor]: ella lives with me

2026-01-16T13:09:54.384696 [root_agent]: Great. Ella living with you is an important factor.

Next question: Are you working, or do you have any income? (Even a small amount of income is relevant for Child Benefit eligibility).

2026-01-16T13:09:55.358354 [actor]: part time shop work

2026-01-16T13:09:56.563933 [root_agent]: Okay, you work part-time in a shop. That’s useful information.

To help me understand your situation fully, approximately how much do you earn per week *before* tax and any other deductions? (An estimate is fine).

2026-01-16T13:09:57.545000 [actor]: 300 pounds weekly

2026-01-16T13:09:58.760905 [root_agent]: Thank you. £300 per week before tax is helpful to know. 

Now, considering your income, are you, or is your partner (if you have one), claiming any other benefits? (For example, Universal Credit, Income Support, etc.)

2026-01-16T13:09:59.443416 [actor]: no benefits

2026-01-16T13:10:00.560070 [root_agent]: Okay, you're not claiming any other benefits. That simplifies things.

Finally, are you a British citizen, or do you have the right of residence in the UK? (This is related to your immigration status).

2026-01-16T13:10:01.248282 [actor]: uk citizen

2026-01-16T13:10:04.728578 [root_agent]: Okay, you are a UK citizen.

Based on the information you've provided:

*   You are over 16.
*   You have a child (Ella) who is under 16 and lives with you.
*   You have an income of £300 per week, but are not claiming any other benefits.
*   You are a UK citizen.

Currently, there is *no* income limit to claim Child Benefit. Therefore, based on this information, you **are likely eligible** to claim Child Benefit for Ella.

However, please remember I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. It’s always best to double-check directly with the government to ensure your specific circumstances are covered. Would you like me to summarise the key eligibility points again?

2026-01-16T13:10:08.060721 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that the person is eligible for Child Benefit for their 8-year-old child Ella who lives with them, correctly noting there is no income limit for claiming Child Benefit.
