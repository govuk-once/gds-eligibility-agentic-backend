2026-01-16T13:20:59.330499 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? Child Benefit eligibility depends on your age, as well as other factors.



**My thought process:**

I've started with a basic question to determine if the claimant is old enough to *receive* Child Benefit. The rules state you must be responsible for a child to claim, and the claimant's age is relevant to that. I'm being polite and setting the stage for further questions. I am adhering to the rule of asking only one question at a time.





2026-01-16T13:21:01.052608 [actor]: I need to role-play as a user in the given scenario about Leo, who is 12 and in local authority care but visits home weekly.

my child is 12 years old

2026-01-16T13:21:05.176244 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know your child is 12 years old. That's helpful!

Now, to understand your situation a little better, could you please tell me what your relationship is to the 12-year-old child? For example, are you the child's parent, guardian, or another family member?



**My thought process:**

The user has provided information about the child's age. This confirms they are within the eligible age range (under 20). However, the context provided indicates the child is in local authority care, which introduces a different set of rules. I need to establish the claimant’s relationship to the child to determine eligibility, referencing the guidance on children living with someone else ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else)). I'm asking one question at a time and remaining polite.

2026-01-16T13:21:05.968700 [actor]: mother of leo

2026-01-16T13:21:09.629560 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you are Leo's mother. That's very helpful.

I understand Leo is 12 and currently in local authority care, but visits home weekly. To clarify, are you currently receiving any financial support from the local authority for Leo’s care?



**My thought process:**

I now know the claimant is the mother. Given the context of Leo being in local authority care with weekly visits home, I need to understand if the mother is receiving financial support *from the local authority for his care*. This is important because receiving such support can affect Child Benefit eligibility, as outlined in the guidance ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else)). I am sticking to one question at a time.

2026-01-16T13:21:10.960965 [actor]: local authority pays for care

2026-01-16T13:21:14.321188 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that the local authority pays for Leo’s care.

In this situation, are you also receiving any other benefits for Leo, such as Universal Credit or Housing Benefit?



**My thought process:**

The local authority paying for Leo’s care is a key piece of information. According to the guidance ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else)), if the local authority is paying for a child’s care, Child Benefit may be affected, and other benefits received by the parent need to be considered. I'm asking about other benefits to get a complete picture, maintaining the one-question-at-a-time approach.

2026-01-16T13:21:15.007396 [actor]: no other benefits

2026-01-16T13:21:17.864542 [root_agent]: Thank you. Just to be absolutely sure, when Leo is at home for his weekly visits, do you provide the main financial support for him during those visits – for example, for his food, clothes, and pocket money?



**My thought process:**

The claimant doesn't receive other benefits. This simplifies the assessment slightly. However, it's crucial to determine the level of financial responsibility the mother has for Leo *during the times he is at home*. The guidance focuses on who is “responsible” for the child, and financial support is a key element of that. I'm focusing on the specifics of the weekly visits, adhering to the rules.

2026-01-16T13:21:18.648840 [actor]: yes i buy food and clothes

2026-01-16T13:21:24.229087 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you buy food and clothes for Leo during his weekly visits home.

Considering all the information you've provided – Leo is 12, in local authority care, visits home weekly, the local authority pays for his care, and you financially support him during visits with food and clothes – it’s likely you **would not** be eligible for Child Benefit. 

This is because the local authority is primarily responsible for Leo's care, and providing financial support for him. The rules state that if the local authority is paying for a child’s care, you generally can’t claim Child Benefit.

Would you like me to summarise the reasons for this conclusion?



**My thought process:**

Based on the information gathered, and specifically referencing the guidance ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else)), the local authority’s financial responsibility for Leo's care overrides the mother’s financial contributions during visits. I've provided a clear, direct answer, and offered a summary for clarity. I'm phrasing it as "likely" as a cautious approach, acknowledging that my assessment is based on the information provided. I’m also offering to summarise, which is helpful and polite.

2026-01-16T13:21:25.947317 [actor]: i spend 25 hours with leo on weekends

2026-01-16T13:21:31.472258 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know you spend 25 hours with Leo on weekends. That’s a significant amount of time.

Given this additional information about the amount of time you spend with Leo, and your continued financial support during those visits, it *might* be possible to argue for eligibility. However, it's a complex situation and HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs) would make the final decision. 

To be clear, the fact the local authority pays for Leo’s care is a strong factor against eligibility, but the amount of time you spend with him and your financial contributions are factors that could be considered.

Would you like me to summarise the situation and the potential arguments for and against eligibility?



**My thought process:**

The user has introduced a new and important detail: the substantial amount of time spent with Leo. This changes the assessment, as "responsible person" isn’t solely based on financial contribution, but also on the level of care provided. While the local authority funding remains a significant hurdle, the 25 hours of weekend time *could* strengthen a claim. I'm being cautious and acknowledging the complexity, while still referring back to the core issue of local authority funding. I’m offering a summary to provide clarity. It's important to note I cannot *guarantee* eligibility, and the final decision rests with HMRC.

2026-01-16T13:21:33.035637 [actor]: visits saturday 10am until sunday 11am care for more than 8 weeks

2026-01-16T13:21:38.780110 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming the consistent weekend visit schedule and that this has been happening for more than 8 weeks.

Considering all the information – the local authority funding Leo’s care, your consistent 25-hour weekend visits, your financial contributions during those visits, and the duration of this arrangement – it's becoming more likely that you *could* be eligible for Child Benefit.

The reason is that the consistent, substantial time you spend caring for Leo, coupled with your financial support, could be argued as demonstrating that you share responsibility for his upbringing. However, HMRC will ultimately decide if this outweighs the local authority’s financial contribution. It would be a case of demonstrating that you are taking on a significant role in Leo’s care *in addition* to the local authority’s provision.

Would you like me to summarise the key points and suggest what information you might need when applying to HMRC?



**My thought process:**

The duration of the arrangement (more than 8 weeks) strengthens the argument for shared responsibility. A consistent weekend schedule is a strong demonstration of ongoing care. While the local authority still provides financial support, the significant and regular time commitment from the mother now provides a potentially viable counterargument, referencing the concept of “responsible person”. I’m maintaining a cautious tone, highlighting that HMRC have the final say, but acknowledging increased potential eligibility. Offering to summarise and provide application advice is helpful and within my scope as a helpful assistant.

2026-01-16T13:21:42.690802 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly analyzed that with a child in local authority care who visits home weekly, with regular 25-hour visits over more than 8 weeks, there is potential eligibility for Child Benefit despite local authority funding.
