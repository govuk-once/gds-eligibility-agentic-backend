The agent correctly determined that Lucas is eligible for Child Benefit, explained that his wife Emily (the higher earner at £65,000) would be responsible for paying the High Income Child Benefit Charge, and clearly outlined both payment options. This matches the expected outcome that Lucas can receive the benefit while Emily pays the tax.
