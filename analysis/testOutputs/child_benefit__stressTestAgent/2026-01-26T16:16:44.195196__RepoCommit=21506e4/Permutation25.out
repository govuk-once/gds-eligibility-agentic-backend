2026-01-26T16:26:39.340118 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your situation.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:26:40.279208 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Leo who is 5 years old.

2026-01-26T16:26:41.596639 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about Leo. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please tell me if Leo normally lives with you?

2026-01-26T16:26:42.656738 [actor]: Well, Leo is currently in local authority care. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-26T16:26:44.330468 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing this information. I understand Leo is currently in local authority care for about 10 weeks.

Child Benefit rules are specific regarding children in care. Could you tell me if you were receiving Child Benefit for Leo before he went into local authority care?

2026-01-26T16:26:45.142587 [actor]: Yes, I was receiving Child Benefit for Leo before he went into local authority care.

2026-01-26T16:26:47.606527 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you've shared, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit for Leo even though he is currently in local authority care.

When a child goes into care temporarily, you can usually keep receiving Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks from when they entered care. Since Leo has been in care for about 10 weeks, you should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit at this time.

May I ask if you expect Leo to return to live with you after his time in care?

2026-01-26T16:26:48.862734 [actor]: I'm not sure exactly when Leo will come back home. It depends on my situation improving.

2026-01-26T16:26:52.335083 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that the timeline for Leo's return is uncertain and depends on your situation improving.

For Child Benefit purposes, if there's an expectation that Leo will eventually return to your care, you can typically continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks while he is in local authority care. Since Leo has been in care for about 10 weeks, you are still within this period.

If Leo stays in care beyond 12 weeks, your Child Benefit would normally stop. However, it's important to note that once Leo does return to live with you, you can claim Child Benefit again.

Would you like me to explain what steps you should take regarding your Child Benefit claim given your current situation?

2026-01-26T16:26:54.097004 [actor]: Yes, please. Also, I should mention that while I don't have any income to contribute to Leo's upkeep, my husband (Leo's stepfather) who lives with me does send £30 a week to the carer for Leo.

2026-01-26T16:26:59.488618 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing this additional information. Let me explain what steps you should take regarding your Child Benefit claim:

1. Since Leo has been in care for less than 12 weeks, you can continue receiving Child Benefit for now. However, you should notify the Child Benefit Office about Leo's current situation if you haven't already done so.

2. The fact that your husband is contributing £30 a week toward Leo's upkeep is positive, as it shows continued financial support. However, for Child Benefit purposes, what matters most is the temporary nature of the care arrangement and whether Leo is expected to return to your home.

3. If Leo remains in care beyond 12 weeks, your Child Benefit will typically stop. You would need to contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them of this change.

4. When Leo does return to live with you, you can reclaim Child Benefit. If the break in your claim is less than 3 months, you may be able to have your claim reinstated without making a new application.

5. It would be advisable to stay in touch with Leo's social worker to keep updated on the timeline for his potential return.

You can contact the Child Benefit Office at 0300 200 3100 to discuss your specific situation and ensure your claim is handled correctly.

Is there anything specific about this process you'd like me to clarify further?

2026-01-26T16:27:01.150982 [actor]: Based on my husband's contributions to Leo's care, does that affect my eligibility for Child Benefit at all? I'm just trying to understand if that makes a difference to how long I can receive the benefit while Leo is in care.

2026-01-26T16:27:05.027939 [root_agent]: I understand your concern about how your husband's contributions might affect your Child Benefit eligibility. Let me clarify this for you:

Your husband's contributions of £30 per week to Leo's carer don't directly affect the 12-week rule for Child Benefit while Leo is in local authority care. The primary factors that determine your eligibility during this period are:

1. The temporary nature of the care arrangement
2. Whether Leo is expected to return to your home
3. The length of time Leo has been in care (the 12-week limit)

These financial contributions may be viewed positively as they demonstrate continued parental involvement and support, but they don't extend the 12-week period during which you can receive Child Benefit while Leo is in care.

After the 12-week period, if Leo remains in local authority care, your Child Benefit would typically stop regardless of these contributions. You would need to reclaim when Leo returns to live with you.

Is there anything else about your specific situation you'd like me to address?

2026-01-26T16:27:06.767897 [actor]: I see, thank you for explaining. So after the 12-week period, my Child Benefit will stop even though my husband continues to contribute to Leo's care? That's good to know. I'll make sure to contact the Child Benefit Office if Leo's stay in care goes beyond 12 weeks.

2026-01-26T16:27:10.954374 [root_agent]: That's correct. After the 12-week period, your Child Benefit will typically stop even though your husband continues to contribute to Leo's care. The financial contributions, while important for Leo's well-being, don't extend the 12-week rule for Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in local authority care.

You're taking the right approach by planning to contact the Child Benefit Office if Leo's stay extends beyond 12 weeks. This will ensure your claim is properly managed and avoid any potential overpayments that might need to be repaid later.

When Leo does return to live with you, remember to notify the Child Benefit Office promptly so they can reinstate your payments. If the gap is less than 3 months since your payments stopped, the process may be simpler than making a completely new claim.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation or any other concerns I can help with?

2026-01-26T16:27:12.630385 [actor]: No, I think that covers everything I needed to know. Thank you for explaining the situation clearly. I'll keep track of the 12-week timeline and contact the Child Benefit Office if necessary.

2026-01-26T16:27:15.241942 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about the 12-week limit for receiving Child Benefit while a child is in local authority care and correctly explained that the stepfather's contributions do not affect this time limit.
