For children in residential accommodation (not in care), the rule is that eligibility continues for 12 weeks, not 8 weeks. The agent incorrectly applied the 8-week rule that's for children in care, when Tom is specifically in residential accommodation for educational needs. This is a critical error in the information provided.
