The agent correctly informed Lisa that Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks when a child is in custody following a court sentence. The scenario specifically states that Mark has been sentenced (not just detained awaiting trial) and has been in custody for 10 weeks, which exceeds the 8-week limit. The agent provided the correct outcome that Lisa is not eligible.
