2026-01-26T16:33:08.429921 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions one by one to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have any children living with you who you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T16:33:09.679484 [actor]: Yes, my wife Helen and I have two adopted children living with us. They're siblings - one is 6 and the other is 8 years old.

2026-01-26T16:33:10.798317 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. That's helpful to know that you have two adopted children living with you.

Do you or your wife normally live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:33:11.878992 [actor]: Yes, both my wife Helen and I live in the UK permanently.

2026-01-26T16:33:13.432905 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you and your wife live permanently in the UK.

Is either you or your wife a UK national or do you have the right to reside in the UK (such as settled or pre-settled status)?

2026-01-26T16:33:14.307962 [actor]: Yes, we're both UK nationals.

2026-01-26T16:33:15.430051 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both you and your wife are UK nationals.

Is either you or your partner earning over £60,000 per year before tax?

2026-01-26T16:33:16.336060 [actor]: No, neither of us earns over £60,000 per year.

2026-01-26T16:33:19.396164 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared with me, it appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit because:

1. You have two adopted children (ages 6 and 8) living with you who you're responsible for
2. You and your wife are UK nationals and live permanently in the UK
3. Neither you nor your wife earns over £60,000 per year

Since neither of you earns over £60,000 annually, you would be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount without any High Income Child Benefit Charge.

The current Child Benefit rates are:
- £25.60 per week for your eldest or only child
- £16.95 per week for each additional child

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T16:33:21.169044 [actor]: That's great news! Yes, I would like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, please. I should mention that we do receive an Adoption Allowance from the Local Authority because our children have special needs. Does that affect our eligibility for Child Benefit at all?

2026-01-26T16:33:26.414231 [root_agent]: I'm happy to help with the application process. Regarding your Adoption Allowance - this is good information to mention, but it doesn't affect your Child Benefit eligibility. Adoption Allowance is separate from Child Benefit, and receiving one doesn't prevent you from claiming the other.

To apply for Child Benefit, you'll need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2. You can:

1. Complete it online, print it out and mail it
2. Print the form directly and fill it out by hand
3. Call the Child Benefit Office to request a form be sent to you

Along with the completed form, you'll need to include:
- The children's original birth certificates or adoption certificates
- Your passport or other identity documents (if this is your first claim)

Once everything is complete, send your application to:
Child Benefit Office
Washington
Newcastle upon Tyne
NE88 1ZD

The claim can only be backdated for up to 3 months from when they receive your claim, so it's good to apply promptly.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about the Child Benefit application process?

2026-01-26T16:33:28.827500 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that the Adoption Allowance doesn't affect our Child Benefit eligibility. That's a relief to know. 

I think I have all the information I need about how to apply. We'll fill out the CH2 form and send it along with the adoption certificates. It's good to know we need to apply promptly to avoid missing out on any payments.

2026-01-26T16:33:31.457957 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a family with two adopted children living in the UK, with both parents being UK nationals earning under £60,000, and correctly stated that Adoption Allowance does not affect Child Benefit eligibility.
