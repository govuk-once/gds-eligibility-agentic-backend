2026-01-26T16:17:57.707024 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one by one.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:17:58.785808 [actor]: I'll play the role of someone inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

Yes, I have a daughter, Sofia. She's 18 years old and lives with me.

2026-01-26T16:18:00.138769 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since Sofia is 18, I'll need to know a bit more about her situation. 

Is Sofia in approved education or training? This would typically include things like A-levels, NVQs, or other approved courses.

2026-01-26T16:18:01.219454 [actor]: No, Sofia isn't in education or training. She left school about two years ago and now works as a receptionist. She's got a regular job.

2026-01-26T16:18:03.182598 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've shared, it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia. Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. Since Sofia is 18 and not in education or training, she wouldn't meet the eligibility criteria.

Do you have any other children you're responsible for?

2026-01-26T16:18:04.653138 [actor]: No, Sofia is my only child. So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit then? I wasn't sure about the rules once she turned 18 and started working.

2026-01-26T16:18:07.229515 [root_agent]: That's correct. You're not eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia. 

Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or for those aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training. Since Sofia is 18 and working rather than being in education or training, she doesn't meet the eligibility criteria.

If your circumstances change in the future - for instance, if you become responsible for another child under 16 or if Sofia were to return to approved education before turning 20 - you could then become eligible for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T16:18:09.205108 [actor]: I understand now. Thank you for explaining that. I wasn't sure about the rules once she left school and started working. That makes perfect sense. I don't have any other questions about Child Benefit at the moment.

2026-01-26T16:18:11.391865 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because their 18-year-old daughter is working and not in approved education or training.
