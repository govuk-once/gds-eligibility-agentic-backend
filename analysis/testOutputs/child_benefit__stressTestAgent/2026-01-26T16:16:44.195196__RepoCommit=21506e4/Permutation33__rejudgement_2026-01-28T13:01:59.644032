2026-01-28T13:02:18.090155 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly told the user they were eligible when they are not. According to gov.uk guidance, training paid for by an employer (as is the case with Bella's training) does not qualify as "approved" training for Child Benefit purposes. The correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
