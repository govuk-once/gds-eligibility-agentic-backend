2026-01-28T13:03:03.076497 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that Amit is eligible for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome. The agent properly identified that Priya qualifies because she's under 20 and in approved education (A-levels), Amit is responsible for her care, they live in the UK, and his income is below the £60,000 threshold.
