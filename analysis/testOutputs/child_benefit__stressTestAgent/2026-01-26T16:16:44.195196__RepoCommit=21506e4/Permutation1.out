2026-01-26T16:16:46.763676 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:16:47.944860 [actor]: Yes, I have a son who's 8 years old. His name is Leo and he lives with me and my husband.

2026-01-26T16:16:49.444310 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since Leo is 8 years old and lives with you, that meets one of the key requirements for Child Benefit.

Next question: Is Leo your biological child, adopted child, or a child you're otherwise responsible for raising?

2026-01-26T16:16:50.450732 [actor]: Yes, Leo is our biological son. My husband Tom and I are raising him together in our home in Manchester.

2026-01-26T16:16:51.773001 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Leo is your biological son and you're raising him in your home, that's good for your eligibility.

Next question: Do you and Leo normally live in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:16:52.663791 [actor]: Yes, we all live in Manchester. Both my husband Tom and I are UK nationals.

2026-01-26T16:16:53.852740 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you and Leo live in the UK. That's important for Child Benefit eligibility.

Next question: Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for Leo?

2026-01-26T16:16:55.049405 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Leo. He's lived with us his whole life, and neither Tom nor I have claimed this benefit before.

2026-01-26T16:16:56.239308 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Leo.

Next question: Regarding immigration status, is Leo a UK citizen, or does he have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T16:16:57.195468 [actor]: Yes, Leo is a UK citizen. He was born here in Manchester and has lived here his whole life.

2026-01-26T16:16:58.730169 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming Leo's UK citizenship. 

Next question: Are you or your husband subject to immigration control? This would mean having conditions or time limits on your stay in the UK.

2026-01-26T16:17:00.020783 [actor]: No, neither of us is subject to immigration control. As I mentioned, both Tom and I are UK nationals, so we don't have any conditions or time limits on our stay in the UK.

2026-01-26T16:17:01.276480 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Since neither you nor your husband are subject to immigration control, that's good for your eligibility.

Next question: Does your or your partner's individual income exceed £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T16:17:02.901681 [actor]: No, neither of us earns that much. Tom works as a teacher and earns £35,000 a year, and I work part-time earning £15,000.

2026-01-26T16:17:07.046404 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your incomes. Since neither you nor your husband has an individual income exceeding £60,000 per year, you would be eligible for the full Child Benefit amount.

Based on all the information you've provided:
- You have responsibility for Leo, your 8-year-old biological son
- You all live together in the UK
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Leo
- Leo is a UK citizen
- Neither you nor your husband are subject to immigration control
- Your individual incomes are below the £60,000 threshold

I can confirm that you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Leo. You would receive the full amount since your incomes are below the threshold where the High Income Child Benefit Charge starts to apply (which begins at £50,000 and results in a gradual reduction).

You can apply for Child Benefit online through the UK government website or by filling out a CH2 claim form.

2026-01-26T16:17:09.570936 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that! That's really helpful to know we're eligible for the full Child Benefit amount for Leo. I wasn't sure about all the requirements, especially with our combined income, so I'm relieved to hear we qualify. I'll look into applying online through the government website. Do you know roughly how much we'd receive?

2026-01-26T16:17:12.334112 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a family with an 8-year-old biological child living in the UK, where both parents are UK nationals, no one else is claiming the benefit, and neither parent earns over £60,000 individually, qualifies for the full Child Benefit amount.
