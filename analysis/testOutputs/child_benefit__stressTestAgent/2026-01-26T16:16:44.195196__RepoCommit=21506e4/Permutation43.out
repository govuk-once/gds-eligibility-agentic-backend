2026-01-26T16:35:00.668761 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to determine this.

Do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T16:35:02.089567 [actor]: I have a son, Callum, who's 17 years old. He lives with me in Glasgow. I'm a single father.

2026-01-26T16:35:04.266757 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since you have a 17-year-old son living with you, I need to ask a few more questions to determine your Child Benefit eligibility.

Is your son Callum in approved education (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3) or training?

2026-01-26T16:35:05.832328 [actor]: Callum has recently started a Modern Apprenticeship here in Scotland. He's really enjoying it so far.

2026-01-26T16:35:07.578820 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Is Callum's Modern Apprenticeship an approved training course that's unpaid, or is it a paid apprenticeship?

2026-01-26T16:35:08.734215 [actor]: It's a paid apprenticeship. He gets a weekly wage from the employer as part of the Modern Apprenticeship program.

2026-01-26T16:35:12.334363 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. 

Since Callum is receiving payment for his Modern Apprenticeship, this would be considered paid work rather than approved unpaid training. 

For Child Benefit eligibility, a young person aged 16 or 17 needs to be in approved education or unpaid training. As Callum is 17 and in paid work (even though it's an apprenticeship with training elements), he would generally not qualify for Child Benefit.

Child Benefit typically stops after August 31st following a child's 16th birthday if they leave approved education or training. It can continue up to age 20 if they stay in approved education or unpaid training.

May I ask if you're currently receiving Child Benefit for Callum?

2026-01-26T16:35:14.007778 [actor]: Yes, I have been receiving Child Benefit for Callum. I wasn't sure if I should continue receiving it now that he's started this apprenticeship. So from what you're saying, I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit since he's in a paid apprenticeship?

2026-01-26T16:35:18.797983 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation. Yes, that's correct. Since Callum is now in a paid apprenticeship rather than unpaid training or approved education, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit.

You should inform the Child Benefit Office about this change in circumstances as soon as possible. When a young person leaves approved education or training and begins paid work (including paid apprenticeships), Child Benefit payments should stop.

You can report this change by:
- Calling the Child Benefit Helpline
- Using your Government Gateway account to update your details online

It's important to notify them promptly to avoid any potential overpayments that might need to be paid back later. The Child Benefit Office can provide you with the exact date when payments should stop based on when Callum started his paid apprenticeship.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?

2026-01-26T16:35:21.344075 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that clearly. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office to let them know about Callum's apprenticeship. I just wanted to be sure about my eligibility status, and now I understand I'm no longer eligible since he's in a paid apprenticeship. I appreciate your help with this matter.

2026-01-26T16:35:23.939135 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is not available when a 17-year-old is in a paid apprenticeship rather than approved unpaid training or education.
