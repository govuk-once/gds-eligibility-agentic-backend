2026-01-26T16:17:37.382972 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine your eligibility for Child Benefit. To assess this accurately, I'll need to ask you some questions one by one.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T16:17:38.288904 [actor]: Yes, I have a son who lives with me. His name is Ben and he's 17.

2026-01-26T16:17:39.781426 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit:

Is Ben in approved education or training? For example, is he still in school, college, or on an approved training course?

2026-01-26T16:17:41.006772 [actor]: Ben left school in June and hasn't gone on to college. He's registered with the local youth careers service and is actively looking for an apprenticeship. He's been doing that since he left school.

2026-01-26T16:17:43.083759 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since Ben is 17 and has left school but is registered with the local youth careers service and actively looking for an apprenticeship, I need to understand his current status a bit better.

Is Ben registered with a government-approved careers service, Connexions (in England), Careers Wales, or Skills Development Scotland? And is he actively looking for work or an apprenticeship through this service?

2026-01-26T16:17:44.434989 [actor]: Yes, he's registered with the local government careers service. He's been working with them to find an apprenticeship since he left school in June. They've been helping him with his applications and interviews.

2026-01-26T16:17:46.412373 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Since Ben is 17, has left school, and is registered with a government-approved careers service while actively looking for work or an apprenticeship, he would typically still qualify for Child Benefit. This falls under what's called "extension period" - which can last up to 20 weeks after leaving approved education.

Is there anyone else in your household who earns over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T16:17:47.470695 [actor]: No, there's no one in our household who earns over £60,000. It's just me and Ben, and my income is well below that amount.

2026-01-26T16:17:51.135612 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared, you would be eligible for Child Benefit for Ben since:

1. He is under 20 years old (he's 17)
2. He has left education but is registered with a government-approved careers service and actively seeking work/apprenticeship
3. You're responsible for him and he lives with you
4. There's no one in your household with an individual income over £60,000 (which would trigger the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

You should be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when Ben left school in June, as long as he remains registered with the careers service and continues looking for work or an apprenticeship during this extension period.

Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit or if there's anything else you should be aware of regarding your claim?

2026-01-26T16:17:53.725961 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for Child Benefit during this extension period. That's helpful to know it can continue for up to 20 weeks after Ben left school in June. I already have a claim in place actually, I was just worried it might stop now that he's left school. Is there anything I need to do to ensure the payments continue during this extension period?

2026-01-26T16:17:56.223712 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit would continue for up to 20 weeks after Ben left school in June, as he's registered with a government careers service and actively seeking work/apprenticeship.
