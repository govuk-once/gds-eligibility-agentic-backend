The agent correctly determined the expected outcome that the applicant is eligible for Child Benefit despite the child being in hospital for more than 12 weeks, as the parent maintains regular contact and spends money on the child's upkeep (£30/week on books, pajamas, and food), which qualifies for the exception to the hospital rules.
