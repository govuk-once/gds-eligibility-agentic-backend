2026-01-28T13:03:08.131658 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated partial eligibility (weekly rate for days the child stays) rather than full eligibility. According to the exception rules, since Jack spends two nights in a row at home every weekend, David is fully entitled to Child Benefit, not just a reduced weekly rate.
