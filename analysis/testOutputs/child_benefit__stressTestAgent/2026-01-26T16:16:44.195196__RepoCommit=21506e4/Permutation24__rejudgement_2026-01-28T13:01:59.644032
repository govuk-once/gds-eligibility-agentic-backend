2026-01-28T13:02:10.341785 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent failed to address a crucial point about the 12-week rule. For children in residential accommodation (distinct from general "care"), eligibility for Child Benefit continues only for the first 12 weeks. Tom has been there for 10 weeks, so the parent is currently eligible but will lose eligibility after 12 weeks unless Tom returns home. The agent didn't communicate this important time limitation.
