2026-01-26T16:24:41.821445 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First question: Do you have any children living with you who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T16:24:43.803983 [actor]: I need to role-play as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility. I'll engage with the agent's questions based on the provided scenario.

Yes, I have one child living with me. My son Sam is 10 years old. My ex-wife and I divorced recently, and my daughter Ella (who's 8) lives with her mother.

2026-01-26T16:24:46.237148 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand you have a 10-year-old son named Sam living with you, and an 8-year-old daughter named Ella who lives with your ex-wife.

Next question: Are you responsible for raising your son Sam? By this, I mean are you providing for his day-to-day care and covering costs for things like food, clothes, and a place to live?

2026-01-26T16:24:48.070633 [actor]: Yes, I am responsible for raising Sam. I provide his day-to-day care, including food, clothes, housing, and all other necessities. His mother and I share parenting responsibilities, but Sam lives with me full-time since the divorce.

2026-01-26T16:24:49.379593 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that you're responsible for raising Sam, who lives with you full-time.

Next question: Are you a UK resident? This is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-26T16:24:50.386377 [actor]: Yes, I am a UK resident. I've been living here all my life.

2026-01-26T16:24:51.701833 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK resident.

Next question: Is there anyone else (such as your ex-wife) who might be claiming Child Benefit for Sam?

2026-01-26T16:24:53.029942 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Sam. My ex-wife Tina is only claiming Child Benefit for our daughter Ella, who lives with her.

2026-01-26T16:24:55.044854 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification about the benefit claims.

Next question: What is your annual income? This is relevant because if you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000, you may have to pay back some of the Child Benefit as Income Tax (known as the High Income Child Benefit Charge).

2026-01-26T16:24:56.103564 [actor]: My annual income is about £42,000, so it's below the £50,000 threshold.

2026-01-26T16:24:59.410843 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing your income information.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You're a UK resident
- You have a 10-year-old son, Sam, who lives with you full-time and for whom you provide day-to-day care
- Nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Sam
- Your income is below the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold of £50,000

You appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your son Sam.

Regarding your daughter Ella who lives with your ex-wife: As she's primarily caring for Ella, your ex-wife would typically be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit for her, which you mentioned she is already doing.

Would you like information on how to apply for Child Benefit for Sam?

2026-01-26T16:25:01.107488 [actor]: That's great news that I'm eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam. Yes, I would like information on how to apply, please.

2026-01-26T16:25:04.583134 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for their son Sam, as they meet all requirements: UK residency, responsible for a child under 16, income below the threshold, and no one else claiming for Sam.
