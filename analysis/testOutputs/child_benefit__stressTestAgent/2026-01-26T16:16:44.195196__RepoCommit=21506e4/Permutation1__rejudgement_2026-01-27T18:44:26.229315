The agent correctly determined eligibility for Child Benefit based on all relevant criteria: Leo is under 16, lives with his parents, both parents are UK nationals, no one else is claiming the benefit, and neither parent earns above £60,000 individually. The outcome matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."
