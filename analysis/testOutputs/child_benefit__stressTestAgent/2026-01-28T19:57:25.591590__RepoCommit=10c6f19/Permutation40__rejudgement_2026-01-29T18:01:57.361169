**Justification:**

The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that **agrees with the expected outcome of "Eligible (until week 12)"**.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of the 12-week rule**: The agent properly identified that the Mental Health Act detention in a secure psychiatric unit falls under hospital/residential accommodation rules, which allow Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks.

2. **Accurate timeline application**: The agent correctly calculated that since the son has been detained for 10 weeks, the parent remains eligible for approximately 2 more weeks (to complete the 12-week period).

3. **Clear communication of outcome**: The agent explicitly stated "You should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit for your son" and explained that payments would continue for the next 2 weeks before stopping after the 12-week threshold.

4. **Proper context**: The agent also correctly explained what happens after 12 weeks (payments stop) and when they resume (when the child returns home).

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome precisely: the parent is **eligible until week 12** of the hospital detention. The evaluation judge also confirmed this with a ✓, noting the agent "correctly determined my eligibility" and "accurately explained that Child Benefit continues for up to 12 weeks."
