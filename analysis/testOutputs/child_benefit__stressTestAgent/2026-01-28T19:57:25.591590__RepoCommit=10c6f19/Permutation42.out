2026-01-28T20:21:06.474179 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Are you responsible for a child under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:21:08.089277 [actor]: child benefit wales 17 year old apprenticship

2026-01-28T20:21:10.349739 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you're asking about a 17-year-old in an apprenticeship in Wales.

Let me ask you a clarifying question:

**Are you responsible for this 17-year-old? In other words, are you their parent or main carer who looks after them?**

2026-01-28T20:21:11.917897 [actor]: yes am the mum she lives with me in cardiff

2026-01-28T20:21:15.581428 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. So your 17-year-old daughter lives with you in Cardiff.

Now, regarding her apprenticeship - this is important for determining eligibility:

**Is your daughter's apprenticeship an approved education or training course? Specifically, is it:**
- **A course that is not paid for by an employer, or**
- **A course where she works less than 24 hours per week (not counting meal breaks)?**

This distinction is important because Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 in approved education or training, but not if they're in paid full-time work or certain types of employment-based training.

2026-01-28T20:21:17.185650 [actor]: foundation apprenticeship wales funded by welsh government

2026-01-28T20:21:19.467853 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. A foundation apprenticeship in Wales funded by the Welsh Government is helpful context.

Let me ask you this to clarify the employment aspect:

**Does your daughter work 24 hours per week or more as part of her apprenticeship (not counting meal breaks)?**

This is important because if she's working 24 hours or more per week, it would typically be considered paid employment rather than approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

2026-01-28T20:21:21.263257 [actor]: she does work as part of it dont know exact hours maybe 20 or 25 not sure

2026-01-28T20:21:24.364523 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. The number of hours is quite important here, as the 24-hour threshold determines eligibility.

Let me ask you:

**Are you able to find out the exact number of hours per week your daughter works as part of her apprenticeship?** 

This is a key factor because:
- If she works **less than 24 hours per week**, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit
- If she works **24 hours or more per week**, you would not be eligible

You might be able to check this on her employment contract, apprenticeship agreement, or by asking her employer or training provider.

2026-01-28T20:21:25.943769 [actor]: how do i check cant find papers is foundation apprentice approved training wales

2026-01-28T20:21:30.307430 [root_agent]: That's a good question. Let me help clarify about foundation apprenticeships in Wales.

Foundation apprenticeships are generally employment-based training programs where the young person has an employment contract and receives a wage. The key issue for Child Benefit eligibility isn't whether the apprenticeship itself is "approved" by the Welsh Government, but rather whether it meets the specific criteria for approved education or training under Child Benefit rules.

For Child Benefit purposes, approved education or training generally means courses that are:
- Not paid for by an employer, OR
- Where the young person works less than 24 hours per week

Since foundation apprenticeships are typically employer-funded and involve paid employment, the working hours become the deciding factor.

**To find out the exact hours, could you:**
- **Ask your daughter directly how many hours per week she works?**
- **Contact her employer or training provider to confirm her contracted hours?**

This information is essential to determine your eligibility for Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T20:21:31.872486 [actor]: she says around 22 hours maybe bit more some weeks

2026-01-28T20:21:36.252856 [root_agent]: Thank you for checking with your daughter. This is important information.

Since she's working around 22 hours, and possibly a bit more some weeks, we need to be precise because the threshold is 24 hours per week (not counting meal breaks).

Let me ask you:

**Can you or your daughter get confirmation of her contracted or average working hours from her employer or apprenticeship provider?** 

This is important because:
- If her contracted/average hours are consistently **under 24 hours per week**, you should be eligible for Child Benefit
- If some weeks push her to **24 hours or more on average**, this could affect your eligibility

The exact contracted hours in her apprenticeship agreement would give us the clearest answer. Would you be able to obtain this information?

2026-01-28T20:21:38.104045 [actor]: foundation apprenticeship wales child benefit rules approved

2026-01-28T20:21:42.714358 [root_agent]: I understand you're trying to confirm whether a foundation apprenticeship in Wales counts as approved training for Child Benefit purposes.

Let me be clear about how this works: The key criterion for Child Benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds is not simply whether an apprenticeship is "approved" by the Welsh Government, but whether it meets **specific Child Benefit rules** about approved education or training.

For Child Benefit purposes, approved education or training means:
- The course is **not paid for by an employer**, OR
- The young person works **less than 24 hours per week**

Foundation apprenticeships typically involve an employment contract with an employer who funds the training. This means the working hours become the determining factor.

Based on what you've told me:
- Your daughter is 17 and lives with you
- She's on a foundation apprenticeship 
- She works around 22 hours, possibly slightly more some weeks

**My question remains: Can you get written confirmation of her actual contracted weekly hours from her employer or apprenticeship agreement?** 

If her contracted hours are definitely under 24 per week, you should be eligible. If they're 24 or over, you would not be eligible.

2026-01-28T20:21:44.115459 [actor]: ok so if under 24 hours i get it

2026-01-28T20:21:48.409456 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct based on the information we've discussed so far! Let me confirm the key points:

**If your daughter:**
- Is under 20 years old (she's 17 ✓)
- Lives with you (she does ✓)
- Works less than 24 hours per week as part of her apprenticeship

**Then you should be eligible for Child Benefit.**

However, before we conclude, let me ask one more important question:

**Do you or your partner earn over £60,000 per year (or did you in the last tax year)?**

This doesn't stop you from *receiving* Child Benefit, but if either of you earns between £60,000 and £80,000, you may have to pay some of it back through tax (called the High Income Child Benefit Charge). If either of you earns over £80,000, you'd have to pay it all back.

You can still claim it regardless, but this affects whether you'd keep the full amount.

2026-01-28T20:21:50.386120 [actor]: no dont earn that much so i can get child benefit then

2026-01-28T20:21:54.537439 [root_agent]: Based on everything you've told me, **yes, you should be eligible for Child Benefit**, provided your daughter's working hours are confirmed to be under 24 hours per week.

To summarize:
- ✓ Your daughter is 17 (under 20)
- ✓ She lives with you in Cardiff
- ✓ You are her mum and responsible for her
- ✓ She works around 22 hours per week (under the 24-hour threshold)
- ✓ Neither you nor a partner earn over £60,000

**Important next step:** I'd still recommend getting written confirmation of her exact contracted hours from her employer or apprenticeship provider, just to be certain they're under 24 hours per week. This will ensure there are no issues with your claim.

If her hours are confirmed as under 24 per week, you can apply for Child Benefit or continue receiving it if you're already claiming.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:21:56.121232 [actor]: no thats all thanks

2026-01-28T20:22:00.161347 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly established that the user is responsible for a 17-year-old living with them in an apprenticeship working under 24 hours per week, with household income under £60,000, which meets all the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.
