**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit for Sam** (the 10-year-old child living with them). The expected outcome states that "Both [parents are] Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)" - meaning both Robert and Tina should each receive the higher "Eldest Child" rate (£26.05) for the child living in their respective household.

The agent's assessment aligns with this expected outcome:
- The user (Robert) is eligible to claim for Sam who lives with him
- The ex-wife (Tina) is eligible to claim for Ella who lives with her
- The agent correctly recognized this is a valid split custody arrangement where each parent claims for their respective child

While the agent didn't explicitly mention the specific rates or elaborate that each parent would receive the higher "Eldest Child" rate (rather than the lower "additional child" rate), the core eligibility determination is correct: both parents are eligible to claim Child Benefit for the child in their care. The agent appropriately confirmed the user's eligibility for Sam, which matches the expected outcome that both parents would be eligible in this split family scenario.
