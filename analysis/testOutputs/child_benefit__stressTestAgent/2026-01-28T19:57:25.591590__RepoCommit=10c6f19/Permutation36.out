2026-01-28T20:17:52.115176 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:17:53.644145 [actor]: daughter 16 not in shcool worried

2026-01-28T20:17:55.741163 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I can see your daughter is 16 and not currently in school, which you're worried about.

To help assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to understand her situation a bit better.

**Is your daughter currently in any approved education or training (such as A-levels, T-levels, NVQs, or similar courses)?**

2026-01-28T20:17:57.209340 [actor]: she finsihed gcses june college starts septmber

2026-01-28T20:17:59.218224 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So your daughter finished her GCSEs in June and will be starting college in September - that's helpful to know.

For Child Benefit purposes, there can be a gap between finishing one stage of education and starting another. 

**Can you confirm that your daughter is definitely enrolled and will be attending college in September?**

2026-01-28T20:18:00.984254 [actor]: yes acceptd into colege for a levels

2026-01-28T20:18:03.420068 [root_agent]: That's great news that she's been accepted into college for A-levels.

Based on what you've told me so far, your daughter should still qualify as a "child" for Child Benefit purposes since she'll be continuing in approved education (A-levels) and is under 20 years old.

Now I need to ask about your circumstances:

**Do you live with your daughter and are you responsible for her day-to-day care?**

2026-01-28T20:18:04.822594 [actor]: yes live together I look after her

2026-01-28T20:18:06.573316 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your residency status:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:18:07.874783 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T20:18:09.873117 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question about your circumstances:

**Are you the only person responsible for your daughter, or does anyone else also care for her (for example, does she split her time between you and another parent or guardian)?**

2026-01-28T20:18:11.337616 [actor]: just me no one else

2026-01-28T20:18:14.464496 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You're responsible for a child under 20 years old
2. ✓ Your daughter is in approved education (A-levels starting in September)
3. ✓ You live with her and are responsible for her day-to-day care
4. ✓ You live in the UK
5. ✓ You're the only person responsible for her

The gap between finishing her GCSEs in June and starting college in September shouldn't affect your eligibility, as this is a normal transition period between stages of education.

**One final question: Are you already claiming Child Benefit, or would this be a new claim?**

2026-01-28T20:18:19.808175 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed eligibility for a parent with a 16-year-old daughter in the gap between GCSEs and A-level college, correctly recognizing that approved education continuation maintains eligibility and that transition periods are acceptable.
