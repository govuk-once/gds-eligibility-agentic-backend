**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated the eligibility outcome, which agrees with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.

The agent clearly explained that:
1. Child Benefit **would have been** eligible from March to August while Emma was completing A-levels (approved education)
2. Child Benefit **stops** from September onwards when Emma started her university degree (higher education)

The agent's final determination was: "So you are **not eligible** for Child Benefit from September onwards" - which directly aligns with the expected outcome that Child Benefit stops when a child starts "advanced" education, such as a university degree.

The agent demonstrated accurate understanding of the distinction between "approved education" (A-levels) and "advanced/higher education" (university degrees), and correctly applied the rule that higher education courses are not covered for Child Benefit purposes.
