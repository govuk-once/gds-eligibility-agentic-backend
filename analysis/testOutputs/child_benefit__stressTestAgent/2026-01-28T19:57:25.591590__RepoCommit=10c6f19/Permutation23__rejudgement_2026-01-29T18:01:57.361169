**Justification:**

The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

**Analysis:**

1. **Child's Age**: The agent correctly confirmed Sarah is 12 years old (under 16) ✓

2. **Contribution Assessment**: The agent established that Kevin contributes £120 every 4 weeks for groceries and clothes. This averages to £30/week, which exceeds the Child Benefit weekly rate threshold of £26.05 ✓

3. **UK Residency**: The agent confirmed Kevin lives and works in the UK ✓

4. **Responsible for Child**: The agent verified Kevin is contributing to his daughter's costs despite not living with her ✓

5. **Critical Caveat Properly Handled**: The agent appropriately noted that only one person can claim Child Benefit per child and worked with the user's assumption that the mother is not claiming it

**Key Strength**: The agent correctly understood that:
- Contributions don't need to be weekly (they can be lump sum payments covering a period)
- £120 over 4 weeks (£30/week average) is sufficient to meet the contribution threshold
- A parent who doesn't live with the child can still claim if they contribute adequately and the other parent isn't claiming

**Final Assessment**: The agent's conclusion of eligibility matches the expected outcome based on the scenario parameters where the mother is not claiming Child Benefit.
