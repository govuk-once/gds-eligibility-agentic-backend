**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit until the 12-week mark**. This aligns perfectly with the expected outcome: **"Eligible (until week 12)."**

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct rule applied**: The agent properly identified that detention under the Mental Health Act in a secure psychiatric unit follows the hospital/residential accommodation rule (12-week limit), not the custody rule (8-week limit).

2. **Accurate timeline**: The agent correctly calculated that since the son has been detained for 10 weeks, the user has 2 more weeks of eligibility remaining before payments stop at the 12-week threshold.

3. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated: "you can continue to claim Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks from when he went into hospital" and "Your payments to continue for the next 2 weeks (to complete the 12-week period)."

4. **Post-12-week guidance**: The agent appropriately informed the user that payments will stop after 12 weeks but will resume when the son returns home.

The agent's eligibility determination matches the expected outcome exactly - the user is eligible, but only until week 12 of the hospital detention.
