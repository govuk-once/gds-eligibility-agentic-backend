**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Age assessment**: The agent correctly identified that the child (Jordan, 17) is over 16, so the basic age criterion doesn't apply.

2. **Education/Training status**: The agent properly established that Jordan is not in approved education or training - he finished his GCSEs in summer 2024 and has been at home since then.

3. **Extension eligibility**: While the agent didn't explicitly mention the 20-week extension or the requirement to register with careers services, the agent correctly determined that Jordan doesn't qualify for continued Child Benefit. The extension would have expired long ago (summer 2024 to now is well over 20 weeks), and there's no indication Jordan registered with any approved careers service.

4. **Clear outcome communication**: The agent explicitly stated: "**Unfortunately, you are not currently eligible for Child Benefit for your 17-year-old son**" and explained the reasoning clearly.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**, as Jordan is 17, not in education/training, and hasn't taken steps that would qualify him for the extension period.
