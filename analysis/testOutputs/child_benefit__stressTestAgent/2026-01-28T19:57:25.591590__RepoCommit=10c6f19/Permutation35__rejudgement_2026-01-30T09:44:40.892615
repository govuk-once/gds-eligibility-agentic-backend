**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the claimant **is eligible** for Child Benefit for Rashid, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of the marriage exception:** The agent properly identified that while marriage normally disqualifies a child from Child Benefit, there is an exception when the child was already in approved education before marriage and continues without a break.

2. **Accurate fact-gathering:** The agent systematically gathered all relevant information:
   - Rashid is 17 (under 20)
   - In full-time approved education (A-levels)
   - Started A-levels in September before marrying in February
   - Continued education without a break
   - Lives with and is supported by the claimant

3. **Clear explanation:** The agent explicitly stated "You should be eligible for Child Benefit for Rashid" and provided a clear rationale referencing the specific exception that applies.

4. **Alignment with expected outcome:** The scenario specifically notes this is an exception case where eligibility is retained despite marriage, which the agent correctly communicated.

The agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome of eligibility via the marriage exception rule.
