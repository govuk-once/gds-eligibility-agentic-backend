**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct identification of the critical issue**: The agent properly identified that the user is on a standard tourist visa and does not have "right to reside" status in the UK.

2. **Accurate application of eligibility criteria**: The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit requires:
   - Living in the UK, AND
   - Having the right to reside in the UK

3. **Clear communication of ineligibility**: The agent explicitly stated "you would not be eligible for Child Benefit in your current situation" and provided a clear explanation of why.

4. **Correct reasoning**: The agent accurately noted that a standard tourist/visitor visa does not provide the right to reside necessary for benefit eligibility, which is consistent with the scenario description stating that visitor visas subject holders to "Immigration Control" with no recourse to public funds.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome (Not Eligible) and correctly applied the immigration status/right to reside criterion, which was the decisive factor in this permutation.
