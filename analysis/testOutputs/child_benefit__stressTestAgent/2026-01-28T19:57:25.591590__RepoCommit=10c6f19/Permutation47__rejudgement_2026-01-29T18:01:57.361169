**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and UK Child Benefit rules, the user should be **eligible**.

Here's why the agent's determination was incorrect:

1. **Contribution Requirement Met**: The user pays £50 per week in maintenance (even though court-ordered), which exceeds the Child Benefit amount of £25.60 per week for an eldest/only child. According to gov.uk guidance, payments made under a court order DO count as contributions toward the child's upkeep.

2. **Critical Question Not Resolved**: The agent asked if anyone else is claiming Child Benefit but never established the answer. The user said "don't know if someone claiming already how do i check" - this was never resolved. The agent moved on without determining this crucial fact.

3. **Incorrect Application of Rules**: The agent stated "Child Benefit is normally paid to the person the child lives with" and concluded ineligibility based solely on the child living with the mother. However, gov.uk clearly states that if you don't live with your child but contribute at least the Child Benefit amount AND no one else is claiming it, you may be eligible.

4. **Premature Conclusion**: Without establishing whether the mother is actually claiming Child Benefit, the agent cannot definitively conclude the user is ineligible.

The expected outcome is "Eligible" but the agent communicated "not eligible" - these outcomes do not agree.
