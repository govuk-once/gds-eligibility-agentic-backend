**Justification:**

The agent communicated that Karen is **eligible** for Child Benefit, stating that Ryan's apprenticeship counts as "approved training." However, this is **incorrect**.

According to UK government guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, **apprenticeships do not qualify as "approved education or training"** for Child Benefit purposes. Apprenticeships are considered paid employment. Only **unpaid approved training** qualifies for the extension of Child Benefit beyond age 16.

Since Ryan is 17 and has started an apprenticeship (paid work), he no longer meets the criteria for Child Benefit. The benefit is only available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in **approved education** (like A-levels or certain unpaid training programs) - not apprenticeships.

The **expected outcome** is that Karen is **Not Eligible** and must stop her claim. The agent's determination of eligibility directly contradicts this expected outcome.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, noting that "apprenticeships are paid employment and do not count as 'approved education or training' for Child Benefit purposes."
