2026-01-28T20:11:20.512791 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:11:22.354835 [actor]: son in residenshal scool can i get benfit

2026-01-28T20:11:24.484589 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit when your son is in residential school, I need to ask:

**Is your son in the residential school because he has special educational needs or a disability, or is he there for other reasons (such as attending a regular boarding school)?**

2026-01-28T20:11:25.968638 [actor]: he has behavral needs council pays for it

2026-01-28T20:11:28.952315 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is helpful information - your son is in residential school due to behavioral needs and the council is paying for it.

Now I need to ask: **Do you still have regular contact with your son and contribute to the costs of supporting him (for example, paying for clothing, toys, or pocket money)?**

This is important because even when a child is in residential care or school, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit if you're contributing to their upbringing.

2026-01-28T20:11:30.655187 [actor]: yes buy him cloths and things how long he been there matter

2026-01-28T20:11:32.743206 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you buy him clothes and things. Yes, the length of time does matter.

**How long has your son been in the residential school?**

This is important because the rules differ depending on whether it's:
- A temporary stay (up to 8 weeks), or
- A longer period

2026-01-28T20:11:33.912560 [actor]: 10 weeks he been ther

2026-01-28T20:11:36.307241 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your son has been in residential school for 10 weeks (which is more than 8 weeks), I need to understand a bit more about the arrangement.

**Does your son come home to stay with you during school holidays or for regular visits, or does he remain at the residential school full-time without returning home?**

This is important because it affects whether you can continue to receive Child Benefit for him.

2026-01-28T20:11:37.768714 [actor]: comes home holidays and some weekends stil his home

2026-01-28T20:11:40.574137 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. This is very helpful.

Based on what you've told me, let me ask one more important question to complete the assessment:

**Are you the person who is mainly responsible for your son - meaning you're the primary person looking after his welfare and making decisions about his upbringing?**

(Or if there's another parent or guardian, are you the one who is more responsible for him than the other person?)

2026-01-28T20:11:42.124746 [actor]: yes im his mum i look after him make desisions

2026-01-28T20:11:47.284955 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility for Child Benefit.

**Good news - you should be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

1. ✓ You are responsible for a child under 16
2. ✓ Your son is in residential school due to special needs (behavioral needs) paid for by the council
3. ✓ You continue to contribute to his costs (buying clothes and things)
4. ✓ He comes home during holidays and some weekends - this is still his home
5. ✓ You are his main carer and make decisions about his upbringing

Even though your son has been in residential school for more than 8 weeks, you can still claim Child Benefit because:
- The placement is due to his special educational/behavioral needs
- He still returns home regularly (holidays and weekends)
- You remain his primary carer and continue to support him financially

**If you haven't already claimed, you should apply for Child Benefit. If you're already receiving it, you should continue to be eligible.**

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:11:50.143236 [actor]: ok thank you

2026-01-28T20:11:53.354935 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks when a child is in residential care or hospital, with only limited exceptions (such as when the child is in hospital rather than care). The agent stated I should be eligible despite my son being in residential school for 10 weeks, which exceeds the 8-week limit, when in fact I would only be eligible until week 12 as stated in the expected outcome.
