2026-01-28T20:14:46.420138 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child (or children) who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:14:47.886548 [actor]: child under 16 yes got one

2026-01-28T20:14:50.119127 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

My next question is:

**Are you responsible for this child? This means - do they normally live with you, or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent) towards their upkeep?**

2026-01-28T20:14:51.667365 [actor]: yes pay for everyting they live with me

2026-01-28T20:14:53.353465 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next, I need to ask:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:14:54.675496 [actor]: uk resident yes

2026-01-28T20:14:56.740707 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Now I need to ask about immigration status:

**Do you have the right to reside in the UK? For example, are you a UK citizen, or do you have settled status, pre-settled status, or another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits?**

2026-01-28T20:14:58.296237 [actor]: uk citizen born here

2026-01-28T20:15:00.575270 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for that information.

One more important question:

**Is your child living with anyone else, or are there any special circumstances such as the child being in hospital long-term, in care, or living with someone else for part of the time?**

2026-01-28T20:15:01.930384 [actor]: no just with me and wife normal family

2026-01-28T20:15:06.379043 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16  
✓ The child lives with you and you're responsible for them  
✓ You're a UK resident and UK citizen  
✓ There are no special circumstances affecting eligibility

**However, there is one important thing to be aware of:**

Even though you're eligible to claim Child Benefit, if either you or your wife has an individual income over £50,000 per year, the higher earner will need to pay a tax charge called the "High Income Child Benefit Charge". This charge increases gradually between £50,000 and £60,000, and if either of you earns £60,000 or more, the charge equals the full amount of Child Benefit received.

**Do either you or your wife have an individual income over £50,000 per year?** This won't affect your eligibility, but it's important to know about the potential tax implications.

2026-01-28T20:15:08.271559 [actor]: wife earns more income 65000 mine is 18000

2026-01-28T20:15:13.582116 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

So to be clear about your situation:

**You are eligible for Child Benefit** - you meet all the criteria to claim it.

**However**, because your wife earns £65,000 per year (which is over the £60,000 threshold), if you claim Child Benefit and receive the payments, she will have to pay back 100% of the Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge on her tax return.

**You have two options:**

1. **Claim Child Benefit and receive the payments** - but your wife will need to complete a Self Assessment tax return each year and pay back the full amount of Child Benefit received through the tax charge.

2. **Claim Child Benefit but opt not to receive the payments** - this way you still get National Insurance credits (which protect your State Pension), and your wife won't have to pay the tax charge or complete a Self Assessment.

Many people in your situation choose option 2, as it gives you the National Insurance credit benefit without the administrative burden of the tax charge.

**Would you like any clarification on either of these options?**

2026-01-28T20:15:15.052619 [actor]: so i can get it then ok thanks

2026-01-28T20:15:18.302346 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct - **you can claim Child Benefit**. You're eligible!

Just remember the key points:

- You're fully eligible to claim
- Because of your wife's income (£65,000), there will be a tax charge equal to the full amount if you receive the payments
- Consider whether to receive the payments or just register to get the National Insurance credits

**Good luck with your claim, and you're very welcome!** If you have any other questions in the future, feel free to ask.

2026-01-28T20:15:24.365530 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately established that the user is eligible for Child Benefit and correctly explained that while the user qualifies, the wife's £65,000 income means she would need to pay back 100% of the benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which is the correct application of the rules for incomes at or above £60,000.
