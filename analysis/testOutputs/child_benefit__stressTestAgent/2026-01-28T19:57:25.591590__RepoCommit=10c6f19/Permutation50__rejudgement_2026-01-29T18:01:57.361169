2026-01-29T18:13:04.598258 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent correctly communicated that the user is eligible for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent properly assessed all relevant eligibility criteria:

1. **Child's age and status**: The 16-year-old has left school but is enrolled in the "No One Left Behind" programme as a full-time trainee
2. **Approved education/training**: The agent correctly recognized this Scottish programme as approved training and verified it meets the full-time requirement (at least 12 hours per week)
3. **Responsibility**: The child lives with the claimant who is solely responsible
4. **UK residency**: The claimant lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK

The agent reached the correct conclusion that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, stating clearly: "Based on your circumstances, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit." This matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**. The agent also correctly explained that Child Benefit can extend to age 20 for young people in approved education or training, which is accurate per UK government guidance on child benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds in approved training.
