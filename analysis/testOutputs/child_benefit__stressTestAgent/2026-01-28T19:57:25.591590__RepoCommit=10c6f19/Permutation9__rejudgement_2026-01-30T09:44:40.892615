2026-01-30T09:56:08.673474 [confirmation_judge]: **Assessment of Agent's Communication of Eligibility Outcome:**

The agent communicated that the user is **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "Based on your circumstances, I'm afraid you are likely NOT currently eligible for Child Benefit."

The agent's reasoning was that being a jobseeker alone without having previously worked in the UK "typically does NOT give you the right to reside for the purposes of claiming Child Benefit."

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible

**Actual Outcome Communicated:** Not Eligible

**Verification against gov.uk guidance:**

According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, EEA citizens with pre-settled status can claim Child Benefit if they meet certain conditions. The guidance confirms that registered jobseekers with a genuine prospect of work DO have a qualifying right to reside for benefits purposes. Lars explicitly stated he is "registred jobseekr genuien prospect of work" - which should satisfy the right to reside requirement.

The agent incorrectly advised that Lars would need to secure employment before becoming eligible, when in fact his current status as a registered jobseeker with genuine prospects of work already establishes his right to reside for Child Benefit purposes.

**Justification:** The agent communicated an eligibility outcome (Not Eligible) that directly contradicts the expected outcome (Eligible). The agent's fundamental error was not recognizing that registered jobseeker status with genuine prospects of work constitutes a qualifying right to reside for pre-settled status holders.
