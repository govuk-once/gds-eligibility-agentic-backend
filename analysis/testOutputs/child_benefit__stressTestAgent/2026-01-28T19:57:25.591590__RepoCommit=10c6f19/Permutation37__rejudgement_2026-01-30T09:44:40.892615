**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of private fostering:** The agent properly recognized this as a private arrangement where the council is aware but not providing financial support.

2. **Accurate eligibility determination:** The agent correctly identified that:
   - Nina (10 years old) qualifies as she's under 16
   - The user has responsibility for day-to-day care
   - The user lives in the UK
   - No financial support is being received from the council or Nina's mother
   - Private fosterers who are financially supporting the child can claim Child Benefit

3. **Important caveat properly communicated:** The agent appropriately noted that only one person can claim Child Benefit at a time, and if Nina's mother is currently claiming, that would need to stop first.

4. **No income threshold issues:** The agent verified the user doesn't earn over £50,000, so no High Income Child Benefit Charge applies.

The agent's conclusion that the user "is eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina" directly matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** for this private fostering scenario.
