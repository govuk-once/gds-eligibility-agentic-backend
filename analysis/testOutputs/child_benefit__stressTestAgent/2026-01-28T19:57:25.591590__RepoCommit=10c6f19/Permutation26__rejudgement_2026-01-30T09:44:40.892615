**Justification:**

The agent determined that the user (Mo) is **not eligible** for Child Benefit because the child lives with his aunt who provides day-to-day care.

However, according to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, a person can claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with them **if they contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit to the child's upkeep** (which is £25.60 for an only/eldest child or £26.05 total in some contexts).

The key facts are:
- Mo contributes £15/week
- Mo's mother (the grandmother) contributes £15/week  
- Total contributions = £30/week

The guidance explicitly states that "Your payments still count if more than one person is contributing to the child's upkeep, as long as your payments together are worth at least as much as Child Benefit would be."

Since the combined contributions (£30) exceed the Child Benefit threshold (approximately £25.60-26.05), and the aunt is not claiming Child Benefit, **Mo should be eligible** to claim.

The agent incorrectly dismissed the relevance of the combined contributions, stating "The amount of money contributed doesn't determine who can claim Child Benefit." This contradicts the specific provisions for children living elsewhere.

**Expected outcome:** Eligible  
**Agent's communicated outcome:** Not eligible  

Therefore, the agent communicated an incorrect eligibility determination.
