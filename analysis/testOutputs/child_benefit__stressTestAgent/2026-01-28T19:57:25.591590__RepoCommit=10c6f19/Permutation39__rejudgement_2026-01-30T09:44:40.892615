**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Responsibility criterion met:** The agent confirmed the two adopted children (ages 6 and 8) live with the user, who is responsible for them.

2. **Adoption Allowance clarification:** The agent correctly stated that "receiving an adoption allowance from the council does not automatically prevent you from claiming Child Benefit - these are separate benefits and you may be entitled to both." This is accurate - adoption allowances (unlike fostering allowances) do not disqualify someone from Child Benefit.

3. **Age criterion met:** Both children are under 16.

4. **UK residency confirmed:** The user lives in the UK.

5. **No duplicate claims:** No one else is claiming Child Benefit for these children.

6. **Income consideration:** The agent appropriately checked the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold and confirmed it doesn't apply.

The agent's final determination - "You are eligible to claim Child Benefit for both of your children" - directly matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**. The agent also correctly emphasized that the adoption allowance does not affect this eligibility, which is the critical distinction in this scenario.
