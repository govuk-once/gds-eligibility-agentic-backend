**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of the apprenticeship rule**: The agent accurately explained that paid Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland do not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes. According to gov.uk guidance, apprenticeships in Scotland (and England and Northern Ireland) generally do not qualify for Child Benefit, unlike the specific exception for certain unpaid Welsh apprenticeships.

2. **Proper age consideration**: The agent correctly identified that while the child is 17 (under 20), Child Benefit continuation past age 16 requires the child to be in approved education or training, which a paid apprenticeship does not satisfy.

3. **Clear communication**: The agent clearly stated "you would **not be eligible**" and provided a thorough explanation of why the paid Modern Apprenticeship doesn't meet the criteria.

4. **Verification of circumstances**: The agent appropriately verified that the father is responsible for the child and that the child lives with him, though ultimately determined ineligibility based on the apprenticeship status.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**, and the reasoning provided is consistent with official Child Benefit eligibility rules for apprenticeships in Scotland.
