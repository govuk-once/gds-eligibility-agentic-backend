2026-01-28T20:24:26.973005 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T20:24:28.547936 [actor]: child not living with me but pay maintenence court order 50 week

2026-01-28T20:24:30.500943 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child who is not living with you, but you pay maintenance under a court order for 50 weeks.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for this child?

2026-01-28T20:24:31.995311 [actor]: dont know if someone claiming alredy how do i check

2026-01-28T20:24:34.829913 [root_agent]: That's an important question. Before we explore how to check that, let me ask you this:

Do you contribute at least the same amount toward the child's upkeep as someone who is getting Child Benefit would receive (which is currently £25.60 a week for the eldest or only child, or £16.95 a week for additional children)?

2026-01-28T20:24:36.553094 [actor]: ya pay 50 per week court made me not volentary tho does that count

2026-01-28T20:24:38.394529 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you pay £50 per week under a court order.

Let me ask you this: Does your child live with someone else on a regular basis, such as with their other parent or another family member?

2026-01-28T20:24:39.837772 [actor]: ya lives with mum full time

2026-01-28T20:24:42.278500 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your child lives with their mother full time, and you pay £50 per week in maintenance under a court order.

Let me ask: Do you and the child's mother have a shared care arrangement where the child spends roughly equal amounts of time living with each of you, or does the child only visit you rather than live with you for any regular period?

2026-01-28T20:24:44.048114 [actor]: no just visits child lives with mum all the time

2026-01-28T20:24:47.797807 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So the child lives with their mother full time and only visits you.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to let you know that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.

Here's why: Child Benefit is normally paid to the person the child lives with. Since your child lives with their mother full time, she would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit.

Even though you're contributing financially through court-ordered maintenance, the key factor for Child Benefit eligibility is who the child is living with on a regular basis. Since the child lives with their mother and only visits you, the mother would be the eligible claimant.

If the mother isn't already claiming Child Benefit, she should consider doing so as she would be entitled to it.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T20:24:49.460591 [actor]: ok thanks understand now not eligble

2026-01-28T20:24:53.289123 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to government guidance, a person who doesn't live with the child can claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay AND no one else is claiming it. The agent failed to establish whether anyone else was already claiming and prematurely concluded ineligibility without fully investigating this crucial factor.
