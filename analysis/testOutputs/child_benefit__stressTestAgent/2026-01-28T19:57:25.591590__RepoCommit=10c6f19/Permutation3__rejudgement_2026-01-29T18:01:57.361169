**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, stating that it would have stopped on 31st August last year when the son turned 16, and that being registered with a careers service does not qualify as approved education or training.

However, according to the expected outcome and the official government guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, there is an **extension period** that applies in this specific situation:

- The son is 16 or 17 years old (he's 17)
- He has left approved education or training (left school in June)
- He is registered with an approved careers service
- It is currently August, which is within 20 weeks of leaving education in June

Under these circumstances, Child Benefit can continue for up to **20 weeks** after the young person leaves education, provided they are registered with the Careers Service, Connexions Service, or equivalent.

The agent failed to recognize or apply this extension rule and incorrectly told the user they were not eligible. The correct outcome should have been that the user **is eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks** from when their son left education in June.

Therefore, the agent's communicated eligibility outcome does **not** agree with the expected outcome.
