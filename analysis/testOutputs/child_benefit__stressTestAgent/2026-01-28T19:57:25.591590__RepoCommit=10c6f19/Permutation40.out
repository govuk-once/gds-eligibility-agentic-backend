2026-01-28T20:20:07.618863 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, **do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:20:09.379540 [actor]: son in hospitl mentel health act detained

2026-01-28T20:20:11.789714 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a son who is detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act.

To help determine your eligibility for Child Benefit in this situation, I need to ask:

**Is your son under 16 years old, or is he under 20 and in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:20:13.093162 [actor]: hes 15 yrs old

2026-01-28T20:20:14.908384 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your son is 15 years old and detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act.

Let me ask you the next important question:

**Has your son been in hospital for more than 12 weeks (84 days)?**

2026-01-28T20:20:16.643681 [actor]: been there 10 weeks now

2026-01-28T20:20:18.861760 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your son is 15 years old, has been detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act for 10 weeks so far.

This is helpful to know. Let me ask you:

**Do you normally live with your son when he's not in hospital, or are you responsible for him?**

2026-01-28T20:20:20.585143 [actor]: yes he lives with me normaly before this happend

2026-01-28T20:20:22.191693 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your son normally lives with you when he's not in hospital.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your son?**

2026-01-28T20:20:24.398001 [actor]: yes i get it now worried might stop

2026-01-28T20:20:26.206013 [root_agent]: I understand your concern. Let me ask you one more important question to give you the most accurate information:

**Is your son expected to remain in hospital for longer than 12 weeks in total, or do you know when he might be discharged?**

2026-01-28T20:20:27.771891 [actor]: doctors say probly few more weeks so maybe 14 or 15 weeks total

2026-01-28T20:20:33.085896 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your situation.

Based on what you've told me, here's the good news: **You should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit for your son.**

Here's why:

- Your son is 15 years old (under 16), so he qualifies age-wise
- He normally lives with you, and you're responsible for him
- You're already receiving Child Benefit for him
- Even though he's detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act, and his stay may extend to 14-15 weeks total, **you can continue to claim Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks from when he went into hospital**

**Important point:** After those first 12 weeks in hospital, your Child Benefit payments will stop. However, as soon as your son comes home and is living with you again, your Child Benefit will restart.

Since he's been there 10 weeks and may be there for about 4-5 more weeks, you should expect:
- Your payments to continue for the next 2 weeks (to complete the 12-week period)
- Your payments to stop after that while he remains in hospital
- Your payments to resume once he returns home

**Do you have any questions about this, or is there anything else you'd like me to clarify?**

2026-01-28T20:20:34.875424 [actor]: ok so i still get it for now but stops after 12 weeks got it thanks

2026-01-28T20:20:38.516930 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit continues for up to 12 weeks when a child is detained in hospital under the Mental Health Act, correctly applied this to the user's situation (son has been there 10 weeks, so 2 weeks of eligibility remain), and properly advised that payments will stop after 12 weeks but resume when the child returns home.
