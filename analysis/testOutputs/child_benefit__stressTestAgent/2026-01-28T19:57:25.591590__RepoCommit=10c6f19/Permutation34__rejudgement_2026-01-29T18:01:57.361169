**Justification:**

The expected outcome for this scenario is **Not Eligible**, and the agent clearly communicated this outcome to the user.

Specifically, the agent stated: "Since your son has now been in custody for 10 weeks, this means you are currently **not eligible** to receive Child Benefit for him while he remains in youth custody."

The agent correctly:
1. Identified that the child is in youth custody (not residential care)
2. Applied the 8-week rule for children in custody
3. Determined that after 10 weeks in custody, the parent is not eligible for Child Benefit
4. Clearly communicated this "not eligible" outcome to the user

This aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** as specified in the scenario, where Mark has been in youth custody for 10 weeks (exceeding the 8-week threshold). The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and appropriately informed the parent of their ineligibility status.
