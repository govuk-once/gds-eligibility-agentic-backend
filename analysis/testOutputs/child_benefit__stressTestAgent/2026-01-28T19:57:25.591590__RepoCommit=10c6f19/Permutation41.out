2026-01-28T20:20:40.127512 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:20:41.788082 [actor]: child beneffit two kids ben and jerry dont live with me tho pay money every week

2026-01-28T20:20:44.122990 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have two children, Ben and Jerry, who don't live with you, but you pay money for them every week.

Let me ask: Do Ben and Jerry live with someone else who is their main carer (such as their other parent, a guardian, or another family member)?

2026-01-28T20:20:45.558090 [actor]: yes live with ex partner i pay 40 pounds week

2026-01-28T20:20:48.408632 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your children live with your ex-partner, and you pay £40 per week towards their care.

In this situation, generally the person the child lives with (your ex-partner) would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit, as they are the main carer.

However, let me ask: Does your ex-partner currently claim Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry?

2026-01-28T20:20:49.825564 [actor]: dunno maybe dont think so want to claim myself

2026-01-28T20:20:52.850377 [root_agent]: I understand you'd like to claim Child Benefit yourself.

To help clarify your situation: Child Benefit is normally paid to the person who is primarily responsible for the child - which typically means the person the child lives with most of the time.

Since Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner, your ex-partner would usually be the eligible person to claim. However, there are some specific circumstances where this might differ.

Let me ask: Are you involved in your children's day-to-day care at all, such as having them stay with you regularly for part of the week?

2026-01-28T20:20:54.561206 [actor]: no they stay with ex just send the 40 quid every week for both kids

2026-01-28T20:20:59.579631 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation clearly.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that you would **not be eligible** to claim Child Benefit in this situation.

Here's why: Child Benefit is paid to the person who is responsible for the child on a day-to-day basis - meaning the person the child normally lives with. Since Ben and Jerry live full-time with your ex-partner and you don't have them staying with you regularly, your ex-partner would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit for them.

The fact that you contribute financially by paying £40 per week shows you're supporting your children, which is important, but it doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit when the children don't live with you.

Your ex-partner should be the one to claim Child Benefit if they haven't already done so. If they're not claiming it currently, it would be worth encouraging them to apply, as it could provide additional financial support for Ben and Jerry's upbringing.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T20:21:04.606770 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because the children (Ben and Jerry) live full-time with my ex-partner who is their main carer, and I only provide financial support without day-to-day care responsibilities. This aligns with the expected outcome that I should not be eligible when children don't live with me.
