2026-01-28T20:22:27.373048 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T20:22:28.946552 [actor]: child in care comes home weekends

2026-01-28T20:22:31.077260 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a child who is in care but comes home on weekends.

To assess your eligibility, I need to understand your situation better. 

Are you responsible for this child - meaning do you have parental responsibility and does the child live with you, even if only at weekends?

2026-01-28T20:22:32.472701 [actor]: leo 12 years old local authority

2026-01-28T20:22:34.637218 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Leo is 12 years old and is in local authority care, but comes home to you on weekends.

To help determine your eligibility, I need to ask:

During the weekdays when Leo is in local authority care, does the local authority pay for the full cost of Leo's care and accommodation?

2026-01-28T20:22:36.059637 [actor]: comes saturday 10am leaves sunday 11am

2026-01-28T20:22:38.141927 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying the timing - so Leo is with you from Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am each week.

Let me ask this important question:

During the weekdays when Leo is in local authority care (Monday through Saturday morning), does the local authority pay for the **full cost** of Leo's care and accommodation?

2026-01-28T20:22:39.596567 [actor]: yes local authority pays full cost

2026-01-28T20:22:41.557688 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that the local authority pays the full cost of Leo's care during the week.

Now I need to ask:

Are you Leo's parent or are you the person who is responsible for Leo when he comes home on weekends?

2026-01-28T20:22:42.941586 [actor]: im the mother

2026-01-28T20:22:44.723119 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you're Leo's mother.

One more important question:

When Leo comes home on weekends (Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am), are you responsible for him during that time - meaning you're looking after him and meeting his needs while he's with you?

2026-01-28T20:22:46.227779 [actor]: yes i look after him saturdays

2026-01-28T20:22:50.354443 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all this information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on the rules for Child Benefit when a child is in care:**

Unfortunately, you are **not eligible** for Child Benefit for Leo in this situation.

Here's why: When a child is in local authority care and the local authority pays the full cost of their accommodation and maintenance, you cannot get Child Benefit - even if the child comes home to stay with you at weekends.

The key factor is that the local authority is paying for Leo's full care costs during the week. This means Child Benefit cannot be paid to you for the time he's with you on weekends.

I understand this may be disappointing news, but these are the rules as set out by the government for children in local authority care.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this decision?

2026-01-28T20:22:55.279567 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in care, you can claim Child Benefit if your child is in local authority care but comes to stay with you for part of the week, as long as you're responsible for them during that time. The agent failed to recognize that weekend care qualifies for Child Benefit eligibility.
