**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. According to the expected outcome provided, the correct determination should be **Eligible**.

However, upon careful review of the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit for children in hospital or care (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), the key rule states:

*"You cannot get Child Benefit if your child is in care for more than 8 weeks and the local authority pays for the full cost of looking after them, unless either:*
- *they're at home with you for more than 2 nights a week, or*
- *they're at home with you for at least 24 hours a week"*

In this scenario:
- Leo is in local authority care (confirmed >8 weeks by Criteria 1)
- The local authority pays full cost (confirmed)
- Leo is home from Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am = **25 hours per week**
- This meets the "at least 24 hours a week" threshold

Therefore, the mother **should be eligible** for Child Benefit because Leo spends 25 hours at home, which exceeds the 24-hour threshold.

The agent's determination that the user is **not eligible** does **NOT** agree with the expected outcome of **Eligible**. The agent failed to apply the 24-hour exception rule correctly.

**👎**
