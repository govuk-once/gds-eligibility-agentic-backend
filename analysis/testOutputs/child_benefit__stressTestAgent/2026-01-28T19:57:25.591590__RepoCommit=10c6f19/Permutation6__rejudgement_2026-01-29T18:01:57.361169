**Justification:**

I disagree with the evaluation judge's assessment. While the agent's communication could have been clearer and more direct, they ultimately communicated the **correct eligibility outcome**.

**Analysis:**

1. **The agent explicitly stated eligibility**: The agent clearly opens with "**you are eligible for Child Benefit**" and provides a checkmarked list of reasons why.

2. **The agent acknowledged the exception**: The agent specifically noted:
   - "After 12 weeks in hospital, Child Benefit normally stops"
   - "**However, if you're still contributing to her costs (which you are), you may be able to continue claiming beyond 12 weeks**"

3. **This matches the expected outcome**: The expected outcome is "Eligible (via Exception)" - which is exactly what the agent communicated. The user is spending £30/week on the child's upkeep, creating an exception to the 12-week rule.

4. **The recommendation was appropriate**: The agent prudently suggested contacting the Child Benefit Office to confirm ongoing eligibility, which is reasonable given the exception circumstances.

**The judge's criticism about "contradictory information" is overly harsh.** The agent was explaining both the general rule (stops after 12 weeks) AND the exception that applies to this case (continues if paying toward care). This is informative, not contradictory. The agent could have been more definitive in their language, but they did communicate that the user is eligible via the exception.
