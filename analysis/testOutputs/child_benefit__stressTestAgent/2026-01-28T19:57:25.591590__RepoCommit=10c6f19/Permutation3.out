2026-01-28T19:58:27.129677 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T19:58:28.934980 [actor]: son left scool in june looking for aprentisship

2026-01-28T19:58:30.598149 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your son left school in June and is looking for an apprenticeship.

Let me ask you this:

**How old is your son currently?**

2026-01-28T19:58:31.946108 [actor]: 17 lives with me

2026-01-28T19:58:35.119145 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your son is 17, lives with you, and left school in June while looking for an apprenticeship.

This is important for eligibility. Let me ask:

**Is your son currently registered with an approved careers service or with Connexions (or equivalent service in Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland) while he looks for work or an apprenticeship?**

This matters because once a child leaves education, they can remain eligible for Child Benefit until the 31st August following their 16th birthday, or longer if they're enrolled in approved education or training.

2026-01-28T19:58:36.495594 [actor]: yes registerd with careers service august now

2026-01-28T19:58:39.680124 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. So your son is 17, registered with the careers service, and it's now August.

Let me ask you an important question about his education:

**When exactly did your son leave education or training - what was his last day at school or college?**

I need to understand the specific timing because there are rules about how long Child Benefit can continue after a young person leaves education while they're looking for work or an apprenticeship.

2026-01-28T19:58:41.313115 [actor]: left in june told you alredy

2026-01-28T19:58:43.279933 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right, I apologize - you did tell me he left school in June.

Let me ask you this next question:

**Are you the person who is responsible for your son? In other words, do you live with him and are you responsible for his care and upbringing?**

2026-01-28T19:58:44.670238 [actor]: yes he lives with me said that

2026-01-28T19:58:46.870453 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right, and I apologize for asking again - you did tell me he lives with you.

Let me ask you one more important question:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your son, or are you asking about whether you can start claiming it or continue claiming it?**

2026-01-28T19:58:48.551623 [actor]: want to know if still get it

2026-01-28T19:58:51.791219 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying - you want to know if you can still receive Child Benefit for your son.

Based on the information you've provided, let me ask one final important question:

**Did your son turn 16 before or after the start of September in the school year when he left education in June?**

In other words, when is his birthday? This is crucial because the rules state that Child Benefit can continue until 31st August following a young person's 16th birthday if they've left education or approved training.

2026-01-28T19:58:53.099664 [actor]: hes 17 now

2026-01-28T19:58:56.024681 [root_agent]: Thank you. I understand he's 17 now. Let me be more specific:

**In which month did he turn 16? Was it before or after September of last year?**

I need to know this because Child Benefit generally stops on 31st August following the date when a young person turns 16, unless they remain in approved education or training. Since your son is 17 now and left school in June, this timing is important to determine your current eligibility.

2026-01-28T19:58:57.694600 [actor]: turned 16 last year before september

2026-01-28T19:59:02.044105 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is very important.

Based on what you've told me:
- Your son turned 16 last year (before September)
- He left school in June this year
- He's now 17 and registered with the careers service looking for an apprenticeship

**I need to inform you that you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit for your son.**

Here's why: Child Benefit stops on 31st August following the date when a young person turns 16, unless they continue in approved education or training. Since your son turned 16 before September last year, your Child Benefit would have stopped on 31st August last year.

Being registered with the careers service while looking for work or an apprenticeship unfortunately does not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes. To remain eligible after 16, a young person must be enrolled in and attending approved education or training (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs, or an apprenticeship program itself).

Once your son starts an approved apprenticeship, you may be able to claim Child Benefit again if he's still under 20.

Do you have any questions about this?

2026-01-28T19:59:06.724800 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rule that Child Benefit stops on 31st August following the date a young person turns 16 unless they remain in approved education or training, and correctly identified that being registered with a careers service while looking for work does not qualify as approved education or training.
