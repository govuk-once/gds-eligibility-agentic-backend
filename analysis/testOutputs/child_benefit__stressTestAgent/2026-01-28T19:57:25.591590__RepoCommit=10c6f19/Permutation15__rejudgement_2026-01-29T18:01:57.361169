**Justification:** The agent correctly determined that Mike is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible." The agent's reasoning was accurate and thorough:

1. The agent correctly identified that Mike's daughter (12) does not live with him but with her mother
2. The agent appropriately explained that to claim Child Benefit when a child lives elsewhere, the applicant must contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit payment
3. The agent accurately stated the Child Benefit rate (£25.60/week in their response, vs £26.05/week in the scenario - a minor difference that doesn't affect the outcome)
4. The agent correctly determined that Mike's £10/week contribution is insufficient to meet the eligibility threshold
5. The agent properly concluded Mike is not eligible and that the mother would be the eligible claimant

The agent's conclusion aligns perfectly with the expected outcome based on Criteria 1 (Responsibility), where Mike's contribution of £10/week falls well short of the required £26.05/week threshold.
