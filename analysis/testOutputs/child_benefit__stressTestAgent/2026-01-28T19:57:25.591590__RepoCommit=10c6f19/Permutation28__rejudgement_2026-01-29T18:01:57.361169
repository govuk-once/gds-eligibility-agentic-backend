**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of the critical issue**: The agent properly identified that a standard tourist visa does not provide "right to reside" status, which is a fundamental requirement for Child Benefit eligibility.

2. **Accurate explanation**: The agent clearly explained that Child Benefit requires both:
   - Living in the UK, AND
   - Having the right to reside in the UK

3. **Proper application to the scenario**: The agent correctly applied these criteria to Maria's situation as a US citizen on a 6-month tourist visa with no work authorization.

4. **Clear communication of ineligibility**: The agent explicitly stated "you would not be eligible for Child Benefit in your current situation" and provided a comprehensive explanation of why.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome (Criteria 2: Immigration Status / Right to Reside - Response: No), and the communication was clear, accurate, and appropriately justified. The original evaluation judge's assessment (✓) was correct.
