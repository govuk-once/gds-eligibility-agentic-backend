**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Crown Servant Exception Properly Applied:** The agent correctly identified that as a member of the UK armed forces serving abroad, the user is exempt from the standard UK residency requirement. This is explicitly stated in UK government guidance for Crown servants posted overseas.

2. **All Eligibility Criteria Met:**
   - Children are under 16 (ages 8 and 10) ✓
   - User is responsible for the children (living with them on base) ✓
   - UK National Insurance contributions confirmed ✓
   - No competing German benefits ✓
   - Crown servant status (armed forces) ✓

3. **Accurate Communication:** The agent explicitly stated "You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided clear reasoning, specifically noting: "As a member of the UK armed forces serving abroad, you can claim Child Benefit even though you're living in Germany."

4. **Correct Application of Rules:** The agent properly understood that armed forces personnel stationed overseas can claim Child Benefit despite not physically residing in the UK, which aligns with the exception criteria for Crown servants.

The agent's eligibility determination agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
