**Justification:**

The expected outcome is that Beatrice is **Eligible** for Child Benefit. The agent correctly concluded that she "can continue to claim Child Benefit."

The agent's reasoning was sound:
1. The agent identified that the child has been in local authority care for 10 weeks (exceeding the 8-week threshold)
2. The agent correctly established that the husband is contributing £30/week to the carer
3. The agent properly applied the rule that contributions from a partner count toward maintaining eligibility when a child is in care
4. The agent concluded that Beatrice remains eligible because of these contributions

This aligns with the scenario's Criteria 2, which states that "a partner's money counts as the applicant's contribution, provided they are married or civil partners and living together." The agent correctly communicated that Beatrice can continue claiming Child Benefit due to her husband's weekly contributions, which matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
