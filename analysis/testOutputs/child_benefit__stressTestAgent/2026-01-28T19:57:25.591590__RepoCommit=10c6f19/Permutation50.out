2026-01-28T20:26:51.802303 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T20:26:53.590574 [actor]: child benefit scotland 16 edinbrugh left scool

2026-01-28T20:26:55.948240 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So I understand you have a 16-year-old in Edinburgh who has left school.

To assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to clarify: Is your 16-year-old currently in any approved education or training (such as college, an apprenticeship, or other approved courses)?

2026-01-28T20:26:57.611995 [actor]: no one left behind programm

2026-01-28T20:27:00.241698 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. The "No One Left Behind" programme is a Scottish employment support initiative.

To help determine if this counts as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes, could you tell me: Is your 16-year-old enrolled in this programme on a full-time basis (meaning at least 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience)?

2026-01-28T20:27:01.711330 [actor]: yes full time trainee enrolled

2026-01-28T20:27:04.611251 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your 16-year-old is enrolled as a full-time trainee.

Now I need to ask about your relationship with the child: Are you responsible for the child, meaning do they live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards their upkeep (even if they don't live with you)?

2026-01-28T20:27:05.975217 [actor]: child lives with me responsible

2026-01-28T20:27:08.604458 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your 16-year-old lives with you and you're responsible for them.

Next question: Are you the only person responsible for this child, or does anyone else also have parental responsibility or care for them (such as another parent or guardian living in the same household)?

2026-01-28T20:27:09.868056 [actor]: only me no one else

2026-01-28T20:27:11.593276 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just one more important question:

Are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-28T20:27:13.192605 [actor]: live in edinburgh scotland uk

2026-01-28T20:27:17.724155 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on your circumstances, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:
- You have a 16-year-old child living with you in the UK (Edinburgh, Scotland)
- You are responsible for this child
- Your child is in approved full-time education or training (enrolled as a full-time trainee in the No One Left Behind programme, which is at least 12 hours per week)
- You are the only person responsible for the child

For Child Benefit purposes, you can claim for a young person aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training. Full-time training programmes like the one your child is enrolled in typically qualify.

**Important note:** Child Benefit can continue until the 31st August following your child's 16th birthday if they're in education or training, and can extend beyond that if they remain in approved education or training until they turn 20.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about claiming or managing your Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:27:20.724143 [actor]: ok thanks got what i needed

2026-01-28T20:27:23.137852 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am eligible for Child Benefit based on having a 16-year-old in full-time approved training (No One Left Behind programme) living with me in the UK, and correctly applied the rule that Child Benefit extends to age 16-20 for children in approved education or training.
