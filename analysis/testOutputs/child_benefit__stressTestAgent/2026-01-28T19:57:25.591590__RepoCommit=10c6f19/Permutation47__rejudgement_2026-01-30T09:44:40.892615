**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, a person who doesn't live with the child **can** claim Child Benefit if:

1. They contribute at least the equivalent amount of Child Benefit to the child's upkeep (£25.60/week for eldest child)
2. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for that child

In this case:
- The user pays £50/week in maintenance (well above the £25.60 threshold)
- Court-ordered payments **do count** as contributions according to government guidance
- The critical question of whether anyone else is currently claiming was **never definitively established**

The user explicitly stated "dont know if someone claiming alredy how do i check" - but the agent never helped verify this crucial eligibility factor. The agent moved on to other questions and then concluded ineligibility based solely on the living arrangement, without confirming whether the mother was actually claiming.

**The expected outcome is "Eligible"** - meaning under the right circumstances (if no one else is claiming), this user would be eligible. The agent should have helped establish whether anyone else was claiming before making a determination. By concluding the user was definitely ineligible without this information, the agent communicated an incorrect outcome that disagrees with the expected outcome.
