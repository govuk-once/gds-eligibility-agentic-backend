**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user (Chloe, age 15) is **not eligible** to claim Child Benefit for her baby Mia. The agent explicitly stated: "You cannot claim Child Benefit for Mia yourself while: You're under 16, You're dependent on your parents, Your parents are providing the home and financial support for both you and Mia."

However, the expected outcome is that Chloe is **eligible** to claim Child Benefit for Mia (though potentially financially suboptimal). According to the scenario notes, "a person under 16 can claim for their own child" and "functionally, Chloe *is* eligible to claim."

While the agent correctly identified that it would likely be more financially beneficial for Chloe's parents to claim (since they would lose the Child Benefit they receive for Chloe if she claims for Mia), the agent incorrectly stated that Chloe **cannot** claim due to her age and circumstances. The correct approach would have been to explain that:
1. Yes, Chloe CAN claim Child Benefit for Mia
2. However, this may result in less overall benefit to the family
3. It would usually be more financially beneficial for her parents to claim

The agent communicated an incorrect eligibility outcome (not eligible) when the correct outcome is eligible.
