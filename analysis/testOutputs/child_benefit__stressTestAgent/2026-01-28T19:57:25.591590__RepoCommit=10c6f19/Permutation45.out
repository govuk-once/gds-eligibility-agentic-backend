2026-01-28T20:22:57.399795 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:22:59.092281 [actor]: daugter in hosptal 8 yrs old can i get mony

2026-01-28T20:23:01.724927 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have an 8-year-old daughter who is in hospital.

To help assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask: **Are you responsible for your daughter?** 

By this I mean - do you normally look after her and make decisions about her care, even though she is currently in hospital?

2026-01-28T20:23:03.363623 [actor]: yes i visit her evry day she been there long time

2026-01-28T20:23:05.342336 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you are actively involved in your daughter's care despite her being in hospital for a long time.

Let me ask you this: **Does your daughter live with you, or is she expected to return home to live with you when she leaves hospital?**

2026-01-28T20:23:07.262730 [actor]: she in hosptal now been ther 14 weeks i go see her

2026-01-28T20:23:09.141459 [root_agent]: I understand - your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks and you visit her regularly.

Let me ask: **Before your daughter went into hospital, did she normally live with you at home?**

2026-01-28T20:23:10.685222 [actor]: yes she livd with me befor hosptal

2026-01-28T20:23:12.500705 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. One more important question:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your daughter, or are you looking to start claiming it now?**

2026-01-28T20:23:13.922143 [actor]: looking to get it now can i get the mony

2026-01-28T20:23:18.957519 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you should be eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter.** Here's why:

✓ Your daughter is 8 years old (under 16)
✓ You are responsible for her - you visit her every day and were her primary carer before hospital
✓ She normally lived with you before going into hospital
✓ Even though she's been in hospital for 14 weeks, you can still claim Child Benefit

**Important information about hospital stays:**
- You can continue to claim Child Benefit (or start a new claim) for a child who is in hospital for up to **12 weeks**
- After 12 weeks in hospital, Child Benefit usually stops
- However, since your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks, you may need to discuss your specific circumstances with the Child Benefit Office

**What you should do:**
Contact the Child Benefit Office to make your claim and explain your daughter's situation. They will be able to advise you on your specific case given that she has been in hospital for longer than 12 weeks.

Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-28T20:23:20.741733 [actor]: so i get the mony or not? confusd about 12 weeks she been there 14

2026-01-28T20:23:24.842596 [root_agent]: I understand the confusion - let me be clearer.

**Based on the standard rules, Child Benefit normally stops after a child has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks.**

Since your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks (which is longer than 12 weeks), **you may not be eligible for Child Benefit for the period she's been in hospital beyond those first 12 weeks.**

**However**, you should still contact the Child Benefit Office because:
- There may be exceptions or special circumstances that apply to your situation
- They can tell you definitively whether you can claim
- If your daughter is expected to come home soon, you'll want to have everything set up

I cannot give you a definite "yes, you'll get the money" because the 14-week hospital stay exceeds the standard 12-week limit. The Child Benefit Office will need to assess your individual case.

**Does your daughter have an expected date to come home from hospital?**

2026-01-28T20:23:26.577672 [actor]: i visit every day for hours does that matter spend time with her

2026-01-28T20:23:30.454546 [root_agent]: That's a very good question, and I can understand why you're asking - you're clearly very involved in caring for your daughter.

Unfortunately, **the frequency of your visits doesn't change the 12-week hospital rule**. The rule is specifically about where the child is living, not about how often you visit or how much time you spend with them.

Even though you visit every day for hours and are clearly providing care and support, if your daughter has been continuously in hospital for more than 12 weeks, the standard rule is that Child Benefit stops after those 12 weeks.

**However**, let me ask you this: **Is your daughter expected to come home from hospital at some point, or is this a longer-term/permanent hospital stay?**

This may be relevant to your situation and what support might be available to you.

2026-01-28T20:23:32.151678 [actor]: i go see her every day hours and hours does that count for anything with the benefit

2026-01-28T20:23:36.869852 [root_agent]: I understand your question, and I can see how important it is to you that you're spending hours with your daughter every day - you're clearly a dedicated parent.

However, I need to be honest with you: **for Child Benefit purposes, the daily visits unfortunately don't change the eligibility rules.**

Child Benefit is based on:
- Where the child normally lives
- Whether they're living with you at home

When a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks continuously, Child Benefit typically stops - regardless of how often you visit or how many hours you spend there.

**But here's what's important:** You should still contact the Child Benefit Office directly because:
- They can review your complete situation
- There may be other benefits or support available to you as a parent of a child in long-term hospital care
- They can give you definitive guidance on your specific case

I know this isn't the answer you were hoping for. **Is there anything else about your daughter's situation you'd like to tell me that might be relevant?**

2026-01-28T20:23:38.433276 [actor]: ok so i dont get it then becaus she been there 14 weeks and i just visit

2026-01-28T20:23:42.770848 [root_agent]: Based on the standard Child Benefit rules and what you've told me, **it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

- Your daughter has been in hospital continuously for 14 weeks
- Child Benefit normally stops after 12 weeks of continuous hospital stay
- The regular visits, while showing you're a caring parent, don't change this rule

**However, I strongly recommend you still contact the Child Benefit Office directly** because:
- They can confirm this for your specific situation
- They may be aware of exceptions I'm not able to assess
- They can advise you on when you can claim again (for example, when your daughter comes home)
- They may be able to direct you to other financial support that might be available for parents of children in long-term hospital care

I'm sorry this isn't the outcome you were hoping for. Your dedication to visiting your daughter every day is clearly important for her wellbeing, even if it doesn't affect Child Benefit eligibility.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?**

2026-01-28T20:23:47.898222 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the 12-week hospital rule and correctly concluded that the claimant would not be eligible for Child Benefit since their daughter had been in hospital for 14 weeks, which exceeds the maximum period allowed under the standard rules.
