2026-01-28T20:15:26.375534 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or young person who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:15:27.771067 [actor]: child benefit daughter 18 universty

2026-01-28T20:15:30.190141 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have an 18-year-old daughter who is at university.

**Is your daughter currently in full-time approved education or training that is not higher education (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or certain vocational courses)?**

Note: Higher education courses (like university degrees) are generally not covered for Child Benefit purposes after age 18.

2026-01-28T20:15:31.838603 [actor]: daughter lives home goes universty everyday just started degree

2026-01-28T20:15:36.362243 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. I understand your daughter lives at home with you and commutes to university daily, where she's just started a degree course.

Unfortunately, once a young person starts a **higher education course** (such as a university degree), Child Benefit generally stops, even if they're under 20. Higher education courses are not counted as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

However, I need to check one important detail:

**When did your daughter turn 18, and when exactly did she start her university degree course?**

This is important because Child Benefit can continue until the Monday following the last day of the week containing 31 August (often called the "extension period") after they turn 16, if they remain in approved education - but not higher education.

2026-01-28T20:15:37.908763 [actor]: turned 18 in march started uni september still 18 now

2026-01-28T20:15:41.292064 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your daughter turned 18 in March and started university in September, and she's still 18 now.

Based on the rules, I need to clarify one more thing:

**Was your daughter in any approved full-time education or training (such as A-levels, BTECs, or similar non-higher education courses) between turning 18 in March and starting university in September?**

This is important because:
- Child Benefit can continue for someone aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training (but NOT higher education)
- Once they start a higher education course like a university degree, Child Benefit stops
- So if she was in approved education after turning 18 but before starting university, you may have been eligible during that period

2026-01-28T20:15:42.813324 [actor]: yes finished college a levels in june then started uni september

2026-01-28T20:15:47.219791 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that timeline.

Based on what you've told me, here's the situation with your Child Benefit eligibility:

**Between March (when she turned 18) and the end of August:**
- Your daughter was still in approved education (A-levels at college)
- Child Benefit can continue until the Monday following the last day of the week containing 31 August after someone turns 16, as long as they remain in approved education or training
- So you **would have been eligible** for Child Benefit during this period

**From September onwards (when she started university):**
- Once your daughter started her university degree course, Child Benefit stops
- Higher education courses like university degrees are not counted as approved education for Child Benefit purposes
- So you are **not eligible** for Child Benefit from September onwards

**Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit, or would you like to know about making a claim for the period when you were eligible (March to August)?**

2026-01-28T20:15:52.870092 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit would have been available from March to August while the daughter was completing A-levels (approved education), but stopped in September when she started her university degree (higher education), which is the correct application of Child Benefit rules.
