**Justification:**

The agent made a critical error in applying the "Linking Rule" for hospital stays. Let me analyze the timeline:

1. **First hospital stay:** 10 weeks
2. **Home:** 2 weeks (15 days before readmission, as clarified by the user)
3. **Second hospital stay:** 3 weeks (current, ongoing)

**The Critical Error:**

The agent stated: "If your child comes home for at least one night between hospital stays, the 12-week count starts again from the beginning."

However, according to the Linking Rule on gov.uk, if a child returns to hospital within **28 days** of leaving, the hospital stays are "linked" and count cumulatively toward the 12-week limit. Since Arthur returned after only 15 days (well within the 28-day window), the stays should be linked.

**Cumulative calculation:** 10 weeks + 3 weeks = 13 weeks total

Since the cumulative hospital time exceeds 12 weeks, Child Benefit eligibility would cease after the 12th cumulative week (unless Jenny is contributing to Arthur's upkeep, which wasn't established).

**Expected outcome:** Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)

**Agent's communicated outcome:** Eligible

The agent's outcome directly contradicts the expected outcome, making this a clear failure to communicate the correct eligibility determination.
