**Justification:**

The agent's assessment is **incomplete and incorrect** based on the specific scenario presented.

**What the agent got wrong:**

1. **Overlooked the contribution amount threshold**: The agent failed to assess whether Martin's £40/week contribution meets the minimum threshold required under the "contributions exception" rules for Child Benefit eligibility when children live elsewhere.

2. **Missed the critical allocation mechanism**: According to the scenario, the total Child Benefit value is £43.30/week (£26.05 for the eldest + £17.25 for the second child). Martin contributes £40/week, which is close to the full amount. The agent should have explored:
   - Whether his contribution meets the threshold for either child
   - The option for Martin to request **unequal allocation** of his contribution (£26.05 to Ben, £13.95 to Jerry)

3. **Incorrect blanket determination**: The agent concluded Martin is "not eligible" without considering that:
   - Under the **equal split default** (£20 each), Martin would fail for Ben but potentially qualify for Jerry
   - Under the **unequal allocation request** (which the scenario explicitly states Martin can make), Martin would be **eligible for Ben at full rate** but not for Jerry

**Expected Outcome**: Eligible for Ben (Full Rate), Not Eligible for Jerry (by explicitly allocating his contribution unequally).

**Agent's Outcome**: Not eligible for either child.

These outcomes do not match.
