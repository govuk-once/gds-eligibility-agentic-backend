**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

The agent systematically worked through all relevant criteria:

1. **Child's age**: Leo is 8 years old (under 16) ✓
2. **Responsibility**: The parents are responsible for Leo ✓
3. **Living arrangements**: Leo lives with the parents ✓
4. **Immigration/residency**: Both parents are UK nationals ✓
5. **State support**: Leo is not in hospital or care ✓
6. **High Income Child Benefit Charge**: Neither parent earns over £50,000 individually (Tom earns £35,000, Sarah earns £15,000) ✓

The agent correctly concluded: "you are eligible for Child Benefit" and explained that they can "receive the full Child Benefit amount without any tax implications."

This outcome matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** for this standard family scenario.
