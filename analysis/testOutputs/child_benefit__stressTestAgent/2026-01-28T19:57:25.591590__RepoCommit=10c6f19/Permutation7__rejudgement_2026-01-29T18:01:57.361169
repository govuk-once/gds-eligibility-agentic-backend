**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user is **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Eligible (via Exception)**.

According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit for children in hospital or care (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), there is a specific exception: if a child in care spends **at least one night a week at home** (or 24 hours a week), the parent can still claim Child Benefit.

The user clearly stated multiple times that their son:
- Comes home every weekend
- Stays Friday evening to Sunday evening
- Spends 2 nights in a row at home (Friday and Saturday nights)

This meets the exception criteria. Despite the user explicitly asking "but he stays 2 nights friday saturdai at home every week", the agent failed to recognize this exception and continued to incorrectly conclude the user was not eligible.

The agent's final determination was: "You are likely NOT eligible for Child Benefit while your son is living in the children's home during the week" - which directly contradicts the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, noting the agent "failed to identify this exception despite the user clearly stating their son stays home Friday and Saturday nights every week."
