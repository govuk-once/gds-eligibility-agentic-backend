**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Hospital duration exceeded**: The child has been in hospital for 14 weeks, which exceeds the 12-week limit specified in Child Benefit rules for children in hospital care.

2. **Expenditure exception not met**: The user only visits the child daily but does not spend money on the child's upkeep (food, clothes, gifts, etc.). The permutation scenario explicitly states Maria "does not buy food, clothes, or gifts, as the hospital provides everything." The expenditure exception requires **regularly spending money** on the child, which visiting alone does not satisfy.

3. **Agent's final determination**: The agent clearly stated: "it appears you would not be eligible for Child Benefit" and explained this was because the hospital stay exceeded 12 weeks and visits alone don't change the eligibility rules.

4. **Appropriate caveats**: While the agent appropriately suggested contacting the Child Benefit Office for confirmation and possible exceptions, they correctly conveyed the core eligibility determination as "not eligible" under standard rules.

The agent's communication aligns with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** for this scenario.
