**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Crown Servant Exception Applied Correctly**: The agent properly recognized that as a member of the UK armed forces stationed abroad, the user is exempt from the standard UK residency requirement. This directly addresses Criteria 2 in the scenario.

2. **All Eligibility Criteria Met**: The agent verified:
   - Children under 16 (ages 8 and 10) ✓
   - Responsible for the children (living together on base) ✓
   - UK National Insurance contributions ✓
   - No conflicting German benefits ✓
   - Crown servant status (UK armed forces posted overseas) ✓

3. **Explicit Eligibility Statement**: The agent clearly stated "You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided a comprehensive explanation of why this is the case.

4. **Accurate Legal Understanding**: The agent correctly explained that "The UK allows armed forces personnel stationed overseas to claim Child Benefit for their children, as long as they meet the other eligibility criteria - which you do."

The agent's assessment matches the expected outcome that Major Thompson (UK armed forces member in Germany with family) is eligible for Child Benefit under the Crown servant exception.
