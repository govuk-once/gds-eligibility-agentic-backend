2026-01-28T20:17:16.810448 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:17:18.317955 [actor]: child benefit for 17 year old maried still in scool

2026-01-28T20:17:20.035283 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask some clarifying questions to assess eligibility.

Is the 17-year-old still in full-time approved education or training (not higher education)?

2026-01-28T20:17:21.597501 [actor]: yes doing a levels lives with me

2026-01-28T20:17:23.627227 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful - the child is doing A-levels and lives with you.

Now, you mentioned the 17-year-old is married. Can you confirm: is the 17-year-old themselves married or in a civil partnership?

2026-01-28T20:17:25.417429 [actor]: yes married to girlfriend she moved in with us

2026-01-28T20:17:27.906856 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Let me ask another important question:

Are you (the person claiming) responsible for the child? In other words, are you the one who looks after them and meets the costs of supporting them?

2026-01-28T20:17:29.354011 [actor]: yes i am the father i pay for everything rashid needs

2026-01-28T20:17:31.344462 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you one more question:

Do you normally live in the UK? (This means the UK is your permanent home, even if you're away temporarily.)

2026-01-28T20:17:32.595569 [actor]: yes live in uk all my life

2026-01-28T20:17:38.914980 [root_agent]: 
Let me review the information gathered:
- The claimant is the father of a 17-year-old named Rashid
- Rashid is married and his wife lives with them
- Rashid is still in full-time approved education (doing A-levels)
- Rashid lives with the claimant
- The claimant is responsible for Rashid and pays for everything he needs
- The claimant lives in the UK

Now I need to check the eligibility criteria based on the gov.uk links provided:

From https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility:
- You can claim for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training
- Rashid is 17 and doing A-levels (approved education), so age-wise he qualifies
- Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child
- You must be responsible for the child

Key question: Does marriage affect eligibility?

From the eligibility page, there's a specific note that you cannot get Child Benefit for a child who is:
- married or in a civil partnership (unless they were in approved education or training before they got married or formed a civil partnership and continued without a break)

This is the critical point. The 17-year-old is married. The question is whether Rashid was already in approved education BEFORE getting married and has continued without a break.

I need to ask this question to determine eligibility.


Thank you for providing all that information. I have one final important question:

Was Rashid already doing his A-levels (or in approved education or training) **before** he got married, and has he continued without taking a break?

2026-01-28T20:17:40.514197 [actor]: yes he started a levels last september then got maried in february still doing them now

2026-01-28T20:17:44.904947 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that timeline. Based on the information you've given me:

**You should be eligible for Child Benefit for Rashid.**

Here's why:
- Rashid is 17 years old (under 20)
- He's in approved full-time education (A-levels)
- He started his A-levels in September before getting married in February
- He has continued his education without a break after marriage
- You are responsible for him and he lives with you
- You live in the UK

The key point is that although Rashid is married, he was already in approved education (A-levels) **before** he got married and has continued without a break. According to the eligibility rules, you can still claim Child Benefit in these circumstances.

If you haven't already claimed, you can apply for Child Benefit. If you're already receiving it, you should be able to continue receiving it as long as Rashid remains in approved education or training (which can continue until he turns 20, as long as the course finishes before his 20th birthday).

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:17:50.265843 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the exception rule that allows Child Benefit to continue when a child under 20 marries after starting approved education and continues without a break, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (via Exception)".
