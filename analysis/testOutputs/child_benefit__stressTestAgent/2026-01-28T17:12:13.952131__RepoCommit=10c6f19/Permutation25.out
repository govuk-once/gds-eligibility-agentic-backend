2026-01-28T17:26:41.118406 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T17:26:42.948060 [actor]: child in care 10 weks how do i get benfit

2026-01-28T17:26:45.392972 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. I can see you have a child who has been in care for 10 weeks.

Let me ask you an important question to help determine your eligibility:

**Is your child expected to be in care (such as in a children's home or with foster parents) for more than 12 weeks in total?**

2026-01-28T17:26:47.017806 [actor]: husband pays 30 pound weekly to carer

2026-01-28T17:26:49.908562 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. Let me clarify the situation:

**Is your child currently living with foster carers or in local authority care, and your husband is paying £30 weekly towards their care costs?**

I need to understand this clearly because it affects Child Benefit eligibility - particularly whether you or someone else (like the foster carer) might be entitled to claim.

2026-01-28T17:26:51.408472 [actor]: yes local authorty care husband pays carer

2026-01-28T17:26:53.945564 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. So your child is in local authority care and your husband pays £30 weekly to the carer.

Now I need to ask: **How long is your child expected to remain in local authority care in total - is it expected to be more than 12 weeks, or is it a shorter-term arrangement?**

This is important because the rules are different depending on whether the care period is under or over 12 weeks.

2026-01-28T17:26:55.857670 [actor]: been 10 weeks now dont know how long more

2026-01-28T17:26:58.191415 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your child has been in care for 10 weeks, and you're unsure how long they'll remain there.

Let me ask you this: **Before your child went into local authority care, were you receiving Child Benefit for them?**

This will help me understand your current situation and what you might be entitled to.

2026-01-28T17:26:59.577211 [actor]: no wasnt recieving before

2026-01-28T17:27:02.273173 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you weren't receiving Child Benefit before your child went into care.

Let me ask: **Are you and your husband responsible for your child - meaning, do you have parental responsibility, and is your child living in local authority care temporarily while still being your dependent child?**

I'm asking because even though your child is in care and you're contributing to their costs, there are specific rules about who can claim Child Benefit when a child is in local authority care.

2026-01-28T17:27:03.942536 [actor]: yes my child leo is 5 husband is stepfather we responsible

2026-01-28T17:27:07.017932 [root_agent]: Thank you for that helpful information. So Leo is your 5-year-old child, your husband is his stepfather, and you both have parental responsibility for him.

Let me ask an important question: **When Leo is in local authority care, does the local authority or the foster carer receive any payments or allowances from the government for looking after him?**

This is important because it affects who can claim Child Benefit - generally, if the local authority or foster carer receives payments for caring for a child, the parent cannot claim Child Benefit during that time.

2026-01-28T17:27:08.684832 [actor]: dont know about payments just know husband sends 30 pound

2026-01-28T17:27:11.574167 [root_agent]: Thank you. Let me ask you another important question to understand your situation better:

**Has the local authority told you whether this care arrangement is temporary (with Leo expected to return home to you), or is it a longer-term arrangement?**

I'm asking because this helps determine your eligibility - the rules can differ based on whether it's a short-term situation or a more permanent care arrangement.

2026-01-28T17:27:13.196267 [actor]: temporary arrangement they said

2026-01-28T17:27:15.548528 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that it's a temporary arrangement.

Now let me ask: **During the time Leo has been in local authority care, have you maintained regular contact with him - such as visiting him or staying involved in his care?**

This is relevant because maintaining your parental role and contact during temporary care can affect Child Benefit eligibility.

2026-01-28T17:27:16.920683 [actor]: yes visit him regularly every week

2026-01-28T17:27:21.039213 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful to know that you visit Leo regularly every week and maintain contact.

Based on what you've told me, let me explain your situation:

**Unfortunately, you are not eligible to claim Child Benefit while Leo is in local authority care.**

Here's why:
- When a child is being looked after by the local authority (in foster care or a children's home), the local authority or the foster carer receives payments to cover the child's care
- During this time, parents cannot claim Child Benefit, even if they are contributing financially (like your husband's £30 weekly payment) and maintaining regular contact

**However, there is good news:**
- If Leo returns home to live with you from the local authority care, you will then be able to claim Child Benefit for him
- Since this is described as a temporary arrangement, once he comes back to live with you permanently, you should apply for Child Benefit at that time

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or this situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T17:27:26.445537 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that parents cannot claim Child Benefit while their child is in local authority care, as the local authority or foster carer receives payments for the child's care during this time, which aligns with the official guidance on children in care.
