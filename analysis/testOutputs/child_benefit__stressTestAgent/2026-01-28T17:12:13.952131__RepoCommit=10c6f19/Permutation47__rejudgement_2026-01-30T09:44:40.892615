**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "You are not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation."

However, the expected outcome according to the scenario is: **Eligible.**

**Analysis of the discrepancy:**

The scenario describes "Permutation 47: The 'Court Order' Contributor" where James pays £50 per week under a court order and argues he shouldn't be eligible because it's not "voluntary." The scenario explicitly states under "Criteria 1: Contribution Source" that:

- *Question:* Do forced payments count as contributions?
- *Response:* **Yes. Payments made under a court order or agreement count towards the maintenance requirement for Child Benefit eligibility.**

The scenario appears to be testing whether mandatory court-ordered payments qualify as contributions toward Child Benefit eligibility. According to the scenario guidance, they should count, making the person eligible.

The agent, however, applied the standard rule that only the main carer (the person the child lives with) can claim Child Benefit, and concluded the user is not eligible since they don't live with or provide day-to-day care for the child.

**Conclusion:**

The agent's eligibility determination (**not eligible**) contradicts the expected outcome (**eligible**), therefore the agent failed to communicate the correct outcome.
