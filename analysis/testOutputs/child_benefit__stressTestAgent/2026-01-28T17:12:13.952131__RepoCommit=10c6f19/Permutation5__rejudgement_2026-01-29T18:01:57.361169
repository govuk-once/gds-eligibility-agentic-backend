**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user was **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome for this scenario is that the user should be **eligible**.

**Why the agent's assessment was incorrect:**

1. **The user contributes £150/month** (approximately £34.60/week), which **exceeds the current Child Benefit rate** of approximately £26.05/week (£113/month for the first child).

2. **The mother is not claiming Child Benefit** - this is crucial because it means there's no concurrent claim that would give her priority.

3. **The "contributing to upkeep" exception applies**: According to [gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else), if you contribute at least as much as the Child Benefit amount toward a child's upkeep, you can claim even if the child doesn't live with you.

4. **The agent made an incorrect assumption**: The agent concluded that because the mother provides housing and day-to-day care, she "likely contributes more." However, the relevant test is whether the applicant contributes **at least the Child Benefit amount** (which Mark does), not whether he contributes the most overall.

5. **Mark meets all criteria**:
   - Responsible for the child (contributes over £150/month)
   - Child is 10 (eligible age)
   - Lives in UK (meets residency)
   - Contributes more than CB amount (exception to living arrangement requirement)
   - No one else is claiming

The agent should have determined Mark was **eligible** to claim Child Benefit.
