**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "if your daughter is receiving a wage or salary for her apprenticeship, you are likely NOT eligible for Child Benefit."

However, the expected outcome is: **Eligible.**

According to the scenario details provided, Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are specifically listed as "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes, with a regional exception noted. The criteria explicitly states that "while apprenticeships in England are excluded, Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are listed as 'approved training' for Child Benefit purposes."

The gov.uk guidance confirms that Child Benefit can continue for young people under 20 in approved education or training, and the payment of a wage or allowance during that training does not automatically disqualify them. The agent incorrectly applied a general rule about paid apprenticeships without recognizing the specific Welsh Foundation Apprenticeship exception.

The agent's final determination contradicts the expected outcome. The user should have been informed they ARE eligible for Child Benefit because their 17-year-old daughter is enrolled in a Welsh Foundation Apprenticeship, which qualifies as approved training regardless of whether it's paid.
