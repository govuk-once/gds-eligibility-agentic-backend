**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Accurate fact-finding:** The agent methodically gathered the relevant information:
   - The child (Liam, age 12) is within the eligible age range
   - The user is a foster carer with a local authority placement
   - The council pays fostering allowances covering accommodation and maintenance

2. **Correct application of rules:** The agent correctly identified that when a local authority pays fostering allowances for a child's accommodation and maintenance, the foster carer cannot claim Child Benefit. This is consistent with the government guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, which states that you cannot get Child Benefit for children looked after by a local authority.

3. **Clear communication:** The agent explained the reasoning clearly: "when a child is placed with you as a local authority foster carer and you receive fostering allowances from the council, you cannot claim Child Benefit for that child."

4. **User confirmation:** The user acknowledged understanding they are "not eligble" (not eligible).

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** for this permutation (Foster Parent with Council-Paid allowance).
