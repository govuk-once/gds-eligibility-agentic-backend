2026-01-28T17:14:20.782988 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T17:14:22.501822 [actor]: chld benfit for son sending money evry month

2026-01-28T17:14:24.376085 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a son and you're sending money every month.

To help assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask: Does your son currently live with you in the UK?

2026-01-28T17:14:26.285159 [actor]: no he lives with ex wife i send 150 pounds each month for his food and cloths

2026-01-28T17:14:28.309057 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your son lives with his ex-wife, and you send £150 each month for his support.

Let me ask: Is your son's mother (your ex-wife) currently claiming Child Benefit for him?

2026-01-28T17:14:29.680164 [actor]: no she dosnt claim it

2026-01-28T17:14:32.220096 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you this:

Even though your son lives with his mother, do you contribute at least the same amount (or more) towards his upkeep as she does? By "upkeep" I mean the cost of providing for his food, clothing, and other needs.

2026-01-28T17:14:33.627897 [actor]: i send 150 pound every month for food and clothes

2026-01-28T17:14:35.723143 [root_agent]: Thank you. I understand you send £150 per month. 

To clarify further: Does your ex-wife also contribute financially to your son's food, clothes, and other needs, or is your £150 per month the main/only financial contribution towards his upkeep?

2026-01-28T17:14:37.369501 [actor]: she contributs too he lives with her she pays for things

2026-01-28T17:14:39.795439 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So both you and your ex-wife contribute to your son's upkeep, with him living with her.

Let me ask: Between the two of you, who do you think contributes more towards the total cost of your son's upkeep - you with your £150 per month, or your ex-wife who pays for things while he lives with her?

2026-01-28T17:14:41.625124 [actor]: dont know she has the house and everything i just send the 150

2026-01-28T17:14:43.467066 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask another important question:

How old is your son?

2026-01-28T17:14:44.929939 [actor]: hes 10 years old

2026-01-28T17:14:47.787892 [root_agent]: Thank you. Your son is 10, so he's under 16 which meets the age requirement.

Now, let me ask: Do you live in the UK yourself?

2026-01-28T17:14:49.103444 [actor]: yes i live in uk

2026-01-28T17:14:52.056449 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Let me ask: Are you responsible for your son in any official way - for example, do you have a Child Arrangements Order (sometimes called custody or access arrangements), or is there any court order stating that he should live with you for part of the time?

2026-01-28T17:14:53.641847 [actor]: no just send money for him each month

2026-01-28T17:14:55.974668 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Let me ask one more important question:

Does your son ever stay with you at your home, even if it's just for some nights or weekends each month?

2026-01-28T17:14:57.600432 [actor]: no he stays with his mum i just transfer the money

2026-01-28T17:15:03.114241 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your situation based on what you've told me.

Based on the Child Benefit rules, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for your son** in this situation. Here's why:

**The key factors are:**

1. **Your son lives full-time with his mother** - Child Benefit is normally claimed by the person the child lives with.

2. **You don't have your son staying with you** - Even when a child doesn't live with someone full-time, they might be eligible if the child stays with them regularly.

3. **You contribute £150 per month, but your ex-wife likely contributes more** - She provides the home, day-to-day care, and pays for other things. The person who contributes the most to the child's upkeep (or who the child lives with) is the one who should claim.

**What you should know:**

- Your ex-wife would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit since your son lives with her full-time and she is his primary carer.

- The £150 you send each month is important financial support for your son, but it doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit under these circumstances.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?

2026-01-28T17:15:04.664270 [actor]: ok so im not eligble then

2026-01-28T17:15:07.158471 [root_agent]: That's correct - based on what you've told me, you are not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.

Your ex-wife, as the person your son lives with, would be the one who is eligible to claim Child Benefit for him (if she chooses to do so).

The £150 you send each month is still valuable support for your son, even though it doesn't qualify you for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

2026-01-28T17:15:08.901962 [actor]: no thats all thanks

2026-01-28T17:15:14.137664 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, if someone contributes at least the same as the person the child lives with AND that person is not claiming Child Benefit, the contributing parent may be eligible to claim. The agent failed to properly establish whether the user's £150/month contribution equals or exceeds the mother's contribution and prematurely concluded ineligibility without fully exploring this possibility.
