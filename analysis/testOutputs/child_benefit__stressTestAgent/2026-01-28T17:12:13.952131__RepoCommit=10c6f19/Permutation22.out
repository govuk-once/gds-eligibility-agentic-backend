2026-01-28T17:24:37.586266 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, **do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:24:39.371273 [actor]: child in hosptal can i get benfit

2026-01-28T17:24:41.451418 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Yes, you may still be able to get Child Benefit if your child is in hospital.

Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility:

**Is your child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T17:24:42.798622 [actor]: son is 7 hosptal long time

2026-01-28T17:24:45.672409 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. A 7-year-old child does meet the age requirement for Child Benefit.

Now, regarding your son being in hospital for a long time, this is important. Let me ask:

**Are you still responsible for your son - meaning do you still have parental responsibility and are you contributing to the cost of supporting him (even while he's in hospital)?**

2026-01-28T17:24:47.362924 [actor]: yes hes my son i pay for things

2026-01-28T17:24:49.854950 [root_agent]: That's good to know. Since your son is 7 years old and you're still responsible for him and contributing to his costs, you should be eligible for Child Benefit even though he's in hospital for a long time.

To complete the eligibility assessment, I need to ask:

**Do you live in the UK, or are you a UK citizen working abroad for the UK government or European institution?**

2026-01-28T17:24:51.173361 [actor]: live in uk

2026-01-28T17:24:54.548474 [root_agent]: Excellent. Based on the information you've provided:

- Your son is 7 years old (under 16) ✓
- You are responsible for him and contribute to his costs ✓
- You live in the UK ✓

**You should be eligible for Child Benefit**, even though your son is in hospital for a long time. The fact that a child is in hospital doesn't stop you from claiming Child Benefit as long as you remain responsible for them.

Just one final question to complete the assessment:

**Are you or your partner earning more than £50,000 a year?** (This won't stop you from being eligible, but it may affect whether you need to pay some of the benefit back through tax - this is called the High Income Child Benefit Charge)

2026-01-28T17:24:56.205763 [actor]: dont understand just tell me if i get it or not

2026-01-28T17:24:58.577740 [root_agent]: **Yes, you can get Child Benefit.**

You meet all the eligibility requirements:
- Your son is 7 years old
- You're responsible for him and pay for things for him
- You live in the UK
- The fact he's in hospital doesn't stop you from claiming

You are eligible to claim Child Benefit for your son.

2026-01-28T17:25:01.734460 [actor]: Thank you for the information.

2026-01-28T17:25:04.321937 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a parent can claim Child Benefit for a 7-year-old child in hospital, as long as they remain responsible for the child and contribute to their costs, which aligns with gov.uk guidance that children in hospital can still qualify for Child Benefit when the parent retains parental responsibility.
