**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Age Assessment:** The agent properly identified that the child is 17 years old, which exceeds the basic age threshold of 16.

2. **Education/Training Status:** The agent correctly established that the child:
   - Left school after GCSEs last year
   - Is not in college
   - Is not working
   - Is not in any approved education or training

3. **Correct Application of Rules:** The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops at age 16 unless the child continues in approved education or training (which can extend eligibility until age 20).

4. **Extension Period:** While the agent mentioned "a short extension period," they correctly concluded that this would not apply since the child left school last year and has not registered with any careers service or training program.

5. **Clear Communication:** The agent clearly stated the user would "**not be eligible**" for Child Benefit for this 17-year-old child.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that Jordan's father Steve is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, as Jordan does not meet the criteria for the 20-week extension (not registered with careers service or similar programs) and is not in approved education or training.
