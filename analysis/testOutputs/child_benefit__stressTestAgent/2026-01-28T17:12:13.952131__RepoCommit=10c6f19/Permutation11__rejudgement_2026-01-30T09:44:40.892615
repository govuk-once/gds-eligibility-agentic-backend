**Justification:**

The agent concluded that Karen **is eligible** for Child Benefit because Ryan is on a government-funded apprenticeship, which the agent classified as "approved training."

However, according to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, **starting an apprenticeship is specifically listed as a reason why Child Benefit stops**. The guidance states that Child Benefit continues for young people aged 16-19 in "approved education or training" but explicitly notes that this does **not** include apprenticeships.

The key distinction is:
- **Approved education/training**: A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3 (when not part of a job contract), etc.
- **NOT approved**: Apprenticeships (which combine work and training under an employment contract)

**Expected outcome:** Not Eligible (Karen must stop her claim)

**Agent's communicated outcome:** Eligible

Since Ryan has started an Intermediate Apprenticeship in England, this is a disqualifying event. The agent's determination that Karen is eligible **does not agree** with the expected outcome that she is **not eligible** and must stop her claim.
