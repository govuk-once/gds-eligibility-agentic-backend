**Justification:** The agent correctly communicated the eligibility outcome that aligns with the expected outcome: **Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible**.

The agent properly identified that:
1. Only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child
2. When parents cannot agree and share care, HMRC gives priority to the person with whom the child lives most of the time
3. Since Holly stays with Sue 4 days per week versus Pete's 3 days per week, Sue has priority
4. Therefore, Sue is eligible and Pete is not eligible

The agent clearly communicated to Pete that "Sue would be the one eligible to receive the Child Benefit payment, not you" and confirmed this understanding when Pete asked "ok so sue gets it then not me" by responding "Yes, that's correct, Pete."

This matches the expected outcome precisely.
