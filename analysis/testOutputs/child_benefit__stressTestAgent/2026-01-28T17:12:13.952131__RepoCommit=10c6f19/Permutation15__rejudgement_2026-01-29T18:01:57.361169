**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct threshold identification**: The agent accurately stated that when a child doesn't live with the claimant, contributions must be "at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount" (£25.60/week, which aligns closely with the scenario's stated rate of £26.05/week).

2. **Accurate assessment of contributions**: The agent correctly identified that the user's contribution of £10/week plus occasional birthday presents falls below the required threshold.

3. **Clear communication of ineligibility**: The agent explicitly stated "you would not be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided a clear explanation of why.

4. **Proper application of responsibility criteria**: The agent appropriately applied Criteria 1 (Responsibility) by recognizing that insufficient financial contribution when the child lives elsewhere means the applicant is not considered "responsible" for Child Benefit purposes.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that Mike is not eligible due to his weekly contribution (£10) being significantly below the Child Benefit rate (£26.05/week).
