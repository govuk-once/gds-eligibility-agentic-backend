**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **potentially eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct criteria assessment**: The agent properly verified that:
   - The daughter is 12 years old (under 16) ✓
   - The user has parental responsibility as the father ✓
   - The user contributes £120 every 4 weeks in groceries and clothes ✓

2. **Proper interpretation of contribution sufficiency**: The agent correctly recognized that £120 over 4 weeks (averaging £30/week) exceeds the Child Benefit threshold of approximately £25.60/week (about £110/month).

3. **Accurate explanation of the eligibility framework**: While the agent emphasized the important caveat that only one person can claim at a time, they clearly stated the user is "potentially eligible" and "can claim it" if the mother is not already claiming.

4. **Alignment with guidance**: According to gov.uk guidance on "child benefit child lives with someone else," a parent who doesn't live with the child can claim if they contribute at least the equivalent of Child Benefit toward the child's upkeep - which this user does through the lump sum grocery and clothing contributions.

The agent's response was thorough, accurate, and communicated eligibility appropriately while noting the practical consideration about concurrent claims.
