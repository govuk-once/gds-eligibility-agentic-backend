**Justification:**

The agent made a critical error in determining eligibility. The agent concluded that the user **is eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "Child Benefit will stop when your son either: Finishes or leaves his A-level course, OR Reaches the age of 20 (which he already has)."

However, according to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, Child Benefit for children in approved education or training stops when they:
- Turn 20, OR
- Leave approved education or training

**The key point is that these are not continuing conditions - once a child turns 20, eligibility ceases immediately, even if they are still in education.**

In this scenario, Dev has already turned 20 (the user stated "son turned 20 stil in scool doing a levels"). Therefore, Child Benefit eligibility has **already ended** on his 20th birthday, regardless of whether he is still completing his A-levels.

The expected outcome clearly states: "**Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday).**"

The agent's determination that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" directly contradicts the expected outcome. The agent should have informed the user that eligibility ceased when their son turned 20, and no further Child Benefit can be claimed.
