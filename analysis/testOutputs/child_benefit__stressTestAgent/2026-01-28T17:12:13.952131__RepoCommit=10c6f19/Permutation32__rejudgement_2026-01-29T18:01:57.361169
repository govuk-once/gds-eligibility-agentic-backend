**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct identification of the issue**: The agent properly identified that the child (17 years old) is in education but needs to meet the "full-time" threshold for approved education.

2. **Accurate application of the 12-hour rule**: The agent correctly stated that full-time education requires "more than 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience."

3. **Proper assessment**: With only 6 hours per week of supervised study, the agent accurately determined this falls short of the requirement.

4. **Clear communication**: The agent clearly explained why the user is not eligible: "Your son is only doing 6 hours per week of supervised study at college for his GCSE retakes. This falls short of the 12-hour minimum requirement, which means his course would not be considered full-time education for Child Benefit purposes."

5. **Alignment with expected outcome**: The expected outcome states the user should be "Not Eligible" because 6 hours is insufficient (less than the 12+ hours required). The agent's conclusion matches this perfectly.

The agent's determination is factually correct and properly communicated to the user.
