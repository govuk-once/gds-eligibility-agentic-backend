2026-01-28T17:30:13.854967 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T17:30:15.645335 [actor]: emma just started uni living at home

2026-01-28T17:30:17.492383 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Emma has just started university and is living at home.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **How old is Emma?**

2026-01-28T17:30:18.916792 [actor]: shes 18 started degree this year

2026-01-28T17:30:23.541585 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Emma is 18 and has started a degree this year while living at home.

To determine your eligibility, I need to know: **Is Emma studying full-time on a course that is not a university degree course at Advanced Level or below (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQ Level 3 or similar)?**

In other words, since she's doing a university degree, that wouldn't count as approved education for Child Benefit purposes. Child Benefit can continue until age 20, but only for non-advanced education or approved training - university degrees are considered advanced education and don't qualify.

However, let me confirm: **Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Emma, and if so, did it stop when she turned 16 or when she started university?**

2026-01-28T17:30:25.400140 [actor]: daughter 18 uni degree 3 years commutes from home

2026-01-28T17:30:29.298598 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your daughter is 18, studying a 3-year university degree, and commutes from home.

I need to give you some important information: **University degree courses are considered "advanced education" and are not counted as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.**

This means that Child Benefit typically stops when a young person:
- Turns 16, OR
- Leaves approved education or training (which doesn't include university degrees), OR
- Turns 20 (if still in approved education or training)

Since your daughter is doing a university degree, you would **not be eligible** for Child Benefit for her, even though she's under 20 and living at home.

However, to make sure I have the complete picture: **Do you have any other children under 16, or under 20 who are in non-advanced education or approved training (such as A-levels, T-levels, NVQs, or similar)?**

2026-01-28T17:30:34.623291 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that university degree courses are considered "advanced education" and do not qualify for Child Benefit purposes, correctly concluding that I would not be eligible for Child Benefit for my 18-year-old daughter who is studying for a university degree.
