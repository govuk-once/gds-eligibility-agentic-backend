**Justification:** The agent correctly communicated the expected eligibility outcome. The agent clearly and accurately explained that:

1. **Sue is eligible**: The agent stated "Sue would be the one eligible to receive the Child Benefit payment" because Holly spends 4 days per week with Sue versus 3 days with Pete, making Sue the primary carer.

2. **Pete is not eligible**: The agent explicitly confirmed to Pete "not you" when Pete asked "ok so sue gets it then not me," clearly communicating that Pete cannot claim the benefit.

3. **Correct reasoning**: The agent properly applied the priority rule that only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child, and when parents share care but cannot agree, HMRC gives priority to the person the child lives with most of the time.

The agent's determination aligns perfectly with the expected outcome: **Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible**.
