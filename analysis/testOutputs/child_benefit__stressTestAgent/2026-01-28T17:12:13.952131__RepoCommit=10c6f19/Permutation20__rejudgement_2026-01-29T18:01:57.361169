2026-01-29T18:03:26.352642 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 **The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome.**

**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Maria is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Responsibility criterion met**: The agent correctly identified that Maria has main responsibility for Lucia (her 14-year-old granddaughter) because Lucia lives with her and Maria pays for everything.

2. **Relationship criterion met**: The agent appropriately recognized that you don't have to be the parent to claim Child Benefit. According to gov.uk guidance, you can claim if you're responsible for a child, even in informal arrangements where you look after a relative's child - which is exactly Maria's situation.

3. **Other eligibility factors confirmed**: 
   - Child under 16 ✓
   - UK residence ✓
   - No immigration control issues ✓
   - No one else claiming ✓

4. **Correct application of informal arrangement rules**: The scenario specifically states this is an informal family arrangement with no court order or fostering arrangement. The agent correctly recognized that Maria can still claim despite the informal nature of the arrangement, as long as she has responsibility for the child (which she does).

The agent's conclusion that Maria is eligible matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** as stated in the scenario guidance.
