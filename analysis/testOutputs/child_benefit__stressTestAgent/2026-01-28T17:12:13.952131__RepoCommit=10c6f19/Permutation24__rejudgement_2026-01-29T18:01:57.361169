**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "You may **not be eligible** to continue receiving Child Benefit while your son is living full-time at the residential school."

However, the expected outcome is: **Eligible (until week 12)**.

According to the scenario context and gov.uk guidance on residential accommodation, when a child is in residential accommodation (such as a residential school for behavioral/educational needs), the parent can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **12 weeks** if they remain responsible for the child. 

In this case:
- The child has been in residential accommodation for **10 weeks**
- The mother remains responsible for the child and makes decisions about his care
- This is a temporary arrangement for behavioral support
- The 12-week eligibility period has not yet expired

The agent failed to recognize the 12-week rule for residential accommodation and incorrectly advised that the parent is not eligible. The correct outcome should have been that the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit until the 12-week period expires (i.e., for 2 more weeks), after which eligibility would cease if the child continues to remain in residential accommodation.

The agent's communicated outcome **does not agree** with the expected outcome.
