2026-01-28T17:23:36.601439 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T17:23:38.245256 [actor]: granddaughter 14 living with me paying for everthing

2026-01-28T17:23:40.706458 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old granddaughter living with you and you're paying for everything.

Let me ask you the next question: **Are you the person with main responsibility for your granddaughter? In other words, are you the one who makes the day-to-day decisions about her care and upbringing?**

2026-01-28T17:23:42.391191 [actor]: yes she lives here parents cant look after her

2026-01-28T17:23:44.050360 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like you have main responsibility for her care.

Next question: **Do you normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:23:45.466901 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T17:23:47.572265 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Next question: **Are you or your granddaughter subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on your right to remain in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:23:48.999469 [actor]: no we are uk citizens

2026-01-28T17:23:50.916394 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: **Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your granddaughter (such as her parents or another family member)?**

2026-01-28T17:23:52.742905 [actor]: no one else claming parents dont contribute anything

2026-01-28T17:23:56.244175 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your 14-year-old granddaughter. Here's why:

✓ You're responsible for a child under 16
✓ You have main responsibility for her (she lives with you and you're paying for everything)
✓ You normally live in the UK
✓ You're a UK citizen with no immigration restrictions
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

Since her parents can't look after her and you're the one providing her care and meeting her needs, you qualify as the person with main responsibility, which makes you eligible to claim.

**Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-28T17:23:59.429307 [actor]: okay thank you

2026-01-28T17:24:01.882647 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a UK resident grandparent with main responsibility for their 14-year-old granddaughter (who lives with them, whose parents cannot care for her, and for whom no one else is claiming) is eligible for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible."
