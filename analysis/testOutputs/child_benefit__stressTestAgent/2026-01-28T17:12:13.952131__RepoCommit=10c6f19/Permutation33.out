2026-01-28T17:31:10.310632 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:31:11.768997 [actor]: bella 16 travel agent course

2026-01-28T17:31:14.720314 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Bella is 16 and doing a travel agent course.

To help me assess eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is Bella's travel agent course an approved education or training program?** 

(Approved education or training typically includes things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or home education if it started before the child turned 16.)

2026-01-28T17:31:16.203866 [actor]: employer pays for it travel agency hired her

2026-01-28T17:31:19.497147 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. It sounds like this is an employer-paid training course as part of Bella's employment with a travel agency.

Let me ask the next important question:

**Does Bella work 24 hours a week or more in her job at the travel agency?**

(This is important because Child Benefit generally stops for young people aged 16-19 who work 24 hours or more per week, even if they're in training.)

2026-01-28T17:31:20.966867 [actor]: no she dosnt work that much just training mostly

2026-01-28T17:31:23.672964 [root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful to know that Bella works less than 24 hours per week and is mostly doing training.

Now I need to ask:

**Do you live with Bella, and are you the person mainly responsible for her care?**

(This means you're the primary person looking after her day-to-day needs.)

2026-01-28T17:31:25.348486 [actor]: yes lives with me im her mum

2026-01-28T17:31:27.801985 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. As Bella's mum and the person she lives with, that's important information.

Let me ask you this:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

(You generally need to be living in the UK to be eligible for Child Benefit.)

2026-01-28T17:31:29.419955 [actor]: yes live in uk

2026-01-28T17:31:31.404790 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in the UK with Bella.

Now I need to ask:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Bella?**

(Only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child at a time.)

2026-01-28T17:31:32.983070 [actor]: no just me nobody else claiming

2026-01-28T17:31:35.535414 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question:

**Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?**

(This is important because if either you or your partner earns over £60,000, you may face a tax charge called the High Income Child Benefit Charge, though you can still claim Child Benefit.)

2026-01-28T17:31:37.170344 [actor]: no income under that

2026-01-28T17:31:42.313443 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility:

✓ You have a child (Bella) who is 16
✓ You are her mother and she lives with you
✓ You are responsible for her
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Bella
✓ Bella works less than 24 hours per week
✓ Your income is under £60,000

**However, there is one key consideration:** Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds depends on whether they are in **approved education or training**. From what you've described, Bella is doing employer-paid training as part of her employment with a travel agency, rather than being enrolled in approved full-time education like A-levels, Scottish Highers, or similar qualifications.

**Work-based training paid for by an employer typically does not count as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.** This is different from government-approved training programs or formal educational courses.

Based on this, you would likely **not be eligible** for Child Benefit for Bella, as she appears to be in employment with employer training rather than approved education.

Would you like me to clarify anything about this assessment?

2026-01-28T17:31:43.947542 [actor]: ok thanks understand not eligible

2026-01-28T17:31:47.771157 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent properly identified that employer-paid training as part of employment does not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes for 16-19 year olds, and correctly concluded I was not eligible.
