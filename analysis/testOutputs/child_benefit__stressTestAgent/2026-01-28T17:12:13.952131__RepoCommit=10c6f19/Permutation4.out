2026-01-28T17:14:03.593675 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:14:07.857295 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have an 18-year-old daughter who works as a receptionist.

Let me ask you a clarifying question:

**Is your daughter currently in any approved education or training (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or similar qualifications)?**

This is important because Child Benefit can continue until age 20 if the young person is in approved education or training, but typically stops at age 16 if they're not.

2026-01-28T17:14:13.205377 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Based on what you've told me, your daughter is 18 years old, left school 2 years ago, and works 30 hours per week as a receptionist. She is not currently in approved education or training.

**Unfortunately, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter.**

Here's why: Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 16, unless they remain in approved education or training - in which case it can continue until they turn 20 (or until they leave education/training if that's earlier). Since your daughter left school 2 years ago at age 16 and is now working rather than in approved education or training, Child Benefit would have ended when she turned 16 or left education, whichever came later.

Do you have any other children under 16 (or under 20 and in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T17:14:18.758405 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my 18-year-old daughter left education 2 years ago and is working full-time, which means she no longer meets the criteria (Child Benefit ends at 16 unless the child remains in approved education or training until age 20).
