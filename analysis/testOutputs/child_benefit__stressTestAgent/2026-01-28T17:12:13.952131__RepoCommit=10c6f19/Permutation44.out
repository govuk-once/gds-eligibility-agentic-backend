2026-01-28T17:38:00.554516 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine whether you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:38:02.174159 [actor]: child in care comes home weekends

2026-01-28T17:38:05.391159 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. So you have a child who is in care but comes home on weekends.

To help me assess your eligibility, let me ask: **Is this child in local authority care (meaning the local council has responsibility for them during the week), or are they in some other type of care arrangement?**

This is important because different rules apply depending on whether a child is formally in local authority care or not.

2026-01-28T17:38:06.834603 [actor]: local authority yes child comes saturdays

2026-01-28T17:38:09.217494 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your child is in local authority care but comes home on Saturdays.

Let me ask you this: **When your child comes home on Saturdays, do they stay overnight with you, or do they just visit during the day and return to care the same day?**

This detail is important because it affects eligibility for Child Benefit when a child is in local authority care.

2026-01-28T17:38:10.792593 [actor]: comes saturday morning goes back sunday morning

2026-01-28T17:38:13.276320 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your child stays with you overnight from Saturday morning to Sunday morning.

This is helpful to know. Now let me ask: **For how many weeks of the year does your child come home to stay with you on weekends like this?**

The frequency of these home visits is important in determining your eligibility for Child Benefit when a child is in local authority care.

2026-01-28T17:38:14.855842 [actor]: every week saturdat to sunday

2026-01-28T17:38:18.164891 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your child comes home every week from Saturday to Sunday.

Based on the information you've provided, let me think through your situation:

- Your child is in local authority care during the week
- Your child comes home every weekend (Saturday morning to Sunday morning)
- This happens every week of the year

According to the rules, when a child is in local authority care, Child Benefit usually stops because the local authority is responsible for the child. However, there are exceptions if the child regularly stays with you overnight.

Let me ask one more important question: **Are you the person who had parental responsibility for this child before they went into local authority care?**

This will help me give you a complete assessment of your eligibility.

2026-01-28T17:38:19.827870 [actor]: yes my child leo hes 12

2026-01-28T17:38:24.733625 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. So Leo is your 12-year-old child, and you had parental responsibility for him before he went into local authority care.

Based on all the information you've shared, here's my assessment:

**You may be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

- Leo is under 16 years old
- You are his parent with parental responsibility
- Although Leo is in local authority care during the week, he comes home and stays with you overnight every weekend (Saturday to Sunday)

According to the rules, when a child in local authority care regularly stays with you overnight, you may still be able to claim Child Benefit for those periods.

However, you will need to inform HMRC about Leo's care situation. The amount of Child Benefit you receive might be adjusted based on the fact that Leo is in care during the week and only stays with you on weekends.

**My recommendation is that you contact HMRC or make a Child Benefit claim and explain Leo's circumstances.** They will be able to confirm your exact entitlement based on the overnight stays.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-28T17:38:29.889500 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the parent may be eligible for Child Benefit despite the child being in local authority care, based on the regular overnight weekend stays, and appropriately advised contacting HMRC to confirm the exact entitlement given the specific circumstances.
