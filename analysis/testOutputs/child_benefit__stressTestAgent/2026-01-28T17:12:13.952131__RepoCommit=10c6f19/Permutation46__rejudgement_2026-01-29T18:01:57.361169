**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible (Expired)**.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct identification of the 91-day limit**: The agent accurately explained that jobseekers with pre-settled status have a right to reside for benefit purposes limited to 91 days.

2. **Proper application to the user's situation**: The agent correctly identified that the user has been seeking work for 95 days, which exceeds the 91-day threshold.

3. **Thorough fact-gathering**: The agent asked appropriate clarifying questions to establish that:
   - The user came to the UK specifically as a jobseeker
   - Has never worked in the UK
   - Has no other qualifying status (self-sufficiency, comprehensive health insurance)
   - Has no imminent job offer

4. **Clear communication**: The agent provided a clear explanation of why the user is not eligible, specifically citing the exceeded time limit and lack of qualifying right to reside for benefit purposes.

5. **Constructive guidance**: The agent appropriately advised that finding employment would change the eligibility status.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that the user's jobseeker status has expired beyond the 91-day limit, rendering them ineligible for Child Benefit.
