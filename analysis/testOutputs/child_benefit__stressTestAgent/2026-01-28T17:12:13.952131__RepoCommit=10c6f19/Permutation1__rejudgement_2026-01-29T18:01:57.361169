**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

The agent's assessment was thorough and accurate:

1. **Child's age and education status**: Correctly identified that the 8-year-old son in primary school meets the under-16 criterion
2. **Responsibility**: Confirmed parental responsibility with the child living full-time with both parents
3. **UK residency**: Confirmed residence in Manchester, UK
4. **Immigration status**: Verified both parents are UK nationals
5. **Living arrangements**: Confirmed the child lives with them full-time
6. **High Income Child Benefit Charge**: Correctly determined that neither parent's income (£35,000 and £15,000) exceeds the £50,000 threshold, so no charge applies

The agent also properly advised that only one parent can claim Child Benefit even though both share responsibility, which is procedurally correct.

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent matches the expected outcome perfectly.
