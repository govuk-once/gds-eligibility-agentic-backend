2026-01-28T17:19:47.880883 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?** (This includes children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)

2026-01-28T17:19:49.445315 [actor]: child not living with me temprary surjery recovery

2026-01-28T17:19:52.514701 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand the child is not living with you temporarily due to surgery recovery.

Let me ask you this: **Is this a temporary situation where the child will return to live with you after their surgery recovery, and are you still responsible for the child?**

This is important because Child Benefit can still be paid if a child is temporarily away from home, including when they're in hospital or recovering from medical treatment.

2026-01-28T17:19:54.203669 [actor]: yes temprary 6 weeks with grandmothr

2026-01-28T17:19:56.968200 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. A temporary 6-week stay with grandmother for surgery recovery should be fine - this is considered a temporary absence.

Now let me ask: **Are you currently the person responsible for the child?** By this I mean:

- Do you normally live with the child?
- Are you responsible for paying for things like food, clothes, and other costs for the child?

2026-01-28T17:19:58.470007 [actor]: yes im the mother pay for evrything

2026-01-28T17:20:00.984126 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful information.

Let me continue with the eligibility questions:

**Does the child normally live in the UK?** (Even though they're temporarily with their grandmother for recovery, I'm asking about where they usually live)

2026-01-28T17:20:02.614352 [actor]: yes we live in UK

2026-01-28T17:20:04.428504 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you.

Now, an important question: **Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for this child, or are you applying for the first time?**

2026-01-28T17:20:06.180211 [actor]: applying first time can i get it

2026-01-28T17:20:08.098009 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Let me ask a few more questions to complete the eligibility assessment.

**How old is your child?** (Child Benefit is available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)

2026-01-28T17:20:09.517338 [actor]: child is 6 years old

2026-01-28T17:20:11.928204 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you.

Now let me ask: **Do you live in the UK yourself?** (You mentioned your child normally lives in the UK, but I need to confirm about you as well)

2026-01-28T17:20:13.308624 [actor]: yes i live in uk

2026-01-28T17:20:15.344858 [root_agent]: Thank you. Just a couple more questions.

**Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for this child?** (For example, the child's other parent, or the grandmother who is currently caring for them during recovery)

2026-01-28T17:20:16.762828 [actor]: no grandmothr not claiming

2026-01-28T17:20:18.874607 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One final question: **Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on your right to live in the UK?**

This relates to your residence status in the UK.

2026-01-28T17:20:20.363047 [actor]: no restrictions born here

2026-01-28T17:20:25.164429 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for answering all my questions.

**Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.** Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (aged 6)
✓ You're responsible for the child - you pay for everything
✓ The child normally lives with you in the UK
✓ You live in the UK with no immigration restrictions
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child
✓ The temporary 6-week stay with grandmother for surgery recovery doesn't affect your eligibility - this is considered a temporary absence

**You can now apply for Child Benefit.** The child being temporarily away from home for medical recovery won't prevent you from claiming, as long as you remain responsible for them and they'll be returning to live with you.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T17:20:31.140935 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit, correctly recognizing that the temporary 6-week absence for surgery recovery does not affect eligibility, and properly verified all relevant criteria including the child's age, residency, responsibility for the child, and that no one else is claiming.
