**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors correctly identified by the agent:**

1. **Children's ages:** The agent confirmed the two children (ages 8 and 10) meet the age requirement (under 16)

2. **Responsibility for care:** The agent established that the user and/or spouse are responsible for the children's care

3. **Crown servant exception:** Most importantly, the agent correctly identified that as a member of HM Forces (British Armed Forces) posted abroad, the user is treated as living in the UK for Child Benefit purposes, despite physically residing in Germany. This is the critical exception that makes the user eligible.

4. **No duplicate claims:** The agent confirmed no one else has claimed Child Benefit for these children

The agent's conclusion that the user is eligible is accurate and matches the expected outcome. The agent demonstrated proper understanding of the Crown servant exception to the UK residency requirement, which is the key factor in this scenario.
