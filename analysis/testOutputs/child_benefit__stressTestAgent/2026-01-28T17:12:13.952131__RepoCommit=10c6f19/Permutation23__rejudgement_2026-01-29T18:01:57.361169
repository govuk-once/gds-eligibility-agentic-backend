**Justification:**

The expected outcome for this scenario is **Eligible** (without qualification). However, the agent communicated that Kevin is only "**potentially eligible**" with significant conditions attached.

The agent's final determination was:
- "You ARE potentially eligible to claim Child Benefit"
- But with the critical caveat: "If her mum is already claiming Child Benefit → You cannot claim it"

**Why this doesn't match the expected outcome:**

According to the gov.uk guidance on child benefit eligibility when a child lives with someone else, a parent who doesn't live with the child can claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount to the child's upkeep.

Kevin contributes £120 every 4 weeks, which averages £30/week - exceeding the £26.05 threshold (using the £25.60 figure mentioned in the transcript, the threshold would be approximately £25.60/week). The guidance allows for lump sum contributions covering a set period, so Kevin's contribution method is acceptable.

The critical issue is that the agent made Kevin's eligibility **conditional** on whether the mother is claiming, when in fact Kevin independently meets the eligibility criteria through his qualifying contributions. While only one person can *receive* the benefit at a time (an administrative matter), this doesn't affect whether Kevin is *eligible* according to the contribution-based route.

The agent should have communicated: "You ARE eligible for Child Benefit based on your contributions" rather than "potentially eligible depending on whether mum is claiming."
