2026-01-28T17:12:52.991756 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:12:54.704157 [actor]: dughter 17 lives with me in london studyin a levels

2026-01-28T17:12:57.799618 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Your 17-year-old daughter studying A-levels could qualify you for Child Benefit, as children under 20 in approved education or training are covered.

Let me ask the next question:

**Are you the person with the main responsibility for your daughter? In other words, are you the main person who looks after her and meets her day-to-day needs?**

2026-01-28T17:12:59.265151 [actor]: yes am single father she lives with me

2026-01-28T17:13:01.356026 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. As a single father with your daughter living with you, that's helpful information.

Now, let me ask:

**Do you or your daughter normally live in the UK? This includes England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland.**

2026-01-28T17:13:02.881993 [actor]: yes london

2026-01-28T17:13:05.257463 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. You've mentioned you live in London, which is in the UK.

Now I need to ask about your immigration status:

**Do you have the right to reside in the UK? For example, are you a British citizen, have settled status, pre-settled status, or another immigration status that allows you to live here?**

2026-01-28T17:13:06.566592 [actor]: british citizen

2026-01-28T17:13:09.050874 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask an important question about your income:

**Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year? Since you mentioned you're a single father, I'm asking about your income specifically.**

2026-01-28T17:13:10.490788 [actor]: earn 40000 per year

2026-01-28T17:13:13.886814 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility:

✓ You have a 17-year-old daughter studying A-levels (approved education)
✓ She lives with you and you have main responsibility for her
✓ You live in the UK (London)
✓ You're a British citizen
✓ Your income is £40,000 per year (below the £60,000 threshold)

**Good news! Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

You can claim Child Benefit for your daughter as long as she continues in approved education or training and is under 20 years old.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the claims process?

2026-01-28T17:13:19.221379 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria (child under 20 in approved education, main responsibility, UK residence, right to reside, and income below £60,000) and correctly concluded the user is eligible for Child Benefit.
