**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of "Eligible."

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct eligibility assessment**: The agent properly identified that the user meets all the criteria for Child Benefit:
   - Nina is 10 years old (under 16) ✓
   - Nina lives with the user as her main home ✓
   - The user is responsible for Nina and covers all costs ✓
   - The user is a UK resident and British citizen ✓

2. **Critical understanding of private fostering**: The agent correctly understood that you don't need to be the child's parent to claim Child Benefit - you just need to be responsible for the child. This is the crucial point for private fostering arrangements like this scenario.

3. **No local authority payments**: The scenario specifies the council is NOT paying Carol a fostering allowance. The agent didn't ask about council payments (which could have strengthened the assessment), but correctly concluded eligibility based on the user being financially responsible for the child.

4. **Appropriate caveat**: The agent appropriately noted that only one person can claim at a time, mentioning the mother's potential existing claim.

According to gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility, private fosterers who are financially supporting a child can claim Child Benefit. The agent's conclusion matches this guidance and the expected outcome.
