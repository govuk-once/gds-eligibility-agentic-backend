**Justification:**

The agent determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, according to the expected outcome and the specific scenario details (Permutation 26: The Combined Contributors), the user **should be eligible**.

**Key Facts from the Scenario:**
- Mo (the user) contributes £15/week
- Mo's mother (grandmother) also contributes £15/week
- Combined contributions total £30/week
- The aunt does not claim Child Benefit
- Current Child Benefit rate is £26.05/week for the eldest/only child

**Why the User Should Be Eligible:**

According to GOV.UK guidance on "Child Benefit - child lives with someone else," a person can claim Child Benefit even when the child lives with someone else IF:
1. They contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit toward the child's upkeep, AND
2. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for that child

The guidance explicitly states: "Contributions still count if more than one person is contributing as long as **the total contributions are worth at least as much as the Child Benefit amount**."

In this case:
- Total contributions (£15 + £15 = £30) exceed the threshold (£26.05)
- The aunt is not claiming
- Therefore, Mo IS eligible to claim

**Agent's Error:**

The agent incorrectly insisted that only the person the child lives with can claim, completely missing the exception for contributors. The agent dismissed the relevance of financial contributions multiple times, when in fact combined contributions meeting the threshold IS a valid basis for eligibility when no one else is claiming.

The agent communicated an outcome of "not eligible" when the correct outcome should have been "eligible."
