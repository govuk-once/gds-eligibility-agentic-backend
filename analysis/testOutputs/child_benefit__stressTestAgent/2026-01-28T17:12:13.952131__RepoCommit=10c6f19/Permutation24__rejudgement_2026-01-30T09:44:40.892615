**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly communicated that the user is "not eligible" to continue receiving Child Benefit. This contradicts the expected outcome.

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible (until week 12)

**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Not eligible

**Analysis:**

According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), when a child is in residential accommodation paid for by the local authority, parents can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **12 weeks** if they remain responsible for the child.

In this case:
- The child has been in residential accommodation for **10 weeks**
- The mother remains responsible for the child and makes decisions for him
- The placement is temporary (for behavioral support)
- The council pays for the accommodation

The user should remain **eligible until week 12** (i.e., for another 2 weeks), after which eligibility would cease if the child continues to stay in residential accommodation full-time.

The agent failed to apply the 12-week rule for residential accommodation and instead incorrectly stated the user "may not be eligible" to continue receiving Child Benefit. This is a significant error that could lead to the user unnecessarily stopping their Child Benefit claim prematurely.
