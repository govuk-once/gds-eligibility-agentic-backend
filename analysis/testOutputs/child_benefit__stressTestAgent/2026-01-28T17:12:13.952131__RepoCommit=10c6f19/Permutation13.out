2026-01-28T17:19:20.478365 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, **do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T17:19:22.368833 [actor]: child living with me adoption not finalised yet

2026-01-28T17:19:24.323760 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand you have a child living with you and the adoption hasn't been finalized yet.

Let me ask you this: **Has the child been placed with you by a court or local authority for adoption?**

2026-01-28T17:19:26.003194 [actor]: placement by agency child moved in

2026-01-28T17:19:27.917514 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that the child was placed with you by an agency and has moved in.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: **Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-28T17:19:29.227958 [actor]: uk resident yes

2026-01-28T17:19:31.808463 [root_agent]: Great, thank you for confirming you're a UK resident.

Now, to help determine your eligibility, I need to ask: **Are you responsible for the child's care and upbringing?** (In other words, are you the main person looking after the child day-to-day?)

2026-01-28T17:19:33.444640 [actor]: looking after child day to day yes

2026-01-28T17:19:35.406086 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're looking after the child day-to-day.

One more important question: **Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for this child?**

2026-01-28T17:19:36.995484 [actor]: no one else claiming

2026-01-28T17:19:40.016014 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You're a UK resident
✓ You have a child living with you who has been placed with you by an agency
✓ You're responsible for the child's day-to-day care
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child

The good news is that you can claim Child Benefit even though the adoption hasn't been finalized yet, as long as the child has been placed with you (which they have).

**Would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?**

2026-01-28T17:19:45.731426 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a person with a child placed by an agency for adoption, who is a UK resident, responsible for day-to-day care, and where no one else is claiming, is eligible for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible."
