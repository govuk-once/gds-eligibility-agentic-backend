**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **currently eligible** for Child Benefit (while the child is 18), but that eligibility will stop when the child turns 19 in November.

However, the **expected outcome** is: **Not Eligible.**

According to the government guidance on approved education for Child Benefit purposes, courses must be "non-advanced" (up to Level 3/A-Level standard) to qualify. A Higher National Certificate (HNC) at Level 4 is considered "advanced education" and does **not** qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes at any age after 16.

Since the child is 18 years old and enrolled in an advanced Level 4 HNC course, they do not meet the criteria for the approved education extension. Child Benefit for this situation should have already stopped (or never qualified under the education extension), regardless of whether the child is 18 or 19.

The agent's determination that the user is "currently eligible" contradicts the expected outcome of "Not Eligible." While the agent correctly identified that the HNC Level 4 is higher education and that benefit will stop at 19, they failed to recognize that the course doesn't qualify at 18 either, since it exceeds Level 3.
