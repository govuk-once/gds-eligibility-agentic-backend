**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user was **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, based on the scenario details and Gov.UK guidance, the user should be **eligible**.

**Key Points:**

1. **The child (Lucas, 10) does not live with the applicant (Mark)** - Confirmed in transcript

2. **Mark contributes £150/month specifically for Lucas's food and clothes** - This exceeds the current Child Benefit rate of approximately £113/month (£26.05/week)

3. **Jenny (the mother) is NOT claiming Child Benefit** - Explicitly confirmed in the transcript ("no she dosnt claim it")

4. **According to Gov.UK rules** (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else): A person can claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with them if they contribute at least the same amount towards the child's upkeep as the person the child lives with, AND that person is not claiming Child Benefit

**The Agent's Error:**

The agent concluded Mark wasn't eligible because:
- The child lives with the mother full-time
- The mother "likely contributes more"

However, the agent failed to properly assess whether Mark's £150/month contribution (which exceeds the Child Benefit amount) qualifies him under the "contributing to upkeep" exception. The critical factor is that Jenny is NOT claiming Child Benefit, which means Mark could be eligible if his contribution is sufficient - which the scenario indicates it is.

**Expected Outcome:** Eligible
**Agent's Communicated Outcome:** Not Eligible

The outcomes do not agree.
