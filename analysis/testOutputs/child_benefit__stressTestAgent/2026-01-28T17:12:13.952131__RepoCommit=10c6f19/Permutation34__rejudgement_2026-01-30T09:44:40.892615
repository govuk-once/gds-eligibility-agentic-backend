**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user was eligible for Child Benefit when the expected outcome is "Not Eligible."

According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), when a child is in custody as part of the youth justice system, Child Benefit generally stops after the child has been in custody for 8 weeks.

In this scenario:
- The child (Mark, age 15) has been sentenced to 6 months in a youth custody center
- He has been detained for 10 weeks (which exceeds the 8-week threshold)
- The mother (Lisa) was previously claiming Child Benefit

The agent told the user: "You should be eligible for Child Benefit for your 15-year-old son, even though he is currently in a young offender institution" and stated they could "continue claiming Child Benefit throughout his 6-month sentence."

This is incorrect. Since the child has been in custody for more than 8 weeks, the mother is **not eligible** to continue receiving Child Benefit during this period of detention.

The agent's communication of the eligibility outcome (Eligible) does not agree with the expected outcome (Not Eligible).
