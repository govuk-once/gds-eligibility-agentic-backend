2026-01-28T17:20:33.372401 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T17:20:35.255933 [actor]: child benefit eligbility daughter doesnt live with me send money every week

2026-01-28T17:20:37.986699 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. So you have a daughter who doesn't live with you, but you send money every week.

Let me ask you: **Does your daughter live with someone else who is also contributing to her upbringing, such as her other parent or a guardian?**

2026-01-28T17:20:39.375267 [actor]: yes she lives with her mum

2026-01-28T17:20:41.208589 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your daughter lives with her mum, and you send money every week.

Let me ask you this important question: **Is the person your daughter lives with (her mum) currently claiming Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-28T17:20:42.655451 [actor]: no mum doesnt claim child benifit

2026-01-28T17:20:45.390213 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you another important question:

**Do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards your daughter's upkeep each week (currently this is at least £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, or £16.95 per week for additional children)?**

2026-01-28T17:20:47.056767 [actor]: send 10 pounds weekly for food plus birthday present

2026-01-28T17:20:51.995320 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Based on what you've told me, I need to explain the situation regarding your eligibility.

From what you've shared:
- Your daughter lives with her mum
- Her mum doesn't claim Child Benefit
- You send £10 per week for food plus birthday presents

Unfortunately, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation. Here's why:

When a child doesn't live with you, you can only claim Child Benefit if you contribute **at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount** towards the child's upbringing. Currently, that's at least **£25.60 per week** for an eldest or only child.

Since you're contributing £10 per week, this is below the minimum threshold required.

However, **your daughter's mum would be eligible** to claim Child Benefit since your daughter lives with her and she is responsible for her. Even though she's not currently claiming, she could apply for it.

Would you like to know more about this, or do you have any other questions?

2026-01-28T17:20:57.413494 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my contribution of £10 per week falls below the required threshold of £25.60 per week for cases where the child doesn't live with the claimant, which aligns with the expected "Not Eligible" outcome.
