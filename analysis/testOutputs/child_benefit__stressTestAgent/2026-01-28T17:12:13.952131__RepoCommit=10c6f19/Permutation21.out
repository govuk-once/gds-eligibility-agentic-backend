2026-01-28T17:24:03.815167 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T17:24:05.678221 [actor]: child benfit eligable check 10 year old living with me aftr divorc

2026-01-28T17:24:07.981768 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 10-year-old child living with you following a divorce.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for this child? This means you're the one who looks after them day-to-day and pays towards things like their food, clothes, and housing.

2026-01-28T17:24:09.765492 [actor]: yes responsable for sam he lives here i pay for evrything food cloths

2026-01-28T17:24:11.752662 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It sounds like you are responsible for Sam and he lives with you.

Now I need to ask: Are you or your child living in the UK?

2026-01-28T17:24:13.289824 [actor]: uk yes we live here

2026-01-28T17:24:15.305885 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful to know you both live in the UK.

Next question: Does anyone else also claim Child Benefit for Sam, such as your ex-spouse?

2026-01-28T17:24:16.932250 [actor]: tina has ella the other child 8 years she lives with tina i have sam

2026-01-28T17:24:19.886742 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Tina has your 8-year-old daughter Ella living with her, and you have Sam (10 years old) living with you.

To be clear about Sam specifically: Is Tina (or anyone else) currently claiming Child Benefit for Sam, or are you asking about claiming Child Benefit for Sam yourself?

2026-01-28T17:24:21.424904 [actor]: no one claiming for sam yet want to know if i can claim

2026-01-28T17:24:24.739815 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that no one is currently claiming Child Benefit for Sam.

Based on what you've told me so far, it appears you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam because:

- Sam is under 16 years old (he's 10)
- Sam lives with you
- You are responsible for Sam (you pay for his food, clothes, and look after him)
- You live in the UK
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Sam

However, I need to ask one more important question: Do you have the right to live in the UK, or are you a UK citizen?

2026-01-28T17:24:26.291802 [actor]: yes uk citizen born here

2026-01-28T17:24:28.926044 [root_agent]: Excellent. Based on all the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam** because:

- Sam is 10 years old (under 16)
- Sam lives with you
- You are responsible for Sam - you pay for his food, clothes, and look after him
- You both live in the UK
- You are a UK citizen
- No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Sam

You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit for Sam.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T17:24:30.764726 [actor]: ok thanks thats what i needed to know

2026-01-28T17:24:35.654131 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am eligible to claim Child Benefit for my 10-year-old son Sam who lives with me, correctly identifying all the key eligibility criteria (child under 16, lives with claimant, claimant is responsible for the child, both live in UK, UK citizen, and no one else claiming). The expected outcome was "Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)" which aligns with the scenario where I can claim for Sam and Tina can claim for Ella, with each receiving the higher rate for their respective child as the eldest in their household.
