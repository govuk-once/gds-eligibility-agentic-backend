2026-01-28T17:25:06.396504 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T17:25:08.098523 [actor]: groceries for daughtr every month £120 worth

2026-01-28T17:25:09.866314 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I can see you have a daughter and you're spending on groceries for her.

To assess your eligibility for Child Benefit, I need to ask: **How old is your daughter?**

2026-01-28T17:25:11.451846 [actor]: shes 12

2026-01-28T17:25:13.544951 [root_agent]: Thank you. Your daughter is 12 years old, which means she meets the age requirement (under 16).

Now I need to ask: **Is your daughter living with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit toward her upkeep if she lives elsewhere?**

2026-01-28T17:25:15.178424 [actor]: she doesnt live with me i send the grocerys

2026-01-28T17:25:18.649255 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. You send groceries worth £120 per month to your daughter who doesn't live with you.

This is important information. Let me ask: **Are you contributing at least as much as the Child Benefit amount would be toward her costs?**

For context, Child Benefit is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child (which would be about £110-111 per month), and you're sending £120 worth of groceries monthly.

But I also need to know: **Does someone else live with your daughter and look after her on a day-to-day basis?**

2026-01-28T17:25:20.315184 [actor]: her mum looks after her i send stuff every 4 weeks

2026-01-28T17:25:22.834383 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your daughter lives with her mum, who looks after her day-to-day, and you send groceries every 4 weeks.

This is an important point: **Is her mum currently claiming Child Benefit for your daughter?**

2026-01-28T17:25:24.505719 [actor]: dont no if shes claiming anythign

2026-01-28T17:25:27.332775 [root_agent]: Thank you for being honest about that.

Here's an important question: **Are you responsible for your daughter? By this I mean, do you have a legal responsibility for her care, or do you contribute to the costs of looking after her regularly?**

I can see you're already contributing £120 worth of groceries every month, which shows you're supporting her financially.

2026-01-28T17:25:29.152023 [actor]: yes im her dad i buy grocerys and cloths for her

2026-01-28T17:25:32.325725 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. As her dad, you do have parental responsibility and you're contributing financially to her upkeep through groceries and clothes.

Now, here's a key question: **Do you want to claim Child Benefit for your daughter, even though she lives with her mum?**

I should explain that normally only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. If her mum is already claiming it, that could affect your eligibility. But if she's not claiming it, you may be able to claim it yourself if you're contributing at least as much as the Child Benefit amount toward your daughter's costs.

2026-01-28T17:25:33.884506 [actor]: can i claim it then

2026-01-28T17:25:36.464569 [root_agent]: That's a good question. Let me help you understand your situation based on what you've told me.

Before I can give you a clear answer, I need to know one more thing: **Are you and your daughter's mum living together, or do you live in separate households?**

This is important because the rules are different depending on whether parents live together or apart.

2026-01-28T17:25:38.303359 [actor]: seprate households i sed i dont live with her

2026-01-28T17:25:43.111822 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right, apologies - you did tell me your daughter doesn't live with you.

Based on what you've shared:
- Your daughter is 12 (under 16) ✓
- She lives with her mum in a separate household
- You're her dad with parental responsibility ✓
- You contribute £120 in groceries monthly plus clothes ✓

Here's the situation: **Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child.** Normally, this would be the person the child lives with - in this case, her mum.

However, if her mum is NOT claiming Child Benefit, then you could potentially claim it because you're contributing at least as much as the Child Benefit amount (around £110 per month) toward your daughter's costs.

So my final question is: **Would you be able to find out from your daughter's mum whether she is claiming Child Benefit or not?** 

This is crucial because if she is already claiming it, you cannot also claim it. If she's not claiming it, then you may be eligible to make a claim yourself.

2026-01-28T17:25:44.606825 [actor]: so am i eligble or not

2026-01-28T17:25:48.908847 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, here's your answer:

**You ARE potentially eligible to claim Child Benefit** because:
- Your daughter is 12 (under 16) ✓
- You are her parent with parental responsibility ✓
- You contribute at least as much as Child Benefit would be (£120/month in groceries plus clothes) ✓

**HOWEVER**, there's one critical condition: **Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child at a time.**

So:
- **If her mum is already claiming Child Benefit** for your daughter → You cannot claim it
- **If her mum is NOT claiming Child Benefit** → You can claim it

**You need to find out whether her mum is already claiming it before you apply.** If she is claiming it and you both try to claim, only one claim will be accepted (usually the person the child lives with).

Does that make sense? Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T17:25:50.552610 [actor]: ok so i can claim it thanks

2026-01-28T17:25:54.550606 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that I am potentially eligible for Child Benefit as I meet the key criteria (daughter under 16, parental responsibility, contributing at least the Child Benefit amount), but correctly clarified the crucial condition that only one person can claim at a time and that I need to verify whether the mother is already claiming before I can successfully claim it myself.
