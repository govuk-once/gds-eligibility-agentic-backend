**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the applicant is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

The agent's reasoning was sound:
1. They established that Bella is 16 and lives with her mother who is responsible for her
2. They confirmed Bella works less than 24 hours per week
3. They identified the critical issue: Bella's training is **employer-paid** as part of her employment with a travel agency
4. They correctly concluded that "work-based training paid for by an employer typically does not count as 'approved education or training' for Child Benefit purposes"

This aligns with the scenario's Criteria 2, which explicitly states that education counts as "approved" only if it is **not paid for by an employer**. Since the employer (the local travel agency) pays for Bella's training course, she does not meet the approved education/training requirement for 16-19 year olds to qualify for Child Benefit.

The agent communicated this outcome clearly to the user, who acknowledged understanding that they are not eligible.
