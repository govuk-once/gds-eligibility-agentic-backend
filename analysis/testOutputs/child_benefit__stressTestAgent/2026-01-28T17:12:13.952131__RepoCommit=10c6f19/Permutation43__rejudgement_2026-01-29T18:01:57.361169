**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, but according to the expected outcome, the user should be **not eligible**.

The critical error is in the agent's assessment of apprenticeships in Scotland. According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, there is an important distinction:

- In **England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland**, you generally **cannot** get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship
- Only in **Wales** is there a specific exception for certain approved apprenticeships

The scenario explicitly states that Callum is in a "Modern Apprenticeship" in Glasgow, **Scotland**. The permutation guidance confirms: "The guidance notes that in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, you generally cannot get Child Benefit for a child doing an apprenticeship (unlike the specific Welsh exception)."

The agent incorrectly stated that "Modern apprenticeships in Scotland are generally approved training programs" for Child Benefit purposes, leading to the wrong eligibility determination. The correct outcome should have been that the user is **not eligible** because apprenticeships in Scotland do not qualify as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Therefore, the agent's communicated eligibility outcome does **not** agree with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
