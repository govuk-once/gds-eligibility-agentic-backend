2026-01-26T14:55:07.894103 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:55:10.943098 [actor]: I'll take on the role of a person in the described situation (James) who doesn't live with his child but pays £50 weekly for child maintenance due to a court order.

I'll respond to the agent's question about Child Benefit eligibility based on this scenario.

Yes, I have a child but they don't live with me. I pay £50 a week for maintenance though, because I have to - there's a court order that makes me pay it.

2026-01-26T14:55:12.433510 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that you have a child who doesn't live with you, and you pay £50 a week for maintenance due to a court order.

For Child Benefit eligibility, an important factor is whether you have responsibility for the child. May I ask who the child primarily lives with?

2026-01-26T14:55:14.034610 [actor]: My child lives with their mother. We separated a few years ago, and the court decided they should live with her. I see my child sometimes on weekends when I can, but they live at her house full-time.

2026-01-26T14:55:17.069955 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation. I understand that your child lives full-time with their mother, and you see them sometimes on weekends.

According to UK Child Benefit rules, Child Benefit can only be claimed by the person who has the main responsibility for the child. Since your child lives with their mother full-time, she would typically be considered the person with main responsibility for the child and would be eligible to claim Child Benefit rather than you.

The fact that you pay child maintenance through a court order and have occasional weekend visits doesn't change this eligibility assessment, as the benefit is designed to go to the person with whom the child primarily lives.

Would you like me to explain anything else about Child Benefit or are there other support options you'd like to know about?

2026-01-26T14:55:19.758437 [actor]: I see. So since my child lives with their mother full-time, I'm not eligible to claim the Child Benefit, even though I'm paying that maintenance money every week. That makes sense, I suppose, since she's the one taking care of them day-to-day.

Does the fact that my payments are court-ordered rather than voluntary make any difference to anything? Or is that irrelevant for Child Benefit purposes?

2026-01-26T14:55:22.199232 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can only be claimed by the person with main responsibility for the child (the mother in this case), and correctly stated that paying court-ordered maintenance does not qualify the non-resident parent for Child Benefit.
