2026-01-28T13:08:20.997994 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent did not communicate the expected outcome that Sue is eligible and Pete is not eligible. The agent only explained that HMRC would make a decision based on factors including time spent with each parent, but never clearly stated that Pete would not be eligible because Holly lives with Sue more days per week.
