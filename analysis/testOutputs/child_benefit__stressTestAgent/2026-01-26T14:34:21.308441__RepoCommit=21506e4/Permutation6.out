2026-01-26T14:36:15.650844 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:36:17.205804 [actor]: I'm Mary, and I have a daughter named Chloe who's 6 years old. She's currently in the hospital though - has been there for about 14 weeks now because of a serious condition. I visit her every day.

2026-01-26T14:36:19.519020 [root_agent]: I'm sorry to hear about Chloe's situation, Mary. Thank you for sharing that information.

Since your daughter is in the hospital, I need to understand your circumstances better. Are you still considered responsible for Chloe even while she's in the hospital? For example, do you make decisions about her care and maintain regular contact with her (which you mentioned you do by visiting daily)?

2026-01-26T14:36:21.458816 [actor]: Yes, I'm still completely responsible for Chloe. I'm her mother and I make all decisions about her care. Like I said, I visit her every day at the hospital, and I'm always in contact with the doctors about her treatment. I bring her books, new pajamas, and special foods she likes - probably spend about £30 a week on things for her at the hospital.

2026-01-26T14:36:23.416868 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mary. Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you're maintaining your responsibility for Chloe while she's in the hospital.

Since Chloe has been in the hospital for about 14 weeks, I need to ask: is her hospital stay expected to be temporary, or has there been any indication that it might be a long-term arrangement (more than 52 weeks)?

2026-01-26T14:36:25.566281 [actor]: Her stay is expected to be temporary. The doctors haven't given me an exact timeline, but they're treating her condition and hoping she'll recover enough to come home. They definitely haven't suggested it would be anywhere near 52 weeks. It's already been longer than we initially expected at 14 weeks, but we're taking it day by day with the treatments.

2026-01-26T14:36:28.581909 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Mary. Since Chloe's hospital stay is expected to be temporary and less than 52 weeks, and you're maintaining responsibility for her through regular visits and involvement in her care, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit.

Child Benefit can generally continue to be paid for up to 12 weeks automatically when a child goes into hospital. Since it's been 14 weeks now, it would be a good idea to contact the Child Benefit Office to update them on Chloe's situation if you haven't already done so.

May I ask if you're already receiving Child Benefit for Chloe, or are you looking to make a new claim?

2026-01-26T14:36:31.120116 [actor]: I've been receiving Child Benefit for Chloe since she was born. I was worried it might stop now that she's been in the hospital longer than 12 weeks. I didn't know about that rule until recently, and I haven't contacted the Child Benefit Office about her hospital stay yet. Should I be concerned that my payments will stop?

2026-01-26T14:36:35.897839 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation, Mary. I understand your concern about the payments potentially stopping after the 12-week period.

Since you've been receiving Child Benefit for Chloe and you continue to be responsible for her care (visiting daily, providing items for her, and making decisions about her treatment), you should still be eligible for Child Benefit even beyond the 12-week period.

However, you should contact the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible to inform them about Chloe's hospital stay, especially now that it has exceeded 12 weeks. They need to be updated about your circumstances, but based on the information you've provided, you should still qualify for continued payments since:

1. Chloe's hospital stay is expected to be temporary (less than 52 weeks)
2. You remain responsible for her care
3. You maintain regular contact with her

The Child Benefit Office can confirm this for your specific situation and ensure that your payments continue without interruption.

Would you like to know how to contact the Child Benefit Office?

2026-01-26T14:36:37.628493 [actor]: Yes please, I'd appreciate knowing how to contact the Child Benefit Office. I'm relieved to hear I should still be eligible for the payments since I'm definitely still supporting Chloe through all this. I'll call them right away to let them know about our situation.

2026-01-26T14:36:42.133787 [root_agent]: I'm glad you're feeling relieved, Mary. You can contact the Child Benefit Office in the following ways:

By phone:
Call the Child Benefit Helpline at 0300 200 3100
Opening hours are Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm
(The line is closed on bank holidays)

You'll need your National Insurance number and Child Benefit reference number when you call.

By post:
Child Benefit Office
PO Box 1
Newcastle Upon Tyne
NE88 1AA

When you speak with them, explain Chloe's hospital situation, how long she's been there, that you're still maintaining responsibility for her care through daily visits, and that her stay is expected to be temporary. They'll be able to update your records and provide specific guidance for your circumstances.

I hope Chloe recovers well and can return home soon. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T14:36:45.682279 [actor]: No, that covers everything I needed to know. Thank you so much for your help and the contact information. I'll call the Child Benefit Helpline tomorrow with my details and explain our situation. I really appreciate your clear explanation about still being eligible despite the 12-week rule since I'm still caring for Chloe. It's one less thing to worry about during this difficult time. Thank you again for your help.

2026-01-26T14:36:48.002797 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Mary remains eligible for Child Benefit even beyond the 12-week hospital stay period because she maintains responsibility for her child, visits daily, the stay is expected to be temporary (less than 52 weeks), and properly advised contacting the Child Benefit Office to update them on the situation.
