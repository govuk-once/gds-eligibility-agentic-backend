2026-01-26T14:51:19.480186 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you several questions one at a time to assess your situation properly.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:51:21.249773 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user checking about child benefit eligibility.

Yes, I have a 15-year-old son named Simon. He's been detained under the Mental Health Act though and is currently in a secure psychiatric unit. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-26T14:51:22.737903 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that you have a 15-year-old son named Simon who is currently detained in a secure psychiatric unit under the Mental Health Act for about 10 weeks.

Next question: Is Simon expected to be in the psychiatric unit for 12 weeks or less in total?

2026-01-26T14:51:23.894715 [actor]: Yes, he's only expected to be there for about 10 weeks in total. His doctors think that should be sufficient for his treatment plan.

2026-01-26T14:51:25.711972 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Simon is expected to be in the psychiatric unit for less than 12 weeks (approximately 10 weeks), this would typically mean you can still receive Child Benefit during this period.

Next question: Before Simon was detained, was he living with you and were you responsible for his care?

2026-01-26T14:51:26.828997 [actor]: Yes, Simon was living with me before he was detained. I'm a single parent and I've been responsible for his care since he was little.

2026-01-26T14:51:28.143972 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you were responsible for Simon's care before his detention, and he was living with you, this strengthens your eligibility.

Next question: Are you a UK resident?

2026-01-26T14:51:29.138806 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK resident. I've lived in Manchester for the past 20 years.

2026-01-26T14:51:30.995684 [root_agent]: Thank you. Being a UK resident is an important eligibility criterion.

Next question: Are you subject to immigration control? (This would mean you have permission to stay in the UK, but that permission says you cannot claim public funds, or you need permission to stay in the UK but do not have it yet.)

2026-01-26T14:51:32.073952 [actor]: No, I'm not subject to immigration control. I'm a British citizen born here in the UK.

2026-01-26T14:51:33.710044 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Next question: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T14:51:35.256073 [actor]: No, I don't earn anywhere near that much. I work part-time at a local shop and earn about £18,000 per year. I don't have a partner.

2026-01-26T14:51:39.317868 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Based on your income being well below the £60,000 threshold, you would be eligible for the full Child Benefit payment without any High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on all the information you've provided, I can confirm that you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for your son Simon because:

1. You have responsibility for a child under 16 (your 15-year-old son)
2. You were responsible for his care before his detention
3. Simon is expected to be in the psychiatric unit for less than 12 weeks
4. You are a UK resident and British citizen
5. You are not subject to immigration control
6. Your income is below the threshold that would reduce Child Benefit

You should continue to receive Child Benefit while Simon is temporarily in the psychiatric unit since his stay is expected to be less than 12 weeks. If his stay extends beyond 12 weeks, you would need to inform the Child Benefit Office about the change in circumstances.

Is there anything specific about Child Benefit that you'd like to know more about?

2026-01-26T14:51:41.918389 [actor]: Thank you for confirming I'm eligible for Child Benefit while Simon is in the psychiatric unit. That's a relief to know I can continue receiving it during his treatment. I was worried I might lose that support during this difficult time. It's good to know that since his stay is less than 12 weeks, I can keep receiving the benefit.

2026-01-26T14:51:45.774510 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the user is eligible for Child Benefit while their 15-year-old son is temporarily detained in a psychiatric unit for less than 12 weeks (10 weeks), which aligns with gov.uk guidance that Child Benefit can continue during hospital stays under 12 weeks.
