2026-01-26T14:35:44.735474 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:35:46.066610 [actor]: I'll assume the role of Elena, a 42-year-old mother trying to determine eligibility for Child Benefit.

Yes, I have a daughter named Sofia who is 18 years old. She lives with me.

2026-01-26T14:35:48.556607 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit for your 18-year-old daughter Sofia. 

Since Sofia is 18, is she currently in approved education or training? This would typically include full-time education such as A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, or certain approved training courses.

2026-01-26T14:35:49.889990 [actor]: No, Sofia isn't in education or training. She finished school two years ago and now works as a receptionist. She works about 30 hours a week.

2026-01-26T14:35:52.817044 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Since Sofia is 18 years old and is not in approved education or training (she's working as a receptionist), I'm afraid you wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit for her.

Child Benefit is typically available for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. Since Sofia is 18 and working rather than being in education or training, she falls outside the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

Do you have any other children you'd like me to assess for Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T14:35:54.784941 [actor]: No, Sofia is my only child. Thank you for letting me know about the eligibility criteria. I wasn't sure if I could still claim since she's living with me, but I understand now that since she's working and not in education, I'm not eligible.

2026-01-26T14:35:56.811224 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available for an 18-year-old who is working and not in approved education or training.
