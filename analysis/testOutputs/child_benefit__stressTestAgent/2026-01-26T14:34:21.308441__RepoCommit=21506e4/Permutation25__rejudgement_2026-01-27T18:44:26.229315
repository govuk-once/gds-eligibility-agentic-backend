2026-01-27T18:50:54.159885 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent provided incorrect information. According to the scenario description, when a spouse/partner contributes to the child's upkeep (£30/week in this case), this counts as the applicant's contribution and Beatrice remains eligible for Child Benefit. The agent failed to provide the correct outcome.
