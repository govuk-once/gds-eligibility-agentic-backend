2026-01-26T14:40:26.595443 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility correctly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have any children that you're responsible for? This could include your own children or other children you're caring for.

2026-01-26T14:40:29.738218 [actor]: I need to play the role of someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll engage in dialogue with the agent as specified.

Hi there. Yes, I have a daughter named Emma. She's 12 years old. She doesn't actually live with me though - she lives with her mother. We're separated. But I'd like to claim Child Benefit for her if that's possible.

2026-01-26T14:40:32.101902 [root_agent]: I understand that you have a 12-year-old daughter named Emma who lives with her mother, and you're wondering if you can claim Child Benefit for her.

Generally, Child Benefit is usually paid to the person the child lives with. Since Emma lives with her mother, her mother would typically be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit.

May I ask, does Emma's mother already claim Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-26T14:40:33.512237 [actor]: No, her mother doesn't claim Child Benefit for Emma. That's part of why I was wondering if I could claim it instead, even though Emma doesn't live with me.

2026-01-26T14:40:35.082275 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Emma's mother isn't claiming Child Benefit, I need to understand more about your situation to determine if you might be eligible.

Do you provide any financial support for Emma's upkeep, or contribute to her living costs?

2026-01-26T14:40:36.466715 [actor]: Yes, I do provide some financial support for Emma. I send her a birthday present once a year, and I transfer £10 a week to her mother to help with food costs.

2026-01-26T14:40:38.970339 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I appreciate that you do provide some financial support for Emma.

For Child Benefit eligibility, the UK government typically considers who has the main responsibility for the child. Since Emma lives with her mother full-time, her mother would generally be considered the person with main responsibility, even though you provide some financial support.

May I ask if you have any formal custody or parenting arrangement that specifies your responsibilities for Emma?

2026-01-26T14:40:41.125178 [actor]: No, we don't have any formal custody arrangement written down. Her mother has always been Emma's primary caregiver since we split up. I just try to help out with the £10 a week and getting her something nice for her birthday. Is that not enough to qualify for the benefit?

2026-01-26T14:40:44.190617 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. Based on the information you've provided, you would not likely be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma. 

Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who has main responsibility for the child, which is generally the person the child lives with. Since Emma lives with her mother full-time and her mother is the primary caregiver without any formal shared custody arrangement, her mother would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit, not yourself.

The occasional financial support you provide, while commendable, doesn't constitute having main responsibility for Emma in the way that's required for Child Benefit eligibility.

Would you like me to explain how Emma's mother could apply for Child Benefit if she hasn't already claimed it?

2026-01-26T14:40:46.503457 [actor]: I see. So the £10 a week I send isn't enough to qualify me for the benefit. That's disappointing, but thank you for explaining it clearly. 

Yes, I would appreciate if you could tell me how her mother could apply. Maybe I could pass that information along to her since she hasn't claimed it yet.

2026-01-26T14:40:49.166562 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the person who has main responsibility for the child (typically the person the child lives with) is eligible for Child Benefit, not the non-resident parent who provides occasional financial support.
