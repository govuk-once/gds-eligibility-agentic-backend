The agent correctly explained that Lucas is eligible to claim Child Benefit, while noting that since Emily earns over £60,000, she would need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge. The agent provided accurate information about the options available and correctly identified that Emily would be the one responsible for paying the tax even though Lucas would be the one receiving the benefit.
