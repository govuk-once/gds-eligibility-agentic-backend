2026-01-26T14:43:26.512321 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you several questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T14:43:28.628273 [actor]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit by answering questions about your situation.

Yes, I have responsibility for my son Arthur who is 7 years old. However, he's currently in the hospital. He was in the hospital for 10 weeks, then came home for 2 weeks, but got sick again and went back to the hospital 15 days after being discharged. He's been back in the hospital for 3 weeks now.

2026-01-26T14:43:31.773935 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about your son Arthur. I understand he's 7 years old and has been in the hospital recently with some back-and-forth stays.

For Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in hospital, there are specific rules. Based on the information you've provided, since Arthur normally lives with you and is temporarily in the hospital, you would still be eligible for Child Benefit during these hospital stays.

The rules state that Child Benefit can continue to be paid when a child is in hospital. There isn't a time limit for how long your child can stay in hospital while you continue to receive Child Benefit.

May I ask, are you responsible for Arthur's regular living costs while he's in the hospital?

2026-01-26T14:43:34.160773 [actor]: Yes, I'm still responsible for Arthur's living costs while he's in the hospital. I bring him clothes, pajamas, his favorite toys, books, and other personal items. I also pay for his tablet that he uses to watch shows and play games while he's there. I visit him almost every day and sometimes buy food items that he prefers over the hospital meals.

2026-01-26T14:43:37.564121 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's clear that you're continuing to provide for Arthur's needs while he's in the hospital, which is important for Child Benefit eligibility.

Based on what you've shared, you would be eligible for Child Benefit for Arthur as:
1. He is under 16 years old (he's 7)
2. You're responsible for him and continue to provide for his needs
3. He normally lives with you and is only temporarily in the hospital
4. You continue to be responsible for his living costs during his hospital stay

May I ask if either you or a partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year? This affects whether you might be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge, though it doesn't affect eligibility itself.

2026-01-26T14:43:38.829756 [actor]: No, neither my partner nor I have an income over £60,000 per year. We're both working but our combined household income is well below that threshold.

2026-01-26T14:43:42.059420 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information. Since neither you nor your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year, you won't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on all the information you've provided:
- You're responsible for Arthur who is 7 years old
- He normally lives with you and is only temporarily in hospital
- You continue to be responsible for his living costs and care
- Neither you nor your partner have an individual income over £60,000

I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit for Arthur. Even during his hospital stays, your Child Benefit payments should continue without interruption, as there's no time limit on how long a child can stay in hospital while you receive Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility or the application process?

2026-01-26T14:43:44.530529 [actor]: Thank you for confirming that I'm eligible for Child Benefit for Arthur even while he's in the hospital. That's a relief to hear. I was worried that his extended hospital stays might affect my eligibility, especially since he's been in and out. Could you tell me if I need to notify anyone about his hospital stays, or does my benefit continue automatically?

2026-01-26T14:43:46.756227 [actor]: Thank you for your question about notifying authorities about Arthur's hospital stays. You don't need to notify the Child Benefit Office specifically about Arthur's hospital stays - your benefit will continue automatically. The Child Benefit continues regardless of how long a child is in hospital, as long as you're still responsible for them and their living costs, which you clearly are. If you have any other questions about your Child Benefit, feel free to ask.

2026-01-26T14:43:48.614580 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that the user is eligible for Child Benefit while their child is temporarily in hospital, as there's no time limit on hospital stays affecting eligibility as long as the parent remains responsible for the child's living costs.
