2026-01-26T14:53:29.189803 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, are you responsible for raising a child who is under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:53:31.208972 [actor]: Hi there! I'm looking to find out if I can get Child Benefit. I have a son named Leo who is 12 years old, but he's currently in local authority care. He does come home to visit me every Saturday morning at 10:00 AM and stays until Sunday at 11:00 AM before going back to the care home.

2026-01-26T14:53:33.332566 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand that your 12-year-old son Leo is in local authority care but visits you regularly on weekends.

For children in local authority care, there are specific rules regarding Child Benefit eligibility. Since Leo is in care but comes home to visit you regularly, I need to understand the arrangement better.

How long has Leo been in local authority care?

2026-01-26T14:53:35.081976 [actor]: Leo has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks now. It's been quite a while actually, but I'm thankful that he still gets to come home for those weekend visits.

2026-01-26T14:53:38.281774 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since Leo has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, I need to consider the specific rules that apply to this situation.

Based on the UK government guidelines, Child Benefit usually stops if a child has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks. However, there are exceptions if the child regularly spends time at home.

Does Leo's weekend visits home (from Saturday morning until Sunday) happen every weekend without fail? And have these regular weekend visits been established and ongoing?

2026-01-26T14:53:39.932713 [actor]: Yes, Leo comes home every weekend without fail. This has been the consistent arrangement for quite some time now. He arrives at 10:00 AM on Saturday and stays until 11:00 AM on Sunday when I take him back to the care home.

2026-01-26T14:53:43.981322 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that information. 

Based on the UK government guidelines for Child Benefit, you may be eligible for what's called "weekly Child Benefit payments" since Leo regularly returns home to you for overnight visits. When a child in care regularly comes home to stay with you overnight, you can claim Child Benefit for those days.

Since Leo stays with you overnight from Saturday to Sunday every week without fail, you would be eligible for Child Benefit payments for those days. This would be calculated as a proportion of the full weekly rate based on the number of days Leo spends with you.

To claim this, you would need to contact the Child Benefit Office to explain your circumstances. They may ask for confirmation of the arrangement from the local authority caring for Leo.

Would you like to know more about how to make this claim or how the payment might be calculated?

2026-01-26T14:53:46.611566 [actor]: That's really good news! I'm glad to hear I might be eligible for some Child Benefit payments. So just to be clear, I can claim for the time Leo spends with me from Saturday to Sunday each week?

Can you tell me how the payment might be calculated based on his 25-hour weekend visits? And yes, I would like to know how to make this claim - would I need to fill out a specific form or just call them?

2026-01-26T14:53:52.255111 [root_agent]: I'm glad I could provide some helpful information. Let me clarify about the payment calculation and claim process:

Yes, you can claim Child Benefit for the time Leo spends with you from Saturday to Sunday each week.

Regarding the payment calculation:
Child Benefit is usually calculated on a daily basis for children in care who regularly return home. The calculation is typically 1/7 of the weekly rate for each day the child stays with you (including overnight stays). Since Leo stays one full day and parts of two days each weekend, you should be entitled to payment for those days.

As for making the claim:
1. If you're not already receiving Child Benefit, you'll need to fill out the Child Benefit claim form CH2.
2. If you're already registered for Child Benefit but payments were stopped when Leo went into care, you should contact the Child Benefit Office directly.
3. You'll need to explain your specific circumstances - that Leo is in local authority care but returns home regularly every weekend.
4. The Child Benefit Office may request written confirmation from the local authority about the arrangement.

The best approach would be to call the Child Benefit Helpline on 0300 200 3100 to explain your situation and they can guide you through the specific process for your circumstances.

2026-01-26T14:53:55.274390 [actor]: Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly. I understand now that I can claim Child Benefit for the days Leo spends with me on the weekends. I'll call the Child Benefit Helpline on 0300 200 3100 to explain my situation and get their guidance on the next steps.

I appreciate your help in confirming that I'm eligible for this benefit even though Leo is in care, since he regularly stays with me overnight during weekends. This will definitely help with the extra costs when he's home.

2026-01-26T14:53:57.919303 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidelines, when a child has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, Child Benefit stops and cannot be claimed for weekend visits. The agent provided incorrect information about eligibility for "weekly Child Benefit payments" for overnight visits.
