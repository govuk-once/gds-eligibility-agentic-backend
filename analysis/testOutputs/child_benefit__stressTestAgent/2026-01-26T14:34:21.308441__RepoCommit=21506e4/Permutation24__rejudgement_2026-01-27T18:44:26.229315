2026-01-27T18:51:00.526548 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent did not specify that eligibility would only last until week 12 of Tom being in residential accommodation. The expected outcome was "Eligible (until week 12)" but the agent indicated ongoing eligibility without mentioning this crucial time limit, despite acknowledging earlier that Child Benefit continues for "up to 12 weeks."
