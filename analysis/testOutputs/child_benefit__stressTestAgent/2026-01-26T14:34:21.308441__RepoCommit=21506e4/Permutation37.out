2026-01-26T14:49:50.753725 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility correctly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, are you responsible for raising a child under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:49:52.375166 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for looking after a 10-year-old girl named Nina. She's the daughter of my best friend who's currently ill, so Nina has come to live with me for the foreseeable future.

2026-01-26T14:49:53.733335 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. To clarify your situation with Nina, I need to ask: Is Nina living with you full-time while your friend is ill, and are you taking on the main responsibility for her care and well-being?

2026-01-26T14:49:55.352148 [actor]: Yes, Nina is living with me full-time while her mother (my best friend) is ill. I'm taking on the main responsibility for her care and well-being. This is a private arrangement between me and her mother - we've notified the local council about this arrangement, but they're not providing any financial support or fostering allowance to me.

2026-01-26T14:49:56.562593 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining. That's helpful information. 

Is Nina normally living in the United Kingdom with you?

2026-01-26T14:49:57.791095 [actor]: Yes, Nina is living with me in the United Kingdom. We're both UK residents, and she's staying with me full-time while her mother recovers from her illness.

2026-01-26T14:49:59.053596 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Do you currently receive any other payments or financial support specifically for looking after Nina?

2026-01-26T14:50:00.588757 [actor]: No, I don't receive any financial support for looking after Nina. As I mentioned, the local council is aware of our arrangement, but they don't pay me a fostering allowance or cover Nina's accommodation costs. This is completely a private arrangement between me and Nina's mother.

2026-01-26T14:50:01.755379 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Is Nina currently enrolled in school or another form of approved education?

2026-01-26T14:50:02.996310 [actor]: Yes, Nina is enrolled in school. She's 10 years old and attends the local primary school. I take her there every morning and pick her up in the afternoon.

2026-01-26T14:50:05.713442 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Nina is enrolled in school.

Based on what you've told me so far, it appears you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Nina. This is because:

1. You're responsible for caring for a child under 16 who lives with you full-time
2. Both you and Nina are living in the UK
3. You're not receiving other payments for looking after her
4. This appears to be a private arrangement with her mother

However, I need to ask one more question: Do you have a household income over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-26T14:50:06.550586 [actor]: No, my household income is below £50,000 per year.

2026-01-26T14:50:10.744968 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on all the details you've shared, you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina while she's living with you. Since:

1. You're responsible for caring for Nina (a child under 16)
2. She lives with you full-time in the UK
3. You're not receiving any other payments for her care
4. Your household income is below £50,000 (so you won't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge)
5. This is a private arrangement with her mother

You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit. Since you're not Nina's biological parent, you may need to provide some additional information about your arrangement when applying.

To claim Child Benefit, you'll need to fill out a CH2 claim form. You can apply as soon as you've registered the birth or the child has come to live with you (as in your case).

Would you like to know what documentation you might need to support your application?

2026-01-26T14:50:12.278857 [actor]: Yes, that would be very helpful. I'd appreciate knowing what documentation I'll need to support my application for Child Benefit for Nina.

2026-01-26T14:50:13.878081 [actor]: Thank you for confirming I'm eligible for Child Benefit while caring for Nina. I'll make sure to gather the necessary documentation and complete the CH2 claim form. I appreciate your help in explaining my eligibility situation.

2026-01-26T14:50:15.496661 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that a person caring for a friend's child through a private arrangement is eligible for Child Benefit, provided they meet all other criteria.
