The agent correctly determined eligibility for Child Benefit based on all criteria: Priya is under 20 and in approved education (A-levels), lives with her father, they're both UK residents, and Amit's income of £40,000 is below the threshold for reduced benefits. The outcome matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."
