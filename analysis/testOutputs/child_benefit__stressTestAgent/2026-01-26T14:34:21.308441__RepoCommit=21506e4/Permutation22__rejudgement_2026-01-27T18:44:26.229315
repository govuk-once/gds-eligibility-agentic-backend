2026-01-27T18:51:18.609701 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent provided incorrect information. According to the Child Benefit rules, after a cumulative 12 weeks in hospital (with gaps of less than 28 days counting as continuous), eligibility ceases. Arthur has been in hospital for 13 weeks total (10 weeks + 3 weeks), with only a 15-day gap, so the expected outcome should be "Not Eligible."
