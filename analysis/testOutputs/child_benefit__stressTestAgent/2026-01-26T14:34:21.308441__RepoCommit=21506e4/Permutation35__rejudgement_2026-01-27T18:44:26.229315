2026-01-27T18:51:26.550450 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated the eligibility rules. According to the scenario, there is an exception that applies when the child lives with the claimant and depends on them financially (which is the case here). The expected outcome should have been "Eligible (via Exception)" but the agent incorrectly stated they were not eligible.
