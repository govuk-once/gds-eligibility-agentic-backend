2026-01-26T14:35:58.595938 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to assess your eligibility.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:36:00.866447 [actor]: I'm Mark, and I'm wondering if I can claim Child Benefit for my son Lucas. He's 10 years old but doesn't live with me - he lives with my ex-wife Jenny after our divorce. I send Jenny £150 every month specifically for Lucas's food and clothes. Jenny isn't claiming Child Benefit for him, but since I'm contributing to his upkeep, I thought I might be eligible to claim instead.

2026-01-26T14:36:02.761307 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context, Mark. I understand your situation better now.

Since your son Lucas lives with your ex-wife Jenny and not with you, I need to understand more about the living arrangements to determine your eligibility for Child Benefit.

Would you say your ex-wife Jenny has the main day-to-day responsibility for looking after Lucas?

2026-01-26T14:36:04.757648 [actor]: Yes, Jenny definitely has the main day-to-day responsibility for Lucas since he lives with her full-time. She handles his daily routine, takes him to school, and everything else. I see Lucas regularly for visits, but Jenny is his primary caregiver. I just contribute financially with that £150 per month to help with his expenses.

2026-01-26T14:36:08.998622 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Mark. Based on what you've shared, I need to inform you that you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas.

According to the UK government guidelines, Child Benefit can usually only be claimed by the person who has the main responsibility for the child. Since Jenny has the main day-to-day responsibility for Lucas, she would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit, not you.

The monthly payment you make of £150 is considered child maintenance or financial support, which is separate from Child Benefit eligibility. Financial contributions alone don't qualify you for Child Benefit if you don't have the main responsibility for the child.

If Jenny isn't claiming Child Benefit for Lucas but is eligible to do so, you might want to suggest that she applies, as this could provide additional financial support for Lucas's upbringing.

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit or related support options?

2026-01-26T14:36:11.819218 [actor]: I see, so even though I'm contributing financially, I can't claim Child Benefit since I don't have the main responsibility for Lucas. That makes sense, but it's a bit disappointing to hear. I'll definitely suggest to Jenny that she should apply for it since she's eligible and not claiming it currently. This would help with Lucas's expenses. Thank you for explaining this to me clearly.

2026-01-26T14:36:14.138443 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can only be claimed by the person with main day-to-day responsibility for the child (Jenny), not by someone who only contributes financially (Mark).
