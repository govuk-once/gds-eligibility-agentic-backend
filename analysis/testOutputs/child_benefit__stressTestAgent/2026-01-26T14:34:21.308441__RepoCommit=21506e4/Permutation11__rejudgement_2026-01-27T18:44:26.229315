2026-01-27T18:52:11.319648 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that Karen is eligible for Child Benefit when a government-funded apprenticeship in England is actually a disqualifying event for Child Benefit. According to UK rules, paid apprenticeships in England are not considered "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes after age 16.
