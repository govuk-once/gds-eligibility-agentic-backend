2026-01-29T11:31:15.408773 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T11:31:17.368747 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, she's 8 years old.

2026-01-29T11:31:18.948550 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does your daughter normally live with you, or does she live with someone else?

2026-01-29T11:31:20.675391 [actor]: Well, she normally lives with me, but she's been in the hospital for about 14 weeks now. I visit her every single day for hours to keep her company.

2026-01-29T11:31:23.958640 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. I'm sorry to hear your daughter has been in hospital for such a long time.

The good news is that you can still claim Child Benefit even when a child is in hospital, as long as you continue to contribute to the cost of supporting them. Since you're visiting her every day and maintaining that close relationship, this would typically count as continuing to support her.

Let me ask you a few more questions to complete the eligibility assessment:

Are you (or your partner if you have one) responsible for your daughter? By this I mean, are you the person who is mainly responsible for her care and upbringing?

2026-01-29T11:31:25.727997 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for her care and upbringing. I'm her parent and I visit her every day to be with her and keep her company.

2026-01-29T11:31:27.384686 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Now, do you currently live in the UK?

2026-01-29T11:31:28.946875 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:31:30.795037 [root_agent]: Thank you. Just a couple more questions to complete the assessment.

Are you or your daughter subject to immigration control, or do either of you have any restrictions on your right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-29T11:31:32.306529 [actor]: No, we're not subject to immigration control and we don't have any restrictions on our right to reside in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:31:34.332306 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One final question: Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for your daughter?

2026-01-29T11:31:35.861308 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for her.

2026-01-29T11:31:41.284328 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:

✓ You have a child (your 8-year-old daughter)
✓ She normally lives with you
✓ You are responsible for her care and upbringing
✓ You live in the UK with no immigration restrictions
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ Even though she's currently in hospital, you continue to support her by visiting daily and maintaining your parental relationship

**Important point about children in hospital:** You can continue to claim Child Benefit while your child is in hospital for up to 84 days (12 weeks), as long as you're contributing to their support - which you clearly are through your daily visits. Since your daughter has been in hospital for about 14 weeks, you should be aware that this exceeds the standard 84-day period. However, you may still be able to claim if you can demonstrate you're continuing to contribute to her support costs.

I'd recommend that you apply for Child Benefit and explain your circumstances, particularly your daily visits and ongoing involvement in her care. You can make a claim and provide details about her hospital stay.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:31:43.614943 [actor]: Actually, I should mention - the hospital provides everything for her. I don't buy her food, clothes, or gifts because they provide all of that. I just visit her every day to keep her company. Does that change anything?

2026-01-29T11:31:48.531023 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated I was eligible for Child Benefit, but according to the rules, Child Benefit cannot be claimed if a child has been in hospital for more than 84 days (12 weeks) unless the claimant continues to contribute to the cost of supporting them. The actor explicitly stated they don't contribute to any costs (no food, clothes, or gifts) as the hospital provides everything, and the child has been hospitalized for 14 weeks. The agent did mention the 84-day limit but still concluded eligibility despite the actor not meeting the requirement of contributing to support costs.
