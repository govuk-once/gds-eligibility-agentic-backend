2026-01-29T11:08:06.269998 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have any children, or are you responsible for any children?**

2026-01-29T11:08:07.760093 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Sofia. She's 18 years old.

2026-01-29T11:08:10.001886 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Since Sofia is 18, I need to ask: **Is Sofia currently in approved education or training?**

(This could include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or similar approved courses)

2026-01-29T11:08:12.270303 [actor]: No, she's not in any education or training. She actually left school two years ago when she was 16, and now she works as a receptionist. She works about 30 hours a week.

2026-01-29T11:08:15.711869 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Sofia**. Here's why:

Child Benefit is generally paid for children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training. Since Sofia is 18, left education at 16, and is now working, she doesn't meet the eligibility criteria.

Child Benefit stops when a young person:
- Turns 16 (if they leave education or training), or
- Turns 20 (if they stay in approved education or training)

In Sofia's case, Child Benefit would have stopped when she turned 16 and left school.

**Do you have any other children that you're responsible for, or would you like to ask anything else about Child Benefit?**

2026-01-29T11:08:20.995016 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the Child Benefit rules: children must be under 16, or under 20 if in approved education or training. Since Sofia is 18, left education at 16, and is working full-time, she does not meet the eligibility criteria, and the agent correctly concluded the user is not eligible for Child Benefit.
