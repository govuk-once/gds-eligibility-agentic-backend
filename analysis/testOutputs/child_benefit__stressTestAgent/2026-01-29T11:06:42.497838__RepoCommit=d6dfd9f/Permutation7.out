2026-01-29T11:09:41.474345 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Are you responsible for a child who is under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:09:43.174132 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for my son Jack. He's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T11:09:45.541880 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question:

**Does Jack normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T11:09:47.497820 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. Jack was placed in local authority care about 3 months ago, but he comes home every weekend - he arrives Friday evening and leaves Sunday evening. So he doesn't live with me full-time, but he does spend every weekend at home.

2026-01-29T11:09:49.792733 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that situation. This is an important detail.

To help me assess your eligibility properly, I need to ask:

**Is Jack in local authority care under a care order, or is this a different type of care arrangement (such as voluntary care or respite care)?**

2026-01-29T11:09:51.416635 [actor]: He's in local authority care, yes. It's been more than 3 months now since he was placed there.

2026-01-29T11:09:55.980612 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to let you know that **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.

Here's why:

When a child is in local authority care (which means the local authority is looking after them), Child Benefit stops. This applies even if the child:
- Comes home regularly for visits (like Jack does on weekends)
- Is still in contact with you
- The care arrangement has been in place for less than 8 weeks OR more than 8 weeks

The local authority receives funding to care for children in their care, which is why Child Benefit cannot be paid to parents during this time.

**However**, if Jack's care arrangement changes in the future and he comes back to live with you permanently, you would be able to claim Child Benefit again at that point.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or your situation that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-29T11:09:58.234792 [actor]: I understand, thank you for explaining that to me. It's disappointing, but I appreciate you clarifying the rules.

2026-01-29T11:10:02.473091 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital or care, when a child is in local authority care, you can still get Child Benefit if the child comes to stay with you for at least one night a week on a regular basis. Since Jack comes home every weekend (Friday evening to Sunday evening), which is clearly more than one night per week on a regular basis, the parent qualifies for an exception and should be eligible for Child Benefit.
