2026-01-29T11:10:04.855437 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:10:06.345213 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a 4-year-old daughter called Ruby who I look after.

2026-01-29T11:10:08.268569 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's good to know you have a 4-year-old daughter named Ruby who you look after.

Now I need to ask:

**Does Ruby normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T11:10:09.713246 [actor]: Yes, she lives with me and my partner James.

2026-01-29T11:10:11.897505 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Ruby lives with you and your partner James.

Next question:

**Are you or your partner James responsible for Ruby? By this I mean, do either of you provide for her care, such as feeding her, clothing her, and making decisions about her upbringing?**

2026-01-29T11:10:13.653129 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. We're both responsible for her - we both look after her, provide for all her needs, and make decisions about her upbringing together.

2026-01-29T11:10:15.296263 [root_agent]: That's great. Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your residency status:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:10:16.776554 [actor]: Yes, we all live in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:10:18.590851 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you all live in the UK.

One more important question:

**Are you or your partner James already receiving Child Benefit for Ruby, or has anyone else claimed Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-29T11:10:20.639050 [actor]: No, neither of us is currently receiving Child Benefit for Ruby, and no one else has claimed it for her either.

2026-01-29T11:10:24.842041 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Ruby. Here's why:

✓ Ruby is under 16 years old (she's 4)
✓ She lives with you
✓ You and your partner are responsible for her care and upbringing
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one is currently claiming Child Benefit for her

**Important note:** Only one person can claim Child Benefit for Ruby - either you or James will need to be the claimant. You should decide between you who will make the claim.

You can apply for Child Benefit online or by post. Once you claim, you may receive payments, though please be aware that if either you or your partner has an individual income over £60,000 per year, there may be a High Income Child Benefit Charge to pay through your tax return.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:10:26.848391 [actor]: Oh, I see. Actually, I should mention - I earn £75,000 a year and James earns £20,000. How does that affect things with the High Income Child Benefit Charge you mentioned?

2026-01-29T11:10:33.841772 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. This is an important detail.

Since you earn £75,000 per year, the High Income Child Benefit Charge will apply. Here's what this means:

**You are still eligible to claim Child Benefit**, but because your individual income is over £60,000, you'll need to pay back some of the Child Benefit through a tax charge.

The way it works is:
- The charge applies when one partner earns between £60,000 and £80,000
- You pay back 1% of the Child Benefit for every £100 earned over £60,000
- In your case, earning £75,000, you'd pay back approximately 75% of the Child Benefit received
- Once someone earns £80,000 or more, they pay back 100% of the benefit

**You have two options:**

1. **Claim Child Benefit and receive the payments**, but you'd need to register for Self Assessment and pay back the charge through your tax return

2. **Claim Child Benefit but opt not to receive the payments** - this way you avoid the tax charge but still get important benefits like National Insurance credits (which protect your State Pension) and a National Insurance number is automatically issued for Ruby when she turns 16

Does this make sense, or would you like me to clarify anything?

2026-01-29T11:10:36.539340 [actor]: That makes sense, thank you. So even though I'll have to pay most of it back, I can still claim it - I just need to decide whether to actually receive the payments or not. I think I understand now. Thanks for your help!

2026-01-29T11:10:40.370505 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit and correctly explained that a High Income Child Benefit Charge applies due to the £75,000 income, with approximately 75% requiring repayment, and properly presented both claiming options.
