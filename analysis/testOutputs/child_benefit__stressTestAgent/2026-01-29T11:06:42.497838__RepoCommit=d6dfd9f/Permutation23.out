2026-01-29T11:18:52.685686 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child (or children) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T11:18:54.549921 [actor]: Yes, I have a daughter. She's 12 years old, but she doesn't live with me - she lives with her mother.

2026-01-29T11:18:56.523303 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since your daughter lives with her mother, let me ask: Do you contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount towards your daughter's upkeep? This could be through maintenance payments or other financial support.

2026-01-29T11:18:58.796287 [actor]: Well, I don't pay weekly maintenance, but I do help out. Every 4 weeks I buy a big bulk order of groceries and clothes for her - it costs me about £120 - and I deliver it all to her mother's house.

2026-01-29T11:19:04.552318 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. Let me reflect on this information.

<thinking>
The user pays approximately £120 every 4 weeks, which is £30 per week. According to the gov.uk guidance on child benefit when a child lives with someone else, a person may be able to claim Child Benefit if they contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount towards the child's upkeep.

Current Child Benefit rates are:
- £25.60 a week for the eldest or only child
- £16.95 a week for each additional child

At £30 per week, this appears to exceed the Child Benefit amount for one child. However, I need to verify other eligibility criteria as well.

That's helpful to know. Your contribution of approximately £30 per week does appear to meet the financial threshold.

Now, let me ask: Are you a UK resident, or if you're not currently living in the UK, are you working abroad for certain organizations like the UK civil service or armed forces?

2026-01-29T11:19:06.034183 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK resident. I live and work here in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:19:07.816718 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now let me ask about your daughter's mother: Is she currently claiming Child Benefit for your daughter?

2026-01-29T11:19:09.554088 [actor]: I'm not entirely sure to be honest. I think she might be, but I haven't specifically asked her about it recently.

2026-01-29T11:19:15.407721 [root_agent]: 
This is an important point. According to the gov.uk guidance on child benefit when a child lives with someone else, only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. If the mother is already claiming Child Benefit for the daughter, then the user would not be eligible to claim it as well.

I need to explain this rule clearly and advise them on what they should do next.


Thank you for being honest about that. This is actually a crucial point for your eligibility.

Here's the key rule: **Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child.** If your daughter's mother is already claiming Child Benefit for her, then you wouldn't be able to claim it as well, even though you're contributing financially to your daughter's upkeep.

However, if your daughter's mother is **not** claiming Child Benefit, then based on what you've told me so far, you could potentially be eligible since you:
- Are a UK resident
- Are responsible for a child under 16
- Contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit amount (approximately £30/week, which exceeds the £25.60 weekly rate for an only/eldest child)

**My recommendation:** You'll need to check with your daughter's mother whether she's currently claiming Child Benefit. If she is, you cannot also claim it. If she's not claiming it, you would be able to apply.

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T11:19:17.555201 [actor]: No, that makes sense. Thank you for explaining it all to me. I'll check with her mother to see if she's already claiming it before I do anything.

2026-01-29T11:19:21.739607 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, correctly calculated that my £30/week contribution exceeds the threshold, verified I'm a UK resident with a child under 16, and appropriately conditioned eligibility on whether the mother is already claiming (which is the correct legal position).
