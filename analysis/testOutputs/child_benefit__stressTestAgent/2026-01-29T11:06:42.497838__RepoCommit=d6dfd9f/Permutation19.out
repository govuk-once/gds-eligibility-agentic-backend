2026-01-29T11:16:26.634920 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T11:16:29.325744 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Holly, who's 9 years old. 

The thing is, I'm separated from my ex-partner Pete, and Holly stays with him 3 days a week and with me 4 days a week. We both help look after her - buying her clothes and food and things. We've both actually submitted claims to HMRC because we couldn't agree on who should claim it. Can you tell me if I'm eligible?

2026-01-29T11:16:32.974485 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. This is a situation where both you and Pete are contributing to Holly's care, and she spends time with both of you.

Let me ask you an important question to help determine eligibility:

**Between you and Pete, who would you say has the main responsibility for Holly on a day-to-day basis? For example, who makes most of the decisions about her care, education, and wellbeing, or who does she spend slightly more time with (since you mentioned 4 days with you vs 3 days with Pete)?**

This is important because when parents are separated and both contribute to a child's care, only one person can receive Child Benefit, and it's typically the person with main responsibility for the child.

2026-01-29T11:16:35.814752 [actor]: Well, Holly spends 4 days a week with me and 3 days with Pete, so she's with me slightly more. As for the main responsibility, I'd say we both do quite a bit - we both buy her clothes and food, and we both look after her when she's with us. 

To be honest, that's why we couldn't agree on who should claim it in the first place. We both feel like we're equally responsible for her, even though she does spend that extra day with me each week. Is that going to make a difference for who gets it?

2026-01-29T11:16:39.600051 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. The extra day does matter, and it sounds like you may have the main responsibility since Holly spends more time with you (4 days versus 3 days).

When both parents contribute to a child's care but can't agree on who has main responsibility, HMRC will make the decision based on the facts. The person who the child lives with for more time is usually considered to have the main day-to-day responsibility.

Let me ask you a couple more questions to get a clearer picture:

**Are you currently responsible for Holly on a regular basis? By this I mean, do you have an ongoing, consistent arrangement where you care for her those 4 days each week, rather than this being a temporary or occasional arrangement?**

2026-01-29T11:16:41.967280 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. This is our regular arrangement - it's been this way since Pete and I separated. Holly stays with me 4 days every week and with Pete 3 days every week. It's consistent and ongoing, not just temporary or now and then. We've got a proper routine sorted out for her.

2026-01-29T11:16:44.774742 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It sounds like you have a stable, ongoing arrangement.

Now, let me ask you one more important question:

**Do you normally live in the UK? And is Holly also normally living in the UK with you and Pete?**

This is important because to be eligible for Child Benefit, you generally need to be living in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:16:46.777235 [actor]: Yes, we all live in the UK. Holly lives here with me for my 4 days and with Pete for his 3 days, and we're both UK residents. We haven't lived anywhere else.

2026-01-29T11:16:51.736075 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit because:**

1. ✓ Holly is under 16 years old (she's 9)
2. ✓ You normally live in the UK
3. ✓ You are responsible for Holly on a regular, ongoing basis
4. ✓ Holly spends more time with you (4 days per week) than with Pete (3 days per week)

**Important points about your situation:**

Since Holly spends more time living with you (4 days versus 3 days), you are likely to be considered as having the main day-to-day responsibility for her. When parents are separated and both contribute to their child's care, only one person can receive Child Benefit - and it's typically awarded to the person the child lives with most of the time.

Since you mentioned that both you and Pete have submitted claims to HMRC, HMRC will need to decide between your competing claims. They will look at who has main responsibility, and the fact that Holly lives with you for more days each week is a significant factor in your favor.

**Is there anything else about your situation you'd like me to clarify regarding Child Benefit eligibility?**

2026-01-29T11:16:54.939878 [actor]: Thank you, that's really helpful to know. So it sounds like because Holly spends that extra day with me each week, HMRC will likely decide that I should get the Child Benefit rather than Pete. That makes sense.

No, I think you've answered my questions. I understand now that only one of us can get it, and that HMRC will make the decision based on who Holly lives with most of the time, which is me. I appreciate you explaining all of that!

2026-01-29T11:16:58.753398 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately determined that Sue is eligible for Child Benefit based on the correct criteria: Holly is under 16, Sue lives in the UK, she has regular ongoing responsibility for Holly, and Holly spends more time with Sue (4 days) than with Pete (3 days), giving Sue the main day-to-day responsibility.
