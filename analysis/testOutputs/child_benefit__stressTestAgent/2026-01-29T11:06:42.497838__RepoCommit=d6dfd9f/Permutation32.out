2026-01-29T11:23:21.948996 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you:

**Do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:23:23.794099 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. I'm responsible for my son John. He's 17 and lives with me.

2026-01-29T11:23:25.977323 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Are you and your son John currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:23:27.377681 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:23:29.508686 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Now I need to ask:

**Is John still in approved education or training, or has he left full-time education?**

2026-01-29T11:23:31.339312 [actor]: He's left school and is now at a local college. He's re-sitting two GCSEs - the course is about 6 hours a week of supervised study.

2026-01-29T11:23:33.672146 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I need to understand this a bit better.

**Is this college course that John is taking classed as full-time education or approved training, or is it part-time study?**

(This is important because Child Benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds depends on whether they're in approved full-time education or training.)

2026-01-29T11:23:35.274749 [actor]: It's part-time study - just 6 hours a week of supervised study. He spends the rest of his time at home.

2026-01-29T11:23:37.457000 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

I need to ask one more question to fully assess the situation:

**Has John registered with a careers service or registered for work or training?**

(This is relevant because there are specific rules about young people aged 16-19 who have left education but are registered for certain services.)

2026-01-29T11:23:39.406795 [actor]: No, he hasn't registered with a careers service or for work or training. He's just doing his part-time college course and that's it.

2026-01-29T11:23:44.781110 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for John in this situation**.

Here's why:

Child Benefit can be claimed for young people aged 16-19, but only if they are in **approved full-time education or training**. Since John is only doing 6 hours a week of supervised study, this would be considered part-time education, not full-time.

Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds typically stops when they:
- Leave full-time approved education or training, or
- Reach age 20 (whichever comes first)

Since John has left school and is only in part-time education (not full-time approved education or training), he wouldn't meet the eligibility criteria.

**However**, if John's circumstances change - for example, if he enrolls in full-time education or approved training - you may become eligible at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T11:23:50.388758 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is not eligible for Child Benefit because the 17-year-old son is only attending 6 hours per week of part-time study, which does not meet the requirement of full-time approved education or training for 16-19 year olds to qualify for Child Benefit.
