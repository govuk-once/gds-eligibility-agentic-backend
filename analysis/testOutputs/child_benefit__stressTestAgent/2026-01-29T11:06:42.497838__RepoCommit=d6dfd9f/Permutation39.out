2026-01-29T11:26:52.552258 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:26:54.827777 [actor]: Yes, I do. My partner and I have two children - they're 6 and 8 years old. We adopted them as a sibling pair. They have special needs, so we actually receive an Adoption Allowance from the Local Authority to help with their costs. Does that affect whether we can get Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:26:57.468570 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. It's wonderful that you've adopted a sibling pair.

The good news is that receiving an Adoption Allowance from the Local Authority does **not** prevent you from claiming Child Benefit - these are separate benefits and you can receive both.

Before I can fully assess your eligibility, I need to ask you another question:

**Do you and your partner live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:26:58.953040 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK with the children.

2026-01-29T11:27:00.961929 [root_agent]: That's great, thank you.

Now I need to ask you about your living arrangements with the children:

**Do the children live with you and your partner, or does someone else look after them for part of the time?**

2026-01-29T11:27:02.497720 [actor]: The children live with us full-time. They're part of our family now since we adopted them.

2026-01-29T11:27:05.207049 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's helpful to know.

Now I need to ask about your responsibilities for the children:

**Are you or your partner responsible for the children? By this I mean, do either of you pay for things like their food, clothes, and other costs of bringing them up?**

2026-01-29T11:27:07.435329 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. We're responsible for both children - we pay for their food, clothes, school things, and all their other needs. That's partly why the Local Authority gives us the Adoption Allowance, to help with those costs since they have special needs.

2026-01-29T11:27:09.873121 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I have an important question about your household arrangement:

**Between you and your partner, which one of you would be claiming Child Benefit? Or to put it another way - only one person in a household can claim Child Benefit for a child. Have you and your partner discussed who would be the one to make the claim?**

2026-01-29T11:27:11.733246 [actor]: Oh, I see. We haven't really discussed it yet - we just wanted to find out if we were eligible first. Does it matter which one of us claims it? Or can either of us do it?

2026-01-29T11:27:14.585397 [root_agent]: That's a good question. Either of you can claim it, but there are some considerations:

**Only one person can claim Child Benefit for each child**, so you'll need to decide between you who will be the claimant.

However, before we get into who should claim, I need to ask you about income:

**Do either you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 a year?**

This is important because it affects whether there's a tax charge on the Child Benefit.

2026-01-29T11:27:16.810158 [actor]: Yes, my partner earns about £55,000 a year. I earn less than that. Does that mean we can't get Child Benefit, or does it just affect how much we get?

2026-01-29T11:27:22.862126 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. This is an important point:

**You are still eligible to claim Child Benefit**, but because your partner earns over £50,000, there would be what's called a "High Income Child Benefit Charge" to pay through tax.

Here's how it works:
- The charge applies when the higher earner in a household has income between £50,000 and £60,000
- At £55,000, your partner would have to pay back some of the Child Benefit through their tax return
- At £60,000 or above, you'd pay back all of it

Since you earn less than your partner, **you would be better off being the one to claim** Child Benefit, as the charge is based on the claimant OR their partner - whichever income is higher.

You have two options:
1. Claim Child Benefit and your partner pays the tax charge
2. Claim Child Benefit but opt not to receive the payments (you'd still get National Insurance credits which protect your State Pension)

Before I confirm your full eligibility, let me ask: **Are the children currently in hospital for more than 12 weeks, or living away in local authority care or a residential school paid for by the local authority?**

2026-01-29T11:27:24.790776 [actor]: No, they're not in hospital or care or anything like that. They live at home with us all the time. They go to their regular school during the day.

2026-01-29T11:27:29.989869 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on all the information you've provided, I can now give you a full assessment:

**You ARE eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's a summary of your situation:

✓ You have two children under 16 who live with you
✓ You're responsible for them (paying for their needs)
✓ You live in the UK
✓ The children are not in long-term hospital or care
✓ Your Adoption Allowance does not affect your eligibility

**Important points about your claim:**

1. **You should be the one to claim** (rather than your partner) since you earn less than £50,000

2. However, because your partner earns £55,000, they will need to pay a High Income Child Benefit Charge through their Self Assessment tax return - this would be approximately 50% of the Child Benefit received

3. You could choose to claim but not receive the payments - this way you'd still get National Insurance credits which protect your future State Pension, and your partner wouldn't have to pay the charge

You can make your claim and decide which option works best for your family. 

Do you have any other questions about your eligibility or the claiming process?

2026-01-29T11:27:33.917418 [actor]: No, that's really helpful, thank you. I understand now - we're eligible, I should be the one to claim it, and we just need to decide whether to actually take the payments given the tax charge my partner would have to pay. That's all very clear, thanks for your help!

2026-01-29T11:27:38.108802 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the family is eligible for Child Benefit, correctly identified that the adoption allowance doesn't prevent eligibility, properly explained the High Income Child Benefit Charge implications given the partner's £55,000 income, and appropriately recommended that the lower-earning partner should claim to optimize their situation.
