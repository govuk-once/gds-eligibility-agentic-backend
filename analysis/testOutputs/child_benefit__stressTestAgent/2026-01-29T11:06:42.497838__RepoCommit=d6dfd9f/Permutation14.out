2026-01-29T11:13:47.290119 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child (or children) who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T11:13:49.504614 [actor]: Yes, I have a son who's 6 years old. But the thing is, he's currently staying with his grandmother because I've just had surgery and I'm recovering. He's been there for about 6 weeks now while I get back on my feet.

2026-01-29T11:13:52.223700 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I'm sorry to hear about your surgery, and I hope your recovery is going well.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand the care arrangements a bit better:

**Are you still responsible for your son - meaning do you still make decisions about his upbringing, contribute to his costs, and is this stay with his grandmother a temporary arrangement while you recover?**

2026-01-29T11:13:55.000692 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm still completely responsible for him - I'm still making all the decisions about his care and education, and I'm still paying for everything he needs. His grandmother is just helping me out temporarily while I recover from the surgery. It's definitely just a temporary thing until I'm well enough to have him back home with me. She hasn't claimed any benefits for him or anything like that - she's just looking after him to help me out during my recovery.

2026-01-29T11:13:56.801202 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that - it's clear you remain responsible for your son.

Now I need to ask about your living situation:

**Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:13:58.685992 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I'm here in England, just recovering at home while my mum looks after Noah for me.

2026-01-29T11:14:01.495904 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your immigration status:

**Do you have the right to live in the UK permanently, or do you have any immigration restrictions that might affect your access to benefits?**

(For example, are you a UK citizen, have settled status, or do you have any visa conditions that restrict your access to public funds?)

2026-01-29T11:14:03.029180 [actor]: I'm a UK citizen, born and raised here. No immigration restrictions or anything like that.

2026-01-29T11:14:04.980890 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now I need to ask about other people who might be claiming for your son:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your son Noah, such as his other parent or another family member?**

2026-01-29T11:14:07.672260 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Noah. His dad isn't involved, and like I said, my mum - his grandmother - hasn't made any claim for him. She's just helping me out while I recover, that's all.

2026-01-29T11:14:10.564581 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, let me ask one final question about your income:

**Do you or your partner (if you have one) earn over £50,000 a year?**

(This won't affect whether you can *claim* Child Benefit, but it may affect whether you need to pay some or all of it back through tax, so it's important to know.)

2026-01-29T11:14:12.986967 [actor]: No, I don't have a partner - I'm a single mum. And I don't earn anywhere near £50,000 a year, so that's not an issue for me.

2026-01-29T11:14:17.523623 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

**Based on the information you've provided, you ARE eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why you qualify:

✓ You have a child under 16 (Noah, who is 6 years old)
✓ You are responsible for Noah - you make decisions about his upbringing and pay for his costs
✓ You live in the UK and are a UK citizen with no immigration restrictions
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Noah
✓ The temporary care arrangement with his grandmother doesn't affect your eligibility, as you remain responsible for Noah and this is just a temporary arrangement while you recover from surgery

The fact that Noah is temporarily staying with his grandmother while you recover from surgery does not disqualify you from Child Benefit, as long as you remain responsible for him - which you clearly do.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about claiming Child Benefit, or do you need any help with the next steps?**

2026-01-29T11:14:21.843997 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you! I was worried that because he's not living with me right now I might not be eligible. It's good to know that I can still claim while he's staying with my mum during my recovery. I appreciate your help!

2026-01-29T11:14:24.390672 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that temporary care arrangements with a grandparent during medical recovery do not affect Child Benefit eligibility when the parent remains responsible for the child, and all other eligibility criteria were correctly verified.
