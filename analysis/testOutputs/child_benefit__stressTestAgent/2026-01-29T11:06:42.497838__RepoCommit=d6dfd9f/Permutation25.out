2026-01-29T11:19:54.090986 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:19:55.650483 [actor]: Yes, I have a child. My son Leo is 5 years old.

2026-01-29T11:19:57.231291 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does your son Leo live with you?**

2026-01-29T11:19:59.156300 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me at the moment. He's been in local authority care for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-29T11:20:02.044900 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this must be a difficult situation.

To assess your eligibility properly, I need to ask: **Are you contributing at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate (which is £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child) towards Leo's upkeep while he's in care?**

2026-01-29T11:20:03.962648 [actor]: I don't have any income myself, so I can't contribute anything. But my husband - he's Leo's stepfather - he sends £30 a week to the carer for Leo's upkeep. Does that count?

2026-01-29T11:20:05.703759 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification.

Next question: **Does your husband live with you in the same household?**

2026-01-29T11:20:07.252136 [actor]: Yes, we live together.

2026-01-29T11:20:11.653815 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, let me assess your situation:

Since Leo is in local authority care and you're not contributing at least the Child Benefit rate towards his upkeep personally, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.

However, there's an important point: Your husband (Leo's stepfather) is contributing £30 per week, which is more than the Child Benefit rate of £25.60. The key question is whether **your husband could claim Child Benefit instead**, as he is contributing the required amount.

To clarify this further: **Is your husband treated as responsible for Leo? In other words, did Leo live with you both before going into care, or does your husband have a parental or legal responsibility for Leo?**

2026-01-29T11:20:13.700181 [actor]: Yes, Leo lived with both of us before he went into care. My husband has been part of his life - we're married and live together as a family.

2026-01-29T11:20:17.375761 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've shared, here's my assessment:

**Your husband may be eligible for Child Benefit** because:
- He is contributing £30 per week towards Leo's upkeep, which is more than the required Child Benefit rate of £25.60 per week
- Leo lived with you both before going into care
- Your husband has been part of Leo's life as his stepfather

**You personally would not be eligible** because you're not contributing at least the Child Benefit rate towards Leo's upkeep.

Since you live together as a married couple, only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child. In this case, it would be your husband who could make the claim based on his contributions.

One final question to confirm: **Has anyone else (such as Leo's other biological parent, foster carer, or the local authority) already claimed Child Benefit for Leo?**

2026-01-29T11:20:20.368480 [actor]: No, no one else has claimed it. So just to be clear - even though I'm Leo's mum and I can't contribute myself, my husband can claim the Child Benefit because he's contributing? Or could I claim it since his money counts as our household money since we're married and living together?

2026-01-29T11:20:24.745341 [root_agent]: That's a really good question, and I want to make sure I give you accurate information.

Let me think through this carefully: The rules state that the person claiming Child Benefit must be the one who is personally contributing at least the Child Benefit rate towards the child's upkeep when the child is in care.

From what I understand of the rules, **the contribution needs to be attributable to the specific person making the claim**. Since your husband is the one sending the £30 per week to the carer, he would be the one who could claim.

However, I want to ask one more clarifying question to be absolutely certain: **Are the payments being made from a joint bank account that you both share, or from your husband's individual account?**

This may affect whether the contribution could be considered as coming from you as well.

2026-01-29T11:20:26.749262 [actor]: The payments come from my husband's own account. We don't have a joint account - he handles his money and makes the transfers himself.

2026-01-29T11:20:30.533168 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on all the information you've provided, here's the definitive answer:

**You are not eligible for Child Benefit** because:
- Leo is in local authority care
- You are not personally contributing at least the Child Benefit rate (£25.60 per week) towards his upkeep
- The payments are coming from your husband's individual account, not yours

**Your husband would be the one who could potentially claim Child Benefit** because:
- He is contributing £30 per week towards Leo's upkeep, which exceeds the required £25.60
- The payments are coming from his own account
- Leo lived with you both before going into care

Even though you're married and live together, the contribution requirement is based on who is actually making the payments. Since your husband is making the payments from his own account, he would be the eligible person to claim.

If you wanted to become eligible yourself, you would need to be the one making contributions of at least £25.60 per week towards Leo's upkeep from your own resources.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T11:20:37.766792 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, when a child is in local authority care for less than 8 weeks, the person who was receiving Child Benefit before the child went into care can continue to receive it. Since Leo has only been in care for 10 weeks, the agent should have asked whether the claimant was receiving Child Benefit before Leo went into care, as they may still be eligible for a period. The agent failed to consider this important exception to the contribution requirement.
