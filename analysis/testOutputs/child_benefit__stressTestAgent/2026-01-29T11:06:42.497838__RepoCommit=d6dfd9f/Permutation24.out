2026-01-29T11:19:23.452644 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T11:19:25.048054 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Tom. He's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T11:19:27.010136 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To help determine your eligibility, I need to ask: Are you responsible for Tom? By this I mean, does Tom live with you and do you look after him?

2026-01-29T11:19:29.145089 [actor]: Well, that's a bit complicated right now. Tom has severe behavioral needs, and he's moved into a residential school that's paid for by the local council. He's been there for about 10 weeks now. Before that, yes, I was responsible for him and he lived with me.

2026-01-29T11:19:31.257669 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that situation. I understand this must be a challenging time for you.

I need to ask: Does Tom come home to stay with you during the school holidays, or at weekends?

2026-01-29T11:19:33.514005 [actor]: Yes, he does come home during school holidays and some weekends. He's still very much part of our family - the residential school is just to help with his behavioral needs and give him the support he requires during term time.

2026-01-29T11:19:35.431977 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know, thank you.

Now I need to ask about your financial circumstances: Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-29T11:19:36.898983 [actor]: No, neither of us earns over £60,000 a year.

2026-01-29T11:19:38.555910 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question: Are you (or your partner if applicable) currently living in the UK?

2026-01-29T11:19:40.483066 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:19:45.284034 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you should be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

1. **You have a qualifying child** - Tom is 14 years old, which is under the age limit (under 16, or under 20 if in approved education or training)

2. **You remain responsible for Tom** - Even though Tom is in residential care paid for by the local council, the fact that he comes home to you during school holidays and weekends means you're still considered responsible for him

3. **You live in the UK** - You meet the residency requirement

4. **Income** - Neither you nor your partner earns over £60,000, so you won't face the High Income Child Benefit Charge

The key point here is that Tom's placement in residential school doesn't disqualify you from Child Benefit because he still returns home to you regularly during holidays and weekends. You maintain your parental responsibility and he remains part of your household.

You should be able to claim or continue claiming Child Benefit for Tom.

2026-01-29T11:19:52.148274 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in hospital or care, when a child goes into local authority care or accommodation paid for by the local authority, child benefit can only continue for up to 12 weeks (not indefinitely). Since Tom has been in the residential school for 10 weeks, the parent is still eligible but only until week 12, after which eligibility ends. The agent failed to mention this critical 12-week time limit and incorrectly suggested the parent would remain eligible as long as Tom comes home during holidays.
