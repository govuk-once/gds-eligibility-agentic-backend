2026-01-29T11:34:47.972450 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T11:34:49.772987 [actor]: Yes, I have a daughter. She's 16 and lives with me in Edinburgh. She's just left school and joined the No One Left Behind programme.

2026-01-29T11:34:52.471807 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know your daughter is 16 and on the No One Left Behind programme.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: **Is your daughter in approved education or training?** 

Specifically, I'm asking whether the No One Left Behind programme she's enrolled in counts as approved full-time non-advanced education or approved training. This is important because Child Benefit can continue for children aged 16-19 if they're in qualifying education or training.

2026-01-29T11:34:54.464986 [actor]: Yes, she is. She joined the No One Left Behind programme after leaving school. It's a Scottish government programme to help young people into training and employment. She's doing it full-time.

2026-01-29T11:34:57.156352 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It's good to know she's in full-time training through a Scottish government programme.

Let me ask you another important question: **Are you the person with main responsibility for your daughter?** 

In other words, do you live with her and are you primarily responsible for her day-to-day care?

2026-01-29T11:34:58.857573 [actor]: Yes, I live with her and I'm responsible for her day-to-day care. She lives here with me in Edinburgh.

2026-01-29T11:35:00.471384 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. That's very helpful.

Now I need to ask: **Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:35:02.154524 [actor]: Yes, I'm living in Edinburgh, Scotland. I've been here the whole time.

2026-01-29T11:35:04.383489 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: **Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for your daughter?**

2026-01-29T11:35:05.720163 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for her.

2026-01-29T11:35:09.202567 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your daughter. Here's why:

✓ You have a child who is 16 years old
✓ She is in approved full-time education or training (the No One Left Behind programme)
✓ You are responsible for her and she lives with you
✓ You live in the UK (Scotland)
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

Child Benefit can continue until your daughter turns 20, as long as she remains in approved education or training.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, or would you like information about how to apply?**

2026-01-29T11:35:12.601281 [actor]: That's great, thank you for your help! I think I have all the information I need now.

2026-01-29T11:35:14.933510 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on having a 16-year-old daughter in approved full-time training (No One Left Behind programme), living together in the UK, being the responsible parent, and no one else claiming the benefit.
