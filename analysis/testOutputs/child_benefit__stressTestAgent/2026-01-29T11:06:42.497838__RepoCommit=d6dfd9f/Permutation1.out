2026-01-29T11:06:45.472751 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:06:47.105809 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who's 8 years old and he lives with me.

2026-01-29T11:06:50.090039 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now I need to ask: **Are you responsible for your son? This means do you live with him and either pay for things like food, clothes, and other everyday costs, or you're the main person looking after him?**

2026-01-29T11:06:52.252375 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. He lives with us - me and my husband - and we pay for all his food, clothes, school things, everything he needs really. I'm his mum.

2026-01-29T11:06:54.079238 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Are you or your husband currently living or working in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:06:55.740759 [actor]: Yes, we both live in Manchester. My husband works as a teacher and I work part-time. We're both UK nationals.

2026-01-29T11:06:57.926520 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

One more important question: **Does anyone else also claim Child Benefit for your son, or is anyone else in a similar position where they could claim for him (for example, does he spend significant time living with anyone else)?**

2026-01-29T11:06:59.525645 [actor]: No, it's just us. He lives with us full-time and nobody else claims anything for him.

2026-01-29T11:07:03.885042 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 8-year-old son)
✓ You're responsible for him - he lives with you and you pay for his everyday costs
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

You meet the key eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

**One important thing to be aware of:** If either you or your husband has an individual income over £50,000 a year, this doesn't stop you from claiming Child Benefit, but the higher earner may have to pay some or all of it back through what's called the High Income Child Benefit Charge. This is something to consider when deciding whether to claim.

Would you like any clarification on anything I've explained?

2026-01-29T11:07:07.790370 [actor]: No, that's great, thank you! That's really helpful. My husband earns £35,000 so we should be fine with that income charge thing. I appreciate your help!

2026-01-29T11:07:10.097664 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria (child under 16, responsible for the child, UK residence, no duplicate claims) and correctly informed the user about the High Income Child Benefit Charge threshold, leading to the correct outcome of "Eligible."
