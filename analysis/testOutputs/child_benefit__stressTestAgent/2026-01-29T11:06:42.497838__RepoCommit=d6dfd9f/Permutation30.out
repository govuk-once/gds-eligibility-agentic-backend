2026-01-29T11:22:20.086455 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:22:21.590325 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a child that I'm responsible for.

2026-01-29T11:22:23.386864 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**How old is your child, and if they are 16 or over, are they in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T11:22:24.832871 [actor]: My child is 14 years old.

2026-01-29T11:22:26.315786 [root_agent]: Thank you. Since your child is 14, they meet the age requirement.

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:22:27.727227 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:22:29.267708 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

**Does your child normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T11:22:30.798171 [actor]: Yes, my child lives with me.

2026-01-29T11:22:32.679797 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

**Are you the person responsible for the child, meaning you're the one who is mainly looking after them day-to-day?**

2026-01-29T11:22:34.125006 [actor]: Yes, I'm the one who's mainly looking after them day-to-day.

2026-01-29T11:22:37.123397 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

One final important question:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £60,000 per year?**

(This is important because it may affect whether you need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, though it doesn't affect your eligibility to claim.)

2026-01-29T11:22:38.692283 [actor]: I earn £18,000 a year, but my wife earns £65,000 a year.

2026-01-29T11:22:44.737491 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me:

**You are eligible for Child Benefit.**

You meet all the eligibility criteria:
- You have a child under 16
- You live in the UK
- The child lives with you
- You are responsible for the child

**However, there's an important point you need to be aware of:**

Since your wife earns £65,000 per year (which is over £60,000), if you claim Child Benefit, she will need to pay the **High Income Child Benefit Charge** through Self Assessment. 

The charge works on a sliding scale:
- It starts when individual income is over £60,000
- At £60,000, you pay back 1% of the Child Benefit for every extra £100 of income
- At £80,000 or above, you pay back 100% of the Child Benefit received

You have two options:
1. Claim Child Benefit and your wife pays the charge back through tax
2. Opt out of receiving the Child Benefit payments (but still register for it, as this protects your child's National Insurance record and your entitlement to State Pension)

Would you like any clarification on this?

2026-01-29T11:22:48.369894 [actor]: Thank you, that's very helpful. I understand now - I can claim it, but my wife will have to pay the charge back because she's the higher earner. That makes sense.

2026-01-29T11:22:50.448167 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that I am eligible for Child Benefit and correctly explained that my wife (the higher earner at £65,000) would need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge through Self Assessment, which aligns with the expected outcome.
