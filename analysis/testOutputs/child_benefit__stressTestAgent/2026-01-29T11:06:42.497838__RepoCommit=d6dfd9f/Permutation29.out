2026-01-29T11:22:02.106062 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have any children, or are you responsible for any children?**

2026-01-29T11:22:03.967125 [actor]: Yes, I have a son. He's 17 years old and lives with me.

2026-01-29T11:22:06.867682 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Is your son currently in approved education or training, or is he registered with a careers service or with Connexions?**

(This is relevant because children aged 16-19 can still qualify for Child Benefit if they meet certain conditions regarding education or training.)

2026-01-29T11:22:08.560247 [actor]: No, he's not. He finished his GCSEs last year but he's not in college, not working, and hasn't registered with any careers service or anything like that.

2026-01-29T11:22:12.310460 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to let you know that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** for your 17-year-old son in his current circumstances.

Here's why: Child Benefit can be paid for children aged 16-19, but only if they are in approved education or training (such as A-levels, T-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or home education), or if they have left education/training and are registered with a careers service or Connexions while waiting to start such courses.

Since your son is not in any approved education or training and is not registered with a careers service, he doesn't meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit beyond age 16.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or related support?**

2026-01-29T11:22:15.517196 [actor]: No, that's clear. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T11:22:17.985793 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rules that Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds requires the child to be in approved education/training or registered with careers services, and correctly concluded that a 17-year-old who has finished GCSEs but is not in college, working, or registered with any careers service does not meet the eligibility criteria.
