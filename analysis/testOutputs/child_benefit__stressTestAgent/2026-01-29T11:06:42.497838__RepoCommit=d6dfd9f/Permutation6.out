2026-01-29T11:08:52.721910 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T11:08:55.247146 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Chloe, she's 6 years old. But I should mention - she's been in hospital for quite a while now, about 14 weeks. She has a serious condition. I visit her every day and I spend money on things for her like books, pyjamas, and special food - usually about £30 a week. Does that affect whether I can get Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:08:58.583850 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I'm sorry to hear about Chloe's condition, and I hope she recovers well.

The good news is that a child being in hospital doesn't automatically stop your Child Benefit. However, there are some specific rules about this situation that I need to understand better.

Let me ask you this:

**Are you still contributing towards the costs of looking after Chloe while she's in hospital - which it sounds like you are with the £30 per week on books, pyjamas, and special food - and do you intend for her to live with you again when she leaves hospital?**

2026-01-29T11:09:01.653559 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm definitely contributing - like I said, I spend about £30 a week on her needs while she's there. And of course she'll be living with me again when she's well enough to come home. She's my daughter, I'm her mum. I visit her every day at the hospital. Does the fact that she's been there for 14 weeks cause a problem? I'm worried because it's been quite a long time now.

2026-01-29T11:09:05.054981 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. I can understand your concern about the length of time.

Let me ask you an important question about the hospital costs:

**Is the cost of Chloe's accommodation and maintenance in the hospital being met by the NHS or local authority (which is usually the case for children in hospital), or are you paying for these costs yourself?**

This is important because it affects how the 12-week rule applies to children in hospital.

2026-01-29T11:09:07.971040 [actor]: The NHS is covering her hospital accommodation and treatment - it's an NHS hospital, so they're paying for her bed and medical care. I'm just paying for the extra things myself, like the books, pyjamas, and special food I mentioned - about £30 a week. Is that going to be a problem since she's been there more than 12 weeks?

2026-01-29T11:09:12.424427 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. This is an important point.

Since the NHS is meeting the costs of Chloe's accommodation and maintenance in hospital, and she's been there for more than 12 weeks (you mentioned 14 weeks), there is a specific rule that applies.

However, there's an exception to this rule if certain conditions are met. Let me ask you:

**Are you regularly spending money on Chloe's needs (which you are - the £30 per week), AND is the amount you're spending at least equal to the amount of Child Benefit you would receive for her?**

To give you context, Child Benefit is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child (and £16.95 per week for additional children). So the question is: is your £30 per week at least equal to what the Child Benefit payment would be?

2026-01-29T11:09:14.912777 [actor]: Yes, I'm spending £30 a week, which is more than the £25.60 Child Benefit rate you mentioned. I spend it regularly every week on her books, pyjamas, and special food while she's in hospital. So does that mean I can still get Child Benefit even though she's been there more than 12 weeks?

2026-01-29T11:09:17.736873 [root_agent]: Yes, that's correct! Based on what you've told me, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit for Chloe, even though she's been in hospital for more than 12 weeks.

This is because you meet the exception to the 12-week rule: you are regularly spending at least as much as the Child Benefit amount (£30 per week, which is more than the £25.60 rate) on her needs while she's in hospital.

Now, to complete the eligibility assessment, I need to ask you a few more questions about your general circumstances:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T11:09:19.120873 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T11:09:22.341928 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Next question:

**Are you the person responsible for Chloe - meaning, does she normally live with you (when she's not in hospital), or if she lives with someone else, are you contributing at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate towards her upkeep?**

From what you've already told me, it sounds like she normally lives with you and will return to live with you after hospital, but I just want to confirm this.

2026-01-29T11:09:24.739917 [actor]: Yes, that's right. Chloe normally lives with me - it's just me and her. She's only in hospital because of her condition. When she's discharged, she'll come straight home to live with me again. I'm her mum and I'm responsible for her.

2026-01-29T11:09:26.543927 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for confirming that.

Now, one final question to complete the eligibility assessment:

**Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for Chloe?**

2026-01-29T11:09:28.278301 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for her. It's just me - I'm her only parent and she lives with me.

2026-01-29T11:09:32.873886 [root_agent]: Excellent. Based on everything you've told me, **you are eligible for Child Benefit for Chloe**.

Here's a summary of why you meet the eligibility criteria:

✓ You have a child under 16 (Chloe, aged 6)
✓ You are responsible for her - she normally lives with you
✓ You live in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ Even though Chloe has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks with her accommodation and maintenance paid by the NHS, you meet the exception because you are regularly spending at least the Child Benefit amount (£30 per week) on her needs

The fact that you're spending £30 per week on books, pyjamas, and special food for Chloe while she's in hospital - which is more than the Child Benefit rate of £25.60 per week - means you can continue to receive Child Benefit throughout her hospital stay.

If you haven't already claimed Child Benefit, you can apply. If you're already receiving it, you should be able to continue receiving it.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T11:09:36.941276 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you! I'm so relieved to hear that I can still get Child Benefit for Chloe. I was really worried that because she'd been in hospital so long I wouldn't be eligible anymore. This helps a lot. Thanks for explaining everything so clearly!

2026-01-29T11:09:39.207262 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user qualifies for Child Benefit via the exception to the 12-week hospital rule, as the user is regularly spending at least the Child Benefit amount (£30/week vs £25.60/week rate) on the child's needs while in hospital, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible (via Exception)".
