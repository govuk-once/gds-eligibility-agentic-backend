2026-01-29T11:32:51.737192 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T11:32:53.770735 [actor]: I have a child, but I don't live with them. I pay £50 a week for maintenance, but that's only because a court order says I have to. I don't think I should be eligible since it's not voluntary - I'm being forced to pay it.

2026-01-29T11:32:55.727798 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Let me ask you a clarifying question:

**Does your child live with someone else (such as their other parent or another person who is caring for them)?**

2026-01-29T11:32:57.877173 [actor]: Yes, my child lives with their mother. She's the one who takes care of them day-to-day. I just make the payments because the court says I have to.

2026-01-29T11:33:01.141564 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you've told me, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.

Here's why: Child Benefit is normally paid to the person who is responsible for the child on a day-to-day basis - in other words, the person the child lives with. Since your child lives with their mother and she is the one caring for them day-to-day, she would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit.

The fact that you pay child maintenance (even though it's through a court order) doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit, as you're not the person responsible for the child's day-to-day care.

Your child's mother would be the appropriate person to claim Child Benefit if she hasn't already done so.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T11:33:02.865295 [actor]: No, that answers my question. Thank you for clarifying that.

2026-01-29T11:33:06.394705 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit is paid to the person responsible for the child's day-to-day care (the mother in this case), and that paying court-ordered maintenance does not establish eligibility for the non-resident parent.
