2026-01-26T15:03:34.107989 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:03:35.892343 [actor]: I'll role-play as someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Yes, my partner and I have recently been approved as adopters. A 4-year-old girl named Maya has been placed with us by the adoption agency and she's now living in our home. We're still waiting for the final adoption order from the court though.

2026-01-26T15:03:38.838801 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing this information. That's wonderful news about Maya joining your family through adoption.

Based on what you've shared, I need to understand more about your situation. Since Maya is living with you following placement by an adoption agency, even though the final adoption order is still pending, you may be eligible for Child Benefit.

To confirm this further, are you or your partner responsible for providing care for Maya on a day-to-day basis? This would include things like providing food, clothing, and a home for her.

2026-01-26T15:03:40.759836 [actor]: Yes, my partner and I are fully responsible for Maya now. Since she was placed with us, we've been providing everything for her - food, clothing, shelter, taking her to school, everything. The adoption agency placed her with us as part of the adoption process, but we're the ones caring for her day-to-day while we wait for the final court order.

2026-01-26T15:03:43.634889 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It's clear that you and your partner are providing the day-to-day care for Maya.

Based on this information, you would likely be eligible for Child Benefit for Maya. Child Benefit can be paid to someone who is responsible for a child, and this includes situations where a child has been placed with you for adoption, even before the final adoption order is granted.

May I ask if either you or your partner has an individual income over £60,000 per year? This wouldn't affect your eligibility to claim, but it might affect how much benefit you receive due to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-26T15:03:45.315793 [actor]: No, neither of us has an income over £60,000. I work part-time and earn about £25,000, and my partner works full-time earning about £40,000 a year. So we're well under that threshold.

2026-01-26T15:03:47.246455 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since neither you nor your partner has an individual income over £60,000, you would be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit amount without being affected by the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

To clarify one more important point: Is Maya a UK resident? And are you and your partner also UK residents?

2026-01-26T15:03:48.712122 [actor]: Yes, we're all UK residents. Maya was in care here in the UK before being placed with us, and my partner and I have lived in the UK all our lives. We're all permanently living here.

2026-01-26T15:03:52.385799 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Based on all the information you've provided:

1. You have responsibility for a child under 16 (Maya, who is 4 years old)
2. Maya has been placed with you for adoption and you're providing day-to-day care for her
3. Neither you nor your partner has an individual income over £60,000
4. You, your partner, and Maya are all UK residents

I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit for Maya, even though the final adoption order is still pending. Since Maya has been placed with you by an adoption agency and you're providing full day-to-day care, you qualify as being responsible for her under Child Benefit rules.

Either you or your partner can make the claim (though only one of you), and the current weekly rates are £25.60 for your first child and £16.95 for any additional children.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:03:54.297948 [actor]: Yes, that would be helpful. Could you let me know how to apply and what documents we might need to submit? We're new to all this so any guidance would be appreciated.

2026-01-26T15:03:56.673157 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that the couple is eligible for Child Benefit as they are UK residents with responsibility for a child placed with them for adoption, even before the final adoption order.
