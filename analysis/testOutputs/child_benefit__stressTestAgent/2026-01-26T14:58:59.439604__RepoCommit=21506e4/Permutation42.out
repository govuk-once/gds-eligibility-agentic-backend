2026-01-26T15:16:32.250482 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T15:16:33.742464 [actor]: I'll play the role of a person seeking Child Benefit information.

Hello! Yes, my daughter Sian lives with me. She's 17 and we live in Cardiff, Wales.

2026-01-26T15:16:35.549425 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your daughter Sian is 17 and lives with you, I need to understand a bit more about her situation to determine your eligibility.

Is Sian currently in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:16:36.918031 [actor]: Yes, Sian has left school but she's just started a Foundation Apprenticeship that's funded by the Welsh Government. She's quite excited about it actually.

2026-01-26T15:16:38.822799 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about Sian's Foundation Apprenticeship. 

Is Sian's Foundation Apprenticeship considered an approved training or education course by the UK government? (For Child Benefit purposes, approved education typically includes A-levels, NVQs up to level 3, and some apprenticeships)

2026-01-26T15:16:40.925891 [actor]: Yes, as far as I understand, Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes. The Welsh Government funds these programs specifically, and they're different from the regular apprenticeships in England. When Sian enrolled, they mentioned this was an approved program for benefits purposes.

2026-01-26T15:16:42.150479 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification. 

Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income of over £50,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:16:43.511188 [actor]: No, my income is definitely not over £50,000. I'm a single parent and I work part-time at a local shop to support us while Sian is in her apprenticeship.

2026-01-26T15:16:44.519603 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Is Sian living with you permanently, or does she split time between different households?

2026-01-26T15:16:45.582034 [actor]: Sian lives with me permanently. It's just the two of us in our home in Cardiff. She doesn't split time between households.

2026-01-26T15:16:46.496270 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Sian lives with you permanently.

Are you a UK citizen or do you have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:16:47.347077 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK citizen. Born and raised in Wales.

2026-01-26T15:16:51.584387 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK citizen.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You have a 17-year-old daughter (Sian) who lives with you permanently
- Sian is in approved training (Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government)
- You're a UK citizen
- You're a single parent with an income below £50,000
- You live in the UK (Cardiff, Wales)

It appears that you are eligible for Child Benefit. Since Sian is over 16 but in approved training, you can continue to receive Child Benefit until she completes her training or reaches the age of 20, whichever comes first.

If you're not already claiming Child Benefit, you can apply online through the UK government website or by filling out a CH2 form.

2026-01-26T15:16:54.182605 [actor]: Thank you for letting me know I'm eligible! That's a relief. I'll continue with my claim then since Sian is still in her apprenticeship. The extra money will definitely help with her travel expenses to get to her training. I appreciate your help with sorting this out.

2026-01-26T15:16:56.240948 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for a 17-year-old in approved training living with their parent in the UK.
