2026-01-26T15:12:23.322393 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To make this assessment, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:12:25.376228 [actor]: I'll help by role-playing as someone seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll respond to the agent's questions based on the provided scenario about Bella.

Hello, yes I have a daughter called Bella who is 16 years old. She lives with me.

2026-01-26T15:12:27.321567 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about your daughter Bella. 

Since Bella is 16, I need to check if she's in approved education or training, as this affects your eligibility for Child Benefit.

Is Bella currently in approved education (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3) or approved training (like foundation apprenticeships)?

2026-01-26T15:12:29.332906 [actor]: Yes, Bella has started a training course to become a travel agent. She's working with a local travel agency who are paying for her training. It's not a standard government apprenticeship, but they've employed her and they're covering all the training costs.

2026-01-26T15:12:31.813729 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information about Bella's training.

For Child Benefit purposes, I need to understand if Bella's training course meets the criteria for "approved training." 

Could you tell me if her travel agent training course is unpaid, and if it's one of the following types of training: Foundation Apprenticeships in England or Wales, Foundation Modern Apprenticeships in Scotland, or other government or local authority supported training in Northern Ireland?

2026-01-26T15:12:33.650682 [actor]: No, it's not unpaid. The local travel agency has employed her and they're paying for all of her training costs. It's not one of those government apprenticeship schemes you mentioned - it's a training program that the travel agency themselves have set up and they fund it completely.

2026-01-26T15:12:36.257476 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that information about Bella's training arrangement.

Based on what you've shared, it sounds like Bella is in paid employment with the travel agency rather than in approved unpaid training. For Child Benefit purposes, approved education or training typically needs to be unpaid and match specific government-recognized programs.

Since Bella is 16 and in paid employment that doesn't fall under the approved training criteria, this may affect your Child Benefit eligibility.

Do you claim any other benefits, such as Universal Credit or tax credits?

2026-01-26T15:12:38.686626 [actor]: No, I don't claim any other benefits at the moment. Just to be clear, I'm not sure if I explained it well - Bella is getting trained by the travel agency, but they're covering the cost of her training. They've employed her, so I guess that does mean it's paid employment with training included. Does that mean I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore?

2026-01-26T15:12:42.264940 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification.

Based on the information you've provided, since Bella is 16 and in paid employment with the travel agency (even though they're covering her training costs), this does not qualify as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes.

You're correct in your understanding - you would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Bella. Child Benefit typically continues beyond age 16 only if the child is in unpaid, approved education or training programs.

If Bella were to leave this employment and enter an approved education program (like A-levels) or an approved unpaid training program (like certain government apprenticeships), you could then reapply for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-26T15:12:44.464718 [actor]: I see, so because the training is paid for by her employer and she's in paid employment, I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore. That's disappointing but I understand now. Thank you for explaining it clearly to me.

2026-01-26T15:12:47.011126 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available for a 16-year-old who is in paid employment rather than approved unpaid education or training.
