2026-01-26T15:18:21.596684 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you understand if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to determine your eligibility.

First, do you have responsibility for a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T15:18:23.562461 [actor]: I need to ask you some questions about my situation. Yes, I do have a child living with me. I'm Hans, I'm 30 years old and have Pre-Settled Status in the UK. I've been unemployed and looking for work for about 95 days now. I've been claiming Child Benefit as a "jobseeker" but I don't have any job offers coming up soon.

2026-01-26T15:18:25.416095 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Hans. I'll continue asking questions to determine your Child Benefit eligibility.

You mentioned you have Pre-Settled Status in the UK. Are you from an EU, EEA country, or Switzerland, and if so, are you currently registered as looking for work with the relevant employment office (like the JobCentre)?

2026-01-26T15:18:26.955913 [actor]: Yes, I'm from Germany, which is in the EU. And yes, I've registered with the JobCentre as looking for work. I've been attending all my appointments and actively searching for jobs these past few months, but it's been difficult to find something suitable.

2026-01-26T15:18:28.560086 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hans. I understand you're from Germany (an EU country), you've registered with the JobCentre, and you're actively seeking work.

How old is the child you have responsibility for, and are they living with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T15:18:30.177670 [actor]: My daughter is 5 years old, and yes, she lives with me here in the UK. We've been here together since I got my Pre-Settled Status.

2026-01-26T15:18:31.665432 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Is your daughter in full-time education or approved training in the UK? At 5 years old, I assume she's in primary school, but I'd like to confirm.

2026-01-26T15:18:32.784606 [actor]: Yes, that's right. She's in primary school here in the UK. She started Reception last year and is doing well.

2026-01-26T15:18:34.544204 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. You mentioned you've been claiming Child Benefit as a "jobseeker" for some time. Just to be clear, are you the person who is primarily responsible for your daughter? (For example, you buy her clothes, food, and provide her housing, etc.)

2026-01-26T15:18:35.921094 [actor]: Yes, I'm her primary caregiver. I'm a single father and I take care of all her needs - her food, clothes, housing, school supplies, everything. That's why finding work soon is so important to me.

2026-01-26T15:18:39.166167 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation. You mentioned you've been claiming Child Benefit as a "jobseeker" for about 95 days. I need to understand your right to reside status a bit better.

As an EU citizen with Pre-Settled Status who is registered as a jobseeker, your right to claim Child Benefit as a jobseeker is typically limited to a 3-month (91-day) period unless you can demonstrate you have a genuine chance of finding work.

Since you've been claiming as a jobseeker for 95 days, which is just beyond the 91-day period, are you aware if your jobseeker status has been reviewed recently by the relevant authorities?

2026-01-26T15:18:40.987203 [actor]: No, I wasn't aware there was a 91-day limit for claiming as a jobseeker. Nobody has contacted me about a review of my status. I've just been attending my JobCentre appointments as usual. Does this mean I might not be eligible for Child Benefit anymore? This is quite concerning as I rely on that money for my daughter.

2026-01-26T15:18:46.205453 [root_agent]: I understand your concern, Hans. This is important information that affects you and your daughter.

Based on the UK government's rules, as an EU citizen with Pre-Settled Status who is claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker, there is typically a 3-month (91-day) limit on maintaining this status unless you can show you have a "genuine chance of being engaged" (meaning a realistic possibility of finding work).

Since you've now exceeded the 91-day period as a jobseeker (you mentioned about 95 days), your eligibility may be affected. However, this doesn't necessarily mean your Child Benefit will automatically stop.

What I would recommend is:
1. Contact the Child Benefit Office as soon as possible to explain your situation
2. Gather evidence of your job search activities to demonstrate you have a genuine chance of finding employment
3. Check if you might qualify for Child Benefit under a different right to reside category

The Child Benefit Office can provide specific guidance for your situation and explain what options you have. Would you like me to provide any additional information about this?

2026-01-26T15:18:48.941280 [actor]: This is really worrying news. I had no idea about this 91-day limit. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office right away. I do have records of all my job applications and interviews from these past months, so I'll gather those as evidence.

Do you think there's a high chance they'll stop my payments? It would be very difficult for me and my daughter if that happened. And what other right to reside categories might I qualify under? I'm not sure what other options I have.

2026-01-26T15:18:54.075729 [root_agent]: I understand this is concerning for you and your daughter, Hans. Let me address your questions:

Regarding your Child Benefit payments:
- Having documentation of your job search efforts is very helpful. This can demonstrate you have a "genuine chance" of finding employment, which might allow for an extension of your jobseeker status.
- The decision isn't automatic - the authorities will assess your individual circumstances.

Possible alternative right to reside categories could include:
- If you've previously worked in the UK (even for a short period) since arriving, you might qualify as a "worker" or retain "worker status" for a period after employment ended
- If you have other income or savings that show you're economically self-sufficient
- If you're in vocational training related to previous employment

When you contact the Child Benefit Office:
- Be open about not knowing about the 91-day limit
- Provide all evidence of your active job search
- Ask them to explain all options available in your situation
- Inquire about any grace period or transition arrangements

They can provide the most accurate guidance for your specific circumstances and help you understand your options going forward.

2026-01-26T15:18:56.992731 [actor]: Thank you for explaining this. I did actually work for about 3 months when I first arrived in the UK before losing my job. I didn't realize that might help my situation. I'll definitely mention that when I contact the Child Benefit Office, along with all my job search evidence.

I'll call them first thing tomorrow morning and explain everything. This benefit is really important for my daughter's wellbeing, so I hope they'll be understanding of my situation.

2026-01-26T15:19:00.262210 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that as an EU citizen with Pre-Settled Status who has been a jobseeker for more than 91 days, Hans's Child Benefit eligibility is at risk unless he can demonstrate a genuine chance of finding work or qualify under a different right to reside category.
