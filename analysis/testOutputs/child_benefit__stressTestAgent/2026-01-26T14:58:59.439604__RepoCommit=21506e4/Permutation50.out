2026-01-26T15:20:05.453771 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one by one to assess your situation.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:20:07.576554 [actor]: I need to understand more about your situation to help determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Based on the question from the agent, I'll respond as someone in the described situation - a person in Edinburgh with a 16-year-old daughter named Fiona who has left school and joined the "No One Left Behind" programme.

I'll engage with the agent's questions about child benefit eligibility.

2026-01-26T15:20:09.496529 [root_agent]: I'll continue helping you determine your eligibility for Child Benefit.

You mentioned you have a 16-year-old daughter named Fiona who has left school and joined the "No One Left Behind" programme. Thank you for sharing that information.

Could you please tell me if the "No One Left Behind" programme qualifies as approved education or training? This would help me understand if your daughter's current situation meets the eligibility requirements.

2026-01-26T15:20:11.703574 [actor]: Yes, Fiona has left school and is now in the No One Left Behind programme in Edinburgh. She's 16. I wasn't sure if I'd still get Child Benefit for her after she left school, but I heard this programme might qualify. It's a Scottish government training scheme she's joined to help her get skills for work.

2026-01-26T15:20:14.635627 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about Fiona's situation.

To determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit, I need to check if the "No One Left Behind" programme counts as approved education or training.

For a 16-year-old who has left school, Child Benefit can continue if they're in what's called "approved education or training." This typically includes courses that are non-advanced education or approved training.

Could you tell me if Fiona spends at least 12 hours a week in learning activities as part of this programme? And is the programme expected to last for at least 3 months?

2026-01-26T15:20:16.944885 [actor]: Yes, Fiona spends about 25 hours a week in the programme. She has classes and practical training sessions throughout the week. The No One Left Behind programme she's on is meant to last for 9 months in total. They're teaching her employability skills and some vocational training in hospitality.

2026-01-26T15:20:19.734018 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing those details about Fiona's programme.

Based on what you've shared - that Fiona spends about 25 hours per week in the programme (which exceeds the minimum 12 hours requirement) and that the programme lasts for 9 months (which exceeds the minimum 3 months requirement) - this sounds like it may qualify as approved training.

The "No One Left Behind" programme, as you've described it with employability skills and vocational training in hospitality, appears to fit the criteria for approved training.

One more question: Is Fiona living with you? Or does she live elsewhere?

2026-01-26T15:20:21.331587 [actor]: Yes, Fiona lives with me at home in Edinburgh. She just travels to the training center during the day for the programme, but she comes home every evening.

2026-01-26T15:20:25.172228 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Fiona lives with you at home in Edinburgh.

Based on all the information you've provided, it appears you should be eligible for Child Benefit for Fiona because:

1. She is 16 years old (under 20)
2. She is in what appears to be approved training (the "No One Left Behind" programme)
3. She spends more than 12 hours a week on this programme (25 hours)
4. The programme lasts more than 3 months (9 months total)
5. She lives with you, and you have responsibility for her

Since Fiona has moved from school to this training programme, if you're already receiving Child Benefit, you should notify the Child Benefit Office about this change in her education status to ensure your payments continue correctly.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or any other details about your situation that might affect your eligibility?

2026-01-26T15:20:27.759169 [actor]: That's great news! I was worried I might lose the Child Benefit when Fiona left school. I'll make sure to let the Child Benefit Office know about her joining this training programme. Thank you for confirming I'm still eligible - it really helps with our household budget. That's all I needed to know for now.

2026-01-26T15:20:30.421249 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Child Benefit can continue for a 16-year-old in approved training, correctly applying the criteria for the No One Left Behind programme which meets the requirements for approved training.
