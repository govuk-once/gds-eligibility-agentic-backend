2026-01-26T15:19:21.136020 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your eligibility.

First question: Are you responsible for raising a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:19:23.104669 [actor]: I'm Emily's mother. Emily is 18 years old and has just finished her A-Levels. She's now started a Higher National Certificate (HNC) course at a local college nearby. I'm wondering if I can still claim Child Benefit for her?

2026-01-26T15:19:24.996774 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To determine if you can claim Child Benefit for Emily, I need to check a few more details.

Is Emily's Higher National Certificate (HNC) course considered an approved education course? Approved education is typically full-time (more than 12 hours a week) non-advanced education or training.

2026-01-26T15:19:26.756931 [actor]: Emily's course is full-time, she attends college for about 20 hours a week. It's a Higher National Certificate course, which is a level 4 qualification at the local college, not at a university.

2026-01-26T15:19:28.921056 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since Emily is 18 years old, has completed her A-Levels, and is now in full-time education (20 hours per week) for an HNC course, this would generally qualify as approved education.

One more question: Does Emily live with you, or do you pay at least an equal amount toward her living costs if she lives elsewhere?

2026-01-26T15:19:30.062887 [actor]: Yes, Emily still lives at home with me. I'm covering all her living expenses while she completes this course.

2026-01-26T15:19:33.544268 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Emily lives with you and you're covering her living expenses.

Based on the information you've provided:
1. Emily is 18 years old
2. She's in approved full-time education (20 hours per week on an HNC course)
3. She lives with you and you're responsible for her living costs

You are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emily. Child Benefit can continue until she turns 20 as long as she remains in approved full-time education. 

You should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit payments, or if you haven't claimed before, you can make a claim now. Remember that if your individual income is over £60,000 per year, you may have to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-26T15:19:35.783016 [actor]: That's great news! Thank you for confirming I can continue to receive Child Benefit for Emily while she completes her HNC course. I wasn't sure if I'd still be eligible now that she's 18 and in college rather than school. I appreciate your help with this.

2026-01-26T15:19:38.383843 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for an 18-year-old in approved full-time education (HNC course) who lives with their parent.
