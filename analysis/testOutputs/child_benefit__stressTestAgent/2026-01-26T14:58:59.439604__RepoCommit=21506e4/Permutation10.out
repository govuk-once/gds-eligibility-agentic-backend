2026-01-26T15:02:19.342391 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions one at a time to assess your situation properly.

Do you have responsibility for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:02:20.962407 [actor]: I'm Brenda, I'm 52 years old and I foster a 12-year-old boy named Liam. He's been placed with me by the local authority and lives with me. So yes, I do have responsibility for a child under 16.

2026-01-26T15:02:22.421733 [root_agent]: Thank you for the information, Brenda. I understand you're fostering a 12-year-old boy named Liam who's been placed with you by the local authority.

Does the local authority pay you an allowance for fostering Liam?

2026-01-26T15:02:23.473238 [actor]: Yes, the local council pays me a fostering allowance that covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance.

2026-01-26T15:02:26.771716 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Brenda.

Since Liam is in foster care and you receive a fostering allowance from the local authority that covers his accommodation and maintenance, you would typically not be eligible for Child Benefit for him.

Child Benefit is generally not payable for children in foster care when the local authority is paying an allowance for them. This is because the fostering allowance you receive is designed to cover the child's needs.

The local authority is considered responsible for the child in this situation, even though you're providing the day-to-day care as the foster parent.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or other support that might be available to you as a foster parent?

2026-01-26T15:02:28.991429 [actor]: I see, that makes sense. The council does provide the fostering allowance to cover Liam's needs. Thank you for explaining why I'm not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation. I don't have any other questions about Child Benefit at the moment.

2026-01-26T15:02:31.036868 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that foster parents receiving a fostering allowance from the local authority are not eligible for Child Benefit for the fostered child.
