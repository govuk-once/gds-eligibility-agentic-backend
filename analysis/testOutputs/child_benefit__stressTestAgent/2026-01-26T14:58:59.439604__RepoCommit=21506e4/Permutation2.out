2026-01-26T14:59:21.517820 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit according to UK government rules. To do this, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First question: Do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T14:59:23.064925 [actor]: Hello there. Yes, I do have responsibility for my daughter Priya. She's 17 and currently studying for her A-levels at a sixth form college nearby.

2026-01-26T14:59:24.475741 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. Since your daughter Priya is 17 and studying for her A-levels at a sixth form college, that's helpful to know.

Next question: Is your daughter normally living with you in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:59:25.498841 [actor]: Yes, she lives with me here in London. It's just the two of us in our home.

2026-01-26T14:59:26.537714 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Are you or your daughter subject to immigration control, or do you both have the right to reside in the UK?

2026-01-26T14:59:27.622863 [actor]: We both have the right to reside in the UK. We're not subject to immigration control.

2026-01-26T14:59:28.704383 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: Is your individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T14:59:29.775831 [actor]: No, my income is around £40,000 per year. I'm a single father raising Priya on my own.

2026-01-26T14:59:32.863681 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information.

Based on what you've told me so far, it appears you are eligible for Child Benefit. You:
- Have responsibility for your 17-year-old daughter who is studying A-levels (approved education)
- Live with your daughter in the UK
- Both have the right to reside in the UK
- Have an income below the £60,000 threshold

Since your income is around £40,000, you would be eligible to receive the full Child Benefit amount without the High Income Child Benefit Charge that applies to those earning over £50,000.

Would you like information about how to claim Child Benefit or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-26T14:59:35.043470 [actor]: That's great news! I'm glad to hear I'm eligible for the full Child Benefit amount. Could you please tell me how I can claim it? I want to make sure I get this sorted out properly.

2026-01-26T14:59:37.952266 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly verified that the father is eligible for Child Benefit since his daughter is 17, in approved education, living with him in the UK, they both have right to reside, and his income is below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
