2026-01-26T15:04:22.302769 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First question: Are you responsible for raising a child who lives with you?

2026-01-26T15:04:23.893860 [actor]: I'll respond as a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

My daughter Emma doesn't live with me. She's 12 and lives with her mother, but I want to know if I can claim Child Benefit for her. Her mother isn't claiming it at the moment.

2026-01-26T15:04:26.908777 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context. I understand that your 12-year-old daughter Emma lives with her mother, not with you, and her mother isn't currently claiming Child Benefit.

Generally, Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with. Since Emma lives with her mother, you wouldn't typically be eligible to claim Child Benefit for her. The person who has the main day-to-day responsibility for the child is usually the one who can claim.

However, I'd like to ask: Do you provide any financial support for Emma or have any specific custody arrangements that might be relevant to your situation?

2026-01-26T15:04:28.492758 [actor]: Yes, I do provide some financial support for Emma. I send her a birthday present once a year, and I transfer £10 a week to her mother to help with food costs. I don't have custody of Emma, but I still want to contribute to her upbringing as much as I can.

2026-01-26T15:04:31.726643 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I appreciate that you want to contribute to Emma's upbringing.

Based on UK government rules for Child Benefit, you wouldn't be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Emma in this situation. The benefit is typically paid to the person who has main responsibility for the child and with whom the child lives. Since Emma lives with her mother full-time, her mother would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit.

The financial support you provide (£10 weekly and birthday presents), while commendable, doesn't meet the threshold for Child Benefit eligibility, as this requires having main day-to-day responsibility for raising the child.

Would you like me to provide information about how Emma's mother could claim Child Benefit if she isn't already doing so?

2026-01-26T15:04:34.059164 [actor]: I see, so I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since Emma lives with her mother and my financial support isn't enough. That's disappointing, but I understand. Yes, I would appreciate some information about how her mother could claim Child Benefit since she isn't claiming it currently. Maybe I could pass that information along to her.

2026-01-26T15:04:36.274208 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is paid to the person the child lives with and has day-to-day responsibility for, which is Emma's mother, not the father who only provides occasional financial support.
