2026-01-26T15:15:19.906714 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To determine your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time.

First, are you responsible for raising a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:15:21.455194 [actor]: I'll role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility.

Yes, I'm responsible for raising two children. My partner Helen and I have adopted a sibling pair who are 6 and 8 years old.

2026-01-26T15:15:22.794902 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know you're responsible for two adopted children aged 6 and 8.

Do these children live with you most of the time?

2026-01-26T15:15:23.961121 [actor]: Yes, both children live with us full time. We adopted them about a year ago, and they've been living with us since then.

2026-01-26T15:15:25.512932 [root_agent]: I understand that both children have been living with you full-time since you adopted them about a year ago.

May I ask if you or your partner Helen have an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-26T15:15:26.806209 [actor]: No, neither of us earn over £60,000 individually. I work part-time as a teacher and Helen works as a nurse. Our combined household income is actually less than that amount.

2026-01-26T15:15:28.288503 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's important to know regarding your income situation.

Are both you and your partner Helen UK residents?

2026-01-26T15:15:29.357318 [actor]: Yes, we're both UK residents. We've lived in Manchester for about 15 years now.

2026-01-26T15:15:30.932329 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that both you and Helen are UK residents living in Manchester.

Is either you or Helen claiming any other benefits for the children, such as Guardian's Allowance?

2026-01-26T15:15:32.497808 [actor]: We don't receive Guardian's Allowance, but because the children have special needs, the Local Authority does pay us an Adoption Allowance to help with the costs of caring for them. That's the only additional support we receive for the children.

2026-01-26T15:15:35.828037 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Receiving an Adoption Allowance for children with special needs doesn't disqualify you from Child Benefit.

Based on what you've told me:
- You're responsible for two adopted children aged 6 and 8
- The children live with you full-time
- Neither you nor your partner earn over £60,000 per year
- You're both UK residents
- You receive an Adoption Allowance but no Guardian's Allowance

From this information, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. You can claim Child Benefit for both children since they live with you, you're responsible for them, and they're under 16. 

The current rates are £25.60 per week for your eldest or only child, and £16.95 per week for each additional child.

Would you like information about how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:15:37.430214 [actor]: That's great news! Yes, I would definitely like to know how to apply for the Child Benefit for our children. This additional support will be very helpful for us.

2026-01-26T15:15:39.781616 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information about Child Benefit eligibility for adoptive parents with two children under 16 who live with them full-time and meet all other requirements.
