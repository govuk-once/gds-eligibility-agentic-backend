2026-01-26T15:15:41.695842 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, are you responsible for raising a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:15:44.574446 [actor]: I need to ask you some questions about my situation regarding Child Benefit. I have a 15-year-old son named Simon. He's been detained under the Mental Health Act and has been placed in a secure psychiatric unit for 10 weeks now. I'm wondering if I'm still eligible to receive Child Benefit for him while he's in this situation.

2026-01-26T15:15:47.918779 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that context about your situation with your 15-year-old son Simon.

Based on the UK government's rules regarding Child Benefit for children in hospital or care, you can usually continue to receive Child Benefit if your child is in hospital, regardless of how long they stay there.

For a child who has been detained under the Mental Health Act in a secure psychiatric unit, this would typically be considered as being in hospital care rather than being "looked after" by the local authority.

Since Simon is temporarily in a psychiatric unit and you're still responsible for him overall, you should remain eligible for Child Benefit during this period.

May I ask, do you visit Simon regularly or maintain contact with him while he's in the unit?

2026-01-26T15:15:50.451571 [actor]: Yes, I visit Simon as often as I can - usually twice a week. I also call him daily when he's able to take calls. The psychiatric unit is about an hour's drive from our home. I'm still taking care of all his other needs - bringing him clothes, personal items, and I'm actively involved in meetings about his treatment and care plan. It's been difficult, but I'm trying to stay involved in his life and support his recovery.

2026-01-26T15:15:53.578539 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. The fact that you're visiting Simon regularly, calling him daily when possible, providing for his personal needs, and remaining actively involved in his treatment and care plan clearly demonstrates that you're maintaining your parental responsibility while he's receiving treatment.

Based on the UK government's guidelines, since Simon is in hospital care rather than being looked after by local authorities, and you're continuing to be responsible for him by staying involved in his life and care, you should remain eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit during his stay in the psychiatric unit.

The temporary nature of his placement (10 weeks so far) and your ongoing involvement in his care are important factors that support your continued eligibility.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility in this situation?

2026-01-26T15:15:56.315817 [actor]: That's a relief to hear that I can continue receiving Child Benefit while Simon is in the psychiatric unit. His doctors have mentioned he might need to stay for a few more weeks beyond the initial plan, so I was getting worried about our financial situation. I don't think I have any other questions right now - you've cleared up my main concern about whether I'd still be eligible during his treatment. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.

2026-01-26T15:15:58.666324 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit while their child is temporarily in hospital/psychiatric care, as they maintain regular contact and parental responsibility.
