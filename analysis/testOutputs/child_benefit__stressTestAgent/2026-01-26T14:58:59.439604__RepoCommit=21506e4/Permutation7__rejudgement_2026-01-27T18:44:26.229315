2026-01-27T18:50:20.306044 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly determined the outcome. According to the expected outcome, David should be "Eligible (via Exception)" for full Child Benefit because Jack spends 2 nights in a row (Friday and Saturday) at home each weekend, which qualifies under the exception to the 8-week care rule. Instead, the agent incorrectly stated David would only be eligible for a proportional payment.
