2026-01-26T15:11:55.968198 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-26T15:11:57.658716 [actor]: I'll roleplay as a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility.

Hello there. Yes, I have a son named John who is 17 years old. He lives with me - I'm Pete, his father.

2026-01-26T15:11:59.159509 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Pete. I'll continue asking questions to determine your eligibility for Child Benefit.

Since John is 17 years old, is he currently in approved education (such as A-levels, NVQs up to level 3) or approved training?

2026-01-26T15:12:00.855156 [actor]: Yes, John is at our local college. He's re-sitting two of his GCSEs that he didn't pass last year. He goes to college for about 6 hours a week for supervised study. The rest of the time he's mostly at home playing video games.

2026-01-26T15:12:02.316923 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Pete. 

To clarify about John's education situation - is this GCSE re-sitting program considered approved education by his school or college? Generally, approved education would involve at least 12 hours a week of supervised study.

2026-01-26T15:12:04.604070 [actor]: The college says it's an approved course for re-sitting GCSEs, but he only attends for 6 hours of supervised study each week. That's all the time they allocate for the two subjects he's re-sitting. Is that not enough hours? I didn't know there was an hourly requirement.

2026-01-26T15:12:06.736126 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification, Pete. 

For Child Benefit eligibility, approved education typically requires at least 12 hours per week of supervised study. Since John is only attending 6 hours per week for his GCSE re-sits, this may not meet the requirement for approved education under Child Benefit rules.

To be certain about your specific situation, may I ask if John is living with you full-time at home?

2026-01-26T15:12:08.549634 [actor]: Yes, John lives with me full-time. He's been living with me since his mother and I separated when he was young. So he's at home with me when he's not at college for those 6 hours a week.

2026-01-26T15:12:10.687234 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that John lives with you full-time, Pete.

Based on the information provided, there may be a challenge with your Child Benefit eligibility. While John is under 20 and living with you, his current education arrangement of only 6 hours per week of supervised study likely does not meet the requirements for approved education, which typically requires at least 12 hours per week.

May I ask if you're currently receiving Child Benefit for John, or are you applying for the first time?

2026-01-26T15:12:12.374026 [actor]: I've been receiving Child Benefit for John since he was born. It's just continued all these years. I didn't know there was a minimum hours requirement for his studies. Does this mean I might lose the Child Benefit now?

2026-01-26T15:12:15.683225 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, Pete.

Yes, this could affect your Child Benefit for John. Since he's over 16 and appears to not be in what's considered full-time approved education (minimum 12 hours of supervised study per week), you may no longer be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit.

If John's hours of supervised study don't increase to at least 12 hours per week, you should notify the Child Benefit Office about this change in circumstances as soon as possible, as continuing to claim when not eligible could result in having to repay benefits.

Would you like me to ask about any other factors that might affect your Child Benefit eligibility, or would you like information about what steps to take next?

2026-01-26T15:12:18.703851 [actor]: I understand now. So I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit because John's course doesn't have enough supervised study hours. That's disappointing, but I appreciate you explaining it clearly. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office to let them know about our situation. Is there any chance the benefit could continue if John increases his study hours? He might be able to add another subject or some additional study time at the college.

2026-01-26T15:12:21.559616 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit eligibility for a 17-year-old requires at least 12 hours of approved education per week, and since the child only attends 6 hours weekly, the parent is not eligible.
