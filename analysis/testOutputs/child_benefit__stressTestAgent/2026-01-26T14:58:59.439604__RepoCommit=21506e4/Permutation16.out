2026-01-26T15:04:38.119946 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you a few questions, one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-26T15:04:38.976155 [actor]: Yes, I have a son named Oliver who is 14 years old.

2026-01-26T15:04:40.510111 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know about your 14-year-old son, Oliver. 

Does Oliver live with you? Or if not, do you pay at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate toward his upbringing?

2026-01-26T15:04:42.541665 [actor]: Oliver doesn't currently live with me. He has a rare medical condition and has been sent to a specialist hospital in the USA for treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I stay in the UK but I pay for his incidental costs while he's there, and I visit him when I can.

2026-01-26T15:04:45.054512 [root_agent]: I understand that Oliver is currently receiving medical treatment in the USA and has been there for about 15 weeks. This is an important detail for determining your Child Benefit eligibility.

Since Oliver is temporarily away for medical treatment, you may still be eligible for Child Benefit. The UK government allows Child Benefit to continue for children who are temporarily away from home for medical treatment.

Is Oliver expected to return to live with you in the UK once his treatment is complete?

2026-01-26T15:04:46.495247 [actor]: Yes, Oliver will be returning to live with me in the UK once his treatment is complete. The doctors haven't given me a specific timeframe yet, but the USA hospital placement is definitely temporary for his specialized treatment.

2026-01-26T15:04:49.458337 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Oliver will be returning to live with you in the UK after his treatment is complete. That's important information.

Based on what you've shared, it appears you may still be eligible for Child Benefit while Oliver is temporarily receiving medical treatment in the USA, since this is a temporary absence for medical reasons and he will be returning to live with you.

Before I confirm your eligibility, I need to ask: Do you normally live in the UK, and do you have the right to reside in the UK (such as being a UK citizen, having settled status, etc.)?

2026-01-26T15:04:50.644425 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK resident. I've been living here all my life and I have the right to reside in the UK as a citizen.

2026-01-26T15:04:53.979327 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a UK resident and citizen. 

Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Oliver because:

1. You have responsibility for a child under 16 (Oliver is 14)
2. Oliver is temporarily away receiving medical treatment, which doesn't affect eligibility
3. He will return to live with you after treatment
4. You are a UK resident with the right to reside in the UK

One final question: Is your individual income over £60,000 per year? If it is, you would still be eligible but would need to pay back all of the benefit through the High Income Child Benefit Charge. If your income is between £50,000 and £60,000, you would need to pay back a portion of it.

2026-01-26T15:04:55.143445 [actor]: My income is around £45,000 per year, so it's below the £50,000 threshold.

2026-01-26T15:04:58.958821 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since your income is around £45,000 per year, which is below the £50,000 threshold, you won't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Based on all the information you've provided, I can confirm that you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Oliver. You:

1. Have responsibility for a child under 16
2. Are a UK resident with the right to reside in the UK
3. Have a child who is temporarily away for medical treatment (which doesn't affect eligibility)
4. Have an income below the threshold for the High Income Child Benefit Charge

If you're not already claiming Child Benefit, you can apply online through the UK government website or by filling out and mailing a CH2 claim form. If you're already receiving Child Benefit, it should continue during Oliver's temporary medical stay abroad.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-26T15:05:01.601599 [actor]: Thank you for confirming I'm eligible for Child Benefit while Oliver is receiving treatment abroad. That's a relief to know. I've been worried about the financial aspects of his treatment, so this helps. I don't have any other questions at the moment. I appreciate your help with this.

2026-01-26T15:05:04.067846 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly identified that the parent remains eligible for Child Benefit while their child is temporarily abroad for medical treatment, with plans to return to the parent's care in the UK.
