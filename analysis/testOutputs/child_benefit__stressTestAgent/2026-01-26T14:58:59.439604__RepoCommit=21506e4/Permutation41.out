2026-01-26T15:15:59.949516 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you figure out if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. Let me ask you some questions to determine your eligibility.

First, do you have any children living with you?

2026-01-26T15:16:01.713556 [actor]: I have two children, Ben who's 10 and Jerry who's 8, but they don't actually live with me. They live with my ex-partner. I do contribute financially to their upbringing though - I pay £40 per week towards their care.

2026-01-26T15:16:04.627124 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. Since Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner rather than with you, this affects your Child Benefit eligibility.

Generally, Child Benefit is paid to the person who the child lives with. In your situation, it would typically be your ex-partner who would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry, as they are living with them.

However, I'd like to ask: Do you have any formal family-based arrangement or court order regarding the care of your children?

2026-01-26T15:16:06.771177 [actor]: No, we don't have any formal court order. It's just an arrangement between us that the children live with my ex, and I contribute £40 a week toward their expenses. I was wondering if I could get any portion of the Child Benefit since I'm helping financially with their upbringing.

2026-01-26T15:16:10.614328 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining your situation. Based on the information you've provided, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry.

Child Benefit is typically paid to the person who the child lives with, which in this case is your ex-partner. Even though you contribute financially to your children's upbringing (which is commendable), the UK system generally awards Child Benefit to the primary caregiver with whom the children reside.

Your informal arrangement to pay £40 per week toward their expenses is separate from the Child Benefit system. The financial contribution you make is important for your children, but it doesn't establish eligibility for Child Benefit in your circumstances.

Your ex-partner would be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ben and Jerry, assuming they meet other eligibility criteria.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation or other support that might be available to you?

2026-01-26T15:16:13.910401 [actor]: I see, thanks for explaining that. I was under the impression that since I contribute a significant amount toward their care (£40 per week), I might be eligible for some portion of the Child Benefit. 

Just to make sure I understand - even though I'm paying more than half of what the Child Benefit would be for both children (I think it's about £43 per week total), there's no way for me to receive any of it directly? Is there any way to arrange for the benefit to be split between me and my ex since we're both contributing to their care?

2026-01-26T15:16:19.247296 [root_agent]: I understand your perspective on contributing significantly to your children's care, and it's a good question.

To clarify: Even though you contribute £40 per week (which is indeed close to the full Child Benefit amount), there is no provision in the UK Child Benefit system to split the benefit between separated parents based on financial contributions. The Child Benefit is designed to go to the person with whom the child primarily lives, regardless of how the financial responsibilities are shared.

The UK government doesn't have an official system for splitting Child Benefit between parents. Child Benefit is paid to one person for a child - it cannot be officially divided between two households under the current rules.

What some separated parents sometimes do is make private arrangements where the receiving parent might share some of the benefit, but this would be an informal agreement between you and your ex-partner, not something officially administered by HMRC.

If your circumstances regarding where the children live were to change substantially (such as moving to a shared care arrangement where the children live with each of you for roughly equal time), then the eligibility situation might be different.

Would you like me to explain any other aspects of how Child Benefit works in separated family situations?

2026-01-26T15:16:21.868918 [actor]: Thank you for explaining that so clearly. I understand now that Child Benefit goes to the parent the children live with, and there's no official way to split it based on financial contributions. 

I suppose I could talk to my ex-partner about possibly sharing some of the benefit given my financial contribution, but that would be between us and not an official arrangement.

Just to be completely clear - even in cases where the non-resident parent provides substantial financial support, the benefit always goes to the resident parent? There's no special application or exception I could make to HMRC?

2026-01-26T15:16:26.457329 [root_agent]: You're absolutely right. Even in cases where the non-resident parent provides substantial financial support, as you do, Child Benefit is still designed to go to the resident parent (your ex-partner in this case). There is no special application or exception you could make to HMRC based solely on your financial contributions.

The UK government's position is clear on this - Child Benefit is paid to the person who the child lives with, regardless of the financial support provided by the non-resident parent. This remains true even when that support is significant, as in your situation.

Your understanding is correct that any arrangement to share some of the benefit would need to be an informal agreement between you and your ex-partner. HMRC does not administer or enforce such arrangements.

The only circumstance where this might change would be if the living arrangements of your children changed substantially (such as if they began living with you part-time in a formal shared care arrangement).

I appreciate your thorough questions to make sure you fully understand the situation.

2026-01-26T15:16:28.277220 [actor]: I understand now. Thank you for being so clear about it. The Child Benefit will go to my ex-partner since Ben and Jerry live with them, regardless of my financial contributions. Any sharing of the benefit would need to be arranged privately between us.

2026-01-26T15:16:30.946356 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit goes to the resident parent (the ex-partner) and the questioner is not eligible since the children don't live with them, regardless of their financial contributions.
