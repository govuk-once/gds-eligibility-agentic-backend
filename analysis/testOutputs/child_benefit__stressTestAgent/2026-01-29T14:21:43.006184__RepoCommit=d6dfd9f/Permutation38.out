2026-01-29T14:51:51.517484 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:51:53.765590 [actor]: Yes, I do! My partner and I just had a baby 4 months ago. We've been so busy with everything that we only just got around to filling in the form today. Are we going to lose out on the money from those past 4 months?

2026-01-29T14:51:57.204841 [root_agent]: Congratulations on your new baby!

Good news - you won't lose out on those past 4 months. Child Benefit can be backdated for up to **3 months** from the date your claim is received. However, since your baby is 4 months old, you'll be able to claim for the most recent 3 months, but unfortunately not for that first month.

Now, to continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: **Are you or your partner responsible for the child, meaning one of you is the main person looking after them?**

2026-01-29T14:51:59.494426 [actor]: Yes, we're both looking after the baby together - we live together as a family. So does that mean we definitely qualify for Child Benefit then? And we'll get the backdated amount for 3 months?

2026-01-29T14:52:02.100768 [root_agent]: That's great that you're both caring for your baby together! 

Before I can confirm your eligibility, I need to ask a few more questions:

**Is your child living with you in the UK, or if they're living elsewhere, are you contributing at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards their upkeep?**

2026-01-29T14:52:03.825774 [actor]: Yes, the baby lives with us here in the UK. We're all living together at home.

2026-01-29T14:52:06.427317 [root_agent]: Excellent! Now I need to ask about your immigration status:

**Do you or your partner have the right to live in the UK? This includes being a British citizen, having settled status, or having a valid immigration status that allows you to claim benefits?**

2026-01-29T14:52:08.330306 [actor]: Yes, we're both British citizens, born and raised here.

2026-01-29T14:52:10.713976 [root_agent]: Perfect! Now I need to ask an important question about income:

**Do you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 per year?**

(This is important because if either of you earns over this amount, it can affect your Child Benefit entitlement through something called the High Income Child Benefit Charge.)

2026-01-29T14:52:12.687274 [actor]: No, neither of us earns that much. We're both well under £50,000 a year.

2026-01-29T14:52:16.392751 [root_agent]: Excellent news! Based on the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit**. 

Here's a summary:
- ✓ You have a child under 16 living with you in the UK
- ✓ You're responsible for the child
- ✓ You have the right to live in the UK (British citizens)
- ✓ Neither of you earns over £50,000 per year

Regarding the backdating: Since you've just filled in the form today and your baby is 4 months old, you should receive Child Benefit for the most recent 3 months (as claims can be backdated up to 3 months from when the claim is received).

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like to know?

2026-01-29T14:52:20.417572 [actor]: That's brilliant, thank you so much! That's really helpful to know. We were worried we'd missed out completely, so getting 3 months back is better than nothing. Thanks for your help!

2026-01-29T14:52:22.967920 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed eligibility for Child Benefit and correctly explained that the claim can be backdated for 3 months (but not the full 4 months), which matches the expected outcome that the claimant is eligible but only for the last 3 months.
