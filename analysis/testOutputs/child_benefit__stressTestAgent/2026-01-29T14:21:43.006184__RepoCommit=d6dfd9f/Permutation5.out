2026-01-29T14:23:49.709588 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T14:23:51.264918 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Lucas, he's 10 years old.

2026-01-29T14:23:52.943290 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: Is Lucas living with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T14:23:54.745854 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me. Lucas lives with my ex-wife, Jenny. We're divorced.

2026-01-29T14:23:56.795229 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. This is an important factor in determining eligibility.

Let me ask: Do you contribute towards Lucas's upbringing? For example, do you pay maintenance or provide regular financial support for him?

2026-01-29T14:23:58.353052 [actor]: Yes, I do contribute. I transfer £150 per month directly to Jenny specifically for Lucas's food and clothes.

2026-01-29T14:24:00.427695 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

One more important question: Does Jenny currently claim Child Benefit for Lucas?

2026-01-29T14:24:02.238191 [actor]: No, she doesn't. Jenny is not claiming Child Benefit for Lucas.

2026-01-29T14:24:04.306556 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Let me ask: Are you responsible for Lucas in any other ways besides the financial contribution? For example, does he stay with you regularly, or do you make decisions about his upbringing, education, or welfare?

2026-01-29T14:24:06.386798 [actor]: Well, I'm his father so I'm involved in decisions about his upbringing and education. He does stay with me sometimes for visits, but he primarily lives with Jenny.

2026-01-29T14:24:08.475088 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me ask one more question to get a complete picture: Approximately how often does Lucas stay with you? For example, is it every weekend, once a month, during school holidays, or another arrangement?

2026-01-29T14:24:10.458439 [actor]: He stays with me every other weekend, and we share some of the school holidays.

2026-01-29T14:24:17.034908 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on the rules for Child Benefit eligibility:**

Since Lucas lives primarily with your ex-wife Jenny, the person who is generally eligible to claim Child Benefit is the person he lives with - in this case, Jenny. Child Benefit is normally paid to the person the child lives with.

However, there is an important provision: if the person the child lives with (Jenny) is **not** claiming Child Benefit, then the person who contributes at least the same amount as Child Benefit toward the child's upbringing may be able to claim instead.

**In your situation:**

- Lucas lives with Jenny (not you)
- Jenny is not claiming Child Benefit
- You contribute £150 per month toward Lucas's upbringing

For the 2023/24 tax year, Child Benefit is £24 per week (approximately £104 per month) for the eldest or only child. Since you're contributing £150 per month, which is more than the Child Benefit amount, **you may be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas**.

You would need to apply and explain your circumstances, including that Lucas lives with his mother who is not claiming, and that you contribute toward his upbringing.

Would you like to know how to apply?

2026-01-29T14:24:18.982683 [actor]: That's great to hear, thank you! Yes, I would like to know how to apply.

2026-01-29T14:24:24.370428 [root_agent]: I'm glad that was helpful!

To apply for Child Benefit, you'll need to:

1. **Fill out a Child Benefit claim form** - You can get this form online from the government website or request it by phone.

2. **Provide proof of your child's birth** - You'll need to send Lucas's original birth certificate (or a certified copy) with your application. This will be returned to you.

3. **Explain your circumstances** - Since Lucas doesn't live with you, you'll need to explain on the form that:
   - He lives with his mother (Jenny)
   - She is not claiming Child Benefit
   - You contribute toward his upbringing (the £150 per month you mentioned)

4. **Submit your application** - Send the completed form and documents to the Child Benefit Office. The address will be on the form.

**Important note:** Given that your situation involves a child who lives elsewhere, it may take a bit longer to process as they'll need to verify the details. They may contact you or Jenny to confirm the arrangements.

You can find the application form and full details on the government website at GOV.UK by searching for "Child Benefit claim form."

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-29T14:24:26.387224 [actor]: No, that's everything I needed to know. Thank you so much for your help!

2026-01-29T14:24:30.359485 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that since the child lives with the mother who isn't claiming Child Benefit, and the user contributes £150/month (which exceeds the Child Benefit amount of approximately £104/month), the user may be eligible to claim Child Benefit and should apply with an explanation of circumstances.
