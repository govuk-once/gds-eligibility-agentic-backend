2026-01-29T14:35:18.630043 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:35:20.753278 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Dev, who is studying full-time for his A-levels. He's currently 19, but he just turned 20 last week actually.

2026-01-29T14:35:23.792531 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask a follow-up question about Dev's education:

**Is Dev enrolled in approved education or training that is not higher education (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or similar qualifications)?**

I'm asking because the rules allow Child Benefit for young people under 20 if they're in approved education or training, but this doesn't include university degrees or other higher education courses.

2026-01-29T14:35:26.289617 [actor]: Yes, he's doing his A-levels, so it's not higher education - he's still at college doing them. He started the course last September and won't finish until June this year. He's studying full-time.

2026-01-29T14:35:29.192757 [root_agent]: Great, that's helpful information. Dev's A-level course does sound like approved education.

Now let me ask you an important question about your relationship with Dev:

**Are you the person responsible for Dev? By this I mean, does Dev normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards his upkeep?**

2026-01-29T14:35:31.207605 [actor]: Yes, Dev lives with me. He's always lived at home with me while he's been studying.

2026-01-29T14:35:33.714421 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now I need to ask about your immigration and residence status:

**Are you living in the UK, and do you have the right to reside here? This means you're either a UK citizen, have settled status, or have another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits.**

2026-01-29T14:35:35.672524 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK citizen and I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T14:35:39.474414 [root_agent]: Excellent. Now I need to ask an important question about Dev's education status:

**Has Dev's college or education provider formally approved his enrollment on the A-level course, and have they confirmed he's in full-time education? Also, is he studying for at least 12 hours a week in what the course provider describes as 'supervised study'?**

This is important because young people aged 16-19 (or who turn 20 during their course) must be in approved education or training for Child Benefit to continue.

2026-01-29T14:35:41.797218 [actor]: Yes, he's enrolled at the college and they've confirmed he's a full-time student. He's definitely doing more than 12 hours a week of supervised study - it's a proper full-time A-level course with lectures and classes throughout the week.

2026-01-29T14:35:43.775642 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now I have one more important question:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Dev? This could be another parent, guardian, or family member.**

Only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child at a time.

2026-01-29T14:35:45.553139 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming for him. I'm the only one claiming Child Benefit for Dev.

2026-01-29T14:35:50.725993 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, let me give you my assessment:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Dev.**

Here's why:

✓ Dev is under 20 years old (he just turned 20)
✓ He's enrolled in approved full-time education (A-levels at college)
✓ He started his course before turning 20 (last September)
✓ He lives with you (so you're responsible for him)
✓ You're a UK citizen living in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for him

**Important point:** Child Benefit can continue until Dev finishes his A-level course in June, or until the week after his 20th birthday - **whichever comes first**. Since Dev has just turned 20 last week, I need to clarify:

**Did Dev turn 20 before the end of the current academic term/course, or will he complete his A-levels before the week after his 20th birthday has passed?**

This timing is crucial because Child Benefit stops the week after a young person turns 20, even if they haven't finished their course yet.

2026-01-29T14:35:52.885632 [actor]: Oh, I see. Yes, Dev turned 20 last week, so that was in the middle of his course - he won't finish his A-levels until June. So you're saying the benefit stops now then, even though he's still studying?

2026-01-29T14:35:58.119839 [root_agent]: Yes, I'm afraid that's correct based on the rules.

**Child Benefit stops from the week after Dev turned 20**, even though he's still studying and hasn't completed his A-levels yet.

The rule is that Child Benefit can continue for young people in approved education or training, but only **until they turn 20**. Specifically, it stops on the Monday after their 20th birthday (or on their 20th birthday if that falls on a Monday).

So even though Dev is still in full-time education and won't finish until June, your Child Benefit entitlement for him ended the week after his 20th birthday last week.

I understand this might be disappointing news, especially as he's still studying and living at home. The benefit doesn't extend to the end of the academic year if the young person turns 20 during their course.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T14:36:00.108921 [actor]: No, I understand now. That's disappointing but I appreciate you explaining it clearly. Thank you for your help.

2026-01-29T14:36:03.702773 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops the week after a child turns 20, even if they are still in approved education, which is the correct rule according to gov.uk guidance.
