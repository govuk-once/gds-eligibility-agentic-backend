2026-01-29T14:25:18.272503 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T14:29:14.793374 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Jack, he's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T14:29:16.479294 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Jack live with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T14:29:20.865685 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. Jack was placed in local authority care about 3 months ago, but he comes home to stay with me every weekend - he arrives Friday evening and leaves Sunday evening.

2026-01-29T14:29:23.214071 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that situation. I understand this can be a complex area.

To help me assess your eligibility properly, I need to ask: During the weekdays when Jack is in local authority care, does the local authority contribute to the cost of looking after him, or are they fully covering his care costs?

2026-01-29T14:29:24.812594 [actor]: The local authority is fully covering his care costs during the week when he's with them.

2026-01-29T14:29:27.057245 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now, when Jack is with you on the weekends, are you responsible for his care and making decisions about his upbringing during that time?

2026-01-29T14:29:28.917878 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. When he's home on weekends, I'm completely responsible for him - I look after him, feed him, and make all the decisions about his care during that time.

2026-01-29T14:29:31.102658 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

One more important question: Have you been claiming Child Benefit for Jack before he went into local authority care, or would this be a new claim?

2026-01-29T14:29:32.740706 [actor]: I had been claiming Child Benefit for Jack before he went into care, yes.

2026-01-29T14:29:37.392977 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on the rules for Child Benefit when a child is in care:**

When a child is looked after by a local authority and the local authority is contributing to or paying for the cost of their care, you generally **cannot continue to claim Child Benefit** during those periods, even if the child comes home for weekends.

However, there is an exception: If Jack has been in care for **less than 8 weeks**, you may still be able to continue receiving Child Benefit.

Since you mentioned Jack has been in local authority care for about 3 months (approximately 12 weeks), this means you would **not be eligible** to continue receiving Child Benefit while he remains in local authority care with his costs fully covered by them.

**Important:** If your circumstances change - for example, if Jack returns to live with you full-time or if the care arrangement changes - you should contact the Child Benefit Office to update them, as you may become eligible again.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-29T14:29:39.903799 [actor]: Oh, I see. That's disappointing to hear, but I understand. No, I think that's clear. Thank you for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T14:29:44.638939 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to the scenario, the expected outcome is "Eligible (via Exception)" but the agent concluded I was "not eligible" to continue receiving Child Benefit. The agent applied the 8-week rule but failed to recognize that the specific circumstances described (child coming home every weekend with the parent maintaining responsibility during those times) may constitute an exception to the standard rules for children in local authority care.
