2026-01-29T14:48:41.581778 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T14:48:43.894454 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Bella. She's 16 years old and she's just started a training course to become a travel agent. A local travel agency has employed her and they're paying for the whole course.

2026-01-29T14:48:46.411744 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It sounds like Bella may qualify since she's under 20 and in training.

Next question: **Do you live in the UK, or are you a UK citizen working abroad for a UK employer or in the Crown service (such as the armed forces or civil service)?**

2026-01-29T14:48:47.974104 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T14:48:50.742500 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Next question: **Are you responsible for Bella? By this I mean, does she live with you, or do you pay at least the same amount as Child Benefit (or the equivalent in your country if you're abroad) towards looking after her?**

2026-01-29T14:48:52.233395 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for her. She lives with me.

2026-01-29T14:48:54.337205 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Is there anyone else who also has parental responsibility for Bella and lives with her? For example, a partner or spouse?**

2026-01-29T14:48:56.195175 [actor]: No, it's just me. Bella lives with me and I'm her mother. There's no one else living with us who has parental responsibility for her.

2026-01-29T14:48:57.924237 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: **Is Bella currently in hospital or in local authority care for more than 12 weeks?**

2026-01-29T14:48:59.604373 [actor]: No, she's not in hospital or in care. She lives at home with me.

2026-01-29T14:49:04.475812 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all those questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Bella) who is 16 years old and in approved training through her employer
✓ You live in the UK
✓ Bella lives with you and you're responsible for her
✓ She is not in hospital or local authority care for an extended period

Since Bella is under 20 and in approved education or training (her travel agent training course), she qualifies as an eligible child, and as the person responsible for her who she lives with, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit.

**Important note:** If you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which means you might have to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through your tax return. However, this doesn't affect your eligibility to claim it.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T14:49:07.725664 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T14:49:10.071153 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. Bella is employed and being paid by the travel agency for her training course, which means this is not "approved education or training" under Child Benefit rules - it is paid employment, making her ineligible even though she's under 20.
