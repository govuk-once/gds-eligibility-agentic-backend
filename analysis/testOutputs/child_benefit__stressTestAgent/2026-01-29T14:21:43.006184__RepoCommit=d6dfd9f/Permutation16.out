2026-01-29T14:34:15.315427 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T14:34:16.776012 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Oliver. He's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T14:34:19.120890 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: Is Oliver living with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T14:34:21.413927 [actor]: Well, that's a bit complicated at the moment. Oliver isn't living with me right now - he's actually in a hospital in the USA. He has a rare condition and had to go there specifically for specialist treatment about 15 weeks ago. I've stayed here in the UK, but I still pay for his incidental costs and visit him when I can.

2026-01-29T14:34:23.686043 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand this must be a difficult time for you and Oliver.

This situation does require careful consideration. Let me ask you: Before Oliver went to the hospital in the USA, was he normally living with you in the UK?

2026-01-29T14:34:25.936141 [actor]: Yes, he was living with me here in the UK before he had to go to the USA for his treatment. We're both UK residents - it's just that he had to go abroad specifically because of the specialist hospital treatment he needs for his condition.

2026-01-29T14:34:27.880285 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is helpful information.

Let me ask you another important question: Are you (or your partner if you have one) the person receiving Child Benefit for Oliver, or has someone else been claiming it?

2026-01-29T14:34:29.816100 [actor]: Yes, I'm the one who has been receiving Child Benefit for Oliver. It's just me - I'm his mum and I'm responsible for him.

2026-01-29T14:34:31.987836 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now, let me ask: Do you know approximately how long Oliver is expected to remain in the hospital in the USA for his treatment? Is there a planned timeframe for when he might return to the UK?

2026-01-29T14:34:34.837058 [actor]: I'm not entirely sure how long the treatment will take - it depends on how he responds to it. The doctors haven't given me a definite end date yet. It could be a while longer, but I'm hoping he'll be able to come home eventually once the treatment is complete. Right now, he's been there for 15 weeks already.

2026-01-29T14:34:37.960742 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. I understand the uncertainty must be challenging.

Let me ask one more important question: While Oliver is in the hospital in the USA, are you continuing to contribute to the costs of looking after him - for example, paying for things like his personal items, clothes, or other expenses beyond what the hospital provides?

2026-01-29T14:34:40.306421 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm still paying for his incidental costs - things like his personal items, clothes, toiletries, and other things he needs while he's there. Plus, I pay for my flights to visit him when I can. I'm still very much supporting him financially even though he's in the hospital abroad.

2026-01-29T14:34:46.828427 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me now assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on the rules for Child Benefit, you should remain eligible** in this situation. Here's why:

1. **Child in hospital**: You can continue to claim Child Benefit for a child who is temporarily in hospital, even if that hospital is abroad, as long as certain conditions are met.

2. **Your circumstances meet the key criteria**:
   - Oliver normally lived with you in the UK before going to hospital
   - You are still responsible for him
   - You continue to contribute to the costs of looking after him (his incidental expenses, personal items, etc.)
   - The hospitalization is temporary - he's there for specialist treatment with the intention of returning home

3. **Time limits**: Child Benefit can generally continue for up to 12 weeks while a child is in hospital. However, there are extensions available for longer hospital stays in certain circumstances, particularly when the child is abroad for specialist treatment.

**Important**: Given that Oliver has already been in hospital for 15 weeks (which is beyond the standard 12-week period), I would strongly recommend that you contact the Child Benefit Office directly to inform them of Oliver's situation if you haven't already done so. They can confirm that your benefit can continue and advise on any additional steps you may need to take.

Do you have any questions about this?

2026-01-29T14:34:49.349069 [actor]: Thank you so much for explaining that. That's a relief to hear. I hadn't realized there were special rules for when a child goes abroad specifically for hospital treatment. I'll make sure to contact the Child Benefit Office to keep them informed about Oliver's situation. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T14:34:53.569780 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that Child Benefit can continue beyond 12 weeks for hospital stays abroad "in certain circumstances, particularly when the child is abroad for specialist treatment," but according to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks if a child is in hospital, and there is no exception for specialist treatment abroad that extends this period beyond 12 weeks.
