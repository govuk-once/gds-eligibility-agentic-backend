2026-01-29T14:51:10.542050 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:51:13.184855 [actor]: Yes, I do. Nina is 10 years old and she's living with me now. She's my best friend's daughter - her mum is quite ill, so Nina has come to stay with me for the foreseeable future. It's just a private arrangement between us, you know, to help out during this difficult time.

2026-01-29T14:51:16.033233 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I'm sorry to hear about your friend's illness - it's very kind of you to help care for Nina.

To assess your eligibility, I need to understand the living arrangement a bit better. 

**Does Nina's mother still receive Child Benefit for her, or has she stopped claiming it since Nina came to live with you?**

2026-01-29T14:51:18.929479 [actor]: No, Nina's mother isn't claiming Child Benefit anymore. Since Nina came to live with me and I'm looking after her full-time now, her mum stopped claiming it. I'm the one providing for Nina - paying for everything she needs, her food, clothes, school things, everything really. Her mum just isn't well enough to look after her at the moment.

2026-01-29T14:51:21.462941 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's clear you're providing a lot of care and support for Nina.

Let me ask another important question: **Are you receiving any financial contribution from Nina's mother (or anyone else) towards Nina's care and upkeep?**

2026-01-29T14:51:24.419289 [actor]: No, I'm not receiving any money from Nina's mum - she's too ill to work at the moment and doesn't have the means to contribute financially. And the local council knows about the arrangement, but they're not paying me anything either - no fostering allowance or anything like that. It's just a private arrangement between me and Nina's mum to help out while she's unwell.

2026-01-29T14:51:26.947532 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail. That's helpful to understand.

Now, let me ask: **Are you currently living in the UK, and do you have the right to reside here (for example, are you a UK citizen, have settled status, or have another immigration status that gives you the right to live in the UK)?**

2026-01-29T14:51:28.677867 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK citizen and I've lived here all my life. Nina and I are both living here in the UK together.

2026-01-29T14:51:30.693199 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Just to make sure I have a complete picture: **Is Nina living with you full-time at your address, or does she regularly spend time living elsewhere (such as with her mother or another family member)?**

2026-01-29T14:51:33.357561 [actor]: She's living with me full-time at my address. She's been here for a while now and will be staying with me for the foreseeable future while her mum recovers. This is her home now - she's not going back and forth or spending time living elsewhere.

2026-01-29T14:51:35.654462 [root_agent]: Thank you for all that information. Let me ask one final question to complete the assessment:

**Do you have any other children living with you, and if so, are you currently claiming Child Benefit for them?**

2026-01-29T14:51:37.369155 [actor]: No, it's just Nina living with me. I don't have any other children, so I'm not claiming Child Benefit for anyone else.

2026-01-29T14:51:42.158554 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions so thoroughly.

**Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Nina.**

Here's why:

✓ Nina is under 16 (she's 10 years old)
✓ She's living with you full-time and you're responsible for her
✓ You're paying for her upkeep and care without receiving financial contributions from anyone else
✓ Nina's mother has stopped claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ You're a UK citizen living in the UK
✓ The local council is aware but this is a private arrangement (not a formal fostering arrangement with payments)

When a child lives with someone other than their parent under a private arrangement, the person who is responsible for the child and meets the eligibility criteria can claim Child Benefit - which appears to be your situation.

**You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for Nina.** You can make your claim online or by post using the Child Benefit claim form.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-29T14:51:44.669895 [actor]: Oh, that's wonderful news! Thank you so much for explaining all of that. It will really help with Nina's expenses. I think I have all the information I need now - I'll go ahead and apply for it. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T14:51:49.149418 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit for Nina, correctly applying the rules that allow someone other than a parent to claim when they have a child living with them full-time under a private arrangement, are responsible for the child's care, are not receiving financial contributions, and the parent has stopped claiming.
