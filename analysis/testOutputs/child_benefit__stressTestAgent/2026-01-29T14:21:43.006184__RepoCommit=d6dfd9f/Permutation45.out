2026-01-29T14:56:45.504762 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T14:56:47.132409 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, she's 8 years old.

2026-01-29T14:56:48.878806 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Do you live with your daughter, or does she live with someone else?

2026-01-29T14:56:50.936438 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated at the moment. She's been in the hospital for about 14 weeks now. I visit her every single day and spend hours with her to keep her company, but she's staying in the hospital.

2026-01-29T14:56:53.256262 [root_agent]: I understand that must be a difficult time for you and your daughter.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to ask: Before your daughter went into hospital, did she normally live with you?

2026-01-29T14:56:55.101312 [actor]: Yes, she normally lives with me. She's been in the hospital for these 14 weeks, but before that she lived with me at home.

2026-01-29T14:56:57.529493 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is helpful information.

Now, are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your daughter, or would this be a new claim?

2026-01-29T14:56:59.447117 [actor]: I'm currently receiving it, but I'm worried because she's been in hospital for so long now. That's why I'm checking if I'm still eligible.

2026-01-29T14:57:01.837496 [root_agent]: I understand your concern. Let me ask another important question to help clarify your situation.

Is your daughter receiving free NHS hospital treatment, or is the hospital care being paid for privately or by a local authority?

2026-01-29T14:57:03.210960 [actor]: It's free NHS hospital treatment.

2026-01-29T14:57:06.007456 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I have one more question to help complete the assessment:

Are you contributing at least the same amount towards your daughter's upkeep (maintenance) as the Child Benefit you're receiving, or more? This could include things like buying her clothes, toys, books, or other items she needs, or any other costs you're covering for her care.

2026-01-29T14:57:08.411866 [actor]: No, I'm not spending money on those things. The hospital provides everything she needs - her food, clothes, everything. I just visit her every day and spend time with her, but I'm not actually buying anything for her.

2026-01-29T14:57:13.726988 [root_agent]: Thank you for being honest about your situation. Based on the information you've provided, I need to give you some important guidance.

**Unfortunately, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit in your current circumstances.**

Here's why: When a child is in hospital receiving free NHS treatment for more than 12 weeks (84 days), Child Benefit can only continue if the parent is contributing at least as much towards the child's maintenance as the Child Benefit payment they receive.

Since your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks and you've told me you're not spending money on her upkeep (as the hospital is providing everything), you would not meet this requirement.

**What you need to do:**

You should contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them of your daughter's situation as soon as possible. It's important to let them know that your daughter has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks receiving free NHS treatment.

I'm very sorry about your daughter's situation, and I hope she recovers soon. When she returns home to live with you, you would become eligible for Child Benefit again.

Do you have any questions about this?

2026-01-29T14:57:15.538250 [actor]: No, I understand. Thank you for explaining that to me. I'll contact the Child Benefit Office right away.

2026-01-29T14:57:20.270122 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately applied the rule that when a child is in hospital receiving free NHS treatment for more than 12 weeks, Child Benefit can only continue if the parent contributes at least as much towards the child's maintenance as the Child Benefit amount, and correctly concluded I was not eligible since I was not making such contributions.
