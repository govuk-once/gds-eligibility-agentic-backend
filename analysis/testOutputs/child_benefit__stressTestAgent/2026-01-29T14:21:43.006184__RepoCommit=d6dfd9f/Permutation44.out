2026-01-29T14:56:21.895760 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T14:56:23.558273 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. My son Leo is 12 years old.

2026-01-29T14:56:26.109209 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Now I need to ask:

**Are you responsible for Leo? This means do you live with him and are you responsible for looking after him (paying for things like food, clothes, and other costs)?**

2026-01-29T14:56:28.442343 [actor]: Well, it's a bit complicated. Leo is actually in local authority care, but he comes home to visit me every week. He comes home on Saturdays at 10 in the morning and goes back to the care home on Sundays at 11 in the morning.

2026-01-29T14:56:30.632391 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that situation. This is indeed an important detail.

Let me ask a follow-up question to understand Leo's care arrangement better:

**Does the local authority provide any financial support or allowance for Leo while he is in their care during the week?**

2026-01-29T14:56:32.359452 [actor]: Yes, the local authority provides for him while he's in their care during the week. They cover his costs there at the care home.

2026-01-29T14:56:36.571795 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to inform you about your eligibility:

**Unfortunately, you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Leo in this situation.**

Here's why: When a child is being looked after by a local authority (which Leo is during the week), Child Benefit cannot be paid for that child, even if they visit you regularly. The fact that the local authority is providing financial support for Leo and he is in their care means that Child Benefit is not available.

The weekly visits Leo makes to you are wonderful for maintaining your relationship, but they don't change the fact that he is primarily in local authority care, which makes him ineligible for Child Benefit claims.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T14:56:43.535927 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance on child benefit for children in care, a parent may still be entitled to Child Benefit if the child is in care but comes home regularly, and the visits are substantial enough that the parent is still considered responsible for the child during those periods. The agent failed to properly assess whether the regular weekly visits (approximately 25 hours per week) might qualify under the exception for children who visit home regularly.
