2026-01-29T14:45:17.659094 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or young person under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:45:19.279437 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Zahid, he's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T14:45:21.751576 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Does Zahid normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T14:45:23.504669 [actor]: No, he doesn't live with me. He lives with his aunt.

2026-01-29T14:45:25.897680 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that Zahid lives with his aunt.

**Do you contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate towards the cost of looking after Zahid?**

(The current Child Benefit rate is £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child, and £16.95 per week for each additional child.)

2026-01-29T14:45:28.044885 [actor]: Well, I send £15 a week to his aunt for Zahid. But his grandmother - that's my mother - also sends £15 a week to the aunt for him. So together that's £30 a week.

2026-01-29T14:45:30.516072 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. Let me make sure I understand this correctly.

**Are you and your mother (Zahid's grandmother) contributing together as a household, or are these separate individual contributions you're each making independently?**

In other words, do you live with your mother, or do you live separately from her?

2026-01-29T14:45:32.409635 [actor]: We live separately. These are separate contributions - I send £15 from my household, and my mother sends £15 from hers.

2026-01-29T14:45:35.883155 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you've told me, I need to consider the eligibility rules carefully. Since you and your mother are making separate, independent contributions from different households, and you're contributing £15 per week while the Child Benefit rate for one child is £25.60 per week, you are not currently contributing at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate on your own.

However, let me ask another important question:

**Does anyone else currently claim Child Benefit for Zahid - such as his aunt who he lives with, or your mother?**

2026-01-29T14:45:37.818062 [actor]: No, his aunt doesn't claim Child Benefit for him, and neither does my mother.

2026-01-29T14:45:40.102953 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Let me ask you another important question to assess your eligibility:

**Are you the person who has the main responsibility for Zahid's day-to-day care and upbringing, even though he doesn't live with you?**

In other words, are you the main person making decisions about his welfare, education, and general care?

2026-01-29T14:45:42.408921 [actor]: Well, his aunt is the one looking after him day-to-day since he lives with her. I help out financially by sending money each week, but she's the one making the daily decisions about his care.

2026-01-29T14:45:46.720115 [root_agent]: Thank you for being clear about the situation.

Based on what you've told me, I need to assess your eligibility carefully:

**From what you've described:**
- Zahid lives with his aunt
- His aunt has the main day-to-day responsibility for his care and makes decisions about his welfare
- You contribute £15 per week towards his costs

**Regarding eligibility:**

For someone to claim Child Benefit when a child doesn't live with them, they need to contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate (currently £25.60 per week for one child) towards the child's upbringing.

Since you're contributing £15 per week, which is less than the £25.60 threshold, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Zahid** under these circumstances.

The person most likely to be eligible would be Zahid's aunt, as she is the one he lives with and who has main responsibility for his day-to-day care.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T14:45:52.812906 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to the guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, when a child doesn't live with you, you can claim Child Benefit if you contribute at least the Child Benefit rate towards the cost of looking after them. The scenario shows I contribute £15 and my mother contributes £15 (totaling £30), which exceeds the £25.60 threshold, making me eligible as the expected outcome states "Eligible."
