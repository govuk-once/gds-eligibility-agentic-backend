2026-01-29T14:23:08.943116 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T14:23:11.303824 [actor]: Hello, yes, I have a son. He's 17 years old. He left school back in June, and he's not in college or anything like that right now. He's registered with the local youth careers service though, and he's actively looking for an apprenticeship. It's August now, so it's been a couple of months since he left school.

2026-01-29T14:23:14.758661 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you a clarifying question about your son's current situation:

**Is your 17-year-old son enrolled in any approved education or training programme, or has he been accepted onto one that will start soon?**

(I'm asking because "approved education or training" is a key requirement for Child Benefit eligibility for young people aged 16-19. Simply being registered with a careers service and looking for an apprenticeship, unfortunately, may not meet the criteria - but I need to understand his exact situation to give you an accurate assessment.)

2026-01-29T14:23:17.699356 [actor]: No, he's not enrolled in any education or training programme at the moment. He hasn't been accepted onto anything that's starting soon either. He's just registered with the careers service and actively looking for opportunities - you know, searching for apprenticeships and that sort of thing. He's really keen to find something, but nothing has come through yet.

2026-01-29T14:23:22.754522 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you've told me, I need to let you know that **your son would not currently meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit**.

Here's why: For young people aged 16-19, Child Benefit can only continue if they are **enrolled in approved education or training**. This means they must be actively participating in a course or programme, not just registered with a careers service or looking for opportunities.

However, there's an important point to be aware of:

**When does the Child Benefit actually stop?**

If your son left approved education or training in June, Child Benefit would typically continue until the end of August (the 31st of August) following the date he left education. Since it's currently August, your entitlement may be coming to an end very soon.

If your son does find and start an apprenticeship or approved training programme, you may be able to claim Child Benefit again at that point.

Do you have any questions about this, or is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T14:23:26.107875 [actor]: Oh, I see. So you're saying because he's not actually in education or training right now, I'm not eligible? Even though he's registered with the careers service and actively looking? That seems a bit harsh - he's only 17 and he's doing everything he's supposed to be doing to find something. 

But if you're saying it stops at the end of August anyway, then I suppose that's that. I just wanted to make sure I understood the rules properly. Thanks for explaining it to me.

2026-01-29T14:23:30.335054 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to the rules, young people leaving education in June are covered until the end of August, which means I should be eligible for up to 20 weeks (June through August), but the agent told me I'm "not currently eligible" rather than confirming I remain eligible until August 31st.
