2026-01-29T14:49:12.150298 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T14:49:13.656657 [actor]: Yes, I have a son. He's 15 years old.

2026-01-29T14:49:15.524203 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Are you responsible for your son? This means do you live with him and are you the main person looking after him (providing food, clothing, and generally caring for him)?**

2026-01-29T14:49:17.428002 [actor]: Well, no, he's not living with me at the moment. He's been in a youth custody center for the past 10 weeks. He was sentenced to 6 months there.

2026-01-29T14:49:19.421581 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. This is an important detail for determining eligibility.

Next question: **Before your son went into the youth custody center, were you the person responsible for him - meaning did he live with you and were you his main carer?**

2026-01-29T14:49:21.331848 [actor]: Yes, I was. I've been claiming Child Benefit for him before all this happened. I'm his mum and he lived with me until he was sentenced.

2026-01-29T14:49:23.677629 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. This is helpful information.

Next question: **Are you continuing to contribute to your son's maintenance while he is in the youth custody center? For example, are you regularly visiting him, sending him money, clothes, or otherwise supporting him?**

2026-01-29T14:49:25.806022 [actor]: Yes, I am. I visit him regularly and send him money and clothes. I'm still supporting him as much as I can while he's in there.

2026-01-29T14:49:31.156088 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, let me give you some important guidance about your Child Benefit eligibility.

**Good news: You should still be eligible for Child Benefit for your son.**

Here's why:

- You were responsible for your son before he went into the youth custody center
- You are continuing to contribute to his maintenance while he's there by visiting regularly and sending money and clothes
- He has been in custody for 10 weeks and is sentenced to 6 months total

**Important point:** You can continue to receive Child Benefit for a child in custody for up to **12 weeks**, as long as you continue to contribute to their maintenance (which you are doing).

However, since your son has already been in custody for 10 weeks and has a 6-month sentence, you need to be aware that **after 12 weeks in custody, your Child Benefit will stop** - even if you continue to support him.

**What you should do:** Make sure HMRC is aware of your son's situation. If his circumstances change (for example, if he's released earlier), you should inform them so your Child Benefit can continue or restart as appropriate.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T14:49:34.263205 [actor]: Oh, that's a relief to hear! So I can keep receiving it for another couple of weeks then. I wasn't sure what would happen. 

Just to be clear - after the 12 weeks are up, it will stop automatically? Or do I need to tell HMRC about his custody myself? I want to make sure I do everything properly and don't end up owing them money back.

2026-01-29T14:49:40.074505 [root_agent]: That's a very responsible question, and it's good that you want to make sure everything is handled properly.

**You should inform HMRC about your son's custody yourself.** Here's why this is important:

- Child Benefit may not stop automatically after 12 weeks unless HMRC is aware of the situation
- If you continue receiving payments beyond the 12-week period without informing them, you could be overpaid and would have to pay the money back
- Reporting changes in circumstances is your responsibility as the claimant

**What you should do:**

1. **Contact HMRC Child Benefit Office as soon as possible** to inform them that your son is in a youth custody center, when he went in, and how long his sentence is
2. They will note this on your claim and ensure payments stop at the correct time (after 12 weeks)
3. Also inform them if his circumstances change - for example, if he's released early, so they can restart your payments

By being proactive and informing them now, you'll avoid any risk of overpayment and ensure everything is handled correctly.

**One more question to ensure I've covered everything: Do you receive Child Benefit for any other children, or is it just for your 15-year-old son?**

2026-01-29T14:49:42.144368 [actor]: No, it's just for him. He's my only child.

Thank you so much for explaining all of this. I'll contact HMRC right away to let them know about his situation. I really appreciate your help with this.

2026-01-29T14:49:45.789435 [root_agent]: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify the situation for you.

To summarize what we've covered:

✓ You are currently eligible for Child Benefit for your son
✓ You can continue receiving it for up to 12 weeks while he's in custody (so about 2 more weeks)
✓ You should contact HMRC Child Benefit Office now to inform them of his custody
✓ Remember to update them if his circumstances change (like early release)

You're doing the right thing by contacting HMRC promptly - this will ensure everything is handled properly and you won't have any issues with overpayments.

If you have any other questions about Child Benefit in the future, feel free to ask. Best wishes to you and your son.
