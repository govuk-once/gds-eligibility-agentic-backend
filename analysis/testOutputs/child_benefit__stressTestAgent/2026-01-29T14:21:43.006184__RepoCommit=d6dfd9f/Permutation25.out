2026-01-29T14:44:35.898895 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or young person that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T14:44:37.598451 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Leo, he's 5 years old.

2026-01-29T14:44:39.121619 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**Does Leo normally live with you, or does he live with someone else?**

2026-01-29T14:44:40.860771 [actor]: He doesn't live with me at the moment. He's been in local authority care for about 10 weeks now.

2026-01-29T14:44:43.581228 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that. I understand Leo is currently in local authority care.

**Is Leo expected to be in local authority care for more than 8 weeks in total, or is this a temporary arrangement that will be less than 8 weeks?**

(I ask because this affects eligibility for Child Benefit while a child is in care.)

2026-01-29T14:44:45.179840 [actor]: It's been 10 weeks already, so yes, it's been more than 8 weeks.

2026-01-29T14:44:48.139148 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

**Are you still contributing at least the same amount as the Child Benefit you would receive towards Leo's upkeep while he's in care?**

(This is important because if a child is in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, you can still claim Child Benefit if you're contributing to their costs.)

2026-01-29T14:44:50.252538 [actor]: I don't have any income myself, so I can't contribute anything. But my husband - Leo's stepfather - he sends £30 a week to the carer for Leo's upkeep. Does that count?

2026-01-29T14:44:52.432247 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Before I can properly assess this, I need to clarify: Are you and your husband living together in the same household, or are you living separately?**

(This is important because it affects whether your husband's contributions can count towards your eligibility.)

2026-01-29T14:44:53.867642 [actor]: Yes, we're living together in the same household.

2026-01-29T14:44:56.467353 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

**Is your husband contributing at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate (which is currently £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child), or more?**

Just to confirm - you mentioned he sends £30 a week, which would meet this threshold. Is he consistently making this contribution to Leo's upkeep?

2026-01-29T14:44:58.290732 [actor]: Yes, that's right - he sends £30 every week consistently to the carer for Leo's upkeep.

2026-01-29T14:45:02.694429 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Based on the information you've provided, you should be eligible for Child Benefit** for Leo, even though he's in local authority care.

Here's why:

- Leo is your child and is under 16
- Although he's been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks (which would normally stop Child Benefit), you can still claim if you or your partner are contributing at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate towards his upkeep
- Your husband is contributing £30 per week, which is more than the Child Benefit rate of £25.60 per week for an eldest or only child
- Since you and your husband live together in the same household, his contributions count for your claim

**One final question to complete the assessment: Are you (or your husband) currently responsible for Leo, meaning you have parental responsibility or have been appointed as his guardian?**

2026-01-29T14:45:04.533650 [actor]: Yes, I'm his mother, so I have parental responsibility for Leo.

2026-01-29T14:45:09.276280 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

**Based on all the information you've provided, you are eligible for Child Benefit for Leo.**

Here's a summary of why you qualify:

✓ You are Leo's mother with parental responsibility
✓ Leo is 5 years old (under 16)
✓ Although Leo has been in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, your household is contributing £30 per week towards his upkeep
✓ This contribution (£30/week) meets or exceeds the Child Benefit rate (£25.60/week for the eldest or only child)
✓ You and your husband live together, so his contributions count towards your eligibility

You should be able to claim Child Benefit. If you haven't already claimed, you can make a claim, and if you're already claiming but it was stopped when Leo went into care, you may be able to have it reinstated.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T14:45:11.081554 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T14:45:15.287372 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the claimant is eligible for Child Benefit because their household contributes £30 per week (exceeding the £25.60 threshold) towards the child's upkeep while in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, which aligns with the rules stated at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care.
