2026-01-29T14:36:46.956995 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T14:36:48.843287 [actor]: Yes, I do. I'm looking after my granddaughter Lucia - she's 14 years old and lives with me.

2026-01-29T14:36:51.297573 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Are you responsible for Lucia? This means do you provide for her care and upbringing on a day-to-day basis - for example, do you make decisions about her welfare, provide her with food, clothing, and a place to live?**

2026-01-29T14:36:53.699094 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Lucia lives with me full-time and I pay for everything - her food, clothes, school things, everything she needs. Her parents aren't able to care for her and they don't help out financially at all. I'm the one making all the decisions about her welfare and looking after her day to day.

2026-01-29T14:36:55.763239 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail. That's helpful information.

Next question: **Do you normally live in the UK? This means the UK is your permanent home where you usually reside.**

2026-01-29T14:36:57.542710 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. This is my home.

2026-01-29T14:36:59.727435 [root_agent]: Thank you. I have a few more questions to fully assess your eligibility.

Next question: **Are you or Lucia subject to immigration control? For example, do either of you have any restrictions on your visa or immigration status that would prevent you from claiming public funds?**

2026-01-29T14:37:01.272258 [actor]: No, we're not subject to immigration control. There are no restrictions on claiming public funds.

2026-01-29T14:37:03.280432 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Next question: **Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucia, or has anyone else claimed it for her in the past that might still be active?**

2026-01-29T14:37:05.064745 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for Lucia. Her parents aren't claiming it - they're not involved in her care at all.

2026-01-29T14:37:07.727868 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: **Does Lucia live with you full-time, or does she spend any time living with someone else (such as her parents or another family member)?**

2026-01-29T14:37:09.484714 [actor]: She lives with me full-time. She doesn't live with her parents or anyone else - it's just been the two of us since she came to stay with me.

2026-01-29T14:37:13.394035 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your granddaughter Lucia.

Here's why:

✓ You have a child (Lucia) under 16 living with you
✓ You are responsible for her - you provide for her day-to-day care and upbringing
✓ You normally live in the UK
✓ Neither you nor Lucia are subject to immigration control
✓ Nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ She lives with you full-time

As Lucia's primary caregiver, you meet the criteria for claiming Child Benefit even though you're her grandparent rather than her parent. The key factors are that you're responsible for her care and she lives with you.

**You can proceed with making a claim for Child Benefit.** You would need to apply and provide Lucia's birth certificate as part of the application process.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-29T14:37:17.586699 [actor]: That's wonderful news, thank you so much! It's a relief to know I can get some help with the costs of raising Lucia. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything clearly. I'll go ahead and apply for the Child Benefit.

2026-01-29T14:37:19.855847 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the grandmother is eligible for Child Benefit as she has responsibility for her 14-year-old granddaughter who lives with her full-time, they both live in the UK without immigration restrictions, and no one else is claiming the benefit.
