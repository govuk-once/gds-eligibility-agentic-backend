2026-01-29T14:34:55.600952 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask: **Are you responsible for raising a child under 16, or a child under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T14:34:57.495936 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have two children, aged 8 and 10.

2026-01-29T14:34:59.173502 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now, let me ask: **Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-29T14:35:01.107287 [actor]: No, I don't currently live in the UK. I'm stationed in Germany with the British Armed Forces - I'm posted here on the base with my wife and children.

2026-01-29T14:35:03.318017 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Since you're serving in the British Armed Forces and are stationed abroad, this is an important detail for eligibility.

Let me ask: **Is your posting in Germany a Crown service posting (meaning you're working for the UK government abroad as part of the Armed Forces)?**

2026-01-29T14:35:05.173345 [actor]: Yes, that's correct. I'm a Major in the British Armed Forces, so this is a Crown service posting. I'm here on official duty with the military.

2026-01-29T14:35:09.919891 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You're responsible for raising two children (aged 8 and 10) who are under 16
✓ Although you don't currently live in the UK, you're working abroad for the Crown (British Armed Forces on a Crown service posting)
✓ People working for the UK government abroad in Crown service are treated as if they live in the UK for Child Benefit purposes

You meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit for both of your children.

**Important note:** If you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 a year, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which gradually reduces the benefit. If either of you earns £60,000 or more, the charge equals the full amount of Child Benefit received.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit eligibility?

2026-01-29T14:35:13.748832 [actor]: No, that's very helpful, thank you. I understand that I'm eligible and I appreciate the information about the high income charge as well. That's all I needed to know.

2026-01-29T14:35:16.275911 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that a member of the British Armed Forces on a Crown service posting abroad is treated as living in the UK for Child Benefit purposes, correctly assessed all eligibility criteria, and provided accurate additional information about the High Income Child Benefit Charge.
