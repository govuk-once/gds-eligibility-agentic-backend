2026-01-29T14:46:52.961650 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T14:46:54.982463 [actor]: I'm asking about my son, Jordan. He's 17 and lives with me. He finished his GCSEs last year but he's not in college or anything like that right now.

2026-01-29T14:46:57.682041 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about Jordan.

Since Jordan is 17 and not currently in education or training, this affects his eligibility. Let me ask you:

**Is Jordan registered with a careers service or with Connexions (or similar service in your area), or is he enrolled to start approved education or training soon?**

2026-01-29T14:47:00.617726 [actor]: No, he's not registered with any careers service or anything like that. He's just been at home, not really doing much to be honest.

2026-01-29T14:47:04.864766 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on what you've told me, **Jordan would not meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit** because:

- He is over 16 (he's 17)
- He is not in approved education or training
- He is not registered with a careers service or enrolled to start approved education or training

Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 (turning 20), but only if they are in approved education or training. Since Jordan finished his GCSEs and is not currently enrolled in any further education, training, or registered with careers services, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit for him.

**However**, if Jordan decides to go back into education or training in the future (such as college, A-levels, vocational training, or an apprenticeship), you may be able to claim Child Benefit again at that point.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or Jordan's situation?

2026-01-29T14:47:10.525631 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the claimant is not eligible for Child Benefit because Jordan is 17, not in approved education or training, and not registered with careers services, which aligns with the eligibility requirements that Child Benefit only continues for 16-19 year olds if they are in approved education or training.
