2026-01-16T10:53:05.233998 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T10:53:06.776336 [actor]: I need to role-play as a user seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll follow the provided scenario about Mike who lives apart from his daughter Emma.

45 year old father need benefit for daughter

2026-01-16T10:53:08.065491 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you're role-playing as a 45-year-old father seeking benefit for your daughter.

To clarify, you are the father and are 45 years old. Now, how old is your daughter, Emma?

2026-01-16T10:53:09.465824 [actor]: daughter is 12

2026-01-16T10:53:10.577433 [root_agent]: Thank you. So, your daughter Emma is 12 years old.

Next question: Does Emma live with you for the majority of the time? Or does she live with someone else, such as her mother?

2026-01-16T10:53:11.419846 [actor]: lives with mother not me

2026-01-16T10:53:12.723116 [root_agent]: Okay, so Emma lives with her mother and not with you.

To confirm, do you have legal responsibility for Emma, despite her living with her mother? For example, do you have a court order stating you have parental responsibility, or are you named on her birth certificate?

2026-01-16T10:53:13.470675 [actor]: named on birth certificate

2026-01-16T10:53:14.618326 [root_agent]: Okay, you are named on Emma’s birth certificate. That's good to know.

Do you contribute financially towards Emma's upbringing? (e.g., do you regularly pay for things like clothes, food, or activities?)

2026-01-16T10:53:15.433399 [actor]: birthday present give money for food

2026-01-16T10:53:16.969575 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It sounds like you do provide some financial support.

Now, is there a formal, written agreement (like a Direct Debit or standing order) outlining regular financial contributions to Emma's mother for her upkeep? Or is it more occasional, like the birthday and food money you mentioned?

2026-01-16T10:53:17.977884 [actor]: send 10 pounds every week

2026-01-16T10:53:18.868896 [root_agent]: Okay, so you send £10 per week. That establishes a regular financial contribution.

Finally, does Emma's mother also claim Child Benefit for Emma?

2026-01-16T10:53:19.601236 [actor]: mother no claim benefit

2026-01-16T10:53:23.490078 [root_agent]: Okay, so Emma's mother does *not* currently claim Child Benefit.

Based on the information you've provided:

*   You are the father, aged 45.
*   Emma is your daughter and is 12 years old.
*   Emma lives with her mother.
*   You are named on Emma's birth certificate.
*   You contribute financially with £10 per week.
*   Emma's mother does not claim Child Benefit.

According to the guidance, you *may* be eligible to claim Child Benefit in your own right, as you have parental responsibility (being named on the birth certificate) and are contributing financially, and the mother isn't already claiming. However, HMRC will ultimately assess whether your contributions meet their criteria for qualifying as supporting the child financially. 

Would you like me to summarise the key points for you, or would you like to explore other potential scenarios?





2026-01-16T10:53:24.900208 [actor]: I'm afraid you wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit. 

2026-01-16T10:53:27.910917 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent made an error by concluding I wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit when in fact I should be eligible. As I am named on the birth certificate (have parental responsibility), contribute financially (£10 weekly), and the mother doesn't claim the benefit, I meet the eligibility criteria for a non-resident parent.
