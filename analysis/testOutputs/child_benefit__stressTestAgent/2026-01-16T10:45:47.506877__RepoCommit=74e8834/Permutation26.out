2026-01-16T10:59:09.322681 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T10:59:10.665064 [actor]: I'll role-play as a person inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

Child benefit eligibility check son money aunt

2026-01-16T10:59:11.950194 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. So you are inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility *as* someone who is an aunt, and potentially claiming for their nephew. 

To start, is the child you are inquiring about under 20 years old?

2026-01-16T10:59:13.189749 [actor]: I'll continue in the role of someone inquiring about Child Benefit.

Son Zahid 15 years old

2026-01-16T10:59:14.432925 [root_agent]: Thank you. So the child, Zahid, is 15 years old. That satisfies the age requirement.

Now, to clarify Zahid’s living situation - does Zahid live with you for the majority of the time?

2026-01-16T10:59:15.426730 [actor]: Living with aunt not me

2026-01-16T10:59:16.819230 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Zahid lives with his aunt, not you.

To help me understand the situation better, are *you* responsible for Zahid’s care? (Even if he lives with his aunt, you might be eligible if you're primarily responsible for him).

2026-01-16T10:59:17.762633 [actor]: Sending money weekly fifteen pounds

2026-01-16T10:59:19.180863 [root_agent]: Okay, so you provide £15 weekly to support Zahid. 

To clarify, does Zahid’s aunt receive any benefits in her own right, such as Universal Credit or Child Tax Credit? Knowing this will help me understand if a claim from you would affect her benefits.

2026-01-16T10:59:19.947699 [actor]: Aunt doesn't claim benefits

2026-01-16T10:59:21.616438 [root_agent]: That's good to know – the aunt doesn't claim benefits.

Now, considering Zahid lives with his aunt and you contribute financially, are you the main person responsible for his care? This means things like making sure he goes to school, arranging medical appointments, and generally overseeing his upbringing. It's important even if the aunt is also involved in his care.

2026-01-16T10:59:22.762607 [actor]: Send money mother sends money too fifteen pounds each

2026-01-16T10:59:24.139133 [root_agent]: Thank you. So both you and Zahid’s mother each contribute £15 per week.

To be clear, is Zahid's mother also *not* claiming any benefits? Knowing this will help determine if either of you could potentially claim Child Benefit.

2026-01-16T10:59:25.056919 [actor]: Grandmother sends money not mother me father

2026-01-16T10:59:27.818717 [root_agent]: My apologies for the confusion, let's clarify. You are the father, and Zahid's grandmother sends money, not his mother.

To confirm, you are sending £15 a week to support Zahid, and his grandmother also contributes financially. Zahid lives with his aunt.

Given this information, and that Zahid is under 20, the key question is: are you (the father) the primary carer for Zahid, even though he lives with his aunt? If not, it's unlikely you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit. Could you please confirm who has day-to-day care and responsibility for Zahid?

2026-01-16T10:59:28.753274 [actor]: Aunt takes care money for needs

2026-01-16T10:59:31.638437 [root_agent]: Okay, so the aunt provides the day-to-day care and uses the money you and his grandmother provide to meet Zahid’s needs.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it appears you are *not* eligible to claim Child Benefit. This is because Zahid lives with his aunt, and she is the one providing his primary care - even though you and his grandmother contribute financially. Child Benefit is usually paid to the person with main responsibility for the child.

However, it’s important to note that the aunt may be eligible to claim. Would you like me to explore the aunt's potential eligibility, or is that something she needs to investigate herself?

2026-01-16T10:59:35.340148 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly explained that the father is not eligible for Child Benefit since the child lives with the aunt who provides day-to-day care, even though the father contributes financially.
