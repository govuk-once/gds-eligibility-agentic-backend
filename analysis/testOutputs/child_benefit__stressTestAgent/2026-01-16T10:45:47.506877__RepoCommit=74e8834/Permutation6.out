2026-01-16T10:47:53.988317 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are? (This helps determine if *you* are the parent or guardian claiming for a child).

2026-01-16T10:47:55.748153 [actor]: I'll play the role of a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility, following the character traits from the scenario.

child benefit daughter hospital long time

2026-01-16T10:47:57.144050 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It sounds like your daughter is currently in hospital for a long time. 

To clarify, is your daughter under 20 years old? (This is a key part of the eligibility criteria, and being in hospital can affect things).

2026-01-16T10:47:58.118794 [actor]: daughter 6 years old hospital 14 weeks visit every day

2026-01-16T10:47:59.758295 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's good to know she's 6 years old and you visit her every day.

Now, to confirm, are you the child’s parent or do you have legal care and responsibility for her? (This is to establish if you are eligible to claim *for* her).

2026-01-16T10:48:00.555660 [actor]: I am her mother Mary

2026-01-16T10:48:02.057889 [root_agent]: Thank you, Mary. It's good to know you are her mother.

Are you working over 16 hours a week on average? (This relates to the earnings rules for Child Benefit). It's okay if this includes paid and unpaid work, like self-employment or volunteering.

2026-01-16T10:48:03.707734 [actor]: part time cashier 3 days weekly

2026-01-16T10:48:04.980195 [root_agent]: Okay, working part-time as a cashier for 3 days a week is helpful to know.

Roughly, what is your annual income from work? (Just an estimate is fine, as there are income thresholds for Child Benefit).

2026-01-16T10:48:05.736580 [actor]: £14000 yearly

2026-01-16T10:48:07.031450 [root_agent]: Thank you, £14,000 yearly is good to know.

To confirm, are you, or your partner (if you have one), claiming any other benefits? (This is to check for any potential overlaps or impacts on your Child Benefit eligibility).

2026-01-16T10:48:07.828145 [actor]: no benefits single parent

2026-01-16T10:48:11.106119 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are a single parent and not currently claiming any other benefits.

Based on the information you've provided – your daughter is 6 years old, she's been in hospital for 14 weeks, you are her mother, you work part-time earning £14,000 a year, and you are a single parent not claiming other benefits – it appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit.

However, because your daughter is in hospital for a long period, the rules are slightly different. As long as she continues to be under 20, and was living with you before going into hospital, you should be able to continue claiming.

Would you like me to summarise this, or perhaps clarify anything further?





2026-01-16T10:48:12.458604 [actor]: Normally, I would be eligible but hospital 14 weeks. I buy her pyjamas and books spend £30 weekly visit daily

2026-01-16T10:48:15.400592 [root_agent]: Thank you for adding that detail, Mary. It’s good to know you are actively involved in her care and contribute to her needs while she's in hospital.

You are right to highlight the hospital stay. The fact that you are still providing for her needs – buying pyjamas, books, visiting daily, and spending £30 a week – all demonstrate that you are still financially supporting her, even while she’s in hospital. This is important!

As long as she was living with you before being admitted, and remains under 20, your eligibility for Child Benefit is *not* affected by her hospital stay. Your continued financial support confirms this. 

Does that clarify things for you?

2026-01-16T10:48:16.315171 [actor]: Yes eligible for child benefit still?

2026-01-16T10:48:18.068265 [root_agent]: Yes, Mary, based on everything you've told me, you are still eligible for Child Benefit. Her hospital stay doesn't change that, as you continue to provide for her financially and were her primary caregiver before she went into hospital.

I'm glad we were able to confirm this for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-16T10:48:21.449362 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that a child's hospital stay doesn't affect Child Benefit eligibility when the parent continues to provide support and care.
