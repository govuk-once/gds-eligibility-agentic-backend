2026-01-16T11:10:55.639137 [root_agent]: Hello! I'm happy to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old *you* are? (This helps determine if you are the parent or guardian claiming for a child, as the rules apply to the person claiming, not the child).

2026-01-16T11:10:57.184884 [actor]: I'll help by playing the role of a user seeking information about child benefit eligibility.

daughter hospital money

2026-01-16T11:10:58.669984 [root_agent]: Thank you for the extra information. It sounds like your daughter is currently in hospital.

To clarify, are *you* the parent or legal guardian of this daughter who is in hospital? Knowing this will help me understand if you are the one who would be eligible to claim.

2026-01-16T11:11:00.219754 [actor]: yes daughter mine hospital long time now 8 years old her

2026-01-16T11:11:02.241583 [root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that she is your daughter. It's good to know she is 8 years old too.

Given that your daughter has been in hospital for a long time, I need to understand her living arrangements a little better. Generally, Child Benefit is paid if a child lives with you. Does your daughter *usually* live with you, or has she been living in hospital for the majority of the last 12 months?





2026-01-16T11:11:03.225134 [actor]: daughter in hospital 14 weeks now visit everyday but live with me before this

2026-01-16T11:11:05.078793 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So, your daughter lived with you before going into hospital 14 weeks ago, and you visit her daily. That's helpful.

Now, to confirm, are you currently employed or self-employed and earning under £50,000 per year? This is because Child Benefit can be affected by your income.

2026-01-16T11:11:06.155802 [actor]: nurse job money not much definitely below that amount

2026-01-16T11:11:07.636568 [root_agent]: That's good to know – being a nurse and earning below £50,000 means your income shouldn't affect your eligibility based on that criteria.

Just to be certain, and as your daughter is in hospital, does anyone else receive Child Benefit for her? For example, does the other parent claim?

2026-01-16T11:11:08.566888 [actor]: no other claims just me

2026-01-16T11:11:09.625321 [root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. So, no one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for your daughter.

Finally, are you a UK resident? (This means you live in the UK for at least 28 days a year).

2026-01-16T11:11:10.595992 [actor]: london home since 10 years

2026-01-16T11:11:14.477856 [root_agent]: Excellent. Living in London for 10 years confirms you are a UK resident.

Based on the information you’ve provided: you are the parent, your daughter is 8 years old, she usually lives with you but is currently in hospital for 14 weeks, your income is below £50,000, and you are a UK resident with no one else claiming for her.

It appears you *are* likely eligible for Child Benefit. Because your daughter is in hospital, the rules regarding where she lives are a little different, but since she normally lives with you, and has been in hospital for less than a year, you can still claim.

However, I am an AI and cannot provide definitive financial advice. I strongly recommend visiting the official government website to confirm and make a claim: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/how-to-claim.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

2026-01-16T11:11:15.332083 [actor]: when hospital more than 12 weeks?

2026-01-16T11:11:18.024800 [root_agent]: You're right to ask about that - it's a good question to double-check!

If a child is in hospital for *more* than 12 weeks, different rules apply. While you can *still* claim Child Benefit, you'll need to provide a letter from the doctor confirming the child is in hospital, and that they’ll be discharged soon.

Since your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks (as you previously mentioned), you *will* need that letter from the doctor when you make your claim.

Does that make sense? Would you like me to reiterate anything about the hospital rules?

2026-01-16T11:11:18.914775 [actor]: do I need to buy things for her?

2026-01-16T11:11:20.779797 [root_agent]: That’s a very thoughtful question.

Child Benefit is intended to help with the costs of raising a child, and you are absolutely free to use the money to buy things for your daughter – clothes, toys, anything she needs or enjoys. There are no restrictions on how you spend the Child Benefit payments. 

It’s entirely up to you how you choose to support her while she's in hospital and beyond.

2026-01-16T11:11:21.861952 [actor]: hospital gives everything for her there, I visit but don't buy things

2026-01-16T11:11:23.897516 [root_agent]: That’s good to know the hospital is providing everything she needs while she’s there. It’s wonderful that you visit her regularly – that's a very important way to support her.

Just to be clear then, even though the hospital provides for her, you are still eligible to claim Child Benefit as her parent, as it's a benefit to help with the general costs of raising a child, regardless of current expenses.

Does that clarify things for you?

2026-01-16T11:11:24.884419 [actor]: I'm not eligible if she's been in hospital more than 12 weeks?

2026-01-16T11:11:28.052371 [root_agent]: You are right to ask me to clarify, and I apologise for any confusion! My previous responses weren’t as clear as they should have been.

You *are* still eligible to claim Child Benefit even if your daughter has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks. However, as I mentioned before, if she’s been in hospital for more than 12 weeks, you *will* need to provide a letter from the doctor confirming she is in hospital and that she will be discharged soon.

It doesn't disqualify you from claiming, it just requires some additional documentation. I'm still learning to present information perfectly, so thank you for pointing out where I can improve!



Does that explanation make things clearer?

2026-01-16T11:11:28.881119 [actor]: need to spend money on her?

2026-01-16T11:11:31.167647 [root_agent]: No, you do *not* need to spend money on her to receive Child Benefit. 

Child Benefit is a payment to help with the costs of raising a child, but there are no requirements to prove you have spent the money *on* the child. The hospital is currently providing for her needs, and that doesn’t affect your eligibility to claim the benefit.

You can use the money for anything you feel would benefit her in the long term, or for other family expenses – it’s entirely your decision.

2026-01-16T11:11:32.264117 [actor]: I looked online and it says something different about hospital more than 12 weeks

2026-01-16T11:11:36.539894 [root_agent]: You are absolutely right to double-check and to bring that up! I sincerely apologise for the conflicting information I've given you. You are very astute to question me.

You are correct – my summaries have been inaccurate. According to the official guidance ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else)), if a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks, Child Benefit *can* be stopped if the hospital is providing full board and lodging.

I am still under development and clearly struggling with nuance in this specific area. I am very sorry for the incorrect advice I have given.

The best course of action is to contact the Child Benefit helpline directly to discuss your specific circumstances: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/contact.

Again, I apologise for the errors and for causing you confusion. Thank you for holding me accountable and helping me learn.

2026-01-16T11:11:38.275730 [actor]: so because I don't spend money on her and hospital provides everything and she's been there 14 weeks, am I eligible?

2026-01-16T11:11:43.073384 [root_agent]: You are right to ask me to be direct, and I will try my best to give you an accurate answer, acknowledging my previous errors.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that the hospital provides everything for your daughter, she’s been there for 14 weeks (more than 12 weeks), and you are not spending money on her directly because of the hospital’s provision – it is **likely your Child Benefit claim could be affected, potentially stopped**.

The rules state that if a child is in hospital for more than 12 weeks and the hospital provides full board and lodging, the benefit can be stopped. The fact you aren’t spending money on her reinforces this possibility.

I *strongly* recommend contacting the Child Benefit helpline ([https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/contact](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/contact)) to get a definitive answer based on your specific situation and to understand what documentation, if any, they require.

I am very sorry for the incorrect information I provided earlier. It's clear I need further refinement in understanding these complexities. Thank you for your patience and for pushing me to be accurate.

2026-01-16T11:11:47.282374 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent initially stated I would be eligible with a doctor's letter after 12 weeks in hospital, then later correctly stated that Child Benefit can be stopped after 12 weeks if the hospital provides full board and lodging, confirming I would likely not be eligible in my situation.
