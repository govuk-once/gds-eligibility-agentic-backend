**Justification:**

The agent communicated an **incorrect eligibility outcome**. According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, Child Benefit stops when a young person turns 20, even if they are still in approved education or training.

**Key facts from the conversation:**
- Dev turned 20 last week (middle of term)
- He is still studying A-levels full-time
- His course finishes in June

**What the agent said:**
The agent told Raj he would continue to receive Child Benefit until August (the end of the terminal date after Dev finishes his course in June).

**What the correct outcome should be:**
According to the expected outcome, eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday. Since Dev turned 20 last week, Raj's Child Benefit eligibility should have **already stopped** - not continue until August.

**The critical error:**
The agent incorrectly applied the terminal date rule. While it's true that Child Benefit can continue to a terminal date for young people under 20 who are finishing education, this rule does NOT apply once the young person reaches their 20th birthday. The 20th birthday is an absolute cut-off point.

The evaluation judge correctly identified this error, and the agent's communicated outcome (eligible until August) directly contradicts the expected outcome (not eligible as of the 20th birthday).
