**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated the eligibility outcome that aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points of agreement:**

1. **Eligibility confirmed**: The agent correctly determined that Tom and Jerry are eligible for Child Benefit based on:
   - Having a child under 20 (4-month-old baby)
   - Child living with them
   - Being responsible for the child
   - UK citizenship
   - Income below £60,000

2. **Backdating limitation accurately explained**: The agent clearly communicated that:
   - Child Benefit can only be backdated 3 months
   - Since the baby is 4 months old, they will lose 1 month of payment
   - They will receive payment for the last 3 months

3. **Direct acknowledgment of user's concern**: When the user explicitly asked "wait so lost 1 month payment then?? can only get 3 months back but baby 4 months old", the agent confirmed: "Yes, unfortunately that's correct. Child Benefit can only be backdated for up to 3 months from the date you make your claim. Since your baby is 4 months old, you would lose 1 month of payments."

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome: **Eligible (but only for the last 3 months; they lose the first month's money).**
