**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Right to Reside Assessment**: The agent properly identified that the applicant is visiting on a tourist visa (6-month standard visitor visa) and correctly determined this does not constitute a qualifying "right to reside" for benefit purposes.

2. **Key Eligibility Criteria Addressed**: The agent explained that Child Benefit eligibility requires:
   - Living in the UK (presence), AND
   - Having qualifying immigration status/right to reside (UK citizenship, settled status, or specific qualifying connections like work)

3. **Correct Application to Facts**: The agent recognized that:
   - The applicant is a temporary visitor/tourist
   - Not working in the UK
   - No other qualifying connections to the UK
   - Therefore does not meet the right to reside requirement

4. **Clear Communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you would not be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided a clear, accurate explanation of why.

The agent's determination correctly reflects that a US citizen on a standard tourist visa, subject to immigration control with no recourse to public funds and without settled status or qualifying right to reside, does not meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit - matching the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
