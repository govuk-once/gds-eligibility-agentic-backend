2026-01-28T18:53:30.219048 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T18:53:31.976199 [actor]: child benefit eligable daughter 4 years old live togther

2026-01-28T18:53:34.167858 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 4-year-old daughter living with you - that's a good start.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Do you normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T18:53:35.679761 [actor]: yes uk live here earnings 75000 year

2026-01-28T18:53:39.224328 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you live in the UK and for providing your earnings information.

Your income of £75,000 per year is important to know. Let me ask you another question:

**Are you the only person responsible for your daughter, or is there another parent or partner involved? If there is another parent/partner, do they also live with you and your daughter?**

This will help me determine if there are any implications regarding the High Income Child Benefit Charge, which applies when someone in the household earns over £60,000.

2026-01-28T18:53:41.150717 [actor]: partner james lives with us earns money

2026-01-28T18:53:43.379478 [root_agent]: Thank you. So your partner James lives with you and your daughter, and he also earns money.

**How much does James earn per year?**

This is important because the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies to the highest earner in the household if either of you earns over £60,000.

2026-01-28T18:53:44.781634 [actor]: james earns 20000

2026-01-28T18:53:47.194946 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask one more important question:

**Are you or James currently receiving Child Benefit for your daughter, or has either of you claimed it in the past?**

This will help me give you a complete picture of your eligibility and what you need to know about claiming.

2026-01-28T18:53:49.101006 [actor]: no not recieving child benifit want to know if can claim

2026-01-28T18:53:55.008338 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you haven't claimed Child Benefit yet.

Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

**You ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit** because:
- You have a 4-year-old daughter (under 16)
- You live with her in the UK
- You are responsible for her

**However, there's an important point about your household income:**

Since you earn £75,000 per year (and this is higher than James's £20,000), you will need to be aware of the **High Income Child Benefit Charge**. This is a tax charge that applies when the highest earner in a household earning over £60,000 claims Child Benefit.

Here's how it works:
- Between £60,000-£80,000: You pay back some of the Child Benefit through your tax return
- At your income of £75,000, you would pay back approximately 75% of the Child Benefit received
- Above £80,000: You pay back 100%

**You have two options:**
1. Claim Child Benefit and pay back most of it through the tax charge
2. Claim Child Benefit but opt not to receive the payments (this still gives your daughter National Insurance credits that protect their future State Pension)

Would you like more information about either of these options?

2026-01-28T18:53:57.346694 [actor]: ok so can claim but have to pay back some undertsand thank you

2026-01-28T18:54:01.320641 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user is eligible for Child Benefit and correctly explained the High Income Child Benefit Charge that applies due to the £75,000 income, including the approximate 75% repayment rate and the two claiming options available.
