**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly assessed the user's eligibility for Child Benefit. Here's why:

**The Facts:**
- Arthur (7 years old) was in hospital for 10 weeks
- He returned home for 2 weeks (15 days between hospital stays)
- He was readmitted and has now been in hospital for 3 weeks
- Total cumulative hospital time: 10 + 3 = 13 weeks
- The hospital covers all costs during his stays

**The Critical Error - The "Linking Rule":**
The agent stated: "because he's been coming home between hospital stays (he was home for 2 weeks between admissions), each hospital stay would likely be counted separately rather than as one continuous period."

This is **incorrect**. According to the linking rule for Child Benefit and hospital stays, if a child returns to hospital within 28 days of leaving, the stays are **linked together** and count cumulatively toward the 12-week limit. Arthur returned after only 15 days, so the linking rule applies.

**The Correct Assessment:**
- Arthur's hospital stays should be counted cumulatively: 10 + 3 = 13 weeks
- This exceeds the 12-week limit
- Since the hospital pays for everything and there's no indication Jenny is contributing to his upkeep costs, Child Benefit should cease after the cumulative 12th week
- **Expected outcome: Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)**

**What the agent communicated:**
The agent told Jenny she "should still be eligible for Child Benefit" and that she should "continue receiving your Child Benefit as normal."

The agent's eligibility determination **does not agree** with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)."
