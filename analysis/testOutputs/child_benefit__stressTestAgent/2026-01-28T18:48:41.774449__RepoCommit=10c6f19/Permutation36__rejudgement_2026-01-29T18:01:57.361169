**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Correct application of the "summer gap" rule**: The agent properly recognized that Child Benefit continues during the gap between finishing GCSEs and starting A-levels in September, stating: "There is typically allowance for gaps between finishing one course (like GCSEs) and starting another (like A-levels)."

2. **All eligibility criteria met**:
   - Child under 20: Yes (16 years old)
   - In approved education: Yes (accepted to study A-levels starting September)
   - Parent responsible for child: Yes (lives with daughter)
   - UK residency: Yes
   - No duplicate claims: Confirmed

3. **Addressed the user's concern**: The agent specifically reassured the worried mother about the current non-school status, explaining that the summer gap doesn't affect eligibility when the child is enrolled in approved education starting in September.

4. **Accurate outcome**: The agent's determination of "eligible" matches the expected outcome, as Kelly's acceptance into A-level college means Child Benefit should continue through the summer break between courses.

The agent's response was thorough, accurate, and properly addressed the specific circumstances of the "summer gap" scenario.
