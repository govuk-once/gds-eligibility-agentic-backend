2026-01-28T19:06:52.533600 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T19:06:54.283647 [actor]: child benefit for 5 year old visitng uk

2026-01-28T19:06:57.497982 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. I can see you're asking about Child Benefit for a 5-year-old visiting the UK.

To assess your eligibility, I need to ask: **Are you responsible for the child?** By this I mean, do you look after the child and are you paying towards their upbringing (for example, for their food, clothes, or housing)?

2026-01-28T19:06:59.327133 [actor]: yes im the mother we came from america on holiday

2026-01-28T19:07:01.489577 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since you're visiting the UK on holiday from America, I need to understand your residency status better.

**Are you or the child usually living in the UK, or are you both just temporarily visiting for a holiday?**

2026-01-28T19:07:03.200392 [actor]: tourist visa 6 months staying in uk

2026-01-28T19:07:05.525270 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. That's helpful information.

Now I need to ask: **Do you or your child have any connection to the UK through work, benefits, or any other circumstances?** For example, are you working in the UK during your stay, or does anyone in your family receive UK benefits or pay UK National Insurance?

2026-01-28T19:07:07.089809 [actor]: not working just visiting with my son

2026-01-28T19:07:12.015003 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to inform you that **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.

Here's why:

To be eligible for Child Benefit in the UK, you generally need to be:
- Living in the UK, AND
- Either a UK citizen, have settled status, or have the right to reside in the UK (which typically comes from working, claiming certain benefits, or having specific immigration status)

Since you and your son are visiting the UK temporarily on a tourist visa for 6 months and you're not working or have any other qualifying connection to the UK, you wouldn't meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

Child Benefit is designed for people who are resident in the UK and have a qualifying immigration status, rather than for temporary visitors or tourists.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit or UK benefits that you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T19:07:17.826116 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a tourist visiting the UK on a 6-month visa without UK residency or work status would not be eligible for Child Benefit, correctly explaining that eligibility requires living in the UK with appropriate immigration status or right to reside, which temporary tourists do not have.
