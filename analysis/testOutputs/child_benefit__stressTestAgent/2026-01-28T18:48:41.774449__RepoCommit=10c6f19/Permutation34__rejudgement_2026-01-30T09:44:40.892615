**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not currently eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Accurate application of the 8-week rule**: The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit continues for up to 8 weeks while a child is in custody, but stops after that period.

2. **Correct timeline assessment**: When the user confirmed Mark had been in custody for 10 weeks (exceeding the 8-week threshold), the agent properly concluded that Child Benefit would have stopped after week 8.

3. **Clear communication of current ineligibility**: The agent explicitly stated "Not eligible now" and confirmed this understanding with the user, who acknowledged: "ok so not eligble now but can claim wen he comes home got it thanks"

4. **Accurate advice about future eligibility**: While the agent also correctly informed the user they could reclaim when Mark returns home, this doesn't change the current eligibility status, which is the focus of this evaluation.

The agent's assessment directly matches the expected outcome that the user is **Not Eligible** for Child Benefit at present due to Mark having been in custody for more than 8 weeks.
