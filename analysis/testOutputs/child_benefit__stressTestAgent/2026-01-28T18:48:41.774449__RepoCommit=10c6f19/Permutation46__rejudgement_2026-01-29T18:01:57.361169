**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, but the expected outcome is **Not Eligible (Expired)**.

**Key Issue:**

The agent failed to recognize the critical time limit for jobseekers claiming Child Benefit. According to UK regulations, people with pre-settled status can claim Child Benefit as jobseekers for a maximum of **91 days**. The user explicitly stated they have been "looking for work 95 days now unemployed" - this exceeds the 91-day limit.

Additionally, the scenario specifies Hans has "no imminent job offer," meaning he doesn't have a genuine prospect of work that would extend his right to reside for benefit purposes beyond the 91-day limit.

**What the agent missed:**

1. The agent asked if the user had been "physically living in the UK for at least 3 months" but didn't specifically ask how long they had been claiming as a jobseeker
2. The agent didn't recognize that "95 days" of unemployment exceeds the 91-day jobseeker time limit
3. The agent didn't inquire about job offers or genuine prospects of work that might extend eligibility

**Correct outcome:** The user's right to reside for Child Benefit purposes expired after 91 days, making them **Not Eligible** at day 95.
