**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Responsibility criterion met:** The children (aged 6 and 8) live with George and Helen, who adopted them. The agent correctly confirmed they are responsible for the children.

2. **Adoption Allowance properly handled:** The agent specifically addressed the adoption allowance and correctly stated: "The adoption allowance you receive from the council should not affect your Child Benefit eligibility. Child Benefit is a separate payment and you can claim it in addition to your adoption allowance."

   This is accurate according to the rules provided - an Adoption Allowance does NOT disqualify someone from Child Benefit (unlike a fostering allowance which covers accommodation/maintenance fully).

3. **All other criteria verified:** The agent checked:
   - Children are under 16 ✓
   - Live in the UK ✓
   - Not subject to immigration control ✓
   - Not claiming conflicting benefits ✓

The agent's final determination of eligibility matches the expected outcome: **Eligible**.
