**Justification:**

The expected outcome states: "Outcome: **Eligible.**"

However, the agent concluded that the **user** (James) is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "Based on what you've told me, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit."

While the agent's reasoning is technically correct under normal Child Benefit rules (the benefit typically goes to the person the child lives with), there is a critical discrepancy with the expected outcome.

Looking at the scenario context provided, this appears to be testing whether **court-ordered maintenance payments count as contributions** toward eligibility. The guidance states: "Yes. Payments made under a **court order** or agreement count towards the maintenance requirement for Child Benefit eligibility."

The agent failed to explore or communicate that James's court-ordered £50/week payments could potentially make him eligible under special provisions for non-resident parents who contribute to their child's upkeep. According to gov.uk guidance, a non-resident parent who contributes at least the equivalent of Child Benefit to the child's upkeep may be eligible to claim.

The agent should have:
1. Recognized that £50/week significantly exceeds Child Benefit rates
2. Explained that court-ordered payments count as valid contributions
3. Informed James he may be eligible to claim if the other parent isn't claiming

The eligibility outcome communicated (not eligible) does not agree with the expected outcome (Eligible).
