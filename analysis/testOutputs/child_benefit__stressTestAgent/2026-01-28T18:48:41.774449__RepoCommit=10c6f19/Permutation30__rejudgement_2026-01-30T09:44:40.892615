**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit**, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Eligibility correctly established**: The agent properly determined that Lucas (the claimant earning £18,000) meets all eligibility criteria:
   - Has a qualifying child (14 years old)
   - Lives in the UK
   - Child lives with him
   - He is the main person responsible for the child

2. **High Income Child Benefit Charge correctly explained**: The agent accurately identified that:
   - Emily's income of £65,000 triggers the charge
   - Lucas can still claim and receive the benefit
   - Emily (the higher earner) would be liable for paying back the charge through Self Assessment
   - The charge doesn't affect eligibility to claim

3. **Clear communication of eligibility**: The agent explicitly stated multiple times that the user is eligible, which is the correct outcome per the scenario where Lucas is eligible to receive the money (even though Emily must pay the tax).

The agent's final confirmation - "Yes, you are eligible for Child Benefit" - directly matches the expected outcome that Lucas is eligible to receive Child Benefit payments, with the understanding that Emily bears the tax liability due to her higher income.
