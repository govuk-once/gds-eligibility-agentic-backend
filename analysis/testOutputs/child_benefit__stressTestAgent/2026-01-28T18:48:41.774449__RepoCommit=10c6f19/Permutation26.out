2026-01-28T19:05:11.696793 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T19:05:13.466934 [actor]: child not living with me send money tho

2026-01-28T19:05:17.208386 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask you this:

**Does the child live with someone else, and if so, do you contribute at least the same amount toward the child's upkeep as the person the child lives with (or the same amount as Child Benefit would be)?**

In other words, I need to understand:
1. Who does the child currently live with?
2. How much do you contribute financially to the child's care?

2026-01-28T19:05:18.742166 [actor]: send 15 pound evry week to aunt child lives there

2026-01-28T19:05:20.709694 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask a follow-up question:

**Do you know if your aunt (who the child lives with) is currently claiming Child Benefit for this child?**

2026-01-28T19:05:22.789208 [actor]: aunt not claiming anythng

2026-01-28T19:05:25.048848 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Now I need to understand a bit more about your situation:

**Are you the child's parent or the person who is primarily responsible for the child, even though they live with your aunt?**

2026-01-28T19:05:26.622748 [actor]: yes son zahid 15 years old

2026-01-28T19:05:29.355025 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Now I need to ask:

**Why does Zahid live with your aunt rather than with you? Is this a temporary arrangement, or is this a more permanent living situation?**

This will help me understand whether you or your aunt would be the eligible claimant for Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T19:05:31.066300 [actor]: permanent arrangement aunt raising him

2026-01-28T19:05:34.537072 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. I have one more important question:

**Are you contributing at least the same amount (£15 per week) as what Child Benefit would pay, or more?**

For context, Child Benefit is currently:
- £25.60 per week for the eldest or only child
- £16.95 per week for each additional child

Since you're sending £15 per week and your aunt is raising Zahid permanently, I need to confirm: Is your aunt willing to let you claim the Child Benefit instead of claiming it herself?

2026-01-28T19:05:36.206394 [actor]: grandmother also sends 15 pound week for zahid

2026-01-28T19:05:38.897810 [root_agent]: Thank you for that additional information. Let me ask:

**Is the grandmother Zahid's maternal or paternal grandmother, and what is your relationship to Zahid - are you his mother or father?**

Also, to clarify: **Would your aunt be willing for you to claim the Child Benefit rather than claiming it herself, given that she is the one raising Zahid on a permanent basis?**

2026-01-28T19:05:40.812409 [actor]: im father mo grandmother is my mother so zahids grandmother

2026-01-28T19:05:44.014110 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Now I have an important question:

**Between you (contributing £15/week), your mother/Zahid's grandmother (contributing £15/week), and your aunt (who is raising Zahid), who contributes the most towards Zahid's upkeep overall?**

I ask because while you and your mother together contribute £30 per week in cash, your aunt is providing daily care, housing, food, and all other living expenses. This is important for determining eligibility.

2026-01-28T19:05:45.744103 [actor]: just send the money aunt does everything else

2026-01-28T19:05:50.456046 [root_agent]: Thank you for being clear about that. Based on what you've told me, I need to explain the situation:

**Based on the Child Benefit rules, you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation.**

Here's why:

Since your aunt is the person Zahid lives with permanently and she is responsible for his day-to-day care (providing housing, food, and raising him), **she would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit** - not you.

The £15 per week you're contributing is less than the Child Benefit amount (£25.60 per week for an only/eldest child), and more importantly, your aunt is providing the majority of Zahid's care and upkeep through the daily essentials.

**However, your aunt can claim Child Benefit for Zahid if she wishes to do so.** You mentioned she's not currently claiming anything - she may want to consider applying as she appears to be eligible.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?

2026-01-28T19:05:57.421615 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated I am not eligible, but according to gov.uk guidance, when a child lives with someone else, you can still claim Child Benefit if you contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit (or the same as the person the child lives with). With both father (£15) and grandmother (£15) contributing £30/week total, which exceeds the £25.60 Child Benefit rate, and the aunt not claiming, the father could potentially be eligible to claim if the aunt agrees, making the expected "Eligible" outcome achievable.
