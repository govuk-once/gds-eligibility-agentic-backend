**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** and properly applied the exception to the hospital stay rules. Here's why this assessment is correct:

1. **Basic eligibility criteria met**: The agent confirmed the child is 6 years old (under 16), the user lives in the UK, and the user has parental responsibility.

2. **Hospital stay exception properly applied**: The agent correctly identified that while the child has been in hospital for 14 weeks (exceeding the standard 12-week limit after which Child Benefit normally stops), an important exception applies.

3. **Critical exception factor identified**: The agent recognized that the user spends £30 per week on the child's upkeep (books, pyjamas, special food), which exceeds the Child Benefit amount. According to gov.uk guidance, if a parent regularly spends at least as much as the Child Benefit amount on their child's upkeep while in hospital, they can continue to receive Child Benefit beyond the 12-week limit.

4. **Correct outcome communicated**: The agent clearly stated "You should be eligible for Child Benefit" and explained the reasoning, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible (via Exception)**.

The agent's assessment matches the expected outcome that Mary retains eligibility beyond the 12-week hospital limit due to her regular financial contributions to Chloe's upkeep.
