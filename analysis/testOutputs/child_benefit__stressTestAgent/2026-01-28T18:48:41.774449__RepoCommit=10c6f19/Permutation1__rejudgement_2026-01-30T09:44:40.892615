**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis of the conversation:**

1. **Child's Age (Criteria 2):** The agent confirmed the child is 8 years old and in primary school, meeting the under-16 requirement.

2. **Responsibility (Criteria 1):** The agent verified the user is responsible for day-to-day care, food, clothes, and necessities.

3. **Living Arrangements (Criteria 4):** The agent confirmed the child lives with the user full-time in Manchester.

4. **Residency/Immigration (Criteria 3):** The agent confirmed both parents are UK nationals with no immigration restrictions.

5. **State Support (Criteria 5):** The child is living at home (not in hospital or care).

6. **High Income Charge (Criteria 6):** The agent appropriately mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge for incomes over £60,000, though this doesn't affect eligibility to claim.

The agent's conclusion that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" and "should be able to claim Child Benefit for your son" is accurate and matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**. The agent systematically verified all necessary criteria and communicated the correct eligibility determination.
