**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."

The agent systematically verified all relevant eligibility criteria:

1. **Responsibility:** Confirmed the user is responsible for the child (pays for food, clothes, rent, bills)
2. **Child's Age and Education:** Verified the daughter is 17 (under 20) and studying full-time A-levels at sixth form college (approved education)
3. **Residency and Immigration:** Confirmed UK citizen living in London
4. **Living Arrangements:** Established the daughter lives with the applicant
5. **No Duplicate Claims:** Confirmed no one else claims Child Benefit for the daughter
6. **High Income Child Benefit Charge:** Verified income of £40,000 is below the £60,000 threshold

The agent provided a clear, accurate assessment with proper reasoning and correctly communicated that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit." This determination aligns perfectly with the expected outcome based on the scenario where Amit (single father, £40,000 income) has a 17-year-old daughter (Priya) studying full-time A-levels at sixth form college while living with him in London.
