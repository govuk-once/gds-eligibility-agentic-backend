2026-01-28T18:55:01.661828 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T18:55:03.466453 [actor]: child benefit for 17 yr old apprenticship

2026-01-28T18:55:06.325295 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand a bit more about the apprenticeship.

**Is your 17-year-old in an approved education or training program, such as an apprenticeship that is not paid employment?**

In other words, is this a recognized apprenticeship or training course, rather than just a regular job?

2026-01-28T18:55:07.911639 [actor]: son doing intermediate apprenticship england government funded

2026-01-28T18:55:10.530947 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. A government-funded intermediate apprenticeship can count as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes, which is good news.

Now I need to ask you a few more questions to assess your full eligibility:

**Are you responsible for your son? In other words, does he live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards his upkeep?**

2026-01-28T18:55:12.186888 [actor]: lives with me hes 17 just started

2026-01-28T18:55:14.095301 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful information.

**Are you or your partner currently receiving Child Benefit for your son, or has anyone else claimed Child Benefit for him?**

2026-01-28T18:55:16.109703 [actor]: no nobdy claiming just want to no if i can get it

2026-01-28T18:55:18.501888 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Just a couple more questions to complete the assessment:

**Are you (or your partner if you have one) responsible for your son? This means you're the main person looking after him and paying for his needs like food, clothing, and housing.**

2026-01-28T18:55:20.292285 [actor]: yes im responible hes my son lives with me im karen

2026-01-28T18:55:22.283470 [root_agent]: Thank you, Karen. I have one more important question:

**Does your son spend any time living with someone else, or is he in hospital or care for any period of time?**

2026-01-28T18:55:24.493134 [actor]: no he lives at home with me all the time

2026-01-28T18:55:28.881108 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions, Karen.

**Based on the information you've provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:
- You have a 17-year-old son who lives with you
- He's in a government-funded intermediate apprenticeship, which counts as approved education or training
- You're responsible for him and he lives with you full-time
- Nobody else is currently claiming Child Benefit for him

You can claim Child Benefit for a child under 20 if they're in approved education or training (like an apprenticeship), as long as they started before they turned 19.

Since your son has just started his apprenticeship at 17, this meets the criteria.

**You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit.** You'll need to apply through the official government process to start receiving the benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T18:55:34.310561 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, apprentices who are paid a wage (which is the case for intermediate apprenticeships) do not qualify for Child Benefit as apprenticeships count as paid employment, not approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.
