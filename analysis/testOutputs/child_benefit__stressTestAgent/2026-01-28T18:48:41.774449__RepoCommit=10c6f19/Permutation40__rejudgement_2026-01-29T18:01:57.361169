**Justification:**

The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that **agrees with the expected outcome** of "Eligible (until week 12)."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct eligibility determination**: The agent clearly stated "You should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit for your son" and explained this is because the NHS secure unit is classified as hospital care.

2. **Correct time limit applied**: The agent correctly identified and applied the **12-week (84 days)** rule for hospital/residential accommodation, stating: "you can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **84 days (12 weeks)** while they're there."

3. **Accurate calculation**: The agent correctly calculated that with 10 weeks elapsed, there are "2 weeks remaining within this 84-day period."

4. **Appropriate guidance**: The agent properly advised that "**If his stay extends beyond 12 weeks**, you should contact the Child Benefit Office" - which aligns with the limitation in the expected outcome.

5. **Correct classification**: The agent appropriately treated the Mental Health Act secure unit as hospital care rather than custody, which is the correct interpretation for Child Benefit purposes.

The agent's communication was clear, accurate, and fully consistent with the expected outcome that the user is eligible until week 12.
