**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit for Sam**. 

According to the expected outcome, this is a "Split Family" scenario where both parents should be eligible - Robert (the user) for Sam who lives with him, and Tina for Ella who lives with her. The agent correctly identified that:

1. The user meets all eligibility criteria for Sam (under 16, responsible for the child, lives in UK, no immigration restrictions, no one else claiming)
2. The user is eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam
3. The agent also correctly noted that "Tina would separately be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Ella, since Ella lives with her full-time"

While the agent didn't explicitly mention that both parents would receive the higher "eldest child" rate (£26.05) as noted in the expected outcome details, the agent did correctly communicate the fundamental eligibility outcome: **both parents are eligible** to claim for their respective children. This aligns with the expected outcome of "Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate)."

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome that both separated parents can claim Child Benefit for the child living with them.
