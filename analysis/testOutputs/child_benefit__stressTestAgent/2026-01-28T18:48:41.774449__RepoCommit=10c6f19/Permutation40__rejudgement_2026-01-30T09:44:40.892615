**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit**, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Eligible (until week 12)."

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct eligibility determination**: The agent clearly stated "You should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit for your son"

2. **Correct time limit applied**: The agent properly identified the **12-week (84 days)** rule for hospital/NHS care, not the 8-week custody rule

3. **Accurate calculation**: The agent correctly noted that with 10 weeks elapsed, there are 2 weeks remaining in the eligible period

4. **Proper classification**: The agent correctly treated the NHS secure unit under the Mental Health Act as hospital care rather than custody

5. **Appropriate guidance**: The agent advised the user to contact the Child Benefit Office if the stay extends beyond 12 weeks, which is appropriate forward-looking advice

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome that the user is eligible until week 12, and provided clear, accurate information about the time-limited nature of this eligibility.
