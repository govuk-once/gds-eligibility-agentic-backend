**Justification:**

The agent failed to communicate the correct eligibility outcome. The expected outcome is that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks** under the extension provision for young people who have left education and are registered with qualifying careers services.

**Key failures:**

1. **Missed the extension rule**: Despite the user repeatedly mentioning the 20-week extension and stating they read it on gov.uk, the agent could not verify or confirm this provision exists.

2. **Incorrect initial determinations**: The agent initially told the user they were "not eligible" multiple times before backtracking to uncertainty.

3. **Failed to verify critical information**: The agent should have consulted the official gov.uk guidance (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility) which states that Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after a young person leaves education if they register with certain careers services.

4. **Admitted inability to determine eligibility**: The agent's final position was "I cannot definitively confirm whether you are eligible or not" and referred the user to call the Child Benefit Office, when the correct answer based on the scenario facts is that the user **is eligible**.

**Correct outcome**: Gary is eligible for Child Benefit for Ben for up to 20 weeks because Ben (17) left education in June, registered with the youth careers service in August (within the qualifying period), and is actively looking for an apprenticeship. This matches the "Job Seeker Extension" permutation exactly.

The agent's failure to communicate this correct outcome represents a significant error in service delivery.
