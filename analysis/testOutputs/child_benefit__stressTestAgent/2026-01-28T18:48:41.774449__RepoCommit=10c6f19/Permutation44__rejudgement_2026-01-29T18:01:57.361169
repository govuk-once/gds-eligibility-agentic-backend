**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user **may be eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Criteria 1 (Care Limit):** The child is in local authority care, which typically exceeds 8 weeks - this would normally disqualify eligibility.

2. **Criteria 2 (Time at Home):** However, the child spends 25 hours at home each week (Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am), which exceeds the 24-hour threshold mentioned in the government guidance for maintaining eligibility even when a child is in care.

3. **Agent's assessment:** The agent correctly identified that:
   - The child meets the age requirement (12 years old)
   - The child spends regular, substantial time at home (25 hours/week)
   - Nobody is currently claiming the benefit
   - The local authority is not claiming it

4. **Appropriate guidance:** The agent appropriately recommended that the user apply and explained that the Child Benefit Office would make the final determination, which is reasonable given the complexity of care situations.

The agent's conclusion that the user "may be eligible" and should apply is consistent with the expected outcome of **Eligible**, as the 25-hour weekly home visit satisfies the requirement for at least 24 hours per week at home, which maintains eligibility despite the child being in local authority care.
