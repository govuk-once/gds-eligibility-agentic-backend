2026-01-28T18:57:50.730965 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T18:57:52.426899 [actor]: child in hospital abroad can i get benefit

2026-01-28T18:57:54.260708 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask you a specific question about your situation:

Is your child currently in hospital abroad, and if so, are they expected to be there for more than 12 weeks?

2026-01-28T18:57:55.955324 [actor]: son 14 years treatmnt usa 15 weeks

2026-01-28T18:57:58.472746 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand a bit more about your circumstances.

Are you currently responsible for your son (meaning you're the one looking after him and contributing to the costs of supporting him), and do you normally live in the UK?

2026-01-28T18:58:00.133249 [actor]: yes uk resident pay costs visits him

2026-01-28T18:58:01.889193 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Let me ask you another important question:

Before your son went to the USA for treatment, was he living with you in the UK?

2026-01-28T18:58:03.386891 [actor]: yes he was living with me befor

2026-01-28T18:58:05.401803 [root_agent]: Thank you. I have one more question to complete my assessment:

Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your son, or are you applying for it for the first time?

2026-01-28T18:58:06.966440 [actor]: need to know if i can get it

2026-01-28T18:58:11.042955 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

**You should be eligible for Child Benefit** for your son during his hospital treatment in the USA, subject to the following important conditions:

✓ Your son is 14 years old (under 16)
✓ You are a UK resident
✓ You are responsible for him and contributing to his costs
✓ He normally lives with you in the UK

**However, there is a time limit**: You can continue to claim Child Benefit while your child is in hospital abroad for up to **12 weeks**. Since you mentioned his treatment will be 15 weeks, you would only be eligible for Child Benefit for the first 12 weeks of his hospital stay abroad.

After 12 weeks, your Child Benefit would stop unless your son returns to the UK.

Do you have any questions about this, or would you like to know how to apply for Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T18:58:16.704026 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that Child Benefit can only be claimed for up to 12 weeks when a child is in hospital abroad, but according to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit can continue for up to 12 weeks when a child is in hospital or care in the UK - there is no automatic provision for extending Child Benefit when a child is in hospital abroad beyond the standard temporary absence rules.
