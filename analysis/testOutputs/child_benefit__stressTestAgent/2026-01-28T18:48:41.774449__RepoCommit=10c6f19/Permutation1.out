2026-01-28T18:48:44.349876 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T18:48:46.368923 [actor]: childs benefts my son 8 yeers old primery scool

2026-01-28T18:48:48.660382 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have an 8-year-old son in primary school.

Now, let me ask you the next question:

**Does your son normally live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards looking after him?**

2026-01-28T18:48:50.188019 [actor]: son lives manchster with us

2026-01-28T18:48:52.621528 [root_agent]: Thank you - so your son lives with you in Manchester.

Next question:

**Are you responsible for your son? This means you're the main person who looks after him day-to-day, makes decisions about his care, and pays for things like food, clothes, and other necessities?**

2026-01-28T18:48:54.320026 [actor]: yes care for him food clothes scool everything

2026-01-28T18:48:56.708172 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask:

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control? This means do you have any restrictions on your visa or immigration status that limit your access to public funds?**

2026-01-28T18:48:58.699907 [actor]: uk nationals both me and husband

2026-01-28T18:49:00.963032 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for clarifying that you and your husband are both UK nationals.

One more important question:

**Is your son living with you full-time, or does he spend significant time living with someone else (for example, does he live part of the time with another parent or family member)?**

2026-01-28T18:49:02.438041 [actor]: lives with us full time at home

2026-01-28T18:49:06.903592 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 8-year-old son)
✓ He lives with you full-time
✓ You are responsible for him - providing his food, clothes, and caring for him
✓ You and your husband are UK nationals (not subject to immigration control)

**You should be able to claim Child Benefit for your son.**

However, there's one important thing to be aware of: if either you or your husband has an individual income over £60,000 per year, you may have to pay some or all of the Child Benefit back through a tax charge (called the High Income Child Benefit Charge). You can still claim it, but the higher earner would need to pay some back through their tax return.

Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T18:49:12.817112 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user meets all Child Benefit eligibility criteria (child under 16, lives with claimant full-time, claimant is responsible for the child, and UK nationals with no immigration restrictions) and correctly informed them about the High Income Child Benefit Charge that may apply if either parent earns over £60,000.
