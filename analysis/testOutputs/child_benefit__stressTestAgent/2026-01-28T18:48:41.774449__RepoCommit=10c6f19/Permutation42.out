2026-01-28T19:16:24.652285 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T19:16:26.382519 [actor]: yeh got daughter 17 stil at home in cardif

2026-01-28T19:16:28.872803 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To help determine eligibility, I need to know:

**Is your 17-year-old daughter currently in approved education or training?**

(This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or certain training courses.)

2026-01-28T19:16:30.716247 [actor]: foundation aprentice ship wales

2026-01-28T19:16:32.618522 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

**Is this foundation apprenticeship in Wales an approved qualification up to level 3 (such as NVQ level 3 or equivalent)?**

2026-01-28T19:16:34.302419 [actor]: dunno just knows its welsh govenment funded foundation aprentice

2026-01-28T19:16:37.103720 [root_agent]: That's helpful to know it's Welsh Government funded.

Let me ask another question to assess your situation:

**Do you live in the UK, or are you a Crown servant (such as a diplomat or member of HM Forces) posted overseas?**

2026-01-28T19:16:38.665944 [actor]: live cardiff wales

2026-01-28T19:16:40.428592 [root_agent]: Thank you. Now I need to understand your living arrangement with your daughter:

**Does your daughter normally live with you in Cardiff?**

2026-01-28T19:16:42.174334 [actor]: yes lives with me

2026-01-28T19:16:44.254149 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now, an important question about your household:

**Does anyone else in your household already claim Child Benefit for your daughter, such as a partner or spouse?**

2026-01-28T19:16:46.140993 [actor]: no just me claiming

2026-01-28T19:16:48.377652 [root_agent]: Thank you. Let me ask one more important question:

**Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or do you have any restrictions on accessing public funds as part of your immigration status?**

2026-01-28T19:16:49.761173 [actor]: no im british born here

2026-01-28T19:16:54.569441 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, let me assess your eligibility:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

1. ✓ You're responsible for a child under 20
2. ✓ Your daughter (age 17) is in approved education/training (Welsh Government-funded foundation apprenticeship)
3. ✓ She lives with you
4. ✓ You live in the UK (Cardiff, Wales)
5. ✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her
6. ✓ You have no immigration restrictions

**Important note about the apprenticeship:** Foundation apprenticeships in Wales are generally considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes as they're funded by the Welsh Government. However, if you haven't already claimed, you may want to confirm the specific qualification level when you apply.

**Would you like to know anything else about Child Benefit, such as how to claim or what happens if your circumstances change?**

2026-01-28T19:17:00.569643 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user meets all Child Benefit eligibility criteria: responsible for a child under 20 in approved education/training (Welsh Government-funded foundation apprenticeship), child lives with them, they live in the UK, no one else is claiming, and no immigration restrictions.
