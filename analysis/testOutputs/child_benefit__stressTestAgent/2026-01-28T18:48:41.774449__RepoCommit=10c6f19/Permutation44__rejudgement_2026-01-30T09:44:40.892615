**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user **may be eligible** to claim Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of the 24-hour rule**: The agent recognized that the child spends 25 hours at home each week (Saturday 10am to Sunday 11am), which exceeds the minimum 24-hour threshold required under the rules for children in care.

2. **Accurate assessment of care situation**: The agent correctly identified that:
   - The child is in local authority care (council children's home)
   - The child has been in care (implicitly >8 weeks given the established routine)
   - Nobody is currently claiming Child Benefit
   - The parent is not contributing to care costs

3. **Appropriate qualification**: The agent appropriately used "may be eligible" rather than making an absolute determination, and correctly advised the user to apply and let the Child Benefit Office make the final decision. This is prudent given the complexity of care situations.

4. **Alignment with expected outcome**: According to the scenario criteria, Leo spends 25 hours at home (exceeding the 24-hour requirement), making the parent eligible even though he doesn't spend 2 nights at home. The agent's conclusion matches this expected eligibility outcome.

The agent successfully communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
