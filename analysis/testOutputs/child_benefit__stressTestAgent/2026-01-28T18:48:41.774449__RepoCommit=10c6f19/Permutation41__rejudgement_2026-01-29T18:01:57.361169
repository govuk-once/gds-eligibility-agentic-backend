**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user (Martin) is **not eligible for Child Benefit**, which contradicts the expected outcome.

**Expected Outcome:** "Eligible for Ben (Full Rate), Not Eligible for Jerry. (By explicitly allocating, he saves one claim)."

**What the scenario describes:**
- Martin contributes £40/week for two children (Ben and Jerry) who live with his ex-partner
- Child Benefit rates: £26.05 for eldest child, £17.25 for second child (total £43.30)
- By default, HMRC splits contributions equally (£20 each child), causing Martin to fail the threshold for Ben (needs £26.05)
- However, the guidance explicitly states Martin can **request HMRC to consider unequal splitting**
- By allocating £26.05 to Ben and £13.95 to Jerry from his £40 contribution, Martin becomes eligible for Ben (meeting the £26.05 threshold)

**What the agent missed:**
The agent failed to recognize that contributing parents can request unequal allocation of their maintenance payments to meet Child Benefit thresholds for specific children. The user explicitly mentioned "guidance says can ask hmrc unequal splitting i request 26.05 ben 13.95 jerry from my £40," but the agent dismissed this as a misunderstanding about splitting the benefit payment itself, rather than recognizing it as a valid mechanism for establishing eligibility through strategic contribution allocation.

The agent's conclusion directly contradicts the expected outcome that Martin would be eligible for Ben at the full rate.
