**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user **is eligible** for Child Benefit because their 18-year-old is enrolled in an HNC course at college, which the agent characterized as "approved education."

However, this is **incorrect**. According to the scenario details and UK Child Benefit rules:

1. **HNC courses are "Advanced" education** - A Higher National Certificate is a Level 4 qualification, equivalent to the first year of a university degree
2. **Child Benefit only covers "non-advanced" education** - This means up to and including Level 3 qualifications (A-Levels, T-Levels, etc.)
3. **Advanced education (Level 4+) does not qualify** - Once a young person moves to HNC, HND, degree-level, or other advanced courses, they are no longer eligible for Child Benefit

The expected outcome is **Not Eligible**, but the agent communicated that the user **is eligible**. This is a fundamental error in understanding what counts as "approved education or training" for Child Benefit purposes - the distinction between non-advanced (eligible) and advanced (not eligible) education is critical.

The agent's conclusion directly contradicts the expected outcome.
