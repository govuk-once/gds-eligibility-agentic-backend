**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

The agent's assessment was thorough and correct:

1. The user has a 17-year-old daughter living with them in Cardiff, Wales
2. The daughter is enrolled in a Welsh Government-funded Foundation Apprenticeship
3. According to the scenario context, Foundation Apprenticeships in Wales are listed as "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes (unlike apprenticeships in England which are typically excluded)
4. All other eligibility criteria were met (UK residence, no double claiming, no immigration restrictions)

The agent specifically noted: "Foundation apprenticeships in Wales are generally considered approved training for Child Benefit purposes as they're funded by the Welsh Government," which demonstrates proper understanding of the regional exception for Wales.

The agent's conclusion that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit" correctly aligns with the expected outcome.
