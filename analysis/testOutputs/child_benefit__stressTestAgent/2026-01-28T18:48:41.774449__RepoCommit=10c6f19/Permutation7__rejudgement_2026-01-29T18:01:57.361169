**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **NOT eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome is **Eligible (via Exception)**.

According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit for children in hospital or care (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), there is a specific exception: if a child in local authority care spends at least one night per week at home with the claimant on a regular basis, the claimant can still receive Child Benefit.

In this case:
- The son has been in local authority care for 3 months (more than 8 weeks)
- The local authority pays for the care
- **However**, the son comes home every weekend and stays for two consecutive nights (Friday and Saturday)
- The father provides food and care during these visits

This situation clearly meets the exception criteria - the child spends two nights per week at home (more than the required one night), and this is a regular arrangement. Therefore, David should be eligible for Child Benefit despite his son being in care.

The agent failed to recognize or apply this exception rule and instead gave an incorrect determination of ineligibility. The agent's response directly contradicts the expected outcome and the actual Child Benefit rules regarding children in care who maintain regular overnight stays with their parent/guardian.
