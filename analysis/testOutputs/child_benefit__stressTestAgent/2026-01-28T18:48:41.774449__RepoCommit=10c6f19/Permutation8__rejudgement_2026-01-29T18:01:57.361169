**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit but subject to a tax charge**, which aligns perfectly with the expected outcome.

Specifically, the agent:
1. Clearly stated "You ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit"
2. Accurately identified that the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) applies because the highest earner (Fiona) earns £75,000, which is above the £60,000 threshold
3. Correctly explained that approximately 75% of the benefit would need to be paid back through the tax charge
4. Presented both claiming options (claim and pay back, or claim but opt out of payments)

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome: **Eligible (but subject to tax charge)**. The user also confirmed understanding ("ok so can claim but have to pay back some understand thank you"), demonstrating the agent successfully conveyed the correct eligibility status with the tax charge caveat.
