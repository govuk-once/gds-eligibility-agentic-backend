**Justification:**

According to the official guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, a person can claim Child Benefit if they are "responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training)."

The key guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else specifically states: "You can claim Child Benefit if a child lives with you. **You can also claim if you do not live with the child but you're paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit towards looking after them** - for example for food or clothes."

In this scenario:
- Mark pays £150/month (approximately £34.60/week) for Lucas's food and clothes
- Current Child Benefit is approximately £113/month (£26.05/week)
- Mark is paying MORE than the Child Benefit amount
- Jenny (who Lucas lives with) is NOT claiming Child Benefit

According to the guidance, Mark **is eligible** to claim Child Benefit because:
1. He contributes more than the Child Benefit amount towards Lucas's upkeep
2. The person Lucas lives with (Jenny) is not claiming

The agent incorrectly concluded that Mark is not eligible, focusing only on living arrangements and day-to-day care, while missing the critical exception for contributing parents who pay at least the Child Benefit amount.

**Expected outcome: Eligible**
**Agent's communicated outcome: Not eligible**

These outcomes do not agree.
