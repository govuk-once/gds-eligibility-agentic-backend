**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

The critical error lies in the agent's treatment of the **HNC (Higher National Certificate) course**. According to the scenario details:

- An HNC is a **Level 4 qualification** (equivalent to the first year of a degree)
- HNCs are classified as **"advanced education"** 
- Child Benefit only covers **"non-advanced education"** up to Level 3/A-Level standard

The gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit eligibility for 16-19 year olds specifies that the education must be "approved education or training" which refers to **non-advanced education** (GCSEs, A-Levels, NVQ Level 3, etc.). Advanced education like HNCs, degrees, and other higher education qualifications do **not** qualify for Child Benefit extension beyond age 16.

The agent treated the HNC as "approved education" without verifying whether it was advanced or non-advanced level education. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the eligibility criteria. Since the 18-year-old is enrolled in advanced education (HNC), they do **not** qualify for Child Benefit, regardless of all other criteria being met.

The agent's conclusion directly contradicts the expected outcome of **Not Eligible**.
