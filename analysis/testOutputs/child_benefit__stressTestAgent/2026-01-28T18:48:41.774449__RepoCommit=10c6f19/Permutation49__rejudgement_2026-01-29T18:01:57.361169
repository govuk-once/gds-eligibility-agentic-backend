**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome.

**Key factors in the assessment:**

1. **Child's age**: Tom is 17, which means he falls into the 16-19 age category where Child Benefit eligibility depends on being in approved education or training.

2. **Education status**: The critical information emerged when the user stated "employer agreement course tom joins after not approved education" - explicitly confirming this is NOT approved education.

3. **Correct application of rules**: According to gov.uk guidance, courses done "with an employer's agreement - for example, to get a job" are specifically excluded from approved education. The agent correctly applied this rule.

4. **Clear communication**: The agent clearly communicated: "You are not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation" and provided a proper explanation that Tom doesn't meet the criteria since his course is not approved education.

5. **No other children**: The agent confirmed there were no other children who might qualify, making the overall outcome "not eligible."

The agent's determination aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of **Not Eligible** based on the scenario where Tom is taking a coding course with an employer agreement to join them afterwards, which is explicitly excluded from approved education.
