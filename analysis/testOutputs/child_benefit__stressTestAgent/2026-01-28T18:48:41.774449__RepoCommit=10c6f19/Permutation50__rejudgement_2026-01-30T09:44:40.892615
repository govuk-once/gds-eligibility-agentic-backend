**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Child's age and status**: The child is 16 years old and participating in the "No One Left Behind" programme in Scotland - a legitimate training initiative.

2. **Approved training verification**: The agent appropriately confirmed that:
   - The programme involves at least 12 hours per week of supervised training (meeting the minimum threshold)
   - This is recognized as approved training for Child Benefit purposes

3. **All eligibility criteria met**:
   - The claimant is responsible for the child and lives with them
   - They pay for the child's needs (food, clothing, housing)
   - They are a UK citizen living in Scotland
   - No one else is claiming for the same child
   - No immigration restrictions apply

4. **Correct application of rules**: The agent correctly applied the principle that Child Benefit can continue for 16-19 year olds in approved education or training, provided they meet the 12-hour weekly minimum requirement.

The "No One Left Behind" programme is indeed an approved Scottish training programme for Child Benefit purposes, and the agent's determination of eligibility is accurate and well-reasoned.
