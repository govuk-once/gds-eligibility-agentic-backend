**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct Application of Criteria:**
   - The agent properly identified that the applicant is on a tourist visa (6-month standard visitor visa)
   - The agent correctly recognized that temporary visitors without work or settled status do not have the right to reside for benefit purposes
   - The agent appropriately concluded that tourists are subject to immigration control and lack qualifying immigration status

2. **Accurate Explanation:**
   - The agent clearly explained that eligibility requires either UK citizenship, settled status, or right to reside
   - The agent correctly noted that temporary visitors/tourists do not meet these criteria
   - The reasoning provided was consistent with UK Child Benefit eligibility rules regarding right to reside

3. **Agreement with Expected Outcome:**
   - Expected: **Not Eligible** (due to Right to Reside failure - tourist visa with no recourse to public funds)
   - Agent's Determination: **Not Eligible**
   - These outcomes match

The agent successfully identified that Maria, as a US citizen on a standard tourist visa with no work or qualifying connection to the UK, does not have the right to reside for benefit purposes and is therefore ineligible for Child Benefit.
