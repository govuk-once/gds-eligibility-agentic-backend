The agent correctly determined that Carol (the mother's best friend in a private fostering arrangement) is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Justification:**

The agent properly identified all the key eligibility criteria:

1. **Child under 16**: Nina is 10 years old ✓
2. **Responsibility for the child**: Carol pays for everything (food, clothes, school supplies) and the child lives with her ✓
3. **No one else claiming**: The mother is not claiming Child Benefit ✓
4. **Child lives with applicant**: Nina lives with Carol, not at a different address ✓
5. **UK residency and right to claim**: Carol is a British citizen ✓

**Critically**, the agent correctly recognized that:
- A private fostering arrangement does NOT disqualify someone from claiming Child Benefit
- Being a non-parent (mother's best friend) does NOT prevent claiming when you have responsibility for the child
- The absence of council payment/support means this is private fostering, and the private fosterer CAN claim

The agent's conclusion that Carol "appears to be eligible to claim Child Benefit" is correct and matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** for this private fostering scenario where the council is not paying for accommodation or providing fostering allowances.
