**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** but will be **subject to a tax charge** due to the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC).

Key points the agent accurately conveyed:

1. **Eligibility confirmed** - The agent clearly stated "You ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit" based on having a 4-year-old daughter, UK residency, and responsibility for the child.

2. **Tax charge explained** - The agent correctly explained that because the highest earner (Fiona at £75,000) exceeds the £60,000 threshold, a tax charge applies that would claw back approximately 75% of the benefit.

3. **Two options presented** - The agent appropriately outlined both claiming options: receive payments and pay back through tax, or claim without receiving payments to preserve NI credits.

4. **Expected outcome match** - The expected outcome states "Eligible (but subject to tax charge)" which precisely matches what the agent communicated.

The agent's assessment aligns with the expected outcome for Permutation 8: The High Earner scenario, where Fiona earns £75,000 (between the £60,000 and £80,000 thresholds) and is therefore eligible but faces a partial tax charge clawback.
