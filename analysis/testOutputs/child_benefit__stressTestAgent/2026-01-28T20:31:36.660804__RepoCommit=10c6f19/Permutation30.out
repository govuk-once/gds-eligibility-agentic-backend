2026-01-28T20:47:08.255052 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:47:09.707026 [actor]: child under 16 yes got one live with me

2026-01-28T20:47:11.892024 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Let me ask you the next question:

**Do you live in the UK, or are you a Crown servant (such as a diplomat or member of HM Forces) posted overseas?**

2026-01-28T20:47:13.336210 [actor]: live in uk yes

2026-01-28T20:47:15.252511 [root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Now, let me ask you:

**Are you the person responsible for the child? This means you're the main person looking after them and making decisions about their care, or they live with you?**

2026-01-28T20:47:16.818119 [actor]: yes im responsable I fill out the form get the payments in my bank

2026-01-28T20:47:18.571634 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Is your child living with you full-time, or do they spend time living with someone else (for example, if you share custody with another parent or guardian)?**

2026-01-28T20:47:19.782808 [actor]: child lives with me full time

2026-01-28T20:47:21.806419 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Now I need to ask:

**Is your child currently in hospital for more than 12 weeks, or are they in local authority care, or living in a residential education or training establishment?**

2026-01-28T20:47:23.338927 [actor]: no none of that child at home with me

2026-01-28T20:47:26.346089 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

✓ You have a child under 16 living with you
✓ You live in the UK
✓ You are responsible for the child
✓ The child lives with you full-time
✓ The child is not in hospital long-term or in care

Since you mentioned you've already filled out the form and are receiving payments in your bank account, it sounds like you're already claiming Child Benefit successfully.

Is there anything specific about your Child Benefit claim that you'd like help with, or do you have any other questions?

2026-01-28T20:47:27.889723 [actor]: wait whats this about high income my wife earns alot

2026-01-28T20:47:30.798298 [root_agent]: That's an important point to raise! Let me ask you about this:

**Does either you or your partner have an individual income over £50,000 a year?**

This is important because there's something called the "High Income Child Benefit Charge" that may apply if either parent earns above this threshold.

2026-01-28T20:47:32.488999 [actor]: I earn 18000 my wife earns 65000

2026-01-28T20:47:37.663772 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

Based on what you've told me, here's what this means for your Child Benefit:

**You are still eligible to claim Child Benefit.** However, because your wife earns £65,000 (which is over £50,000), the High Income Child Benefit Charge will apply.

Here's how this works:

- You can continue to receive Child Benefit payments as normal
- However, the partner with the higher income (in this case, your wife earning £65,000) will need to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the tax system via a Self Assessment tax return
- The charge is 1% of the Child Benefit amount for every £100 earned over £50,000
- At £60,000 or above, the charge equals 100% of the Child Benefit received

Since your wife earns £65,000, you would need to pay back all of the Child Benefit received through her tax return.

**You have two options:**

1. Continue receiving Child Benefit payments but your wife pays it all back via Self Assessment
2. Opt out of receiving Child Benefit payments (but still register for it to protect National Insurance credits)

Do you have any questions about this?

2026-01-28T20:47:39.395467 [actor]: ok so wife has to pay it back got it thats all I needed to know

2026-01-28T20:47:42.145729 [root_agent]: You're welcome! Yes, that's correct - your wife will need to pay it back through her Self Assessment tax return since she earns £65,000.

Just to confirm: **you are eligible for Child Benefit**, but the High Income Child Benefit Charge means it will need to be repaid.

I'm glad I could help clarify this for you. If you have any other questions in the future, feel free to ask. Take care!

2026-01-28T20:47:47.303799 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user is eligible for Child Benefit and correctly explained that while eligible to receive the benefit, the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies because the wife earns £65,000, meaning the full amount must be repaid through Self Assessment tax.
