**Justification:**

The agent concluded that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, stating: "You are not eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation."

However, the expected outcome is: **Eligible.**

**Why the agent's determination was incorrect:**

According to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit (specifically https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else), a person can claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with them if:
1. They contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit (£26.05/week for the eldest child) towards the child's upkeep, AND
2. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for that child

In this scenario:
- Mo contributes £15/week personally
- Mo's mother (the grandmother) contributes another £15/week
- **Combined contributions = £30/week, which exceeds the £26.05 threshold**
- The aunt is not claiming Child Benefit

The guidance explicitly states that contributions from multiple people can be aggregated. Since the total contributions meet the threshold and no one else is claiming, Mo **is eligible** to claim Child Benefit.

The agent failed to:
1. Ask about other contributors
2. Explain the contribution threshold rule
3. Recognize that combined contributions can meet the eligibility requirement

The agent's conclusion directly contradicts the expected eligible outcome.
