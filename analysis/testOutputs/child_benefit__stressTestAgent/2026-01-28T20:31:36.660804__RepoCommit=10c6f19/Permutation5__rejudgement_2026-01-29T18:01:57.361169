**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Mark is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Responsibility criterion met**: The agent correctly identified that Mark contributes £150/month (approximately £35/week) toward Lucas's care, which exceeds the Child Benefit rate of approximately £25/week. This satisfies the "contributing to upkeep" exception even though Lucas doesn't live with Mark.

2. **No concurrent claim**: The agent properly verified that Jenny (the ex-wife) is not currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucas, meaning there's no conflicting claim.

3. **Age requirement met**: Lucas at 10 years old clearly meets the age criterion (under 16).

4. **Residency verified**: Mark confirmed he lives in the UK and is a British citizen.

5. **Clear communication**: The agent explicitly stated "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and provided a clear breakdown explaining why Mark qualifies despite not living with Lucas.

The agent's assessment aligns perfectly with the expected outcome that Mark is eligible under the "contributing to upkeep" exception outlined in Criteria 1 and the absence of a concurrent claim noted in Criteria 5.
