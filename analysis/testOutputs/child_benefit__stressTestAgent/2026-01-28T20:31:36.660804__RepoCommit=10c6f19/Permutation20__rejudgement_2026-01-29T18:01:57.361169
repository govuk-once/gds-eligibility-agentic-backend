**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Maria is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Responsibility criterion met**: The agent correctly established that Maria is responsible for her granddaughter's day-to-day care, as she pays for everything (clothes, food, school supplies) and the child lives with her.

2. **Relationship criterion met**: The agent appropriately recognized that you don't have to be a parent to claim Child Benefit. UK Child Benefit rules allow grandparents and others with informal care arrangements to claim, provided they are responsible for the child.

3. **No competing claim**: The agent verified that neither parent nor anyone else is claiming Child Benefit for Lucia.

4. **Residency confirmed**: UK residency was established with no immigration restrictions.

5. **Age requirement met**: Lucia at 14 is under the 16-year age threshold (or 20 if in approved education/training).

The agent's conclusion that Maria "should be able to apply for Child Benefit for your granddaughter" correctly communicates eligibility. The agent also provided clear reasoning for the eligibility determination, citing all the relevant criteria that were satisfied.

This matches the expected outcome that Maria is **Eligible** under the informal guardian scenario.
