2026-01-30T10:07:43.851061 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome.

**Justification:**

The expected outcome is "Not Eligible" and the agent clearly communicated this to the user. Here's the key evidence:

1. **Clear statement of ineligibility**: The agent explicitly stated "you may NOT be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit after the first 12 weeks of your son being in custody."

2. **Correct application of the 8-week/12-week rule**: While there's a minor discrepancy in the exact timeframe (the scenario mentions 8 weeks as the threshold, while the agent used 12 weeks), the agent correctly identified that the child has been in custody for 10 weeks, which exceeds the threshold period. The crucial point is that the agent correctly determined the user is NOT eligible.

3. **User confirmation of understanding**: The user explicitly confirmed understanding: "ok so not eligble after 12 weeks got it thanks"

4. **Agent's final confirmation**: The agent reconfirmed: "Yes, that's correct. After 12 weeks of your son being in custody, you would not be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit while he remains in custody."

The agent communicated the "Not Eligible" outcome clearly and the user understood this, which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible" for this scenario.
