**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

Wait - let me reconsider this carefully.

Looking at the expected outcome again: "Outcome: **Eligible.**"

And reviewing the scenario: James pays £50 a week under a court order, and the scenario states that "Payments made under a **court order** or agreement count towards the maintenance requirement for Child Benefit eligibility."

However, the agent told the user: "Child Benefit is generally paid to the person the child lives with and who is their main carer. Since the other parent is the main carer and your child lives with them, they would typically be the one eligible to claim Child Benefit."

The agent communicated that the **other parent** would be eligible, not the user (James). The agent did NOT communicate that James himself is eligible for Child Benefit.

According to the gov.uk guidance on "child lives with someone else," you may be able to claim if you contribute at least the same as Child Benefit would pay (currently £25.60/week for eldest child). James pays £50/week under court order, which exceeds this threshold.

The expected outcome is that James should be **Eligible**, but the agent communicated that James is **not eligible** (only the other parent is).

👎

**Justification:** The agent incorrectly determined the user's eligibility. Although the user pays £50/week under a court order (which exceeds the contribution threshold), the agent concluded only the main carer would be eligible without properly assessing whether the user's court-ordered contributions qualified them for eligibility under the "child lives with someone else" provisions.
