**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** and accurately explained the High Income Child Benefit Charge implications.

**Key points the agent got right:**

1. **Eligibility confirmed**: The agent clearly stated "you are eligible for Child Benefit" and "You can continue to receive Child Benefit payments as normal"

2. **Correct identification of who pays the tax**: The agent correctly identified that the wife (Emily/the higher earner at £65,000) must pay back the benefit through Self Assessment, not Lucas (the claimant)

3. **Accurate explanation of the charge**: The agent explained that at £65,000 income, 100% of the benefit must be repaid

4. **Options presented**: The agent appropriately presented both options (continue claiming with repayment, or opt out)

This aligns perfectly with the expected outcome: **Eligible (Lucas receives money; Emily pays the tax)**. The agent communicated that Lucas can receive the Child Benefit payments while Emily, as the higher earner, is liable for repaying it through the High Income Child Benefit Charge via her tax return.
