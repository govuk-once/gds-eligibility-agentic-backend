**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasoning:**

1. **Child in care >8 weeks:** The agent correctly identified that the child has been in local authority foster care for 10 weeks, which exceeds the 8-week threshold that would normally disqualify the claimant.

2. **Contribution requirement satisfied:** The agent properly recognized that the user's household is contributing £30/week towards the child's upkeep through the husband's payments, which exceeds the Child Benefit rate (£25.60 for eldest/only child).

3. **Spousal contribution counts:** Most importantly, the agent correctly applied the rule that contributions from a spouse/partner living in the same household count toward satisfying the contribution requirement. The agent stated: "Your household is contributing £30 per week towards the child's care (through your husband)."

4. **Proper conclusion:** The agent concluded "You should be eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit" based on the household contribution meeting the threshold.

The agent's assessment matches the expected outcome that Beatrice remains eligible because her husband's contributions satisfy the upkeep requirement, even though she personally has no income and cannot contribute directly.
