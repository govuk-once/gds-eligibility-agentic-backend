2026-01-28T20:44:12.394342 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-28T20:44:13.961492 [actor]: child benfit eligibilty son 14 yrs old residental school

2026-01-28T20:44:16.056441 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old son who is at a residential school.

To assess your eligibility properly, I need to ask: Does your son live at the residential school full-time, or does he come home regularly (such as on weekends or during school holidays)?

2026-01-28T20:44:18.329004 [actor]: son at residental scool 10 weeks council pays

2026-01-28T20:44:20.668381 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your son is at a residential school for 10 weeks and the council pays for this.

To help assess your eligibility, I need to understand: Does your son come home to you during school holidays and weekends, or does he stay at the residential school for the entire 10 weeks without coming home?

2026-01-28T20:44:22.527272 [actor]: stays there full time behaviorl needs seveer

2026-01-28T20:44:24.783431 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that. I understand your son stays at the residential school full-time due to severe behavioral needs, and the council pays for this placement.

This is an important question: Are you still responsible for your son - meaning do you still have parental responsibility and maintain contact with him, even though he's living at the residential school full-time?

2026-01-28T20:44:26.465026 [actor]: yes im his mum still responsibel

2026-01-28T20:44:29.042989 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. As his mother, you still have parental responsibility for him.

Now I need to ask: Is the residential school placement temporary (meaning there are plans for him to return home at some point), or is this considered a permanent arrangement?

2026-01-28T20:44:30.896030 [actor]: temporery placemnt for education and behavoir support

2026-01-28T20:44:33.118510 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that this is a temporary placement for education and behavioral support.

One more important question: Is your son's placement at the residential school provided by the local authority as part of their duty to provide education, or is it specifically accommodation provided under care arrangements (such as being "looked after" by the local authority)?

2026-01-28T20:44:34.690522 [actor]: local authority pays for it education and his needs

2026-01-28T20:44:37.313172 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I have one more important question to help determine your eligibility:

Does your son come home to stay with you at all - even if just during school holidays like Christmas, Easter, or summer holidays - or does he remain at the residential school throughout the entire year without coming home?

2026-01-28T20:44:38.650709 [actor]: comes home school holidys

2026-01-28T20:44:43.400415 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you should be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 14-year-old son)
✓ You have parental responsibility for him
✓ He comes home to you during school holidays
✓ The placement is temporary (for education and behavioral support)
✓ Even though the local authority pays for the residential school, he still returns to your care during holidays

When a child is in a residential school but comes home during holidays, you can still claim Child Benefit because you remain responsible for them and they return to live with you during those periods.

The fact that the local authority pays for the placement for educational and behavioral needs, and that it's temporary, doesn't prevent you from claiming Child Benefit - especially since he comes home to you during school holidays.

**You can claim Child Benefit for your son.**

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your eligibility?

2026-01-28T20:44:48.957281 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to gov.uk guidance, when a child is in local authority accommodation (which includes residential schools paid for by the council), Child Benefit can only be claimed for the first 12 weeks. Since the son has been at the residential school for 10 weeks, the parent should only be eligible until week 12, not indefinitely as the agent suggested.
