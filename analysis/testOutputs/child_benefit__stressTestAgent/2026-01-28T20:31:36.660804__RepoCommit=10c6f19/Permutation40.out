2026-01-28T20:52:43.834226 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child who is under 16 years old, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:52:45.189661 [actor]: simon mental health unit 10 weks

2026-01-28T20:52:47.037240 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand there's a child named Simon who is in a mental health unit for 10 weeks.

Let me ask you: **Are you the person who is responsible for Simon, and how old is Simon?**

2026-01-28T20:52:48.542859 [actor]: yes he 15 responsibel for him

2026-01-28T20:52:50.583084 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. So Simon is 15 years old and you're responsible for him, and he's currently in a mental health unit for 10 weeks.

This is important information. Let me ask you the next question:

**Before Simon went into the mental health unit, did he normally live with you?**

2026-01-28T20:52:52.023270 [actor]: yes lives with me normaly

2026-01-28T20:52:53.452023 [root_agent]: Thank you. So Simon normally lives with you when he's not in the mental health unit.

Next question: **Do you normally live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:52:54.909156 [actor]: uk yes live here

2026-01-28T20:52:57.138813 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming you live in the UK.

Now, let me ask: **Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control, or are there any restrictions on your right to live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:52:58.488319 [actor]: no restrictions uk citizen

2026-01-28T20:53:00.549490 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You're a UK citizen with no restrictions.

Now, an important question about your current situation with Simon: **Do you continue to pay for Simon's upkeep while he's in the mental health unit - for example, do you still pay for his clothes, activities, or other costs for him?**

2026-01-28T20:53:02.034594 [actor]: yes pay for his things clothes etc

2026-01-28T20:53:03.929350 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you continue to pay for Simon's upkeep while he's in the mental health unit.

One more important question about this: **Is the mental health unit an NHS facility, or is it a private facility that you're paying for?**

2026-01-28T20:53:05.247964 [actor]: nhs mental health unit secure

2026-01-28T20:53:07.116322 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification - Simon is in a secure NHS mental health unit.

Let me ask: **Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for Simon, or have you been claiming Child Benefit for him already?**

2026-01-28T20:53:08.545490 [actor]: no one else claiming i claim alredy

2026-01-28T20:53:10.563477 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you already claim Child Benefit for Simon and no one else is claiming for him.

One final important question: **How long have you been told Simon will be in the secure mental health unit in total - is it definitely just 10 weeks, or could it be longer?**

2026-01-28T20:53:12.065279 [actor]: 10 weeks told detained under mental helth act

2026-01-28T20:53:16.435193 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you should remain eligible for Child Benefit for Simon while he's in the secure mental health unit.**

Here's why:

✓ You're responsible for Simon who is 15 (under 20)
✓ He normally lives with you
✓ You live in the UK with no immigration restrictions
✓ You continue to pay for his upkeep while he's away
✓ No one else is claiming for him

**Regarding children in care or hospital:** When a child is in hospital or a care facility (including secure mental health units), you can usually continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **12 weeks** if you continue to contribute to their upkeep - which you do.

Since Simon's stay is 10 weeks (which is within the 12-week period), and you're continuing to support him financially, you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit during this time.

**Do you have any other questions about your Child Benefit situation?**

2026-01-28T20:53:18.049237 [actor]: ok thank you understand now

2026-01-28T20:53:21.497399 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that Child Benefit continues for children in hospital or care facilities (including secure mental health units) for up to 12 weeks when the claimant continues to contribute to the child's upkeep, and correctly applied this to the 10-week scenario presented.
