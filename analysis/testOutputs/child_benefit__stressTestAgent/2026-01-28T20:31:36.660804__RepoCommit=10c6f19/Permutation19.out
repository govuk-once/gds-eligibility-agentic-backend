2026-01-28T20:41:33.937753 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you are responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:41:35.540510 [actor]: child benefit holly 9 yrs old separated cant agree

2026-01-28T20:41:37.375284 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. I can see you have a 9-year-old child named Holly and you're separated and can't agree on something with the other parent.

Let me ask: Does Holly currently live with you?

2026-01-28T20:41:38.941171 [actor]: she stays wit me 3 days week buy clothes food

2026-01-28T20:41:40.796761 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Holly stays with you 3 days a week, and you buy her clothes and food.

Let me ask: Does Holly spend the other 4 days of the week with your ex-partner?

2026-01-28T20:41:42.165326 [actor]: yes other parent has her 4 days also buys stuff

2026-01-28T20:41:44.497348 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So Holly spends 3 days with you and 4 days with her other parent, and you both buy things for her.

This is an important situation because when parents are separated and a child spends time living with both parents, only one person can claim Child Benefit for that child.

Let me ask: Is the other parent currently claiming Child Benefit for Holly?

2026-01-28T20:41:46.338990 [actor]: we both submited claim to hmrc cant agree who shoudl get it

2026-01-28T20:41:49.374485 [root_agent]: I understand - you've both submitted claims to HMRC and can't agree who should receive the Child Benefit.

In situations like yours where parents can't agree, HMRC will make the decision based on specific criteria. The main factor they consider is who has **main responsibility** for the child.

Let me ask you: Besides the number of nights Holly stays with you, can you tell me - do you make decisions about Holly's healthcare, education, or general welfare? For example, do you take her to doctor's appointments, attend parent-teacher meetings, or make important decisions about her upbringing?

2026-01-28T20:41:50.913957 [actor]: i buy clothes food for her when shes with me 3 days

2026-01-28T20:41:53.536828 [root_agent]: Thank you. I understand you buy clothes and food for Holly during the 3 days she's with you.

Let me ask about other aspects of her care: Who is registered with Holly's school as the main contact? And who takes Holly to medical appointments like GP visits or dentist appointments?

2026-01-28T20:41:55.238540 [actor]: dunno just want to no if i can get the benefit both claimed

2026-01-28T20:42:00.092912 [root_agent]: I understand you want to know if you can get the benefit since you've both claimed.

Let me be clear about the situation: **Only one person can receive Child Benefit for Holly.** Even though you both contribute to her care and have both submitted claims, HMRC will only pay it to one of you.

When parents can't agree and both have claimed, HMRC will decide who gets it based on who has **main responsibility** for Holly. They look at factors like:
- Who Holly lives with most of the time
- Who is registered as the main contact for school and medical care
- Who makes the main decisions about her welfare

Since Holly spends 4 days with the other parent and 3 days with you, and you're unsure about who handles school and medical matters, this may work against your claim - but HMRC will make the final decision.

Let me ask: Has HMRC contacted either of you yet about your claims, or are you still waiting to hear from them?

2026-01-28T20:42:01.911718 [actor]: waiting to hear just want to no am i eligble or not

2026-01-28T20:42:06.793494 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, let me give you a clear answer:

**You ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit** because:
- Holly is under 16 (she's 9 years old)
- You are responsible for her - you care for her 3 days a week and buy her clothes and food

**However**, the key issue is that **only one person can actually receive the payment** for Holly. Since both you and the other parent have claimed, HMRC will have to decide between you.

The decision will likely favour whoever has **main responsibility**, which HMRC typically determines by:
- Who the child lives with most (Holly is with the other parent 4 days vs your 3 days)
- Who is the main contact for school and healthcare
- Who makes main decisions about her upbringing

Since Holly spends more time with the other parent (4 days vs 3), HMRC may award the Child Benefit to them - but this isn't certain until HMRC reviews both claims and makes their decision.

You'll need to wait for HMRC to contact you with their decision. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?

2026-01-28T20:42:08.278152 [actor]: ok so they will decide got it

2026-01-28T20:42:12.446516 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated "You ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit" when the scenario indicates the expected outcome is that Sue (the character with 3 days custody) is NOT eligible, while Pete (4 days custody) IS eligible. The agent should have concluded that Sue is likely not eligible given Holly spends more time with the other parent.
