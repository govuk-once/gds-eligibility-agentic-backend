**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of the international exception rule**: The agent properly recognized that when a child goes abroad specifically for hospital treatment and the parent continues to pay for their costs, Child Benefit eligibility continues. This is exactly the scenario presented.

2. **Accurate criteria assessment**:
   - Child under 16 (14 years old) ✓
   - UK resident parent ✓
   - Parental responsibility and financial support ✓
   - Temporary absence for medical treatment ✓
   - Intention to return to UK ✓

3. **Proper handling of the 15-week hospitalization**: While the general rule states that Child Benefit stops after 12 weeks in hospital, the agent correctly identified that the international exception applies here - when a child is in hospital **abroad** and only went abroad for that treatment, the 12-week limit does not apply as long as the parent continues to pay for their costs.

4. **Clear communication**: The agent provided a well-reasoned explanation of why eligibility continues, giving the parent confidence in their ongoing entitlement.

The agent's determination matches the expected outcome of **Eligible** and demonstrates proper understanding of the relevant Child Benefit rules.
