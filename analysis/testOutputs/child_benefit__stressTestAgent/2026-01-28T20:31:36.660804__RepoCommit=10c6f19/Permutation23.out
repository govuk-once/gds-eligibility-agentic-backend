2026-01-28T20:43:41.920186 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:43:43.362075 [actor]: child beneffit groceries payment daughter 12

2026-01-28T20:43:45.224313 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 12-year-old daughter, which meets the age requirement.

Now, my next question:

**Do you live in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:43:46.872198 [actor]: yes uk groceries every month 120 pounds

2026-01-28T20:43:48.442993 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you live in the UK and have a 12-year-old daughter.

My next question:

**Are you responsible for your daughter? That is, does she normally live with you?**

2026-01-28T20:43:49.952543 [actor]: dont live with her buy groceries clothes 120 4 weeks

2026-01-28T20:43:52.105534 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your daughter doesn't live with you, but you contribute financially by buying groceries and clothes.

This is an important point for eligibility. Let me ask:

**Does your daughter live with someone else, such as her other parent, a guardian, or another family member?**

2026-01-28T20:43:53.601695 [actor]: she lives with mother i buy bulk groceries every 4 weeks 120 pounds

2026-01-28T20:43:55.920333 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So your daughter lives with her mother, and you provide financial support.

This is important because generally, only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, and it's usually the person the child lives with.

Let me ask:

**Does your daughter's mother currently claim Child Benefit for her?**

2026-01-28T20:43:57.480823 [actor]: dont know about mother just pay 120 groceries 4 weeks

2026-01-28T20:44:01.097274 [root_agent]: I understand. Let me clarify the situation for you.

Based on what you've told me, your daughter lives with her mother, not with you. Under UK Child Benefit rules, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit** because:

- Child Benefit is normally paid to the person the child lives with
- Only one person can get Child Benefit for a child
- Since your daughter lives with her mother (not with you), her mother would be the eligible person to claim

Even though you're providing financial support by buying groceries and clothes, this doesn't make you eligible for Child Benefit if the child doesn't live with you.

However, there are some exceptions. Let me ask one more question:

**Is there a formal arrangement in place where you and the mother share caring responsibilities equally, or does your daughter spend significant time living with you (such as half the week)?**

2026-01-28T20:44:02.685135 [actor]: no she lives with mother full time i just deliver groceries bulk order 4 weeks

2026-01-28T20:44:05.603003 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on all the information you've provided, **you are not eligible for Child Benefit** because:

- Your daughter lives with her mother full time, not with you
- Child Benefit is paid to the person the child normally lives with
- Only one person can claim Child Benefit for each child

Even though you're providing valuable financial support through groceries and other items, this doesn't qualify you for Child Benefit under UK rules.

**Your daughter's mother** would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit, as she's the one your daughter lives with. If she isn't already claiming it, she may want to apply.

Is there anything else about Child Benefit eligibility you'd like me to clarify?

2026-01-28T20:44:07.232011 [actor]: ok understand not eligble thanks

2026-01-28T20:44:10.595138 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter lives with her mother full-time, and Child Benefit is paid to the person the child normally lives with, despite my financial contributions through grocery purchases.
