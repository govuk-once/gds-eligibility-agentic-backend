2026-01-28T20:31:38.911490 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:31:40.843614 [actor]: child benfit yes got kid hes 8 goes to scool

2026-01-28T20:31:42.609130 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have an 8-year-old child who goes to school.

Now, let me ask the next question:

**Does your child normally live with you?**

2026-01-28T20:31:43.947154 [actor]: yeah he lives with us in manchester

2026-01-28T20:31:46.051810 [root_agent]: Great, thank you. So your child lives with you in Manchester.

Next question:

**Are you or your partner subject to immigration control, or do either of you have a "no recourse to public funds" condition on your visa or immigration status?**

2026-01-28T20:31:47.422106 [actor]: uk nationals both of us born here

2026-01-28T20:31:49.651046 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that. As UK nationals, you wouldn't have immigration restrictions.

One more important question:

**Are you the person with main responsibility for your child? In other words, are you the main person who looks after and makes decisions about your child's day-to-day care?**

2026-01-28T20:31:51.247477 [actor]: yes we look after him hes our son lives with us

2026-01-28T20:31:54.762780 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** because:

✓ You have a child under 16 (your 8-year-old son)
✓ Your child lives with you 
✓ Your child is in education (attending school)
✓ You are UK nationals with no immigration restrictions
✓ You have main responsibility for your child's care

You should be able to claim Child Benefit for your son. 

Just one thing to be aware of: If you or your partner earns over £60,000 a year, you may need to pay some or all of the Child Benefit back through the High Income Child Benefit Charge, though you can still claim it.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:31:59.647748 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on having a child under 16 who lives with them, attends school, and for whom they have main responsibility, with no immigration restrictions as UK nationals.
