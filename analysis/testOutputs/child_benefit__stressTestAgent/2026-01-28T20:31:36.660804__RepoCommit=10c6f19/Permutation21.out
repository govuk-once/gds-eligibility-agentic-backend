2026-01-28T20:42:43.446605 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Are you responsible for a child under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-28T20:42:45.173727 [actor]: child beneffit eligbility divorced kids live seprate

2026-01-28T20:42:47.471540 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. I understand you're divorced and your children live separately from you.

Let me ask you a specific question to help assess your eligibility:

**Do your children live with you for at least part of the time, or do they live with your ex-partner (or someone else) full-time?**

2026-01-28T20:42:48.795945 [actor]: one kid lives with me sam hes 10

2026-01-28T20:42:50.556801 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So Sam, who is 10, lives with you.

**Do you have any other children, and if so, where do they live and how old are they?**

2026-01-28T20:42:52.020737 [actor]: ella 8 lives with ex

2026-01-28T20:42:54.389646 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you have:
- Sam (10) who lives with you
- Ella (8) who lives with your ex-partner

**For Sam who lives with you - are you the main person responsible for him? By this I mean, are you the one who is mainly looking after him and meeting his day-to-day needs?**

2026-01-28T20:42:56.009727 [actor]: yes i look after sam he lives here with me

2026-01-28T20:42:58.059136 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

**Based on what you've told me, you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam, since he lives with you and you're responsible for him.**

However, regarding Ella who lives with your ex-partner, only one person can get Child Benefit for a child. 

**Is your ex-partner currently claiming Child Benefit for Ella?**

2026-01-28T20:42:59.677097 [actor]: yes ex claims for ella

2026-01-28T20:43:02.307294 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

**Based on the information you've provided, here's your eligibility status:**

✓ **You are eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam** - since he lives with you and you're responsible for him.

✗ **You cannot claim Child Benefit for Ella** - since your ex-partner is already claiming for her, and only one person can receive Child Benefit for each child.

**Do you have any questions about claiming Child Benefit for Sam, or is there anything else you'd like to know about your eligibility?**

2026-01-28T20:43:07.487402 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that I am eligible to claim Child Benefit for Sam (who lives with me) but cannot claim for Ella (who lives with my ex-partner who is already claiming), which aligns with the rules that only one person can claim Child Benefit per child and that the claimant must be responsible for the child.
