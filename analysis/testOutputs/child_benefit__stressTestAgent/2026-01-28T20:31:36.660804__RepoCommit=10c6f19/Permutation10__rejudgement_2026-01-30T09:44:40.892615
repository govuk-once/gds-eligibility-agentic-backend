**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Correct identification of key facts:** The agent properly established that:
   - Liam is a foster child placed by the local council
   - The user receives fostering allowances from the council
   - Liam is 12 years old (within the age criteria)

2. **Accurate application of eligibility rules:** The agent correctly applied the restriction that states: "You cannot claim Child Benefit for a fostered child if the council is paying for their accommodation or maintenance."

3. **Clear communication:** The agent explicitly stated "You are not eligible for Child Benefit for Liam" and provided a clear explanation of why this is the case.

4. **Alignment with expected outcome:** The expected outcome is "Not Eligible" because Criteria 4 specifically states that you cannot claim Child Benefit when the council pays for the child's upkeep. The agent's determination matches this perfectly.

The agent's assessment was thorough, accurate, and properly communicated the ineligibility based on the fostering allowance situation.
