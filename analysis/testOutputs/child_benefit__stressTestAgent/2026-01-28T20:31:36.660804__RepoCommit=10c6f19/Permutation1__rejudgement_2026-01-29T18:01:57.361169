**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Child's age and education**: The child is 8 years old (under 16) and attends school - satisfies Criteria 2
2. **Responsibility**: The user confirmed they look after the child and he is their son - satisfies Criteria 1
3. **Living arrangements**: The child lives with the parents in Manchester - satisfies Criteria 4
4. **Residency/Immigration**: Both parents are UK nationals born in the UK - satisfies Criteria 3
5. **No state support issues**: Child lives at home, not in hospital or care - satisfies Criteria 5
6. **Income**: No mention of income over £60,000 (the scenario indicates highest income is £35,000) - satisfies Criteria 6

The agent systematically gathered the necessary information, correctly applied the eligibility criteria, and clearly communicated that the user "appears to be eligible for Child Benefit." The agent also appropriately mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge as a caveat, showing thoroughness.

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent matches the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
