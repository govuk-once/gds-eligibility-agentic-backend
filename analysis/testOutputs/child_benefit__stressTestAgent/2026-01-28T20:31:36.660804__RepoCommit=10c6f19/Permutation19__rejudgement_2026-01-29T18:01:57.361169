**Justification:**

The agent's communication of the eligibility outcome does NOT agree with the expected outcome.

**Expected Outcome:** Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible.

**What the agent communicated:** The agent told the user (who has the child 3 days per week) that they ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit, but noted that HMRC would decide between the two parents based on main responsibility, likely favoring the parent with 4 days custody.

**The problem:** Based on the conversation, the user is Pete (3 days custody), not Sue. The agent told Pete he is eligible, when according to the expected outcome, Pete should be Not Eligible and Sue (4 days custody) should be Eligible.

The agent's statement "You ARE eligible to claim Child Benefit" directly contradicts the expected outcome that Pete is Not Eligible. While the agent correctly explained that HMRC would make the final decision and that the 4-day parent would likely be favored, the agent still affirmed Pete's eligibility when they should have communicated that Pete is not eligible given Sue has main responsibility (more days of care).
