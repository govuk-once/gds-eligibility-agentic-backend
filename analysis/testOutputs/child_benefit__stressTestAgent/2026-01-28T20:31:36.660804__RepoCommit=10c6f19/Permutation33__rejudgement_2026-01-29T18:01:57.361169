**Justification:**

The agent incorrectly determined that the user was **eligible** for Child Benefit, when the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**.

The critical error lies in the agent's assessment of Bella's training program. The agent accepted that "employer-funded travel agency training" qualifies as "approved training" for Child Benefit purposes. However, according to the eligibility criteria:

1. **Approved education or training** for Child Benefit has a specific definition
2. For training to qualify, it must be part of recognized schemes (such as government-approved apprenticeships, traineeships, or programs with approved training providers)
3. **Employer-funded workplace training does not automatically qualify** as "approved training" under Child Benefit rules

The key distinction is that Bella's training is:
- Fully paid for by her employer (the travel agency)
- Not described as a standard government apprenticeship
- Workplace-based training rather than a formally approved training scheme

The eligibility criteria specify that education/training must be "approved" and typically excludes employer-funded workplace training that isn't part of a recognized qualification framework. The agent failed to properly verify whether this specific type of employer-funded training meets the definition of "approved training" and incorrectly concluded the applicant was eligible.

The agent communicated an outcome of **Eligible**, but the expected outcome is **Not Eligible**, therefore the agent failed to communicate the correct eligibility determination.
