2026-01-28T20:54:25.152144 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have any children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-28T20:54:26.750860 [actor]: child benefit for 17 year old appretice wales

2026-01-28T20:54:29.691044 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I can see you're asking about a 17-year-old apprentice in Wales.

To help determine eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is the 17-year-old in approved education or training?** 

(Apprenticeships can count as approved training, but I need to confirm the details of their specific situation.)

2026-01-28T20:54:31.163241 [actor]: daughter doing foundaton apprenticship left school

2026-01-28T20:54:34.422436 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So your daughter is 17, has left school, and is doing a foundation apprenticeship.

Let me ask an important question:

**Is the foundation apprenticeship an approved course - meaning it's unpaid and for 12 or more hours per week in education or training?**

(This is important because for Child Benefit to continue for 16-19 year olds, they need to be in approved education or training, which includes unpaid training courses of at least 12 hours per week. However, if she's receiving wages as part of her apprenticeship, this may affect eligibility.)

2026-01-28T20:54:35.866609 [actor]: its funded by welsh goverment cardiff

2026-01-28T20:54:38.247422 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Let me ask a crucial question to determine eligibility:

**Is your daughter receiving a wage or salary as part of her foundation apprenticeship, or is it unpaid training?**

(This is the key factor - if she's being paid as part of the apprenticeship, she would not qualify for Child Benefit. However, if it's unpaid training of 12+ hours per week, she may still be eligible.)

2026-01-28T20:54:39.734787 [actor]: just need to know if i can get child benefit

2026-01-28T20:54:41.907660 [root_agent]: I understand you need a clear answer. To give you accurate guidance, I really do need to know this important detail:

**Is your daughter receiving any wages or payment as part of her foundation apprenticeship?**

This directly determines whether Child Benefit can continue. Once you answer this, I'll be able to tell you if you're eligible.

2026-01-28T20:54:43.466585 [actor]: foundation apprenticship wales 17 year old eligable

2026-01-28T20:54:46.678383 [root_agent]: I understand you're looking for a definitive answer about eligibility. Let me clarify the situation based on the rules:

**For a 17-year-old doing a foundation apprenticeship in Wales to qualify you for Child Benefit, the apprenticeship must be unpaid (or they receive only expenses) and be for at least 12 hours per week.**

So my question is:

**Does your daughter receive wages/salary from her foundation apprenticeship, or does she only receive expenses or no payment at all?**

This is the deciding factor for eligibility, and I need this information to give you an accurate answer about whether you can claim Child Benefit.

2026-01-28T20:54:47.965680 [actor]: she gets training allowance not wages

2026-01-28T20:54:50.628444 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that she receives a training allowance rather than wages.

Let me ask one more important question:

**How many hours per week is the foundation apprenticeship - is it 12 hours or more per week of education or training?**

(If the apprenticeship is 12+ hours per week and she's receiving an allowance rather than wages, this is looking positive for eligibility, but I need to confirm the hours.)

2026-01-28T20:54:52.170422 [actor]: yes 12 hours foundation apprenticship wales approved training

2026-01-28T20:54:55.801202 [root_agent]: Excellent! Based on the information you've provided, let me assess your eligibility:

Your daughter is:
- 17 years old
- Doing an approved foundation apprenticeship in Wales
- Attending 12+ hours per week of training
- Receiving a training allowance (not wages)

**You should be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training. An approved training course must be unpaid (or only expenses/training allowance paid) and for at least 12 hours per week. Your daughter's foundation apprenticeship meets these criteria.

Now, let me ask one final question to complete the assessment:

**Are you responsible for your daughter - meaning does she live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards her costs?**

2026-01-28T20:54:57.202151 [actor]: yes she lives with me in cardiff

2026-01-28T20:55:00.150823 [root_agent]: Perfect! Based on all the information you've provided, **you are eligible for Child Benefit**.

Here's why:
- Your daughter is 17 (under 20)
- She's doing an approved foundation apprenticeship in Wales
- It's 12+ hours per week of training
- She receives a training allowance (not wages)
- She lives with you, so you're responsible for her

You meet all the criteria for Child Benefit. If you're not already claiming it, you can apply. If you were already claiming and it stopped when she left school, you should notify HMRC about her apprenticeship so they can continue your payments.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-28T20:55:02.834017 [actor]: okay thankyou

2026-01-28T20:55:05.098541 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a 17-year-old doing a Welsh government-funded foundation apprenticeship (12+ hours/week, receiving training allowance rather than wages, living at home) qualifies the parent for Child Benefit under the approved education/training provisions for 16-19 year olds.
