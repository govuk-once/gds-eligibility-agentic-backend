2026-01-30T10:10:33.054866 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated the correct eligibility outcome.

**Justification:**

The expected outcome for this scenario is **Not Eligible**, and the agent clearly communicated this outcome to the user.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct application of responsibility criteria**: The agent properly identified that Child Benefit eligibility depends on who the child lives with AND who is mainly responsible for day-to-day care decisions, not merely financial contribution amounts.

2. **Clear communication of ineligibility**: The agent explicitly stated: "Based on what you've told me, **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit** in this situation."

3. **Accurate reasoning**: The agent correctly explained that:
   - The daughter lives with her mother
   - The mother makes all day-to-day care decisions
   - Therefore, the mother would be the eligible person to claim
   - Financial contributions alone do not establish eligibility when the child lives with someone else who provides care

4. **Proper distinction**: The agent appropriately distinguished between the user's financial support obligations as a parent and Child Benefit eligibility criteria.

The agent's determination aligns perfectly with the expected outcome (Not Eligible) based on the scenario details: Mike only contributes £10/week (well below the £26.05/week Child Benefit rate threshold), and Emma's mother is the primary caregiver making day-to-day decisions.
