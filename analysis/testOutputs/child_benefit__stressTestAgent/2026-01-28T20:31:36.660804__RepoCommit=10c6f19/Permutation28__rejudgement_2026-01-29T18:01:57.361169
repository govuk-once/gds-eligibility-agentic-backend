**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key reasons supporting this assessment:**

1. **Immigration Status/Right to Reside:** The agent properly identified that the user's tourist visa has a "no recourse to public funds" condition, which explicitly prohibits claiming Child Benefit and other UK public benefits.

2. **Ordinary Residence:** The agent correctly noted that the user is visiting temporarily for 6 months rather than being ordinarily resident in the UK (where the UK would be their main home).

3. **Clear Communication:** The agent provided a clear, structured explanation with three numbered points explaining why the user does not qualify, making the negative eligibility determination easy to understand.

4. **Accurate Legal Understanding:** The agent demonstrated proper understanding that Child Benefit is designed for people who are settled in the UK or have the right to access public funds, which a standard tourist visa holder does not have.

The agent's conclusion that the user is "not eligible for Child Benefit" directly matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible" based on the Right to Reside failure criteria outlined in the scenario.
