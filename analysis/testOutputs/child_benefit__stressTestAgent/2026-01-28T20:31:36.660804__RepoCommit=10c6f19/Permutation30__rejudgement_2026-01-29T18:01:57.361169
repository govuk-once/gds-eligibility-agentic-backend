**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit** and accurately explained the High Income Child Benefit Charge implications. This aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points the agent got right:**

1. **Eligibility confirmed**: The agent stated "you are eligible for Child Benefit" - this is correct since Lucas meets all the basic criteria (responsible for child under 16, lives in UK, child lives with him full-time).

2. **Lucas receives the payments**: The agent acknowledged that Lucas fills out the form and receives payments in his bank account - consistent with the scenario.

3. **Emily pays the tax charge**: The agent correctly identified that "the partner with the higher income (in this case, your wife earning £65,000) will need to pay back some or all of the Child Benefit through the tax system via a Self Assessment tax return" - this is the correct application of the High Income Child Benefit Charge rules.

4. **Full repayment required**: The agent accurately calculated that at £65,000 income, 100% of the benefit must be repaid.

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome: **Eligible (Lucas receives money; Emily pays the tax).**
