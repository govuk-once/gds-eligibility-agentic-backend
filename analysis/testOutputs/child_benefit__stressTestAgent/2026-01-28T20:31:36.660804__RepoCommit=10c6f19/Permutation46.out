2026-01-28T20:56:40.673820 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?

2026-01-28T20:56:42.348033 [actor]: child benefit jobseeker presettled stauts 95 days no job

2026-01-28T20:56:44.378302 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. Let me ask a specific question to help assess your eligibility:

Do you have a child or children who are either under 16 years old, or under 20 years old and in approved education or training?

2026-01-28T20:56:45.835103 [actor]: yes kid 8 years old

2026-01-28T20:56:48.125175 [root_agent]: Thank you. So you have an 8-year-old child, which meets the age requirement.

Now, are you responsible for this child? By this I mean - does the child live with you, or do you contribute at least the same amount as Child Benefit would pay towards the child's upkeep?

2026-01-28T20:56:49.509763 [actor]: kid lives with me

2026-01-28T20:56:51.224508 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful information.

Now, regarding your immigration status - you mentioned you have pre-settled status. Are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-28T20:56:52.746210 [actor]: yes living in uk looking for work 95 days now

2026-01-28T20:56:54.555371 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're living in the UK.

Regarding your pre-settled status and your job search - are you currently receiving any benefits or support while looking for work, such as Jobseeker's Allowance or Universal Credit?

2026-01-28T20:56:55.998851 [actor]: not recieving benifits just looking for work no job offers

2026-01-28T20:56:57.992479 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question: Are you or your partner (if you have one) subject to immigration control? Specifically, does your visa or immigration status have a condition that states you have "no recourse to public funds"?

2026-01-28T20:56:59.433633 [actor]: presettled status no recorse to public funds condition

2026-01-28T20:57:01.628565 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that your pre-settled status does not have a "no recourse to public funds" condition.

One final question to confirm your eligibility: Is anyone else claiming Child Benefit for this same 8-year-old child?

2026-01-28T20:57:03.173514 [actor]: no one else claiming for child

2026-01-28T20:57:06.785941 [root_agent]: Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have an 8-year-old child (under 16)
✓ The child lives with you (you're responsible for them)
✓ You're living in the UK
✓ You have pre-settled status with no "no recourse to public funds" condition
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for this child

Your employment status (currently looking for work) does not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit - you don't need to be working to claim it.

You can apply for Child Benefit and should receive payments to help with the costs of raising your child. The fact that you're job-seeking and not currently receiving other benefits doesn't prevent you from claiming Child Benefit.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or the application process?

2026-01-28T20:57:12.176426 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. According to UK Child Benefit eligibility rules for those with pre-settled status, individuals must be working, self-employed, or meet specific exemptions (such as retaining worker status) to be eligible. Someone with pre-settled status who has been job-seeking for 95 days without employment and not receiving benefits does not meet the right to reside test required for Child Benefit eligibility.
