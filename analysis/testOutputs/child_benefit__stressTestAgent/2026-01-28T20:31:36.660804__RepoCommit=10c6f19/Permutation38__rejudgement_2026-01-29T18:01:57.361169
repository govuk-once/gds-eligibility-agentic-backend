**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible for Child Benefit**, which aligns with the expected outcome. 

More importantly, the agent accurately explained the backdating limitation: "You can backdate your claim for up to 3 months from the date you make your claim, so it's important to apply as soon as possible to minimize any loss of payments."

When the user explicitly asked for confirmation ("so I lost one month money cant get it back"), while the agent didn't provide a direct response to this follow-up question in the visible transcript, the agent had already correctly communicated the 3-month backdating rule, which implicitly confirms that the first month (month 1 of 4) cannot be recovered.

The expected outcome was: **Eligible (but only for the last 3 months; they lose the first month's money)** - and this is precisely what the agent communicated. The user will be eligible for months 2, 3, and 4, but will lose month 1 due to the 3-month backdating limit.
