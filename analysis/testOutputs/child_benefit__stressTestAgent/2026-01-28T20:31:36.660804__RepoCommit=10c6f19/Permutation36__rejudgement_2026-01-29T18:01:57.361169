**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.

The agent's assessment was thorough and accurate:

1. **Age criterion**: The daughter is 16 years old (under 20) ✓

2. **Terminal dates/summer gap**: The agent correctly identified that Child Benefit continues during the gap between finishing GCSEs in June and starting college in September, stating: "You should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit during the period between your daughter finishing school in August and starting college in September, as this is a recognized gap between leaving school and starting further education." ✓

3. **Approved education**: A-levels are approved full-time education (at least 12 hours/week supervised study) ✓

4. **Responsibility**: The mother lives with and is responsible for the daughter ✓

5. **UK residency**: Confirmed ✓

6. **Single claimant**: No one else claiming ✓

7. **Income threshold**: Under £50,000, so no High Income Child Benefit Charge ✓

The agent specifically addressed the key issue in this scenario—the "summer gap"—and correctly advised that eligibility continues through this period. This matches the guidance that Child Benefit does not stop immediately when school ends if the child has been accepted into further approved education starting in the next term.
