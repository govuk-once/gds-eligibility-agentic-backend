2026-01-28T20:39:55.860742 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with a basic question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:39:57.597780 [actor]: son 14 yrs hospital treatmnt usa 15 weks

2026-01-28T20:40:00.038105 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 14-year-old son who is receiving hospital treatment in the USA for 15 weeks.

Let me ask you this:

**Do you normally live in the UK, and is your son's usual home also in the UK?**

2026-01-28T20:40:01.530871 [actor]: yes uk resident son went usa only for hospital rare condtion

2026-01-28T20:40:03.961853 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. So you're both UK residents and your son has only gone to the USA temporarily for hospital treatment for a rare condition.

Let me ask you:

**Are you the person who is responsible for your son - meaning you're the one who looks after him and meets the costs of supporting him (like food, clothing, and other living expenses)?**

2026-01-28T20:40:05.384620 [actor]: yes pay for his costs visit when can incidental expenses

2026-01-28T20:40:07.229358 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. You're responsible for your son's costs and visit when you can to support him.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Is your son expected to return to the UK after his hospital treatment is complete, or is this a permanent move to the USA?**

2026-01-28T20:40:08.811359 [actor]: temporary treatmnt specialist hospital coming back uk after

2026-01-28T20:40:10.713862 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Your son will be returning to the UK after the treatment.

Now, let me ask you about your current situation:

**Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for your son, or are you applying for the first time?**

2026-01-28T20:40:12.351559 [actor]: currently receving wondering if still eligble been gone 15 weeks

2026-01-28T20:40:14.535977 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying - you're currently receiving Child Benefit and are concerned about whether you remain eligible while your son has been in the USA for 15 weeks for hospital treatment.

Let me ask you one more question to complete my assessment:

**Is the hospital treatment in the USA being provided or paid for by the NHS, or are you paying for it privately?**

2026-01-28T20:40:16.132473 [actor]: private paying ourselves specialist treatmnt not availble uk

2026-01-28T20:40:22.111588 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. Let me assess your eligibility based on what you've told me.

**Good news - you should still be eligible for Child Benefit.**

Here's why:

✓ You are a UK resident
✓ Your son is under 16 (he's 14)
✓ You are responsible for him and paying for his costs
✓ Your son normally lives with you in the UK
✓ He is only temporarily abroad for hospital treatment for a rare condition
✓ He will be returning to the UK after treatment

**Important points about children in hospital:**

When a child is in hospital (including abroad), you can usually continue to receive Child Benefit as long as:
- The child's absence from the UK is temporary
- They intend to return to the UK
- They normally live with you

The 15-week period your son has been away for specialist medical treatment should not affect your eligibility, as this is a temporary medical situation and he will be coming back.

You should continue to receive your Child Benefit as normal. If you have any concerns or if HMRC contacts you about this, you can explain that your son is temporarily abroad for essential medical treatment that isn't available in the UK.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit situation?

2026-01-28T20:40:24.896593 [actor]: ok thank you thats helpful

2026-01-28T20:40:27.258879 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the claimant remains eligible for Child Benefit while their son is temporarily abroad for hospital treatment, correctly identifying all relevant eligibility criteria including UK residency, the child being under 16, parental responsibility, and the temporary nature of the absence for medical treatment.
