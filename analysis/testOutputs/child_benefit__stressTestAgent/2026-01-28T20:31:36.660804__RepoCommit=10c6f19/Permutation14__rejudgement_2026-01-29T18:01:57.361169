**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key factors supporting this assessment:**

1. **Temporary absence within 8-week rule**: The child has been with the grandmother for 6 weeks, which is within the 8-week threshold mentioned in the scenario guidance. According to UK Child Benefit rules, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 8 weeks when a child temporarily lives with someone else.

2. **No competing claim**: The grandmother is not claiming Child Benefit, which is crucial for maintaining the mother's eligibility during the temporary arrangement.

3. **Continued responsibility**: Sophie (the mother) remains responsible for Noah and contributes to his upkeep, which the agent correctly verified.

4. **Temporary nature**: The arrangement is clearly temporary due to the mother's surgery recovery, not a permanent change in living arrangements.

5. **UK residency**: Both mother and child are UK residents.

The agent's conclusion that "temporary stays with relatives (like while you recover from surgery) don't affect your entitlement to Child Benefit, as long as you're still responsible for the child" is accurate and appropriately applied to this situation.

The eligibility outcome communicated by the agent agrees with the expected outcome of **Eligible**.
