**Justification:**

The agent correctly communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Key points supporting this assessment:**

1. **Correct distinction made**: The agent properly distinguished between "approved education" (A-levels, college) and "advanced education" (university degrees)

2. **Clear outcome communicated**: The agent explicitly stated "You are no longer eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter" and "Child Benefit would have ended when she left college and started university"

3. **Accurate reasoning**: The agent correctly explained that university degree courses do not count as approved education for Child Benefit purposes, which is consistent with the gov.uk guidance that advanced education (university degrees, BTEC Higher Nationals) does not qualify

4. **Appropriate advice given**: The agent advised the user to inform the Child Benefit Office if still receiving payments, as they should have stopped

The agent's communication matches the expected outcome that the user is **Not Eligible** because Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education such as a university degree.
