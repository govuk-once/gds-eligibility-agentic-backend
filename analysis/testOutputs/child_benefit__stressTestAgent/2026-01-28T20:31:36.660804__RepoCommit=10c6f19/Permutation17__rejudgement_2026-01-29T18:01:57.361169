2026-01-29T18:26:08.051923 [confirmation_judge]: 👍 The agent communicated an eligibility outcome that agrees with the expected outcome.

**Justification:** The agent correctly determined that Major Thompson is **eligible** for UK Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible."

The agent's assessment was accurate because:
1. The agent identified that the applicant has two children aged 8 and 10 (meeting the age requirement)
2. The agent correctly recognized that members of HM Forces on overseas postings are treated as UK residents for Child Benefit purposes, despite physically living in Germany
3. The agent verified that no duplicate benefits were being received from Germany or another country
4. The agent properly concluded that as a Crown servant (British Armed Forces member) posted abroad, the applicant qualifies for UK Child Benefit

This aligns with the official guidance that Crown servants posted overseas are exempt from the standard requirement to be physically present in the UK, making them eligible for Child Benefit. The agent's final determination of eligibility is correct and matches the expected outcome.
