**Justification:**

The agent communicated that the user is **not eligible** for Child Benefit. However, the expected outcome is that the user should be **eligible**.

According to the gov.uk guidance on child benefit when a child lives with someone else (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else), a person can claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with them if they contribute at least the amount of Child Benefit towards the child's upkeep.

In this scenario:
- Mo contributes £15/week
- Mo's mother (the grandmother) also contributes £15/week
- Combined total = £30/week
- This exceeds the £26.05 threshold mentioned in the scenario criteria

The guidance explicitly states that contributions from multiple people can be aggregated, and as long as the total contributions meet or exceed the Child Benefit amount, the person can claim.

The agent failed to:
1. Ask about other contributors to the child's upkeep
2. Recognize that combined contributions could meet the threshold
3. Understand that financial contribution alone can establish eligibility when the child lives elsewhere and the primary carer is not claiming

The agent's conclusion that the user is "not eligible" directly contradicts the expected outcome of "Eligible" based on the combined contribution rule.
