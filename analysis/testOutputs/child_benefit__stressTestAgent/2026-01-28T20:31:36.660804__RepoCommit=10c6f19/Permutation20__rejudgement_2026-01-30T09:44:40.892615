**Justification:**

The agent correctly determined that Maria is **eligible** for Child Benefit, which aligns with the expected outcome.

**Analysis:**

1. **Responsibility Criterion (Met):** The agent properly established that Maria is responsible for Lucia's day-to-day care, as she pays for everything including clothes, food, and school supplies.

2. **Relationship Criterion (Met):** The agent correctly recognized that you don't need to be a parent to claim Child Benefit. Grandparents can claim if they have responsibility for the child. This is consistent with the guidance that informal family arrangements qualify as long as the local council isn't paying for accommodation (which wasn't mentioned as a factor here).

3. **Other Requirements (Met):** The agent verified:
   - Child is under 16 (Lucia is 14) ✓
   - Child lives with the applicant ✓
   - No one else is claiming Child Benefit ✓
   - UK residency ✓
   - No immigration restrictions ✓

4. **Clear Communication:** The agent communicated a clear eligibility determination: "you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit" and "You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for your granddaughter."

The agent's assessment matches the expected outcome that Maria is eligible under the informal guardian arrangement, where she has taken on full responsibility for her granddaughter without formal legal orders.
