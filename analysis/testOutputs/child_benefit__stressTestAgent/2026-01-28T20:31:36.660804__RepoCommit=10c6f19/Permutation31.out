2026-01-28T20:47:49.330943 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-28T20:47:53.996059 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have an 18-year-old who is a university student living at home.

To help determine your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Is your 18-year-old in full-time non-advanced education or approved training (rather than university/higher education)?**

This is important because Child Benefit eligibility for 16-20 year olds depends on them being in approved education or training, which typically means courses up to A-level or equivalent standard, rather than university degree courses.

2026-01-28T20:47:59.430322 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. 

I need to let you know that **university degree courses do not qualify as approved education for Child Benefit purposes**. Child Benefit for young people aged 16-20 only covers non-advanced education (such as A-levels or equivalent) or approved training - not university degrees.

This means that **Child Benefit would have stopped when your daughter left approved education** (likely after finishing her A-levels or equivalent qualification) and started her university degree course.

However, let me ask one more question to be thorough:

**When did your daughter turn 16, and was she receiving Child Benefit for her continuously up until she started university?**

This will help confirm the timeline and when the benefit should have ended.

2026-01-28T20:48:04.539616 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Based on what you've told me, I need to give you some important information:

**You are no longer eligible for Child Benefit for your daughter** now that she has started university. Here's why:

- Child Benefit stops when a young person finishes non-advanced education (like college/A-levels)
- University degree courses do **not** count as approved education for Child Benefit purposes
- Child Benefit would have ended when she left college and started university, even though she's still only 18

**Important:** If you're still receiving Child Benefit payments for her, you need to inform the Child Benefit Office immediately that she has started university, as you should no longer be receiving these payments.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or this situation?

2026-01-28T20:48:09.249199 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit stops when a child starts university (advanced education) and only continues for non-advanced education like A-levels, correctly concluding that I am not eligible since my 18-year-old daughter has started a university degree.
