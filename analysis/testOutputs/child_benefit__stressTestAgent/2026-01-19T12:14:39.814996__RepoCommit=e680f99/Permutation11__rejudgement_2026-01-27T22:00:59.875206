2026-01-27T22:03:58.030590 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly determined that the intermediate apprenticeship in England qualifies as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes, but government-funded apprenticeships in England are actually disqualifying events for Child Benefit. Karen is not eligible and must stop her claim.
