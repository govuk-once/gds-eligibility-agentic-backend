2026-01-19T12:15:02.723874 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have responsibility for a child under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:15:04.022926 [actor]: I'll role-play as the user in this scenario about child benefit eligibility.

daughter college student Priya seventeen

2026-01-19T12:15:06.218303 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So you have a 17-year-old daughter named Priya who's in college.

Is Priya in approved education or training? This would typically include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, home education (if it started before your child turned 16), or certain other approved courses.

2026-01-19T12:15:07.134684 [actor]: A-levels local college lives with me

2026-01-19T12:15:09.045348 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Priya is 17 years old, attending a local college for A-levels, and lives with you, that's helpful information for determining eligibility.

Next question: Are you responsible for Priya? By this I mean, do you provide for her basic needs and have main day-to-day responsibility for her care?

2026-01-19T12:15:10.121825 [actor]: single dad yes her guardian

2026-01-19T12:15:11.526434 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know you're a single father and Priya's guardian.

Are you or Priya living in the United Kingdom?

2026-01-19T12:15:12.750321 [actor]: London resident many years

2026-01-19T12:15:14.074802 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're a London resident of many years.

Do either you or Priya have any immigration restrictions on your stay in the UK, or are you both UK citizens or have settled status?

2026-01-19T12:15:15.002436 [actor]: uk citizens both of us

2026-01-19T12:15:19.445653 [root_agent]: I'll reflect on your eligibility based on the information you've shared:
- You're a single father and legal guardian of 17-year-old Priya
- Priya is attending A-levels at a local college (approved education)
- Priya lives with you
- You're both UK citizens and London residents

Based on this information and the UK government's Child Benefit eligibility criteria, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit since:
- You have responsibility for a child under 20 who is in approved education
- You both live in the UK and are UK citizens
- You are Priya's guardian and responsible for her care

As a single parent with a child in approved education who lives with you, you should be eligible to claim Child Benefit. The current rates are £25.60 per week for your eldest or only child.

Would you like to know about the application process or do you have any other questions about Child Benefit?

2026-01-19T12:15:22.990772 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent provided accurate information that a single parent responsible for a 17-year-old in approved education (A-levels) who lives with them and is a UK citizen qualifies for Child Benefit.
