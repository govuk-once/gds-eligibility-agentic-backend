2026-01-28T12:50:22.931057 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly determined the user was eligible for Child Benefit. A government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England is actually a disqualifying event for Child Benefit. The agent should have communicated that Karen is not eligible and must stop her claim.
