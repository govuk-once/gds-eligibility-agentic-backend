Based on the UK government guidance, when a child lives with someone else, a person can still be eligible for Child Benefit if they contribute at least £26.05 a week toward the child's upkeep. The combined contributions from Mo and the grandmother (£30) exceed this threshold, making Mo eligible, but the agent incorrectly stated that Mo was not eligible.
