2026-01-19T12:16:42.570968 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in the UK. To assess this properly, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children that you're responsible for who are under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:16:43.574563 [actor]: Child benefit eligibility daughter in hospital

2026-01-19T12:16:45.353365 [root_agent]: I understand your daughter is in hospital. I'm sorry to hear that, and I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.

How long has your daughter been in hospital? This information will help me understand if there are any specific rules that apply to your situation.

2026-01-19T12:16:46.298036 [actor]: 14 weeks Chloe sick

2026-01-19T12:16:48.866544 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information. I'm sorry to hear that Chloe has been unwell and in hospital for 14 weeks.

Based on the UK government guidelines for Child Benefit, if your child is in hospital, you can typically continue to receive Child Benefit as normal, regardless of how long they're staying there.

May I ask how old Chloe is? This will help me confirm your eligibility.

2026-01-19T12:16:49.635465 [actor]: Chloe 6 years old

2026-01-19T12:16:52.859547 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Chloe is 6 years old and currently in hospital, you should still be eligible for Child Benefit.

For children in hospital, Child Benefit continues to be paid as normal regardless of the length of hospital stay. This is because you're still considered responsible for Chloe even while she's receiving medical care.

Are you currently the person who is primarily responsible for Chloe? (This typically means the person who Chloe normally lives with and who takes care of her day-to-day needs.)

2026-01-19T12:16:54.066122 [actor]: visiting daily mother

2026-01-19T12:16:56.558417 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. The fact that you're visiting her daily as her mother indicates you're maintaining your parental responsibility.

For Child Benefit purposes, you would still be considered responsible for Chloe while she's in hospital, especially as you're visiting her daily and maintaining your role as her mother.

Do you normally live in the UK? This is another important eligibility factor for Child Benefit.

2026-01-19T12:16:57.781088 [actor]: yes uk live in london

2026-01-19T12:17:00.977023 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you live in London, UK.

Based on the information you've provided:
- Your daughter Chloe is 6 years old
- She's currently in hospital (for 14 weeks)
- You're her mother and visit her daily
- You live in the UK (London)

You should be eligible for Child Benefit. When a child is in hospital, Child Benefit continues to be paid as normal to the person who is responsible for the child, regardless of how long the hospital stay is.

Is there anything else about your situation that might affect your eligibility that you'd like me to address?

2026-01-19T12:17:02.138992 [actor]: buying books clothes food for her

2026-01-19T12:17:05.714507 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that additional information. The fact that you're buying books, clothes, and food for Chloe further demonstrates that you're maintaining your parental responsibility while she's in hospital.

This additional detail supports your eligibility for Child Benefit. You're clearly continuing to provide for Chloe's needs beyond just her medical care, which is exactly what Child Benefit is designed to support.

Based on all the information you've provided, you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit during Chloe's hospital stay. If you're already receiving Child Benefit, it should continue without interruption. If you haven't yet applied, you would be eligible to do so.

Would you like information about how to claim Child Benefit if you haven't already done so?

2026-01-19T12:17:06.936259 [actor]: eligible question answer

2026-01-19T12:17:09.692442 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit continues to be paid normally when a child is in hospital, regardless of the length of stay, as the parent visiting daily and providing for the child's needs is still considered responsible for the child.
