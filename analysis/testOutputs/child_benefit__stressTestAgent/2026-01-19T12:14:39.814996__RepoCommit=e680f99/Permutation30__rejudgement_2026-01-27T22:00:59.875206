The agent correctly determined the family is eligible for Child Benefit, accurately explained that Lucas (the claimant) can receive the payments while Emily (the higher earner at £65,000) would be responsible for paying the High Income Child Benefit Charge through self-assessment, which matches the expected outcome.
