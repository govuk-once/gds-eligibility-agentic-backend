2026-01-19T12:20:43.412522 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit under UK government rules. To assess your eligibility, I'll need to ask you some questions one at a time.

First, do you have any children under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?

2026-01-19T12:20:44.876301 [actor]: Based on the situation provided, I'll assume the role of Hannah, a UK resident with a son receiving treatment abroad.

Oliver hospital USA treatment 14

2026-01-19T12:20:46.680690 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context, Hannah. I understand your son Oliver is 14 years old and is currently receiving treatment in the USA.

To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask if you normally live in the UK? (This refers to your usual residence, not your temporary situation while Oliver is receiving treatment.)

2026-01-19T12:20:47.611924 [actor]: Yes UK live here always have

2026-01-19T12:20:49.380925 [root_agent]: I understand that you normally live in the UK, which is helpful to know for determining your Child Benefit eligibility.

My next question is: Is Oliver normally living with you in the UK when not receiving treatment in the USA?

2026-01-19T12:20:50.270120 [actor]: Yes before hospital Oliver home with me

2026-01-19T12:20:51.929200 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Oliver normally lives with you in the UK when not receiving treatment.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to understand your relationship to Oliver. Are you his parent, guardian, or someone who is responsible for raising him?

2026-01-19T12:20:52.718761 [actor]: Mother of Oliver since birth

2026-01-19T12:20:54.324330 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you're Oliver's mother since birth.

Next question: Are you or your partner (if you have one) earning over £60,000 per year? This affects whether you might be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

2026-01-19T12:20:55.385583 [actor]: No money problems not rich need help with costs

2026-01-19T12:20:56.900117 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your income isn't over £60,000, you wouldn't be subject to the High Income Child Benefit Charge.

Now, regarding Oliver's treatment in the USA: Is this a temporary situation for medical treatment, or has Oliver moved there permanently?

2026-01-19T12:20:58.071067 [actor]: Treatment only special hospital rare condition

2026-01-19T12:21:01.412790 [root_agent]: I understand that Oliver is in the USA temporarily for treatment at a special hospital for a rare condition.

Based on the information you've provided:

1. You are Oliver's mother
2. You both normally live in the UK
3. Oliver is 14 years old
4. He's temporarily abroad for medical treatment
5. Your income isn't over £60,000

You should remain eligible for Child Benefit while Oliver is temporarily abroad receiving medical treatment. The UK government allows Child Benefit to continue during temporary absences abroad, particularly for medical treatment.

Would you like me to explain how you can claim Child Benefit or check on your existing claim given your current situation?

2026-01-19T12:21:02.382621 [actor]: How long for treatment benefits stop?

2026-01-19T12:21:05.903391 [root_agent]: That's an important question. Child Benefit can usually continue during temporary absences abroad for up to 12 weeks for any reason, or for up to 12 months if the absence is exclusively for medical treatment.

Since Oliver is abroad specifically for medical treatment, your Child Benefit can continue for up to 12 months while he receives treatment in the USA. If the treatment needs to extend beyond 12 months, I would recommend contacting the Child Benefit Office before that period ends to discuss your specific situation, as extensions may be possible given the medical circumstances.

Is there anything specific about the treatment timeline that concerns you?

2026-01-19T12:21:06.992468 [actor]: He already 15 weeks USA hospital

2026-01-19T12:21:09.559197 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since Oliver has been in the USA hospital for 15 weeks, you're still within the 12-month allowance for medical treatment abroad. As his absence from the UK is exclusively for medical treatment, your Child Benefit should continue to be paid during this period (up to the 12-month limit).

The fact that it's already been 15 weeks doesn't affect your eligibility, as long as the total absence doesn't exceed 12 months. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your Child Benefit while Oliver is receiving treatment?

2026-01-19T12:21:11.991534 [actor]: I understand now. Still eligible for benefits since treatment abroad less than 12 months. Thank you for information.

2026-01-19T12:21:13.841680 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit can continue for up to 12 months when a child is temporarily abroad for medical treatment, which aligns with UK government guidelines.
