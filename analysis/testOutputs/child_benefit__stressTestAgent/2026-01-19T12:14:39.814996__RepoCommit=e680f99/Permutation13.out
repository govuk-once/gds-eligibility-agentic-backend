2026-01-19T12:19:30.594100 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. I'll need to ask you a few questions one at a time to assess your situation.

First, do you have any children living with you that you're responsible for?

2026-01-19T12:19:31.427978 [actor]: child living with me

2026-01-19T12:19:32.787221 [root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know that you have a child living with you. To continue assessing your eligibility for Child Benefit, may I ask how old is this child?

2026-01-19T12:19:33.772504 [actor]: 4 years

2026-01-19T12:19:35.158331 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Since your child is 4 years old, they are within the age range for Child Benefit.

To further assess your eligibility, could you tell me if you are a UK resident?

2026-01-19T12:19:36.001970 [actor]: UK resident yes

2026-01-19T12:19:36.878067 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that you are a UK resident. 

Is your child a UK resident as well?

2026-01-19T12:19:37.714026 [actor]: yes child lives with me

2026-01-19T12:19:39.061398 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that your child is also a UK resident and lives with you.

Next question: Is there anyone else (such as another parent or guardian) who might be claiming Child Benefit for this same child?

2026-01-19T12:19:39.828643 [actor]: no adoption placement

2026-01-19T12:19:41.693117 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand this is not an adoption placement and no one else is claiming Child Benefit for your child.

May I ask if you or your partner (if you have one) has an individual income over £60,000 per year?

2026-01-19T12:19:42.602739 [actor]: adoption placement Maya child placed with us court order not yet

2026-01-19T12:19:44.745060 [root_agent]: I apologize for misunderstanding. Thank you for clarifying that this is actually an adoption placement for Maya who has been placed with you by court order, but the adoption is not yet finalized.

For children placed for adoption, the situation is specific. Could you confirm if you have been formally approved as an adopter and Maya is now living with you under a placement order or similar arrangement?

2026-01-19T12:19:45.757986 [actor]: approved adopters Maya living with us final adoption order not yet

2026-01-19T12:19:49.227432 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Since you are approved adopters and Maya is living with you, even though the final adoption order is not yet complete, you may be eligible for Child Benefit.

Based on the information you've provided:
- You are approved adopters
- Maya is 4 years old and living with you
- You are UK residents
- The placement is formal, even though the final adoption order is pending

These circumstances generally make you eligible to claim Child Benefit for Maya. The person who has the child living with them and is responsible for them can claim, which in this case would be you.

Do you have any questions about how to apply for Child Benefit? You can usually apply as soon as you have responsibility for the child.

2026-01-19T12:19:52.789136 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately informed the user that approved adopters with a child placed in their home can claim Child Benefit even before the final adoption order is issued.
