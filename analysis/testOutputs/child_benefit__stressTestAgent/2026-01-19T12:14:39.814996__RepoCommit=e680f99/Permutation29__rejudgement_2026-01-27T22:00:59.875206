2026-01-27T22:04:09.788237 [confirmation_judge]: ☺ I agree with the judge's assessment. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit is not available for a 17-year-old like Jordan who isn't in approved education or training and isn't registered with any careers service, making the outcome "Not Eligible" accurate.
