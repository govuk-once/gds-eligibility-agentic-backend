2026-01-28T12:49:24.265328 [confirmation_judge]: 👎 The agent incorrectly communicated that Kevin is not eligible for Child Benefit, while the expected outcome was "Eligible." The agent didn't properly consider that Kevin's regular lump sum contributions of £120 every 4 weeks (averaging £30/week) exceed the £26.05 threshold, which would make him eligible despite not having primary care.
