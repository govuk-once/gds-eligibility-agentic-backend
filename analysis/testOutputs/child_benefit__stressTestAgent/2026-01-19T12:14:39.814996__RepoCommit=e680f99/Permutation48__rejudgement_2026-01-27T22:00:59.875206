2026-01-27T22:03:47.974101 [confirmation_judge]: ☹ I disagree with the judge's assessment. The agent incorrectly stated that HNCs qualify as approved education for Child Benefit purposes. HNCs are actually considered "advanced education" (equivalent to Level 4), whereas Child Benefit is only available for "non-advanced" education (up to Level 3/A-Level standard). The correct outcome should have been "Not Eligible."
