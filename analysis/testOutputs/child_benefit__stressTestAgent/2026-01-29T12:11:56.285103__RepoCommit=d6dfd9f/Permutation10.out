2026-01-29T12:17:18.590011 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Are you responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T12:17:20.723154 [actor]: Yes, I am. I have a child living with me - Liam, he's 12 years old. I'm his foster carer, the local authority placed him with me.

2026-01-29T12:17:23.751892 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does Liam receive any payments from the local authority for his care, such as a fostering allowance?**

(I'm asking this because it's important to understand the financial arrangements in place, as this can affect Child Benefit eligibility for foster carers.)

2026-01-29T12:17:25.261949 [actor]: Yes, the local council pays me a fostering allowance. It covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance costs.

2026-01-29T12:17:29.200631 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Based on the information you've provided, I need to explain something important about your situation:

**If you're receiving fostering allowance from the local authority for Liam, you are generally not eligible to claim Child Benefit for him.** This is because when a child is being looked after by the local authority (even if placed with foster carers), the local authority itself can claim Child Benefit, not the foster carer.

However, let me ask one more question to be certain: **Is Liam formally in the care of the local authority under a care order, or is this a different type of arrangement?** 

(For example, some children live with family or friends under informal arrangements, or there might be other legal orders in place.)

2026-01-29T12:17:31.162621 [actor]: He's formally placed with me by the local authority as a foster child. They have him in their care and placed him with me, and that's why they pay me the fostering allowance.

2026-01-29T12:17:35.785082 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, **you are not eligible to claim Child Benefit for Liam**.

Here's why: When a child is formally in the care of the local authority and placed with you as a foster carer, the local authority is responsible for the child. In these situations, it's the local authority (not the foster carer) that can claim Child Benefit for children in their care.

Since you're receiving a fostering allowance from the local authority for Liam's accommodation and maintenance, this confirms that the local authority has formal responsibility for him, which means Child Benefit cannot be claimed by you.

**In summary:** Foster carers receiving fostering allowance from a local authority for children formally placed in their care are not eligible for Child Benefit for those children.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this?

2026-01-29T12:17:37.386750 [actor]: No, that's clear. Thank you for explaining that to me.

2026-01-29T12:17:40.667900 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that foster carers receiving fostering allowance from a local authority for children formally placed in their care are not eligible for Child Benefit, as the local authority has formal responsibility for the child and can claim the benefit themselves.
