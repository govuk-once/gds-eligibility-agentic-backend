2026-01-29T12:20:37.261272 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First, do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T12:20:38.956203 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Oliver. He's 14 years old.

2026-01-29T12:20:40.610489 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Oliver normally live with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T12:20:42.776220 [actor]: Well, normally he lives with me, but right now he's actually in a hospital in the USA. He has a rare condition and had to go there for specialist treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I'm still here in the UK, but I visit him when I can and I'm paying for his incidental costs while he's there.

2026-01-29T12:20:44.883747 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that situation. I can imagine that must be very difficult for you and Oliver.

Let me ask: Is the hospital where Oliver is staying providing his treatment free of charge, or are you paying for his medical treatment as well as his incidental costs?

2026-01-29T12:20:47.251424 [actor]: The hospital is providing the medical treatment, but I'm paying for all his incidental costs - you know, things he needs while he's there beyond the actual medical care. That's quite expensive as you can imagine, especially with him being so far away.

2026-01-29T12:20:49.470664 [root_agent]: I understand - that must be a significant financial burden on top of the worry about Oliver's health.

A few more questions to help assess your eligibility:

Are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Oliver, or would this be a new claim?

2026-01-29T12:20:51.478829 [actor]: I'm currently receiving Child Benefit for him. I'm just worried because he's been away for so long now - 15 weeks is quite a while - and I wanted to make sure I'm still eligible to keep receiving it.

2026-01-29T12:20:53.676114 [root_agent]: That's a very sensible thing to check, especially given Oliver's extended stay abroad for treatment.

Let me ask: Before Oliver went to the USA for this treatment, was he living with you full-time in the UK, and are you planning for him to return to live with you once his treatment is complete?

2026-01-29T12:20:56.198223 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. He was living with me full-time before this, and of course he'll come back to live with me once his treatment is finished. We're hoping that will be soon. This is just temporary for his medical treatment - we had no other choice really, given how specialized the care is that he needs.

2026-01-29T12:20:58.262293 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. I have just a couple more questions to complete the assessment.

Are you and Oliver both normally resident in the UK? In other words, is the UK your permanent home where you usually live?

2026-01-29T12:21:00.743301 [actor]: Yes, we're both UK residents. The UK is our permanent home. I've stayed here in the UK while Oliver is getting his treatment - I just travel over to visit him when I can. But we both live here normally, and he'll be coming straight back home once the treatment is done.

2026-01-29T12:21:02.660785 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information. I have one final question:

Is there anyone else who is also claiming Child Benefit for Oliver, or are you the only person claiming for him?

2026-01-29T12:21:04.243400 [actor]: No, I'm the only one claiming for him. It's just me - I'm his mother and I'm responsible for him.

2026-01-29T12:21:10.417068 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, I can now assess your eligibility.

**Good news - you should still be eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for Oliver.**

Here's why:

1. **You meet the basic requirements**: You're responsible for Oliver, he normally lives with you in the UK, and you're both UK residents.

2. **The hospital situation**: Even though Oliver has been in hospital abroad for 15 weeks (and counting), you can continue to receive Child Benefit while a child is in hospital - even if that hospital is outside the UK - as long as:
   - You're contributing to the cost of supporting them (which you are - you're paying his incidental costs)
   - It's expected to be temporary and they'll return home (which is your situation)

3. **No conflict**: You're the only person claiming for Oliver, so there's no issue with multiple claims.

The key factors working in your favor are that this is a temporary medical situation, Oliver will be returning to live with you in the UK, and you're continuing to financially support him during his treatment.

You should be able to continue receiving your Child Benefit without interruption. If you have any concerns or if HMRC contacts you about it, you can explain the temporary nature of Oliver's hospital stay abroad for specialist treatment.

I hope Oliver's treatment goes well and he's home with you soon.

2026-01-29T12:21:14.670136 [actor]: Thank you so much, that's really reassuring to hear. I was worried that because he's been away for so long I might lose the benefit. It's a relief to know I can continue receiving it while he's getting the treatment he needs. I appreciate your help.

2026-01-29T12:21:16.886149 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that Child Benefit can continue while a child is in hospital abroad for temporary medical treatment when the parent is contributing to support costs and the child will return home, which matches the expected eligible outcome.
