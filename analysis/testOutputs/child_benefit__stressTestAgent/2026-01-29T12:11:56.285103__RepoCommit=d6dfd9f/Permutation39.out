2026-01-29T12:33:30.938316 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?

2026-01-29T12:33:32.870118 [actor]: Yes, I do. My wife Helen and I have two children - they're 6 and 8 years old. We adopted them as a sibling pair.

2026-01-29T12:33:34.495318 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. It's wonderful that you've adopted your children together.

Next question: Do you or your wife live in the UK?

2026-01-29T12:33:35.772081 [actor]: Yes, we both live in the UK.

2026-01-29T12:33:37.936592 [root_agent]: That's good to know.

Now, do either you or your wife have another nationality or immigration status that I should be aware of? For example, are you both British citizens, or does either of you have a different status such as settled status, indefinite leave to remain, or another type of visa?

2026-01-29T12:33:39.558599 [actor]: We're both British citizens, so no immigration issues there.

2026-01-29T12:33:41.222258 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Now, an important question: Are both children living with you and your wife in your household?

2026-01-29T12:33:42.817029 [actor]: Yes, both children live with us in our household.

2026-01-29T12:33:44.994119 [root_agent]: That's great. 

Now I need to ask: Is anyone else also claiming Child Benefit for these same children? For example, a birth parent, another relative, or anyone else?

2026-01-29T12:33:46.575353 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for them.

2026-01-29T12:33:48.606834 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more important question: Are either of your children currently in hospital as an in-patient, or are they in local authority care, residential care, or any similar arrangement where they're living away from your home?

2026-01-29T12:33:50.217335 [actor]: No, both children live at home with us full-time. They're not in hospital or in any care arrangement.

2026-01-29T12:33:56.052309 [root_agent]: Perfect, thank you for all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit**. Here's why:

✓ You have two children under 16 years old
✓ You and your wife are both British citizens living in the UK
✓ Both children live with you in your household
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for them
✓ The children are not in hospital or care

Since both you and your wife live with the children, either one of you can claim Child Benefit, but only one of you should make the claim (not both). You'll need to decide between you who will be the claimant.

One final thing to be aware of: If either you or your wife has an individual income over £60,000 per year, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge through Self Assessment, which could reduce or eliminate the benefit depending on how much you earn. However, you can still claim Child Benefit and choose not to receive the payments if you wish - this can protect your National Insurance credits.

Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:33:57.945656 [actor]: That's really helpful, thank you. Just to mention - because the children have special needs, the Local Authority pays us an Adoption Allowance to help with costs. Does that affect our eligibility at all?

2026-01-29T12:34:02.690880 [root_agent]: That's a very good question, and I want to make sure I give you accurate information.

The Adoption Allowance you receive from the Local Authority is a separate payment designed to support adoptive families with additional costs, particularly when children have special needs.

From my understanding of the Child Benefit eligibility criteria, receiving an Adoption Allowance should not affect your eligibility for Child Benefit. These are two different types of support serving different purposes - the Adoption Allowance is specific support for your circumstances as adoptive parents of children with special needs, while Child Benefit is a general benefit available to people responsible for children.

However, since this involves a specific financial arrangement with the Local Authority, I'd recommend confirming this directly when you apply for Child Benefit, or by contacting the Child Benefit Office, just to be absolutely certain there are no complications in your particular case.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:34:04.420932 [actor]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you so much for your help!

2026-01-29T12:34:08.380085 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed all eligibility criteria (children under 16, UK residence, children living in household, no duplicate claims, not in care/hospital) and correctly confirmed that the Adoption Allowance does not affect Child Benefit eligibility.
