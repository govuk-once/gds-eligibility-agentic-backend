2026-01-29T12:13:07.051988 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T12:13:08.669410 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son, Ben. He's 17 years old.

2026-01-29T12:13:10.209056 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Does Ben live with you, or does he live with someone else?

2026-01-29T12:13:11.589989 [actor]: Yes, Ben lives with me.

2026-01-29T12:13:13.913969 [root_agent]: That's helpful, thank you.

Is Ben still in full-time non-advanced education or approved training? (This would include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQ Level 3 or below, but not university degrees or equivalent qualifications.)

2026-01-29T12:13:15.948568 [actor]: No, he's not in education at the moment. He left school back in June. But he has registered with the local youth careers service and he's actively looking for an apprenticeship right now.

2026-01-29T12:13:17.924241 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

When did Ben turn 16? I need to understand the timeline of when he left education and his current situation with the careers service registration.

2026-01-29T12:13:20.112431 [actor]: He turned 16 last year, so he's 17 now. He left school in June, and it's currently August, so it's only been a couple of months since he finished.

2026-01-29T12:13:22.495917 [root_agent]: Thank you for that detail.

Just to confirm - you mentioned Ben has registered with the careers service. Was this registration done recently, and is he currently registered with them now as someone looking for work or training?

2026-01-29T12:13:24.844099 [actor]: Yes, that's right. He registered with them after he left school in June, and yes, he's still registered with them now. He's been using their help to look for apprenticeships.

2026-01-29T12:13:26.853754 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your own situation. Are you responsible for Ben - meaning do you live with him and are you the person who is mainly responsible for him?

2026-01-29T12:13:28.608497 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for him. He lives with me and I'm his father. I'm the one looking after him.

2026-01-29T12:13:30.794029 [root_agent]: Thank you. A few more questions to complete the assessment.

Are you currently living in the UK?

2026-01-29T12:13:32.095937 [actor]: Yes, I am. I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T12:13:37.416442 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, I have good news. **You should be eligible for Child Benefit** for Ben.

Here's why:

- Ben is under 20 years old (he's 17)
- He left approved education or training in June
- He has registered with the careers service (or equivalent) and is actively looking for work or training
- He lives with you, and you're responsible for him
- You live in the UK

The key point here is that Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 who have left education if they are registered with the careers service and looking for work or training. However, this extension typically only lasts for a limited period.

**Important:** Child Benefit in this situation (registered with careers service after leaving education) is usually only payable for up to **20 weeks** from when Ben left education or training in June.

I'd recommend that you apply for or notify HMRC about this situation as soon as possible if you haven't already, to ensure you don't miss out on any payments you're entitled to during this 20-week period.

Do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-29T12:13:40.864610 [actor]: No, that's very helpful, thank you. I'll make sure to get in touch with HMRC right away to sort this out. I appreciate your help!

2026-01-29T12:13:43.363142 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the claimant is eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks after Ben left education in June, given that Ben is 17, registered with the careers service, and actively seeking an apprenticeship, which matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)".
