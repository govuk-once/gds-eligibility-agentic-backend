2026-01-29T12:41:42.284434 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you some questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?**

2026-01-29T12:41:44.288156 [actor]: Yes, I have a daughter who's 16. She left school and has just joined the No One Left Behind programme here in Edinburgh.

2026-01-29T12:41:47.240488 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. To assess your eligibility, I need to understand more about the programme your daughter has joined.

**Is the No One Left Behind programme an approved education or training programme? Specifically, is it full-time and non-advanced (such as A levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or similar qualifications)?**

2026-01-29T12:41:49.862806 [actor]: Yes, it's a full-time training programme. It's the Scottish Government's No One Left Behind programme - it's designed to help young people like my daughter get into work or further training. She's doing it full-time and it's not a degree or anything like that, just vocational training to help her get started.

2026-01-29T12:41:52.079055 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It sounds like your daughter is in full-time, non-advanced training, which is positive for eligibility purposes.

Now I need to ask about your relationship with your daughter: **Does your daughter live with you, or are you responsible for her?**

2026-01-29T12:41:53.869743 [actor]: Yes, she lives with me. She's still at home with us here in Edinburgh.

2026-01-29T12:41:55.923952 [root_agent]: Thank you. That's helpful information.

Next question: **Are you responsible for your daughter? By this I mean, do you provide for her care and financial support?**

2026-01-29T12:41:57.935235 [actor]: Yes, of course. I'm her parent and I provide all her care and financial support - she lives with me and I look after her.

2026-01-29T12:41:59.985690 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your residency status: **Are you living in the UK, and do you have the right to reside in the UK? For example, are you a UK citizen, or do you have settled status, pre-settled status, or another immigration status that allows you to live here?**

2026-01-29T12:42:01.528814 [actor]: Yes, I'm a UK citizen. I've lived in Edinburgh my whole life.

2026-01-29T12:42:03.505872 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

One more important question: **Is anyone else already claiming Child Benefit for your daughter?** For example, is the other parent or anyone else receiving Child Benefit payments for her?

2026-01-29T12:42:05.120046 [actor]: No, nobody else is claiming Child Benefit for her. It's just me looking after her.

2026-01-29T12:42:08.573058 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all those questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for your 16-year-old daughter. Here's why:

✓ Your daughter is 16 and in full-time, non-advanced education or training (the No One Left Behind programme)
✓ She lives with you
✓ You are responsible for her and provide her care and financial support
✓ You are a UK citizen living in the UK
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

You can claim Child Benefit for a child under 20 if they stay in approved education or training, which your daughter's vocational training programme appears to qualify as.

**Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit, or would you like information about how to make a claim?**

2026-01-29T12:42:12.282376 [actor]: Oh, that's great news! Thank you so much for your help. I think I have all the information I need for now.

2026-01-29T12:42:14.716371 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that a parent with a 16-year-old in full-time, non-advanced training (No One Left Behind programme) who lives with them is eligible for Child Benefit, and correctly verified all necessary criteria including residency, responsibility for the child, and that no one else is claiming.
