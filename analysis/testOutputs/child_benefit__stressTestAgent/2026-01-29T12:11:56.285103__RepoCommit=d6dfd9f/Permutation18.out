2026-01-29T12:21:52.919522 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you please tell me: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:21:54.861382 [actor]: Hello, yes I do. I'm claiming for my son Dev. He's been studying full-time for his A-levels, but he just turned 20 last week.

2026-01-29T12:21:57.297262 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Since Dev has just turned 20 and is studying for his A-levels, I need to understand his education status more clearly.

**Is Dev still enrolled in full-time approved education or training that is not higher education (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or an approved traineeship)?**

2026-01-29T12:21:59.116691 [actor]: Yes, he's still enrolled in full-time A-levels. He's in the middle of his course - hasn't finished yet. He turned 20 during the term.

2026-01-29T12:22:01.600993 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. 

I need to ask you an important question about when Dev turned 20:

**Did Dev turn 20 before the start of the current academic year (which typically begins in September), or did he turn 20 after the academic year had already started?**

This timing is important for determining continued eligibility.

2026-01-29T12:22:03.670469 [actor]: He turned 20 after the academic year had already started. Like I said, he turned 20 in the middle of the term - the course was already underway.

2026-01-29T12:22:06.950281 [root_agent]: Thank you for that clarification.

Based on the rules, when a young person turns 20 during their course, Child Benefit can continue until a specific point. I need to confirm one more detail:

**Is Dev enrolled on a course that is expected to last beyond the Monday following his 20th birthday (known as the "extension period"), or has his course already ended or will it end before that date?**

In other words, does his A-level course continue past the week after he turned 20?

2026-01-29T12:22:09.466273 [actor]: Yes, his A-level course continues well past the week after he turned 20. He's still attending classes now and has months left on his course before he finishes his A-levels.

2026-01-29T12:22:12.277201 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your relationship with Dev and your living arrangements:

**Do you live with Dev, and are you responsible for him? By "responsible for," I mean are you the one who is mainly looking after him and meeting his day-to-day needs?**

2026-01-29T12:22:14.281035 [actor]: Yes, I live with Dev and I'm responsible for him. I'm his father and he lives here at home with me. I take care of him and his day-to-day needs.

2026-01-29T12:22:16.643609 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

I need to ask about your residence status:

**Do you normally live in the UK, and are you either a UK citizen, or do you have the right to reside in the UK (for example, through settled status, pre-settled status, or another immigration status that gives you the right to claim benefits)?**

2026-01-29T12:22:18.112888 [actor]: Yes, I normally live in the UK and I'm a UK citizen.

2026-01-29T12:22:20.775960 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

I need to ask one more important question about your income:

**Do you or your partner (if you have one) have an individual income over £50,000 per year? This is important because it may affect whether you need to pay a tax charge on the Child Benefit, though you can still claim it.**

2026-01-29T12:22:22.300135 [actor]: No, my income is below £50,000. I don't have a partner either.

2026-01-29T12:22:27.625626 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you should be eligible for Child Benefit for Dev**. Here's why:

✓ Dev is under 20 years old (just turned 20)
✓ He's enrolled in full-time approved education (A-levels), which is not higher education
✓ He turned 20 after the academic year started, and his course continues beyond the week after his 20th birthday
✓ You live with Dev and are responsible for him
✓ You normally live in the UK and are a UK citizen
✓ Your income is below £50,000, so there's no High Income Child Benefit Charge to worry about

**Important note:** Child Benefit for Dev will stop on the 31st August following his 20th birthday (the end of the academic year in which he turned 20), even if his course continues beyond that date. So you can continue claiming until then.

If you haven't already claimed Child Benefit, or if you need to update your claim, you should contact HMRC or visit the gov.uk website to ensure your claim is active.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:22:32.888345 [evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly determined my eligibility. The agent stated that Child Benefit continues until 31st August following the 20th birthday, but according to gov.uk regulations, Child Benefit actually stops on the Monday following the young person's 20th birthday (known as the "terminal date"), not at the end of the academic year. The agent gave incorrect information about when the benefit ceases.
