2026-01-29T12:19:12.578389 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start with the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) who you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:19:14.830819 [actor]: Yes, we do. We have a 4-year-old girl named Maya who lives with us. She was placed with us by the adoption agency and is living in our home now.

2026-01-29T12:19:17.243066 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information about Maya.

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask:

**Has Maya's adoption been legally finalized, or is she currently placed with you as a foster child while the adoption process is ongoing?**

2026-01-29T12:19:19.338236 [actor]: The adoption hasn't been finalized yet - we're still waiting for the final adoption order from the court. But Maya has already moved in with us. We've been approved as adopters and the adoption agency placed her with us.

2026-01-29T12:19:21.590934 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Now I need to understand your living situation with Maya:

**Are you the main person responsible for Maya on a day-to-day basis? In other words, do you provide her main home and care for her daily needs?**

2026-01-29T12:19:23.750972 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. My partner and I are the ones caring for Maya every day. She lives with us full-time in our home, and we look after all her daily needs.

2026-01-29T12:19:25.841581 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now I need to ask about your residency status:

**Do you live in the UK, and are you either a UK citizen, have settled status, or have the right to reside in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:19:27.327220 [actor]: Yes, we live in the UK and we're UK citizens.

2026-01-29T12:19:29.128437 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

I have one more important question:

**Is anyone else currently claiming Child Benefit for Maya, or has anyone else claimed Child Benefit for her in the past?**

2026-01-29T12:19:30.435351 [actor]: No, no one else is claiming Child Benefit for Maya.

2026-01-29T12:19:34.387115 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Maya. Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 living with you
✓ You are responsible for Maya on a day-to-day basis and she lives with you full-time
✓ You live in the UK and are UK citizens
✓ No one else is claiming Child Benefit for her

**Important point about adoption:** Even though Maya's adoption hasn't been legally finalized yet, you can still claim Child Benefit because she has been placed with you by an adoption agency and is living in your home. The law treats children placed for adoption as eligible for Child Benefit from the point they move in with their prospective adopters.

You should be able to apply for Child Benefit for Maya. Would you like to know anything else about your eligibility or the application process?

2026-01-29T12:19:38.669339 [actor]: That's great news, thank you so much for clarifying everything! It's really helpful to know that we can claim even before the final adoption order comes through. We'll go ahead and apply for Child Benefit for Maya. Thank you for your help!

2026-01-29T12:19:41.151281 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that children placed for adoption are eligible for Child Benefit from when they move in with prospective adopters, even before the final adoption order, and correctly applied all eligibility criteria.
