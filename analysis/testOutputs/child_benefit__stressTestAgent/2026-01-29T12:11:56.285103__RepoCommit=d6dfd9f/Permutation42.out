2026-01-29T12:36:01.160507 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

First, do you have a child or children who you're responsible for?

2026-01-29T12:36:03.366716 [actor]: Yes, I do. I'm 17 and I live with my mum in Cardiff. I think she's asking about whether she can still get child benefit for me? I've just started a Foundation Apprenticeship.

2026-01-29T12:36:05.994846 [root_agent]: Thank you for that context. To help determine if your mum can still get Child Benefit for you, I need to ask:

Are you currently enrolled in approved education or training? Specifically, is your Foundation Apprenticeship full-time (more than 12 hours per week of supervised study or course-related work experience)?

2026-01-29T12:36:07.761185 [actor]: Yes, it's definitely full-time - it's a proper Foundation Apprenticeship funded by the Welsh Government. I'm doing it through the week, so it's well over 12 hours a week.

2026-01-29T12:36:09.874550 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. That's helpful to know.

Now, let me ask: Are you under 20 years old? (I can see you mentioned you're 17, but I want to confirm this for the assessment.)

2026-01-29T12:36:11.485035 [actor]: Yes, that's right - I'm 17, so definitely under 20.

2026-01-29T12:36:13.410921 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now, an important question: Does your mum (or the person claiming Child Benefit for you) live with you, or are you living with her in Cardiff?

2026-01-29T12:36:15.031735 [actor]: Yes, I live with my mum here in Cardiff. We live together.

2026-01-29T12:36:17.181008 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

One more important question: Is your mum (or whoever would be claiming) responsible for you? This means she contributes to the cost of supporting you - for example, providing you with food, clothing, or somewhere to live.

2026-01-29T12:36:19.361059 [actor]: Yes, definitely. My mum pays for everything - the rent, food, my clothes, all of that. She's the one who looks after me and pays for everything I need.

2026-01-29T12:36:23.216158 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **your mum should still be eligible to receive Child Benefit for you**. Here's why:

✓ You are under 20 years old (you're 17)
✓ You are in full-time approved education or training (your Foundation Apprenticeship is over 12 hours per week)
✓ You live with your mum
✓ Your mum is responsible for you (she provides for your living costs)

Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training. Your Foundation Apprenticeship counts as approved education since it's full-time.

One final question to complete the assessment: Has your mum already been claiming Child Benefit for you, or would this be a new claim?

2026-01-29T12:36:25.778052 [actor]: Oh, she's already been claiming it - she's been getting it for years. She was just worried that because I've started this apprenticeship instead of staying in school, she might lose it. So that's good news then!

2026-01-29T12:36:29.490122 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the mother remains eligible for Child Benefit because the 17-year-old is under 20, enrolled in full-time approved education (Foundation Apprenticeship over 12 hours per week), lives with the claiming parent, and the parent is responsible for them - all correct criteria per gov.uk guidance.
