2026-01-29T12:23:39.717796 [root_agent]: I'll help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you some questions.

**Do you have a child or children that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:23:41.990015 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a son who lives with me. My ex-wife and I recently divorced, and our son Sam lives with me while our daughter Ella lives with her mum.

2026-01-29T12:23:43.681236 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

**How old is your son Sam?**

(This is important because Child Benefit is only available for children under a certain age)

2026-01-29T12:23:45.076438 [actor]: Sam is 10 years old.

2026-01-29T12:23:47.137302 [root_agent]: Thank you. Sam is within the age range for Child Benefit.

**Are you responsible for Sam? This means do you live with him and are responsible for things like his food, clothing, and general care?**

2026-01-29T12:23:49.835658 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. Sam lives with me full-time and I'm responsible for all his care - his food, clothing, school needs, everything really. He's been living with me since the divorce was finalized.

2026-01-29T12:23:51.853778 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It sounds like you meet the basic criteria so far.

**Are you or your ex-wife currently claiming Child Benefit for Sam?**

(It's important to note that only one person can claim Child Benefit for the same child)

2026-01-29T12:23:54.040070 [actor]: No, neither of us has claimed anything yet. We're both just trying to sort out what we're each entitled to now that we're living separately with one child each.

2026-01-29T12:23:56.077812 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Since neither of you is currently claiming for Sam, that's helpful to know.

**Do you normally live in the UK?**

(This is one of the key eligibility requirements for Child Benefit)

2026-01-29T12:23:57.913097 [actor]: Yes, I live in the UK. I've always lived here and Sam goes to school here locally.

2026-01-29T12:24:02.231994 [root_agent]: Excellent, thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you've provided, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for your son Sam** because:

- Sam is 10 years old (Child Benefit covers children under 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)
- You live with Sam and are responsible for his care
- You normally live in the UK
- No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for Sam

**You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit for Sam.**

One additional thing to be aware of: **If you or your partner earn over £50,000 a year, you may need to pay the High Income Child Benefit Charge**, which reduces the benefit through the tax system. Would you like me to explain more about that, or do you have any other questions about your eligibility?

2026-01-29T12:24:08.054649 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit based on the correct criteria: the child (Sam, age 10) lives with the user, the user is responsible for his care, they live in the UK, and no one else is currently claiming for Sam. The agent also appropriately mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge for earnings over £50,000, which is accurate information.
