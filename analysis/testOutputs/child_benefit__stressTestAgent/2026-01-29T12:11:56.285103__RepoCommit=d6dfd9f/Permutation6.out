2026-01-29T12:14:36.167356 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me start by asking you a few questions.

First question: **Do you have a child under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:14:37.735636 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Chloe - she's 6 years old.

2026-01-29T12:14:39.232574 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does Chloe normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T12:14:42.199377 [actor]: Well, not at the moment - she's been in hospital for about 14 weeks now. She has a serious condition, but I visit her every day and I spend money on things for her like books, pyjamas, and special food. I spend about £30 a week on her.

2026-01-29T12:14:44.476188 [root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that information, and I'm sorry to hear about Chloe's hospitalization.

Let me ask: **Before Chloe went into hospital, did she normally live with you?**

2026-01-29T12:14:46.126798 [actor]: Yes, she did. She lived with me before she went into hospital.

2026-01-29T12:14:47.711885 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

Next question: **Is Chloe expected to return home to live with you after she leaves hospital?**

2026-01-29T12:14:49.397735 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. She'll come back home to live with me once she's well enough to be discharged.

2026-01-29T12:14:51.815005 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Next question: **Are you (or your partner if you have one) responsible for Chloe? By this I mean, do you make decisions about her upbringing and welfare, and contribute to her care costs?**

2026-01-29T12:14:53.527518 [actor]: Yes, I'm responsible for her. I'm her mother and I make all the decisions about her care and upbringing. I don't have a partner - it's just me looking after her.

2026-01-29T12:14:54.897059 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information.

Next question: **Are you currently living in the UK?**

2026-01-29T12:14:56.228772 [actor]: Yes, I am. I live in the UK.

2026-01-29T12:14:57.951549 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

One more question: **Are you currently claiming Child Benefit for Chloe, or would this be a new claim?**

2026-01-29T12:14:59.566886 [actor]: This would be a new claim. I haven't claimed Child Benefit before.

2026-01-29T12:15:04.573975 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing all that information.

Based on what you've told me, **you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit** for Chloe. Here's why:

✓ You have a child under 16 (Chloe is 6)
✓ You are responsible for her - you're her mother and make decisions about her care
✓ She normally lived with you before going into hospital and is expected to return to you after discharge
✓ You're contributing to her costs while she's in hospital (spending about £30 per week on her)
✓ You live in the UK

**Important point about children in hospital:** You can continue to claim Child Benefit for a child who is in hospital, as long as:
- The child normally lives with you (which Chloe did)
- You're contributing at least the weekly rate of Child Benefit to the costs of looking after them (which you are - you're spending £30 per week)
- The child is expected to return home to you (which she is)

You should be able to make a claim for Child Benefit. Would you like to know anything else about your eligibility or the claiming process?

2026-01-29T12:15:06.941131 [actor]: Oh that's wonderful news, thank you so much! That's a real relief. I was worried about the fact that she's been in hospital for so long, but it's good to know I can still claim. I really appreciate your help with this.

2026-01-29T12:15:10.922877 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately identified that the user qualifies for Child Benefit under the exception for children in hospital, correctly applying the rules that the child normally lived with the claimant, is expected to return home, and the claimant is contributing at least the weekly Child Benefit rate to the child's costs.
