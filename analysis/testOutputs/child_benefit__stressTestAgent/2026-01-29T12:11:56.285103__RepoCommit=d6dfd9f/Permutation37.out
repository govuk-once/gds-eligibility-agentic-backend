2026-01-29T12:32:16.552798 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, let me ask you the first question:

**Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:32:18.872552 [actor]: Yes, I do. I'm looking after Nina, she's 10 years old. She's come to live with me because her mum is ill. I'm her mum's best friend and Nina's staying with me for the foreseeable future.

2026-01-29T12:32:21.409995 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. I understand Nina is living with you while her mum is ill.

Let me ask an important follow-up question:

**Does Nina's mum currently receive Child Benefit for Nina, or has she stopped claiming it since Nina came to live with you?**

2026-01-29T12:32:23.755945 [actor]: Nina's mum has stopped claiming it since Nina came to live with me. She's not able to look after Nina right now because of her illness, so Nina is with me full-time and I'm the one providing for her.

2026-01-29T12:32:26.195121 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. It's helpful to know that Nina's mum has stopped claiming Child Benefit and that you're now providing for Nina full-time.

Let me ask you the next question:

**Are you responsible for Nina in a way that you're contributing to the cost of looking after her - for example, are you paying for things like her food, clothing, and other needs?**

2026-01-29T12:32:28.505147 [actor]: Yes, absolutely. I'm paying for everything - her food, clothes, school things, everything she needs. It's just a private arrangement between me and Nina's mum. The council knows about the situation, but they're not paying me anything or helping with any costs.

2026-01-29T12:32:31.315130 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information. It's clear you're taking full financial responsibility for Nina's care.

Let me ask you another important question:

**Are you currently living in the UK, and do you have the right to reside here (for example, are you a British citizen, have settled status, or have another immigration status that allows you to claim benefits)?**

2026-01-29T12:32:33.158389 [actor]: Yes, I'm a British citizen and I live here in the UK. I've lived here all my life.

2026-01-29T12:32:35.221029 [root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. 

Let me ask you one more question to complete the assessment:

**Is there anyone else who might also be responsible for Nina or claiming Child Benefit for her - for example, Nina's father or another family member?**

2026-01-29T12:32:37.316814 [actor]: No, there's no one else. Nina's dad isn't in the picture, and I'm the only one looking after her now. Her mum can't because of her illness, and I'm the one Nina is living with and who's responsible for her.

2026-01-29T12:32:41.740157 [root_agent]: Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on the information you've provided, let me give you my assessment:

**You appear to be eligible for Child Benefit for Nina.**

Here's why:

✓ Nina is under 16 years old (she's 10)
✓ You are responsible for Nina - she's living with you full-time
✓ You're contributing to the cost of looking after her (paying for her food, clothes, school things, and other needs)
✓ Nina's mum has stopped claiming Child Benefit for her
✓ You're a British citizen living in the UK
✓ No one else is responsible for Nina or claiming for her

Since Nina has come to live with you because her mum is unable to look after her due to illness, and you're now the person providing for her day-to-day needs, you should be able to claim Child Benefit even though this is a private arrangement and you're not Nina's parent.

**Next steps:** You would need to make a claim for Child Benefit. When you do, you'll need to explain that Nina is living with you because her mother is unable to care for her due to illness, and that you're now responsible for her care.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit?

2026-01-29T12:32:46.101234 [actor]: Thank you so much, that's really helpful! I'm relieved to know I can claim for Nina. It will definitely help with all the extra costs. I'll get the claim sorted out and make sure to explain the situation with her mum. I appreciate your help!

2026-01-29T12:32:49.111262 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that the user is eligible for Child Benefit as they are responsible for a child under 16, providing full financial support, the child's mother has stopped claiming, no one else is claiming, and the user is a UK resident with the right to claim benefits.
