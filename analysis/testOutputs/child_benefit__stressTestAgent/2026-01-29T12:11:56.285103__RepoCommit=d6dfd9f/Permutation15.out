2026-01-29T12:20:14.243900 [root_agent]: I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit. Let me ask you a few questions to assess your situation.

First question: **Do you have a child (or children) under the age of 16, or under 20 if they're in approved education or training?**

2026-01-29T12:20:15.822727 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Emma, she's 12 years old.

2026-01-29T12:20:17.853119 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

Next question: **Does your daughter Emma normally live with you, or are you responsible for her care?**

2026-01-29T12:20:19.973786 [actor]: No, she doesn't live with me. She lives with her mother. But I do contribute to her upkeep - I send money to her mum each week for food, about £10 a week, and I make sure to send her a birthday present every year.

2026-01-29T12:20:22.633868 [root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that situation.

Let me ask a follow-up question: **Are you the person who has the main responsibility for Emma's day-to-day care? For example, are you the one who makes decisions about her education, health, and general welfare, even though she lives with her mother?**

2026-01-29T12:20:25.179332 [actor]: No, I'm not really involved in the day-to-day care. Her mother handles all that - the education decisions, health matters, all the daily stuff. I just send the £10 a week for food and her birthday present each year. I want to claim Child Benefit though, since her mother doesn't claim it.

2026-01-29T12:20:29.864784 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail.

Based on what you've told me, I need to let you know that **you would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit in this situation**.

Here's why: Child Benefit is paid to the person who is responsible for the child and who the child normally lives with. Since Emma lives with her mother and her mother is responsible for her day-to-day care (making decisions about education, health, and general welfare), her mother would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit.

The fact that you contribute £10 a week for food and send birthday presents shows you're supporting Emma financially, which is commendable. However, this level of contribution doesn't meet the threshold for being considered responsible for her care in the way that Child Benefit requires.

**One important point**: You mentioned that her mother doesn't claim Child Benefit. It would be worth encouraging her mother to claim it, as she appears to be eligible and it could provide important financial support for Emma's upbringing.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or your situation?

2026-01-29T12:20:35.330554 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately assessed that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter lives with her mother who has day-to-day care responsibility, and my financial contribution (£10 weekly for food and birthday presents) does not constitute being responsible for the child's care as required by Child Benefit rules.
