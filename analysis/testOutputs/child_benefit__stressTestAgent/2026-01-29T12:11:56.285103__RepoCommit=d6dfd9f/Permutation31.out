2026-01-29T12:29:09.247348 [root_agent]: Hello! I'd be happy to help you determine if you're eligible for Child Benefit.

Let me start by asking: **Do you have a child or children under the age of 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training) that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:29:10.678136 [actor]: Yes, I do. I have a daughter, Emma, who's 18 years old.

2026-01-29T12:29:13.128455 [root_agent]: Thank you for that information. 

To continue assessing your eligibility, I need to ask: **Is Emma in approved education or training?** 

(This would typically include things like A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or certain apprenticeships and training courses.)

2026-01-29T12:29:14.882707 [actor]: Yes, she's in education. She's just started a 3-year Bachelor's degree at university. She still lives at home with me and commutes to university.

2026-01-29T12:29:16.656978 [root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information.

I need to clarify something important: **Is Emma studying full-time for her Bachelor's degree, or is it a part-time course?**

2026-01-29T12:29:18.119802 [actor]: She's studying full-time for her Bachelor's degree.

2026-01-29T12:29:22.690621 [root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that.

I need to let you know that **Child Benefit is only available for children under 20 who are in approved education or training**. However, university degrees (including Bachelor's degrees) do not count as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes.

Approved education or training typically includes:
- A-levels or similar qualifications
- Scottish Highers
- NVQs up to level 3
- Home education (if started before the child turned 16)
- Certain apprenticeships and unpaid training leading to accredited qualifications

Since Emma is 18 and studying for a Bachelor's degree at university, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for her**.

Child Benefit would have stopped when she either:
- Turned 16 (if not in approved education/training), or
- Finished her approved education/training (like A-levels) after turning 16, or
- Turned 20 (whichever came first)

**Do you have any other children under 16, or under 20 in approved education or training, that you're responsible for?**

2026-01-29T12:29:24.410048 [actor]: No, Emma is my only child.

2026-01-29T12:29:28.383439 [evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined my eligibility. The agent accurately explained that university degrees (Bachelor's degrees) do not count as approved education or training for Child Benefit purposes, and correctly concluded that I am not eligible for Child Benefit for my 18-year-old daughter who is studying for a university degree.
