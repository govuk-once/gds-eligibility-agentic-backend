[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Sarah. It’s lovely to speak with you. To help me determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you tell me, is the child, Leo, living with you and your husband, Tom?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Leo lives with us - me and my husband Tom in our home in Manchester.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Sarah. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me how old Leo is?

[evaluation_judge]: Leo is 8 years old. He's in primary school at the moment.

[root_agent]: Okay, Leo is 8 years old. And just to confirm, both you and Tom are UK nationals, and you both live here permanently, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Both Tom and I are UK nationals and we live permanently in Manchester.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for that information. Now, could you tell me roughly what Tom earns each year?

[evaluation_judge]: Tom works as a teacher and earns about £35,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sarah. And could you tell me approximately how much you earn each year?

[evaluation_judge]: I work part-time and earn about £15,000 a year.

[root_agent]: Okay, so Tom earns £35,000 and you earn £15,000. Just to be absolutely clear, is there anyone else who regularly contributes towards Leo’s upkeep, such as grandparents or other family members?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's just Tom and me who take care of Leo and provide for him financially. We don't receive any regular financial support from family members for his upkeep.

[root_agent]: That’s good to know, Sarah. And just one final question regarding Leo’s health – is he currently in hospital or care for a significant period?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Leo isn't in hospital or care. He's healthy and living at home with us.

[root_agent]: Excellent. Thank you for answering all my questions, Sarah. Based on the information you’ve provided – that Leo lives with you and Tom, is under 16, you both have low incomes, and he’s not in hospital or care – it appears you would likely be eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to summarise the key criteria we’ve discussed?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate a summary of the key criteria and confirmation of our eligibility.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Let’s recap. You were assessed against the following criteria:

*   **Responsibility:** You are responsible for Leo as he lives with you.
*   **Age & Education:** Leo is under 16 and in approved education (primary school).
*   **Residency & Immigration:** You and Tom are both UK nationals and ordinarily resident in the UK.
*   **Living Arrangements:** Leo lives with you and Tom.
*   **Hospital/Care:** Leo is not in hospital or care.
*   **Income:** Neither you nor Tom’s individual income exceeds £60,000.

Considering all of these factors, I can confirm that, based on the information you've provided, you are likely eligible for Child Benefit.

Do you have any other questions about Child Benefit that I can help you with?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the clear summary. That's really helpful to know that we're eligible for Child Benefit. I don't have any other questions right now. This is exactly what I needed to know.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit based on all the criteria they checked, which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
