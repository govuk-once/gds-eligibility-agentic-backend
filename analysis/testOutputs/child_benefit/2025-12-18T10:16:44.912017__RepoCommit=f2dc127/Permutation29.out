[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jordan and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Jordan. Thank you for speaking with me.

Let’s start with a simple question. Are you under the age of 16?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm 17. I finished my GCSEs last year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know you’re 17. That’s helpful.

Now, could you tell me, are you currently in any approved education or training courses?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not in any education or training at the moment. I haven't really figured out what I want to do next.

[root_agent]: I understand. Thank you for clarifying that you’re not currently in education or training.

Just to be clear, have you registered with any government-sponsored careers service or the armed forces recently?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't registered with any careers service or anything like that. I've just been staying at home with my dad since finishing school.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. It sounds like you’ve been at home with your dad since finishing school.

To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me, does your child (that’s you) qualify for the 20-week extension, which is designed for 16 and 17 year olds who aren’t in education, employment, or training?

[evaluation_judge]: I think there might be a misunderstanding. I'm Jordan - I'm 17 years old myself. I live with my dad, Steve. I'm not a parent with a child. I'm trying to find out if I'm eligible for any benefits as a 17-year-old who's not in education, employment, or training.

[root_agent]: Oh my goodness, you are absolutely right! I sincerely apologize for the confusion. My programming must have gotten crossed up. Thank you so much for pointing out my mistake. 

Let’s start again. To help me determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you tell me, how many children do you have living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have any children. I'm 17 and I live with my dad. I think I might have been unclear - I'm not looking to claim benefits for anyone else. I'm wondering if there are any benefits I might be eligible for as a 17-year-old who isn't in education, employment or training.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that you don’t have any children and that you’re interested in benefits for yourself. That’s very helpful.

Just to confirm, are you under the age of 16?

[evaluation_judge]: No, as I mentioned before, I'm 17 years old. I finished my GCSEs last year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that you’re 17.

And to be completely sure, are you currently in any approved education or training?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not in any education or training. As I said earlier, I haven't signed up for college or any courses since finishing my GCSEs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. It sounds like you’re currently not in education or training. 

Let’s move on to a slightly different point. Are you receiving any Universal Credit?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not receiving Universal Credit or any other benefits right now. I just live with my dad who supports me.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know that you’re not receiving Universal Credit or any other benefits.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that you are 17, not in education or training, and not receiving any benefits – it appears you are **not eligible** for Child Benefit.

The criteria for Child Benefit generally requires that a parent has at least one child living with them. As you don't have any children, you don't meet that requirement.

Do you understand this assessment, or would you like me to elaborate on any part of it?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent gave me the correct outcome that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit, but for the wrong reason. The reason I'm ineligible is because I'm over 16 and not in approved education or training (nor have I registered with a careers service to qualify for the extension). The agent incorrectly stated I'm ineligible because I don't have children, misunderstanding that I am the child in this scenario, not the claimant.
