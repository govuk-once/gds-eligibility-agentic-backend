[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Alice and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Alice, it’s lovely to speak with you. I’m here to help you figure out if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you tell me, is your son, Tom, currently in “Care” or “Residential Accommodation”?

[evaluation_judge]: My son Tom is in a residential school - it's a residential accommodation that's paid for by the local council. He's been there for about 10 weeks now because of his severe behavioral needs.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. So, Tom is in a residential school that’s being paid for by the local council. That confirms he’s in “Residential Accommodation”.

Now, just to be completely clear, regarding residential accommodation, there’s a specific time limit for eligibility. What is the cutoff period for this type of accommodation?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not entirely sure about the time limits. I just know he's been there for 10 weeks so far. The school is helping him with his behavioral needs, but I don't know how long he can stay there before it affects any benefits.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. It’s understandable that you’re unsure about the time limits. 

Based on the information available, children in “Residential Accommodation” typically retain eligibility for Child Benefit for 12 weeks. 

Since Tom has been in the residential school for 10 weeks, he is currently eligible for Child Benefit. 

Do you have any other questions about this, or would you like me to explain anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: So I'm still eligible to receive Child Benefit for Tom right now? And this will continue until he reaches 12 weeks in the residential school, is that correct?

[root_agent]: Yes, that is absolutely correct. As we’ve discussed, children in “Residential Accommodation” like Tom’s generally remain eligible for Child Benefit for 12 weeks, regardless of how long they’ve been in the accommodation. 

So, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for Tom until he has been in residential accommodation for a total of 12 weeks. 

Is there anything else I can clarify for you regarding his eligibility, or would you like to explore any other aspects of Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, that's clear now. I just wanted to be sure I'll still receive the benefit while he's at school, at least for a little while longer. I don't have any other questions about this right now.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit while my son is in residential accommodation for up to 12 weeks (he's currently been there for 10 weeks).
