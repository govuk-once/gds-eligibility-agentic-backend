[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Brenda and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Brenda. Thank you for speaking with me today. To start, could you tell me how old Liam is?

[evaluation_judge]: Liam is 12 years old. He's been placed with me by the local authority as I'm his foster parent.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Just to confirm, you’re fostering Liam, who is 12 years old, and the local authority places him with you? Could you tell me, are you responsible for Liam?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. I'm fostering Liam who is 12, and he was placed with me by the local authority. I am responsible for him - he lives with me and I take care of him day to day.

[root_agent]: Alright. And to clarify, the local council is currently paying for Liam’s accommodation and maintenance, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. The local council pays me a fostering allowance that covers Liam's accommodation and maintenance.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Just one more question for now. Could you tell me, have you ever claimed Child Benefit before?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't claimed Child Benefit for Liam. I wasn't sure if I could since I receive the fostering allowance from the council.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re responsible for Liam, he’s 12 years old, and the local council covers his accommodation and maintenance – I can confirm that you are not eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because the council pays for Liam's accommodation and maintenance through the fostering allowance. Is that right?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s absolutely correct. You cannot claim Child Benefit for a fostered child if the local council is providing for their accommodation and maintenance.

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. Thank you for explaining that to me.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit because the local council pays for the fostered child's accommodation and maintenance through a fostering allowance.
