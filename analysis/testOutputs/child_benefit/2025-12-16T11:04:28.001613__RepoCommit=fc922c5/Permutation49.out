[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Tom and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Tom, thank you for reaching out. I understand you’re interested in exploring potential benefits.

To start, could you tell me if the computer coding course you’re taking is recognised as approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm taking a computer coding course that my future employer is paying for. They're covering my course fees as part of an agreement that I'll work for them after I complete the training. I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that.

Just to be clear, the guidance states that courses done with an employer’s agreement – for example, to get a job – are excluded from approved education. Is this course considered to be for the purpose of getting a job?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the course is definitely for the purpose of getting a job. My future employer is paying for the course fees specifically as part of our agreement that I'll work for them after I complete it. They're investing in my training so I can work for them afterward.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Based on the information you’ve provided, I’m afraid you’re not eligible for Child Benefit. The guidance specifically excludes courses undertaken with an employer’s agreement for the purpose of securing employment. 

Do you have any other questions about this, or would you like me to explore other potential benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining why I'm not eligible.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit because my course is done with an employer's agreement for the purpose of getting a job, which matches the expected outcome in the prompt.
