[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Karen and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Karen, nice to meet you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 44 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Karen. And do you have any children?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a son named Ryan who is 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Is Ryan currently in approved education or training? By approved education, I mean things like primary school, secondary school, or A-levels.

[evaluation_judge]: Ryan has left school and has just started a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England. He lives at home with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Karen. Just to confirm, is Ryan receiving an apprenticeship in England?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Ryan is doing his Intermediate Apprenticeship here in England.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. And are you, as his mother, responsible for Ryan financially?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am responsible for him. He lives with me and I support him financially.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Karen. Based on the information you've provided, unfortunately, you are no longer eligible for Child Benefit. This is because Ryan has started an apprenticeship in England, and this disqualifies him from being counted as a qualifying child for Child Benefit purposes. 

Do you have any questions about this, or would you like me to explain further?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit surprised to hear that. I thought I might still get Child Benefit while he's in training. Why does his apprenticeship disqualify me from receiving the benefit?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask, and it's good to clarify! It can be a bit counterintuitive. The rules state that while a child is in approved education – like school, college, or university – you can continue to receive Child Benefit. However, starting an apprenticeship in England is specifically a disqualifying event, even though it *is* a form of training. 

Essentially, the rules differentiate between formal education and apprenticeships for Child Benefit eligibility. It's different to, for example, staying in school to study A-Levels.

Would you like me to point you to the relevant information on the government website, although I'm unable to provide a direct link? It's on gov.uk if you search for "Child Benefit eligibility" and look for the section about children in education or training.

[evaluation_judge]: That would be helpful, yes. So just to be clear, because Ryan is doing an apprenticeship rather than being in school or college, I need to stop my Child Benefit claim?

[root_agent]: Yes, that's absolutely correct, Karen. Because Ryan is undertaking an apprenticeship in England, you will need to stop your Child Benefit claim. 

As I mentioned, the rules specifically state that starting an apprenticeship is a disqualifying event, even though it's a form of training.

To find the official information, search for "Child Benefit eligibility" on the gov.uk website and look for the section detailing when Child Benefit stops – it will explain the rules regarding apprenticeships.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining it to me. I'll look into stopping my claim.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Karen. I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions in the future.

Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my son has started an apprenticeship in England, which is a disqualifying event under the rules, even though I am responsible for him.
