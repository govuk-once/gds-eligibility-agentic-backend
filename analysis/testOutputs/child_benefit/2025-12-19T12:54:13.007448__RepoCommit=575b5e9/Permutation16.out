[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Hannah, a UK resident trying to learn about benefits eligibility while her son is receiving treatment abroad.

Hi, i'm Hannah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Hannah, it’s lovely to speak with you. I understand you’re wanting to understand your eligibility for a benefit while your son is receiving treatment. 

To start, could you please tell me, how old is your son?





[evaluation_judge]: My son Oliver is 14 years old. He has a rare condition that required specialized treatment.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Hannah. That's helpful to know.

Is your son currently living with you in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's actually currently in a specialist hospital in the USA. He has a rare condition that couldn't be treated here in the UK, so he was sent there for specialized treatment. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I'm still here in the UK, but I visit him when I can and I'm paying for all his incidental costs while he's there.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Hannah. It sounds like a very difficult situation, and I appreciate you explaining it so clearly.

To clarify, was your son sent abroad *specifically* to receive hospital treatment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. He was sent to the USA specifically for this hospital treatment. His condition is quite rare and the specialists here recommended this particular hospital in the USA for his treatment. That's the only reason we're in this situation - he went abroad solely for this specialized medical care.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Hannah. 

Has your son been in the hospital in the USA for more than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he has been in the hospital in the USA for 15 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Hannah. Based on the information you’ve provided, it sounds like you may still be eligible for Child Benefit while your son is receiving treatment in the USA. 

To be absolutely sure, are you currently responsible for his financial support, even while he's receiving treatment abroad? For example, are you covering his day-to-day expenses?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm definitely still financially responsible for him. I cover all his personal expenses and incidentals while he's in the hospital - things like clothes, personal items, entertainment, and anything else he needs that isn't covered by his medical care. I also pay for my visits to see him when I can manage to travel there.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Hannah. That’s very helpful.

Based on everything you’ve told me – your son is 14, he’s been in hospital abroad for more than 12 weeks, he went abroad *specifically* for treatment, and you are continuing to financially support him – you are likely still eligible to receive Child Benefit.

Would you like me to summarise this for you, or would you like to discuss anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, that's really helpful to know. Could you please summarize it for me? I just want to make sure I understand correctly why I'm still eligible even though he's been away for over 12 weeks.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Hannah. Here’s a summary of why you’re likely still eligible for Child Benefit:

You continue to be eligible because your son, Oliver, is 14, and he was sent to the USA *specifically* to receive hospital treatment for a rare condition. He has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks. Importantly, even though he is abroad, you are still financially supporting him by covering his personal expenses and incidental costs.

The rules allow for continued eligibility for Child Benefit when a child is in hospital abroad and went there solely for medical treatment, as long as a parent is still providing financial support.

Does that make sense, and is there anything else I can clarify for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. It's reassuring to know I can continue to receive Child Benefit while Oliver is getting the treatment he needs abroad. I appreciate your help with this!

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit despite my son being hospitalized abroad for over 12 weeks. They correctly applied the international exception rule since my son went abroad specifically for hospital treatment and I continue to financially support him.
