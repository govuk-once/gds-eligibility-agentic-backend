[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you test this agent by playing the role of Alice who is inquiring about benefits eligibility related to her son in residential school.

Hi, i'm Alice and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Alice, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me the age of the child you are claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. I'm looking into benefits for my son Tom. He's 14 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Alice. That's helpful to know.

Is Tom currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Actually, Tom has severe behavioral needs and he's been placed in a residential school. The local council is paying for it. He's been there for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Alice. That's important information.

To clarify, is this residential school providing care as part of a local authority arrangement (like fostering), or is it primarily for his education and support due to his behavioral needs, with the local council funding that support?

[evaluation_judge]: It's primarily for his education and support due to his behavioral needs. It's not fostering or local authority care - it's a residential school that specializes in working with children with behavioral challenges. The local council is funding his placement there because of his specific needs.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Alice, that clarifies things.

Is Tom usually a UK resident?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Tom is a UK resident. We've always lived here.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you. 

And just to confirm, is Tom still attending school, even though it's at the residential school?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he is attending school. The residential school provides both education and accommodation for him with the specialized support he needs for his behavioral challenges.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Alice. This is very helpful.

To confirm, is anyone else financially responsible for Tom, such as another parent?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm solely responsible for Tom. There's no other parent involved in his financial care.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Alice. 

Given that Tom is 14, a UK resident, attending school, and currently residing in residential accommodation funded by the local council for his specific needs, and you are solely responsible for his financial care, it sounds like you may still be eligible for Child Benefit. However, eligibility continues for up to 12 weeks in this situation. 

Could you confirm how long Tom has been at the residential school, to the nearest week? You mentioned 'about 10 weeks' earlier.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's been exactly 10 weeks since Tom moved into the residential school.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Alice.

Based on the information you've provided, you *are* currently eligible for Child Benefit. Because Tom is in residential accommodation (not 'care' as defined by fostering or local authority arrangements) and has been there for 10 weeks, you remain eligible for up to 12 weeks from when he started living there. 

I recommend keeping track of the dates, as eligibility will end after 12 weeks.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am eligible for Child Benefit since my son is in residential accommodation (not care) and has been there for 10 weeks, which is less than the 12-week cutoff period for residential accommodation.
