[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Fiona and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Fiona, thanks for reaching out. It's great to hear you're involved in the "No One Left Behind" programme in Edinburgh! 

To start, could you tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 16 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks! And are you currently in full-time, non-advanced education? (For example, A-levels, or equivalent).

[evaluation_judge]: I've actually left school. I've joined the "No One Left Behind" programme in Edinburgh instead.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, thank you. So, as you've left school and are on the "No One Left Behind" programme, is this a full-time training course?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a full-time training programme.

[root_agent]: Great. And are you earning less than £120 a week, on average, from this training programme?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm earning less than £120 a week from this programme.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful. Finally, are your parents or guardians responsible for your care and maintenance?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I still live with my parents and they're responsible for my care and maintenance.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Fiona.

Based on what you've told me – that you are 16, no longer in full-time education, participating in the "No One Left Behind" programme as a full-time trainee earning less than £120 a week, and are financially supported by your parents – you are likely eligible for Child Benefit. 

Would you like me to explain any of this in more detail, or perhaps talk about how to claim?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I'm eligible for Child Benefit while participating in the "No One Left Behind" program in Scotland, which is an approved training program for Child Benefit purposes.
