[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi John, nice to meet you! To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me your age?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And where do you currently live – with your parents, or someone else?





[evaluation_judge]: I live with my father, Pete. It's just the two of us.

[root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know. Are you currently in education, or do you have a job?

[evaluation_judge]: I've left school and I'm attending a local college to re-sit two GCSEs. I go to college for about 6 hours a week for supervised study. The rest of the time I'm mostly at home gaming.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. To clarify, is this course at college considered full-time education? This often depends on the number of hours of supervised study or tuition each week.

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's not full-time. I only attend for about 6 hours of supervised study each week. It's just to re-sit two GCSEs I need to improve.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Just to be clear, are you financially dependent on your father, Pete?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm financially dependent on my dad. He pays for everything as I don't have a job or any income of my own.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, and the rules around Child Benefit, it seems you may not be eligible. This is because to be eligible, if you are 16-19 and doing some education, that education generally needs to be full-time – meaning more than 12 hours a week of supervised study. 

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or perhaps explore whether there might be other benefits you could be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you just confirm for me - so I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because my college course is only 6 hours per week instead of the required 12+ hours?

[root_agent]: You are exactly right. As you are 17 and in non-full-time education – meaning your course involves less than 12 hours a week of supervised study – you don’t currently meet the eligibility requirements for Child Benefit. I'm happy to double-check anything if you'd like!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because my education doesn't meet the minimum requirement of 12+ hours of supervised study per week.
