[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Mo, I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility. To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are applying Child Benefit for?


[evaluation_judge]: My son Zahid is 15 years old. He doesn't live with me though - he lives with his aunt, but I send money to support him.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Mo. Does your son's aunt claim Child Benefit for Zahid?

[evaluation_judge]: No, his aunt doesn't claim Child Benefit for him. I send her £15 a week to help with Zahid's costs.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mo. Does anyone else contribute financially towards the costs of raising Zahid, besides yourself?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my mother - Zahid's grandmother - also sends the aunt £15 a week to help with Zahid's costs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Mo. Just to confirm, you personally contribute £15 per week, and Zahid’s grandmother contributes another £15 per week, both to his aunt?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. I send £15 per week and my mother sends another £15 per week to help the aunt with Zahid's costs.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mo. Are you Zahid's parent?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm Zahid's father.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mo. Do you have sole responsibility for Zahid, or does another person have parental responsibility? (This is just to help me understand the situation fully).

[evaluation_judge]: His mother has parental responsibility too, but she's not involved in his life or providing financial support. His aunt takes care of him day-to-day, but I'm still his father and trying to support him financially.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mo. To clarify, although Zahid lives with his aunt and his mother isn’t involved, you are contributing financially to his care. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Although Zahid lives with his aunt, I contribute financially by sending £15 per week to help with his care. And as I mentioned, my mother also sends £15 per week.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mo. Based on the information you've provided, it seems you may be eligible for Child Benefit. The total financial contribution towards Zahid's care – £30 a week between you and your mother – meets the required amount, even though you don’t have day-to-day care of him.

Would you like me to summarise the reasons why you appear eligible?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd like to hear the summary of why I'm eligible, please.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Mo. Here's a summary of why you appear eligible for Child Benefit for Zahid:

*   Zahid is 15 years old, and Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 20.
*   Although Zahid lives with his aunt, you are contributing financially to his care – £15 per week.
*   Your mother also contributes financially – another £15 per week.
*   The combined financial contributions (£30 per week) meet the threshold required for eligibility when a child lives with someone else.
*   His aunt does not claim Child Benefit for him.

Therefore, based on the information provided, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit. Do you have any other questions for me?





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for Child Benefit. They understood that my combined contribution with my mother's (£30/week) exceeds the required amount, even though I personally only contribute £15/week.
