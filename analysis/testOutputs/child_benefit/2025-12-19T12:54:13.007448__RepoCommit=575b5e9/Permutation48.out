[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Emily and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Emily, welcome! To help me understand if you might be eligible, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 18 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently in education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I just finished my A-Levels and I've started a Higher National Certificate course at my local college.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Is the course you are taking considered an "Approved" or "Advanced" course?

[evaluation_judge]: It's an Advanced course. It's a BTEC Higher National Certificate, which is a level 4 qualification.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, is the college you are attending a university?

[evaluation_judge]: No, it's not a university. It's just a local college.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you've provided – that you are 18, in advanced education (a Level 4 HNC at a college, not a university) – it seems you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit. This is because Child Benefit generally stops when someone turns 18 and is in non-advanced education. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit. They accurately identified that my HNC course is considered "advanced education" (Level 4), which disqualifies me from Child Benefit that only covers non-advanced education up to Level 3/A-Level standard.
