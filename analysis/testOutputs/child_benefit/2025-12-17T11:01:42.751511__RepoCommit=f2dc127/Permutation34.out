[evaluation_judge]: I'll act as a parent seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility when a child is in custody. I'll engage with the agent until they provide an eligibility determination, then evaluate if their response matches the expected outcome.

Hi, i'm Lisa and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay Lisa, I understand. I’m here to help you figure out if you’re eligible for Child Benefit. Let’s start with a simple question: Is the child, Mark, living with you at the moment?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Mark isn't living with me right now. He's actually been sentenced to a youth custody center.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know that Mark is currently in a youth custody center. That’s helpful information.

To clarify, is Mark currently in custody – meaning held in a prison or detention center – as a result of his sentence?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's in a youth custody center. He was sentenced for 6 months and he's been there for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lisa. That’s very important to know. Just to confirm, Mark has been in the custody center for approximately 10 weeks, and his sentence is for six months, is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. He's been there for 10 weeks now and he has a 6-month sentence in total.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Now, I need to check something related to the length of time he’s been in custody.  Considering the rules, has Mark been in custody for longer than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's been in custody for 10 weeks now. It's been over 8 weeks already.

[root_agent]: Right, thank you for clarifying that. Based on the information you’ve provided – that Mark is in custody and has been there for over 8 weeks – I must inform you that you are unlikely to be eligible for Child Benefit at this time. The rules state that Child Benefit generally stops being paid after a child has been in custody for 8 weeks. 

Do you understand this outcome?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I understand. So I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit since he's been in custody for more than 8 weeks. That makes sense, although it's disappointing to hear. Thank you for explaining it to me.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit since my child has been in custody for more than 8 weeks (10 weeks), which matches the expected outcome.
