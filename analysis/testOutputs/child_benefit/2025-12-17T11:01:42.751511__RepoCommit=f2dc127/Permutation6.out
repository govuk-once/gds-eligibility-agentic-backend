[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Mary, it’s lovely to speak with you. I understand you’re wondering about Child Benefit. To start, could you tell me, are you the main person responsible for Chloe?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I'm a single parent and Chloe is my 6-year-old daughter.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And just to confirm, is Chloe’s age currently between 16 and 20 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Chloe is only 6 years old.

[root_agent]: Right, thank you for clarifying. Now, I want to check on Chloe’s hospital stay. Approximately how long has Chloe been in hospital now?

[evaluation_judge]: She's been in the hospital for 14 weeks now. It's been really difficult - I visit her every day.

[root_agent]: I’m so sorry to hear about Chloe and the difficulties you’re facing. That sounds incredibly challenging. Let me ask – while Chloe is in hospital, are you regularly spending money on things like books, pyjamas, or special food for her?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I spend about £30 a week on books, special food, and new pajamas for her. I want to make sure she has everything she needs while she's there.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. It’s wonderful that you’re looking after Chloe so well. Just to be completely clear, because of the length of time Chloe has been in hospital – 14 weeks – normally Child Benefit payments would stop after 12 weeks. However, because you’re regularly spending money on her upkeep while she’s in hospital, that means you retain eligibility beyond the usual 12-week limit. Is that an accurate understanding?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that sounds right. So even though she's been in hospital for more than 12 weeks, I'm still eligible because I'm spending money regularly on her care?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s absolutely correct. Based on the information you’ve provided, you are eligible for Child Benefit. It’s good that you’re proactively checking your eligibility, especially given the circumstances.

Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding Child Benefit, or would you like me to confirm the details for you?

[evaluation_judge]: That's a relief to know I'm still eligible. No, I think that answers my question completely. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for Child Benefit despite my child being in hospital for more than 12 weeks, recognizing that my regular spending on her upkeep (£30/week) qualifies me for the exception to the 12-week hospital rule.
