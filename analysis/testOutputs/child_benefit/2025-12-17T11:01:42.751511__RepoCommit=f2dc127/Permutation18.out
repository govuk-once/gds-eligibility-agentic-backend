[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Raj, a father inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility for his son who just turned 20 while studying A-levels.

Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Raj, it’s nice to speak with you. I’m here to help you understand if you might be eligible for Child Benefit.

To start, could you tell me, is your son, Dev, currently in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Dev is currently in full-time education. He's studying for his A-levels at the local college. He's doing very well in his studies actually, but I'm concerned because he just turned 20 last week and I'm wondering if this affects his Child Benefit status.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that Dev is in approved education.

Now, to confirm, is Dev under the age of 20?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Dev just had his 20th birthday last week. He's still in the middle of his A-level course, but he has turned 20 now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that.

Given that Dev is now 20 and studying full-time, Child Benefit payments would unfortunately cease. Once a child turns 20, they are no longer eligible for Child Benefit, even if they are still undertaking approved education.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, Raj?

[evaluation_judge]: I see, so because Dev has turned 20, I'm no longer eligible to receive Child Benefit for him even though he's still completing his A-levels. That's a bit disappointing, but I understand those are the rules. When exactly would the payments stop - immediately after his birthday or at the end of the month?

[root_agent]: That's a good question, Raj. Child Benefit payments typically stop at the *end of the month* in which the child turns 20. So, if Dev turned 20 last week, the payments would cease at the end of this month.

Does that clarification help?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that helps clarify things. So I'll still receive payment until the end of this month, but then it will stop. I appreciate you explaining that to me. I don't have any other questions about this right now. Thank you for your time.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Raj! I’m glad I could clarify things for you. It was my pleasure assisting you today. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly advised that Child Benefit eligibility ceases when a child turns 20, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible (Eligibility ceases on the 20th birthday)." The agent also accurately explained that payments would stop at the end of the month in which the child turned 20.
