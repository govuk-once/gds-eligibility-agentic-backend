[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Raj, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me the age of the child you are claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm claiming for my son Dev. He's 19 years old at the moment, but he'll be turning 20 soon.

[root_agent]: Thank you, that's helpful. Is Dev currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's in full-time education. He's studying for his A-levels at the moment.

[root_agent]: Great, thanks. And just to confirm, is Dev currently *under* 20 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's currently 19, but he'll be turning 20 in the middle of his current term.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Just so I understand correctly, Dev will turn 20 *during* his current A-level studies?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. He's 19 now but will turn 20 mid-way through this term while he's still studying for his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. To be clear, Child Benefit can continue to be paid until the end of the course if someone is aged 16 to 19 and in approved education. However, once a child turns 20, eligibility for Child Benefit generally stops, even if they are still in full-time education. 

Given Dev will be 20 during his current term, it sounds like your entitlement to Child Benefit may be affected. Just to be certain, are you currently receiving Child Benefit for Dev?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently receiving Child Benefit for Dev. So what happens when he turns 20 during the term?

[root_agent]: Thanks for confirming you’re currently receiving it. Your Child Benefit payments will continue up to and including the day *before* Dev turns 20. Once he reaches the age of 20, your entitlement will cease, even though he’s still studying. You will need to inform HMRC of Dev’s 20th birthday. Would you like me to explain anything further about this?

[evaluation_judge]: So to be clear, I'll only receive the Child Benefit up until the day before his 20th birthday, and then it stops completely? I need to inform HMRC about this?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct. You will receive Child Benefit up to, but not including, Dev’s 20th birthday. Then, your payments will stop. And yes, you do need to inform HMRC of his 20th birthday – they won’t automatically know. 

Would you like me to provide information on how to contact HMRC to inform them?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful to know how I should contact HMRC about this. Also, is there any other benefit that might be available to help with Dev's education after he turns 20?

[root_agent]: Okay, regarding contacting HMRC, you can report the change in circumstances – Dev turning 20 – through the following methods:

*   **Online:** Via your online HMRC account for Child Benefit.
*   **Phone:** Call HMRC on 0300 200 3100.

Regarding other benefits for educational support after Dev turns 20, Child Benefit is specifically for those under 20. There aren't direct replacements for Child Benefit related to *his* education once he reaches 20. However, depending on his circumstances, he *may* be eligible for things like:

*   **Student Finance:** For tuition fees and maintenance loans if he goes on to university.
*   **Universal Credit:** If he's on a low income, he could potentially claim Universal Credit as an independent individual.
*   **Tax Credits:** Depending on his and your income, he might be eligible for Working Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit (though eligibility criteria apply).

Those depend on *Dev’s* individual circumstances after he turns 20 though, and aren’t a direct replacement for Child Benefit. Would you like me to give you more information on any of those options?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit will cease once Dev turns 20, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible" once he celebrates his 20th birthday.
