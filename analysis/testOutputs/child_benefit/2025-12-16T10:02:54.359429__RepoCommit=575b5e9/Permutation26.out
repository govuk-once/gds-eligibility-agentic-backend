[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Mo, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible, could you please tell me the age of the child you are applying for Child Benefit for?

[evaluation_judge]: My son Zahid is 15 years old. He doesn't live with me though - he lives with his aunt. I send £15 a week to help support him.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mo. Does anyone else contribute financially to Zahid's upbringing while he lives with his aunt?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, actually my mother - Zahid's grandmother - also sends £15 a week to my aunt to help with Zahid's care.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mo. Just to clarify, does your aunt claim any benefits for Zahid?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my aunt doesn't claim any benefits for Zahid.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that, Mo. To be certain, could you confirm that the £15 you contribute each week is directly to support Zahid, and not for any other purpose?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the £15 I send each week is specifically to help with Zahid's care and upkeep. It's for him, not for anything else.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Mo. Based on the information you've provided, it seems you may be eligible for Child Benefit. To confirm, are you the child’s parent?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am Zahid's father.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you Mo. One final question – are you responsible for Zahid’s care, even though he lives with his aunt?

[evaluation_judge]: I wouldn't say I'm responsible for his day-to-day care since he lives with my aunt, but I do contribute financially to his upkeep, as does my mother.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mo. Based on everything you’ve told me – that Zahid is 15, lives with his aunt, you and your mother combined contribute at least £26.05 a week, your aunt doesn’t claim benefits for him, and you are his father – it appears you *are* eligible for Child Benefit. 

Would you like me to explain further how the combined contributions work in this situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain a bit more about how the combined contributions work. I wasn't sure if I'd be eligible since I don't pay the full amount myself.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Mo. The rules state that even if you don’t personally contribute the full amount of Child Benefit (£26.05 per week) yourself, you can still be eligible if the total contributions from anyone supporting Zahid add up to at least that amount. 

In your case, you contribute £15 a week, and your mother contributes another £15, totaling £30 a week. Because this combined amount meets the £26.05 threshold, it satisfies the financial contribution requirement for eligibility. The guidance allows for contributions from multiple people to be combined. Does that make things clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes it much clearer, thank you! So between my £15 and my mother's £15, we're contributing enough to meet the threshold. That's great news.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Mo! I'm glad I could help. It sounds like you’ve understood it perfectly. If you have any further questions about Child Benefit or anything else, please don’t hesitate to ask.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit, accurately explaining that contributions from multiple people (myself and my mother) can be combined to meet the threshold of £26.05, with our combined £30 weekly contribution.
