[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'll help you evaluate the agent's performance. I'll now play the role of a person seeking benefits information.

Hi, i'm Hans and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Hans, it's lovely to meet you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits.

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 30 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Hans. And are you currently employed?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm currently unemployed. I've been unemployed for about 95 days now and I've been claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker. I have Pre-Settled Status in the UK.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hans. Just to clarify, do you have a current, confirmed job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any job offer at the moment. I'm still looking for work but haven't found anything yet.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming, Hans. Do you have any other income or financial support besides the Child Benefit you've been receiving?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any other income or financial support. I've just been receiving Child Benefit while looking for work these past 95 days.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Hans. With your Pre-Settled Status and having been unemployed for 95 days while claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker, and without a current job offer or other income, it appears your eligibility may have expired.

The rules state that someone with Pre-Settled Status can usually claim as a jobseeker for 91 days. Would you like me to explain this in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this to me in more detail. What happens after 91 days?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Hans. The rules state that with Pre-Settled Status, you can generally claim benefits as a jobseeker for 91 days. After that period, unless you have a genuine prospect of work – such as a job offer – or you have other resources to support yourself, your right to reside for the purpose of claiming benefits usually expires. 

As you’ve been unemployed for 95 days and don’t have a job offer, it looks like you may have reached that point where your eligibility has unfortunately ended.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you?

[evaluation_judge]: So you're telling me I'm not eligible anymore for Child Benefit because I've been claiming as a jobseeker for longer than 91 days? Is there anything I can do to maintain eligibility?

[root_agent]: That is correct, Hans. Based on the information you’ve provided, you are likely no longer eligible for Child Benefit based on being a jobseeker, as you’ve exceeded the 91-day limit without a job offer or other resources.

To potentially maintain eligibility, you would need to demonstrate a genuine prospect of work – for example, having a confirmed job interview scheduled soon or a conditional job offer. Alternatively, you'd need to be able to demonstrate you have sufficient other resources to support yourself.

Would you like me to explain what is considered ‘sufficient resources’ or perhaps point you to information about finding work?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit as my jobseeker status has expired after exceeding the 91-day limit without a job offer.
