[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jordan and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Jordan, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And are you currently in approved education or training – for example, college, university, or an apprenticeship?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not. I finished my GCSEs last year but I'm not in college or doing any training right now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Have you registered with any government-sponsored careers service, the armed forces, or a similar program? This is to see if you might be eligible for an extension to benefits beyond age 16.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't registered with any careers service or anything like that. I'm not doing any programs at the moment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you may not be eligible for Child Benefit. This is because Child Benefit usually continues to be paid for those aged 16-19 only if they are in approved education or training, or have registered with certain services. 

Would you like me to explain this in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain it in more detail. I thought my dad might still be getting some benefit for me.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Child Benefit is usually paid until a young person turns 18, but there are conditions. If a young person is 16-19, the benefit continues *only* if they are:

*   In approved education (like A-levels, BTECs, or university)
*   In approved training (like an apprenticeship)
*   Or have registered with a government-sponsored careers service, the armed forces, or a similar program.

Because you finished your GCSEs and aren’t currently in education or training, and haven’t registered with any of those services, the payments would likely have stopped. 

Your dad might have been receiving it up until you turned 16, but it’s unlikely to continue beyond that without meeting one of those conditions. Does that make sense?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So basically since I'm 17 but not in any education, training, or registered with any careers service, my dad wouldn't be getting Child Benefit for me anymore. Thank you for explaining.

✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since I'm 17, not in approved education or training, and haven't registered with any careers service that would qualify me for the 20-week extension.
