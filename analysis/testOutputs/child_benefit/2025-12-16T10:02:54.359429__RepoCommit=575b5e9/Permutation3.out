[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as a user named Gary who is seeking information about benefit eligibility for his son who recently left school and is looking for an apprenticeship.

Hi, i'm Gary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Gary, it's lovely to speak with you today. I'm happy to help you understand what benefits you might be eligible for.

To start, could you tell me how old your son is?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. My son Ben is 17 years old. He lives with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. And has Ben recently left school?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Ben left school in June this year. He's not gone on to college, but he's registered with the local youth careers service and is actively looking for an apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: That's good to know, Gary. Is Ben currently receiving any other financial support or benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's not receiving any financial support or benefits at the moment. I'm his only source of support right now while he's looking for an apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Gary. To clarify, when you say you are his only source of support, do you mean he is living with you full-time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he lives with me full-time. It's just the two of us in the house.

[root_agent]: Thanks Gary. Finally, just to confirm, are you a UK resident?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am a UK resident.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information, Gary. Based on what you've told me – that your son Ben is 17, he left school in June and is actively seeking an apprenticeship while registered with a careers service, he lives with you full-time, and you are a UK resident – you are likely eligible for Child Benefit for him. 

However, as he is over 16 and no longer in approved education, this eligibility is time-limited to a maximum of 20 weeks from when he left school. As it is currently August, you are still within that 20-week window.

Would you like me to explain anything further about this, or perhaps discuss how to claim?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news. So I can receive Child Benefit for Ben for up to 20 weeks after he left school in June? Is there anything I need to do to claim this, or will it continue automatically if I was already receiving it for him?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Gary! Yes, that's correct – you can receive Child Benefit for Ben for up to 20 weeks after he left school in June.

Whether you need to do anything depends on if you were *already* receiving Child Benefit for Ben while he was in school or college. 

If you **were** already receiving it, the payments should continue automatically as long as you've informed HMRC that he's no longer in education. You can do this by signing into your online account on gov.uk or by calling them.

If you **weren’t** already receiving Child Benefit, you’ll need to make a new claim. Would you like me to outline the basic steps for making a claim?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been receiving Child Benefit for Ben while he was in school. I'll make sure to inform HMRC about his change in education status. One more question - if Ben does find an apprenticeship within the 20-week period, would that affect the Child Benefit payments?

[root_agent]: That’s good to hear you’ve been receiving it already, Gary. Informing HMRC is the key step!

And yes, that’s a very good question. If Ben finds an apprenticeship (which is a qualifying education) within the 20-week period, the Child Benefit payments would continue as normal, as he would then meet the criteria of being under 20 and in approved education. 

However, if he *doesn't* find an apprenticeship and remains unemployed after the 20-week period, the Child Benefit will stop.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, Gary?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that covers everything I needed to know. Thanks for explaining it all so clearly. It's good to know I can keep receiving Child Benefit during this transition period while Ben is looking for an apprenticeship, and that it would continue if he finds one. That's a big help for us.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Gary! I'm delighted I could help clarify everything for you. It's completely understandable to want to ensure you're receiving all the support you're entitled to during this time. 

I wish Ben all the best in his search for an apprenticeship. If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. 

Have a lovely day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I am eligible for Child Benefit for my 17-year-old son who recently left education, within the 20-week extension period. They accurately explained the temporary nature of this eligibility and that benefits would continue if my son found an apprenticeship within this period. This matches the expected outcome.
