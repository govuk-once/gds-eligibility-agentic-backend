[evaluation_judge]: I'll roleplay as Sarah, a 45-year-old mother who wants to claim Child Benefit for her 18-year-old daughter Emma who has just started university. I'll engage with the agent until I receive an eligibility determination, then assess whether their outcome matches the expected outcome (which is "Not Eligible" since Emma has started advanced education at university).

Let me begin the conversation with the agent under test.

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, thank you for contacting me today. I understand you’re hoping to claim Child Benefit for your daughter, Emma.

To start, could you please tell me how old is Emma?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. Yes, I'm hoping to see if I can claim Child Benefit for my daughter Emma. She's 18 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Is Emma under 20?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Emma is 18, so she's under 20 years old.

[root_agent]: Alright. And can you tell me what type of education Emma is currently undertaking? Is it “Approved Education” or “Advanced Education”?

[evaluation_judge]: Emma has just started a 3-year Bachelor's degree at a university. She lives at home with me and commutes to the university each day.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. So, Emma is undertaking “Advanced Education” – a university degree. 

Just to confirm, she’s 18 and currently studying for a Bachelor’s degree, and she still lives at home with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. She's 18, studying for a Bachelor's degree at university, and she still lives at home with me and commutes to university each day.

[root_agent]: Okay, Sarah. Thank you for confirming all of that. Based on the information you’ve provided, Emma is currently undertaking advanced education – a university degree – and as per the Child Benefit guidelines, Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education.

Therefore, I’m afraid you are not eligible for Child Benefit in this case.

Do you have any other questions for me today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any other questions. Thank you for the information.

Based on my assessment, the agent provided the correct determination. The agent correctly identified that Emma is undertaking "Advanced Education" (a university degree) and concluded that I am "Not Eligible" for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome specified in the scenario. The agent properly followed the guideline that Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education such as a university degree.
