[evaluation_judge]: I'll help you evaluate the agent by role-playing as Beatrice in this scenario. I understand I need to act as a UK resident seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility in this specific situation, and continue the dialogue until the agent provides an eligibility outcome. Then I'll assess whether their determination matches the expected outcome (Eligible).

Let me know when you're ready for me to begin the role-play, and I'll interact with the agent under test as Beatrice, inquiring about my Child Benefit eligibility given my son Leo is in local authority care but my husband is contributing to his upkeep.

[root_agent]: Okay, I'm ready. Let's begin.

First, I’d like to ask: Has the child been in care for longer than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my son Leo has been in local authority care for about 10 weeks now. It's been quite difficult for our family.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Now, I’d like to ask: Can the applicant claim if *they* aren’t paying, but their partner is?

[evaluation_judge]: That's exactly my situation. I don't have any income myself, so I can't contribute to Leo's upkeep. But my husband - Leo's stepfather - sends about £30 per week to the carer to help with Leo's expenses. We're married and living together. Does that make a difference for my eligibility?

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that detail. It’s helpful to know that you’re married and living together. 

Just to be clear, is your husband transferring money to the carer to cover Leo’s upkeep?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. My husband transfers £30 per week directly to the carer to help with Leo's upkeep and expenses while he's in local authority care.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Based on this information, I can confirm that you are eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's good news! Can you explain why I'm eligible even though Leo is in local authority care? I was worried that because he's been away for more than 8 weeks, I might not qualify anymore.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Because your husband is contributing to Leo’s upkeep – even though you aren’t directly – that is considered a contribution. The rules state that a partner’s money counts as the applicant’s contribution, provided they are married or civil partners and living together. Since his contribution meets the criteria, you remain eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: I understand now. So even though Leo has been in care for over 8 weeks, my husband's regular contributions of £30 per week count as my contribution because we're married and living together. That's really helpful to know. Thank you for explaining that I'm still eligible for Child Benefit in these circumstances.

[evaluation_judge]: The agent performed correctly in this evaluation. The agent's final determination was that Beatrice is eligible for Child Benefit, which matches the expected outcome.

The agent accurately:
1. Confirmed the key facts of the scenario (child in care for >8 weeks)
2. Asked clarifying questions about the spousal contributions
3. Correctly applied the rule that a partner's financial contributions count as the applicant's when they are married and living together
4. Explained that even though Beatrice herself has no income, her husband's regular payments of £30/week to the carer satisfy the contribution requirement

The agent demonstrated good knowledge of the specific exception to the 8-week care rule when contributions to upkeep are being made by a spouse. This was a nuanced scenario, and the agent handled it correctly.
