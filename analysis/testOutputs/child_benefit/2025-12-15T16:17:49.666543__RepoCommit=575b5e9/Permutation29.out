[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jordan and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Jordan, it's nice to meet you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me your age?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17. I finished my GCSEs last year.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that's helpful to know. Are you currently in approved education or training? This could be things like A-levels, college, an apprenticeship, or volunteering that counts as training.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not in any education or training at the moment. I'm not working either.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Have you registered with any government-sponsored careers service, like a careers advisor, or with the armed forces? This is to see if you might qualify for an extension to child benefit eligibility.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't registered with any careers service or anything like that.

[root_agent]: Thank you for being so open. Just to clarify, you are 17, not currently in education or training, not working, and haven’t registered with a careers service. Based on this information, it appears you may not be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Would you like me to explain why, or would you like to double-check any of the details we've discussed?

[evaluation_judge]: Yeah, could you explain why I'm not eligible? I thought my dad might get some help since I'm still living with him.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Child Benefit generally continues to be paid until a child turns 18, *if* they are in approved education or training. As you’ve finished your GCSEs and aren't currently in education, training or registered with a careers service, the usual conditions for continued eligibility aren’t met.

There's a provision for 16-17 year olds to continue receiving Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks *after* leaving education, but only if they register with a careers service, the armed forces, or a similar program. Since that hasn't happened, unfortunately, it seems you’re not currently eligible. 

Does that make sense? I can provide a little more detail if you’d like.





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So basically since I'm not in education, training, or registered anywhere, we're not eligible for Child Benefit right now. If I were to register with a careers service, would that change things?

[root_agent]: That’s right – you’ve understood perfectly.

And yes, registering with a government-sponsored careers service *would* potentially change things! It would allow you to claim Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from the date you registered. So it’s worth considering if that’s something you’d like to do.



Is there anything else I can help you with today? Perhaps information about registering with a careers service?

[evaluation_judge]: That would be helpful actually. Where would I go to register with a careers service?

[root_agent]: Certainly! In England and Wales, you can find information and register with a careers advisor through the National Careers Service. Their website is a good place to start: [https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/](https://nationalcareers.service.gov.uk/)

They have a helpline too, if you’d prefer to speak to someone directly: 0800 121 4000. 

They can offer advice and help you find suitable training or employment opportunities. Would you like me to clarify anything about this, or perhaps look into options available specifically in your area? (If you’re comfortable sharing your general location, of course - it’s not required!).

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's really helpful. I'll check out that website and think about calling them. Thanks for explaining everything to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Jordan! I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions in the future. Wishing you all the best in finding the right next step for you.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly explained that I am not eligible for Child Benefit since I am 17, not in education or training, and not registered with a careers service. The information provided was accurate and matches the expected outcome.
