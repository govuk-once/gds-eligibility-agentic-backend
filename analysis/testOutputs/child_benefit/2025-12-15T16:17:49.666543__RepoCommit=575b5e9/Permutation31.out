[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you're eligible, could you please tell me how old your child is?

[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Emma is 18 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And is Emma currently in education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she's just started a 3-year Bachelor's degree at university. She still lives at home with me and commutes to the university daily.

[root_agent]: Thanks for that information. To clarify, would you say Emma is undertaking what's known as "Approved Education" or "Advanced Education"? (Approved Education includes things like A-Levels or NVQ Level 3, while Advanced Education includes university degrees like the Bachelor's degree she's pursuing).

[evaluation_judge]: She's in Advanced Education - she's doing a Bachelor's degree at university.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on the information you've provided, as Emma is 18 and undertaking Advanced Education (a Bachelor's degree), you are unfortunately not eligible for Child Benefit. Child Benefit typically stops when a child starts advanced education like a university degree. 

I hope this information is helpful, even though it's not the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So I can't claim Child Benefit for Emma now that she's started university? Are there any other benefits I might be eligible for to help support her while she's studying?

[root_agent]: You are correct, you can’t claim Child Benefit for Emma while she's studying for her Bachelor’s degree.

I’m focused on assessing eligibility for Child Benefit right now, and don’t have information on other benefits you might be eligible for. I would recommend checking the government website for a benefits calculator or exploring options specifically for students. Would you like me to confirm your details again to double-check the Child Benefit eligibility before we finish?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's okay. I understand now that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since Emma has started her university degree. Thank you for explaining.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter is in Advanced Education (university degree), which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
