[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Alice and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Alice, it's good to speak with you. I understand you're looking to understand your eligibility for a particular benefit.

To start, could you please tell me how old your children are?





[evaluation_judge]: I have a 14-year-old son named Tom. He has severe behavioral needs and has recently moved into a residential school. The local council is paying for it.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Alice. 

Could you please tell me how long Tom has been staying at the residential school?

[evaluation_judge]: Tom has been at the residential school for 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Alice. To clarify, is this residential school providing care because of his behavioral needs, and is it paid for by the local council?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. The residential school is specifically for children with severe behavioral needs like Tom has. The local council is paying for his placement there because of these needs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Alice. 

Just to be certain, is this a situation where Tom is living away from home for education or because of his care needs, rather than being in the care of the local authority (like fostering)?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Tom is living at the residential school for education that can address his severe behavioral needs. He's not in foster care or in the care of the local authority in that sense. It's a residential accommodation for his educational and behavioral support needs.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Alice. That's very helpful.

Knowing this, it sounds like Tom is in Residential Accommodation. Are there any other children you receive Child Benefit for?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Tom is my only child. I don't receive Child Benefit for any other children.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Alice. 

Based on the information you've provided, as Tom is 14, in residential accommodation due to his behavioral needs, and it’s been 10 weeks since he started living there, you are currently eligible for Child Benefit. This is because eligibility continues for up to 12 weeks in these circumstances.

Would you like me to explain anything further about this, or are you happy with this initial assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: That's good to know I'm still eligible. Just to make sure I understand correctly - will I stop being eligible after the 12 weeks are up? And is there anything I need to do at that point?

[root_agent]: You're right to check, Alice. Yes, your eligibility for Child Benefit for Tom will end after 12 weeks from when he started living at the residential school. So, in your case, that would be in 2 weeks.

At that point, you'll need to inform HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) that Tom is no longer eligible. You can do this through your online Child Benefit account, or by calling them. They will likely ask for confirmation that Tom is still residing at the school. 

Would you like me to provide you with the number for HMRC, or information on how to manage your Child Benefit online?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the number for HMRC would be helpful, thank you. Just to be absolutely clear, there's no way for me to keep receiving Child Benefit after the 12 weeks are up, even though Tom is still my son and I'm still supporting him when he comes home for visits?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Alice. 

The number for HMRC is 0300 200 3100. It's best to call between 8am and 6pm, Monday to Friday.

And you are correct to clarify. Unfortunately, even with visits home and your continued support, Child Benefit eligibility ends after the 12-week period for children in residential accommodation. The rules are quite specific on this timeframe, regardless of ongoing parental support or the child's needs. 

I understand this might be frustrating, but I want to ensure you have accurate information. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am eligible for Child Benefit because my son has been in residential accommodation for 10 weeks, which is under the 12-week limit for eligibility.
