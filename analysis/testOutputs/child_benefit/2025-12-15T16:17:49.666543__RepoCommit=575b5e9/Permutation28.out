[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Maria, it's good to speak with you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 35 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And do you currently live in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently in the UK. I'm from the US and I'm here on a standard 6-month tourist visa with my 5-year-old son.

[root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know. Are you currently working in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not working while I'm here. I'm just visiting.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Do you have a settled status in the UK, or do you have a right to reside based on a qualifying immigration status – for example, as an EEA national with worker status?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have settled status. I'm just here as a tourist on a standard 6-month visitor visa from the US.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Do you have any other children living with you in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Just my 5-year-old son who I brought with me on this trip.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. To confirm, your son is 5 years old and also in the UK with you on the same visitor visa?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. He's 5 years old and he's here with me on the same visitor visa arrangement.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you've provided, it appears you may not be eligible for Child Benefit as you are in the UK as a visitor, and those with standard visitor visas generally don't have a right to reside for benefit purposes. 

However, I want to be sure I've covered everything. Is your son currently receiving any form of long-term hospital or care treatment?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's not receiving any long-term hospital or care treatment. We're both just here temporarily as visitors.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Based on everything you’ve told me, it seems you are not currently eligible for Child Benefit. This is because you are visiting the UK on a standard tourist visa, which doesn’t usually provide a right to reside for benefit purposes.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So just to be clear, because I'm here on a tourist visa, I don't qualify for Child Benefit? Is there any other benefit I might be eligible for during my stay?

[root_agent]: You are correct, because you are here on a tourist visa, you don’t qualify for Child Benefit. 

Regarding other benefits, generally, visitors to the UK are not entitled to most benefits. The rules are quite strict about needing a right to reside to access public funds. Given your visitor status, it’s unlikely you would be eligible for other benefits during your stay.

However, to be absolutely certain, could you tell me if you are receiving any financial support from anyone while you are in the UK? This would include financial help from family or friends. It won’t change your eligibility for Child Benefit, but helps me be sure I’ve considered all possibilities.

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not receiving any financial support from anyone while I'm here. I have my own savings that I'm using during our visit. 

I understand that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit or other benefits because of my visa status. Thank you for explaining that to me.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Maria. I'm glad I could clarify things for you. It sounds like you're well-prepared for your visit. 

If you have any further questions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. Have a lovely stay in the UK with your son!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for your help and kind wishes. Have a good day!

✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit due to my tourist visa status, which doesn't provide the necessary right to reside for benefit purposes. The agent gave the accurate outcome matching the expected "Not Eligible" result.
