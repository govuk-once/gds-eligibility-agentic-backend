[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Karen and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Karen, it's lovely to speak with you. I understand you're checking your eligibility for a benefit. To start, could you please tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 44 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Karen. And do you have any children?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a son called Ryan. He's 17.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that’s good to know. Is Ryan currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: He actually just left school and has started an Intermediate Apprenticeship. It's government-funded, and he's still living at home with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Karen. Just to clarify, is this apprenticeship in England?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, the apprenticeship is in England.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And are you responsible for Ryan financially?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. He still lives at home with me and I support him financially.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Karen. Based on the information you've provided, as Ryan has started a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England and is over 16, you are unfortunately no longer eligible for Child Benefit. 

Do you have any questions about this?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit surprised. I thought I could still claim Child Benefit while he's doing training. Does it matter that it's an apprenticeship rather than staying at school?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask, it can be confusing! Yes, it does matter. While staying in full-time education like A-levels would allow you to continue claiming Child Benefit, starting an apprenticeship in England is considered a disqualifying event, even though it *is* training. The rules are different for apprenticeships. 

Would you like me to explain this in a bit more detail, or perhaps point you to where you can find more information on the government website?

[evaluation_judge]: That would be helpful. Can you explain why apprenticeships are treated differently? And do I need to notify anyone that he's started this apprenticeship?

[root_agent]: Certainly. The rules state that Child Benefit generally stops when a child turns 16 and is no longer in approved full-time education. However, there's an exception for those continuing in approved education – like A-levels or university. 

An apprenticeship is considered different because it combines work with training, and the government views this as employment rather than solely education for the purposes of Child Benefit eligibility.

And yes, you *do* need to notify HMRC (the tax office) as soon as possible that Ryan has started his apprenticeship. This is to stop your Child Benefit payments. You can find information on how to do this on the government website, but I'm unable to provide a direct link.



Do you have any other questions?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's clear now. I'll need to contact HMRC to stop my payments. Thank you for explaining the situation to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Karen. I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because my son has started an apprenticeship in England, which is a disqualifying event, even though I'm still financially responsible for him.
