[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a user in this scenario to test the agent's knowledge about benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Lars and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Lars, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me, are you responsible for Hans?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am responsible for my son Hans. He's 5 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. And just to confirm, is Hans 5 years old?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. Hans is 5 years old. We moved here from Germany not long ago.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful. And do you currently have a qualifying right to reside in the UK for benefits purposes?

[evaluation_judge]: I have Pre-Settled Status under the EU Settlement Scheme. I'm currently unemployed but I've registered as a jobseeker and I'm actively looking for work. Does that give me the right to reside for benefits?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Holders of Pre-Settled Status can often claim Child Benefit under certain circumstances, particularly if they are registered as a jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work. 

Could you tell me, are you currently receiving any comprehensive sickness insurance?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any comprehensive sickness insurance at the moment. I'm just focused on finding work right now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just one more question to confirm – are you actively looking for work at the moment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am actively looking for work. I've registered as a jobseeker officially and I'm applying for jobs regularly.

[root_agent]: Okay, Lars. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you are responsible for Hans, he is of eligible age, you have Pre-Settled Status and are registered as a jobseeker with a genuine prospect of work – it appears you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Would you like me to explain the process of applying for Child Benefit in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, that would be very helpful. Could you explain how I can apply for Child Benefit?

[root_agent]: Certainly. To apply for Child Benefit, you can typically do so online through the government website. You’ll need your National Insurance number, Hans’s date of birth, and information about your income and housing. 

Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official application form?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, a link to the official application form would be great. Also, is there anything specific I need to prove about my jobseeker status when applying?

[root_agent]: Okay, here’s the link to the official Child Benefit application form: [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-application](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-application)

Regarding proving your jobseeker status, it’s generally helpful to include a copy of your jobseeker’s account confirmation or a letter from the jobcentre confirming your registration and active jobsearching. While not always explicitly requested, having this documentation readily available can speed up the application process.

Do you want me to elaborate on any part of the application process, or perhaps discuss what documentation you might need to gather?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit based on my Pre-Settled Status as an EU citizen actively job-seeking with a 5-year-old child in my care.
