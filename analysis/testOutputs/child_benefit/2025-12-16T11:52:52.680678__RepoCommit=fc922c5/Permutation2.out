[evaluation_judge]: I'll now act as Amit, a single father inquiring about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Amit and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Amit, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me, are you responsible for Priya?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am responsible for my daughter Priya. She lives with me at our home in London. I'm her single father.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. To help me assess your eligibility, could you tell me, is Priya under 16, or under 20 and in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Priya is 17 years old. She's finished her GCSEs and is now studying full-time for her A-levels at a local sixth-form college.

[root_agent]: That’s helpful to know. And just to confirm, does Priya live with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Priya lives with me full-time in our home in London.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And to help me understand your situation fully, are you a UK resident?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am a UK resident. We live in London.

[root_agent]: Alright. Finally, could you tell me, are you liable for the tax charge on Child Benefit? (This means are you earning over £60,000?)

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not earning over £60,000. My income is £40,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Okay, Amit. Based on this information – that you’re responsible for Priya, she’s under 20 and in approved education, you’re a UK resident, and your income is under £60,000 – it appears you might be eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to provide you with some links to the official guidance on Child Benefit eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would appreciate links to the official guidance on Child Benefit eligibility. That would be very helpful, thank you.

Do you have any questions about these links, or anything else regarding Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for these links. Just to be clear, based on everything I've told you, am I definitely eligible for Child Benefit for my daughter Priya?
