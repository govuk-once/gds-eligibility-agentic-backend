[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Emily and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, Emily, it’s lovely to meet you. To help me figure out if you might be eligible for any benefits, could you tell me, are you currently studying at university?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not at university. I've finished my A-Levels and I'm now doing a Higher National Certificate course at my local college.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That's helpful. Now, could you tell me if your Higher National Certificate course is considered “Approved” or “Advanced”?

[evaluation_judge]: The course is considered "Advanced" education. It's a BTEC Higher National Certificate at level 4.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Okay, Emily, based on this information, it appears you are not eligible for Child Benefit. As the course is considered “Advanced” education, it doesn’t meet the criteria for eligibility. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I wanted to know about. Thank you for the information.

✗ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit because I am on an Advanced education course (HNC is considered advanced education at level 4), which makes me ineligible for Child Benefit since it's only available for non-advanced education up to Level 3.
