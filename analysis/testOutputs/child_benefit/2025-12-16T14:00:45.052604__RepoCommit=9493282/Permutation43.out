[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Callum and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, Callum. Thanks for letting me know.

To start, could you tell me if this Modern Apprenticeship is an approved training scheme?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm doing a Modern Apprenticeship in Glasgow. I've just turned 17 and I live with my dad. I'm not sure what you mean by "approved training scheme" though.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying.

To help me understand, could you tell me if the training provider for your Modern Apprenticeship has been approved by a relevant organization, like an employer association or training body?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's a proper Modern Apprenticeship through Skills Development Scotland. I'm working with a company and getting trained at the same time. I get paid a wage while I learn.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Callum. That’s very helpful to know.

Just to be clear, as Skills Development Scotland runs the scheme, it’s considered an approved training scheme. 

Now, could you tell me how many siblings you have?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have any siblings. It's just me living with my dad.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know.

Could you tell me how your father is employed – for example, is he full-time, part-time, or self-employed?

[evaluation_judge]: My dad works full-time for a construction company. He's been there for about 5 years now.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for that information.

Could you tell me approximately what your father earns per year?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not exactly sure what my dad earns, but I think it's around £35,000 a year.

[root_agent]: Okay, around £35,000 a year.

Just one more question for now: Are you currently receiving any other benefits or financial support?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not receiving any other benefits or financial support. I just get my apprenticeship wage.

[root_agent]: Okay, Callum. Thank you for all of your answers.

Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re 17, living with your father, undertaking a Modern Apprenticeship through Skills Development Scotland, and neither you nor your father are receiving any other benefits – you do not appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Why am I not eligible for Child Benefit? Is it because of the apprenticeship, or is there another reason?

[root_agent]: That’s a really good question, Callum.

The primary reason you aren’t eligible for Child Benefit is because, as we discussed, the government’s rules state that children undertaking approved apprenticeships generally cannot receive it. This is a specific policy in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland – a different rule applies in Wales.

Do you want me to explain the relevant links for more detail on this rule?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please. I'd like to know more about this rule and if there are any exceptions to it.

[root_agent]: Okay. Here are the links I mentioned for your reference:

*   **Child Benefit Eligibility:** [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility)
*   **Child Benefit - Children Living with Someone Else:** [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else)
*   **Child Benefit for Children in Hospital or Care:** [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care)

As you can see from the first link, the general rule is that children doing apprenticeships aren’t eligible. However, it does state there are some specific exceptions. Would you like me to summarise those exceptions for you, or would you like me to elaborate on any particular part of the rules?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly informed me that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because I am doing a Modern Apprenticeship in Scotland, which aligns with the expected outcome.
