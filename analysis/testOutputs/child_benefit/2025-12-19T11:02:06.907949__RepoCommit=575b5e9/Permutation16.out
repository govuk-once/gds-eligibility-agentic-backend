[evaluation_judge]: I'll now adopt the role of Hannah, a UK resident with a son who's receiving medical treatment abroad.

Hi, i'm Hannah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Hannah, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me if you are currently receiving Child Benefit for your son?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been receiving Child Benefit for my son Oliver. He's 14 years old. The situation has changed a bit though, as he's currently receiving treatment at a specialist hospital in the USA for a rare medical condition. He's been there for about 15 weeks now. I'm still here in the UK, but I pay for his additional costs and visit him when I can. I'm worried about whether this affects my Child Benefit.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining, Hannah. It's understandable to be concerned about how this change in circumstances might affect your Child Benefit.

Just to confirm, when Oliver went to the USA, was it specifically for the purpose of receiving this hospital treatment?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. We sent him to the USA specifically for the treatment. His condition is quite rare and the specialist care he needs wasn't available here in the UK. The doctors recommended this particular hospital in the USA because they specialize in his condition. We didn't have much choice really - it was the best option for his health.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Hannah. That's very helpful.

To confirm, are you continuing to financially support Oliver while he is receiving treatment in the USA?

[evaluation_judge]: Absolutely, yes. I'm still covering all his personal expenses - things like additional comfort items, clothes, entertainment while he's able to use it, and some special foods that aren't provided by the hospital. Plus the costs for me to visit him when I can, which is expensive but important for both of us. It's stretching my finances quite thin, to be honest, which is why I'm concerned about the Child Benefit.

[root_agent]: I understand your concern, Hannah, and it's good to know you are continuing to financially support Oliver.

Given that Oliver is receiving hospital treatment abroad specifically for that treatment, and you are still financially supporting him, your Child Benefit should continue uninterrupted. However, to be absolutely certain, could you confirm that you are a UK resident?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am definitely a UK resident. I live here permanently and work here. I've only gone to the USA for short visits to see Oliver, but my home is here in the UK.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent, Hannah. Thank you for confirming.

Based on the information you've provided – Oliver is 14, he's receiving specialist hospital treatment in the USA specifically for that purpose, you are a UK resident, and you are continuing to financially support him – you should remain eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: That's a relief to hear! So even though he's been there for 15 weeks, the Child Benefit will continue? I was worried because it's been quite a long time already, and we're not sure exactly how much longer his treatment will take. No other questions for now - you've answered my main concern. Thank you for the information.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Hannah! I’m glad I could reassure you.

Yes, that’s correct. As long as Oliver continues to receive hospital treatment abroad and you continue to financially support him, your Child Benefit should continue, even if his treatment extends beyond 15 weeks. There isn’t a time limit as long as those conditions are met.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if any further questions come to mind. I wish Oliver all the best with his treatment and a speedy recovery.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you so much for your help. It's good to know that the Child Benefit will continue while he's receiving treatment. I appreciate your kind wishes for Oliver too. Have a good day!

✓ The agent correctly determined that I'm eligible for Child Benefit while my son is receiving hospital treatment abroad. The agent understood that the international exception applies since Oliver went abroad specifically for hospital treatment, and I continue to financially support him while remaining a UK resident.
