[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mark and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Mark, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible, could you please tell me the age of the child you’re considering claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm divorced and have a son named Lucas who is 10 years old. He lives with my ex-wife Jenny, but I'm wondering if I can claim Child Benefit for him.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Mark. Does your ex-wife, Jenny, currently claim Child Benefit for Lucas?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Jenny doesn't claim Child Benefit for Lucas at all.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's good to know. Do you contribute financially towards Lucas's upbringing, and if so, approximately how much do you contribute each month?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I transfer £150 per month to Jenny specifically for Lucas's food and clothes.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Mark. Just to confirm, do you live at the same address as Lucas?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't live with Lucas. He lives with Jenny, my ex-wife.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. Finally, are you currently claiming Child Benefit for any other children?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not claiming Child Benefit for any other children.

[root_agent]: Okay Mark, thank you for providing all of that information. Based on what you've told me – Lucas is 10, Jenny doesn’t claim Child Benefit for him, you contribute £150 a month towards his expenses, and you don’t live with him but aren’t claiming for any other children – it appears you *are* eligible to claim Child Benefit for Lucas. 

Would you like me to explain why, or would you like information on how to apply?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to understand why I'm eligible, especially since I don't live with Lucas.

[root_agent]: Certainly. You're eligible despite not living with Lucas because you contribute financially to his upkeep, and that contribution (£150 per month) exceeds the amount of Child Benefit currently available (£113 per month, roughly). While typically Child Benefit is claimed by the person the child lives with, there's an exception for non-resident parents who contribute significantly to the child's expenses. Because Jenny isn’t claiming, and you meet the financial contribution requirement, you are eligible to claim.

Does that make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. Thank you for explaining. So because my £150 monthly contribution exceeds the Child Benefit amount, and Jenny isn't claiming it, I can claim even though Lucas doesn't live with me. Could you tell me how I would go about applying?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Mark! You’ve understood it perfectly.

To apply for Child Benefit, you’ll need to fill out the CH2 form. Unfortunately, I'm not able to provide a direct link, but if you search “CH2 form gov.uk” on a search engine, it will take you directly to the form on the government website. 

You'll need to provide information about yourself, Lucas, and your financial contributions. It’s also helpful to have Lucas’s birth certificate to hand.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: I think that covers everything I needed to know. I'll search for the CH2 form on the gov.uk website and make sure I have Lucas's birth certificate ready. Thank you for your help with this.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit because I contribute more than the Child Benefit amount to my son's upkeep (£150 vs £113/month), and my ex-wife isn't claiming it, which matches the expected outcome.
