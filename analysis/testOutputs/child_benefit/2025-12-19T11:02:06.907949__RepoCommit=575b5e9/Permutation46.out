[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Hans, a 30-year-old with Pre-Settled Status who has been claiming Child Benefit as a "Jobseeker" for 95 days and has no imminent job offer.

Hi, i'm Hans and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Hans, it's good to speak with you. I'm here to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please confirm how long you have been actively looking for work?





[evaluation_judge]: I've been looking for work for about 95 days now. I've been claiming Child Benefit during this time as a jobseeker with my Pre-Settled Status. I've been applying for jobs but unfortunately haven't received any offers yet.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hans.

Just to clarify, are you currently receiving Child Benefit specifically *because* you are a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm receiving Child Benefit because I have Pre-Settled Status and I've been classified as a "jobseeker" during this period while I've been looking for work. I've been unemployed for these 95 days and still actively searching for jobs.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. 

Do you currently have a job offer, or are you in the process of accepting a job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have a job offer at the moment. I'm still applying and interviewing, but nothing has come through yet. There's nothing imminent or lined up at this point, unfortunately.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Hans. I appreciate you being so upfront with me.

To confirm, you mentioned having Pre-Settled Status. Do you have any other sources of income or support besides Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any other sources of income right now. The Child Benefit has been my main support while I've been looking for work. I don't have any savings or other resources to rely on either.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Hans. 

With the information you've provided, it appears you may no longer be eligible for Child Benefit as a jobseeker. The rules state that claiming as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status is generally limited to 91 days, and you've indicated you've been looking for work for 95 days without a job offer or other resources. 

However, I want to be certain. Are you absolutely sure you haven't had any income from *any* source during these 95 days – even something small or occasional?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I haven't had any income from any source during these 95 days. I've been completely reliant on the Child Benefit payment. I've been applying for jobs consistently but haven't had any paid work, not even something small or occasional. It's just been a difficult period trying to find employment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Hans. 

Based on the information you’ve provided – that you have Pre-Settled Status, have been seeking work for 95 days, have no job offer, and have no other sources of income – it appears you are unfortunately no longer eligible for Child Benefit as a jobseeker. The eligibility period is limited to 91 days without a genuine prospect of work or other resources.

I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or perhaps point you towards resources that could help with your job search?

[evaluation_judge]: That's disappointing to hear. I was really counting on that benefit. Could you explain a little more about why the benefit stops after 91 days? Is there any way I can extend it or reapply if my job search continues to take longer than expected?

[root_agent]: You're right to ask for more detail, Hans, and I'm sorry to deliver disappointing news. The 91-day limit exists because the right to reside in the UK for the purpose of claiming benefits for people with Pre-Settled Status as a jobseeker is time-limited. It's intended to support individuals while they actively seek employment, but it isn't a long-term solution.

Essentially, after 91 days, unless you have a genuine prospect of work – meaning a firm job offer, or you can demonstrate you have sufficient resources to support yourself – the basis for your right to reside for benefit purposes expires. 

Unfortunately, there isn't a simple way to 'extend' the 91-day period. However, you *can* re-establish your right to reside if your circumstances change. For instance, if you *do* find a job, even if it's temporary, that would re-establish your right to reside. Or, if you acquire sufficient funds or other support, that would also change your situation.

Continuing to look for work doesn’t automatically extend the period. The key is demonstrating a change in your circumstances that provides a new basis for your right to reside.



Does that explanation make sense? Would you like me to clarify any part of it?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that explanation makes sense, though it's not what I hoped to hear. So basically, once the 91 days are up, I need to either have a job offer or sufficient resources to support myself in order to maintain my right to reside for benefit purposes. Just continuing to look for work isn't enough on its own.

Are there any other benefits I might be eligible for in the meantime while I continue my job search? Or any government programs that could help me during this period?

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Hans. You're right, simply continuing to look for work isn't enough on its own – there needs to be a change in your circumstances that establishes a new basis for your right to reside.

Regarding other potential benefits, it's a little complex given your Pre-Settled Status. Child Benefit is usually the most accessible benefit in your situation while jobseeking. However, depending on your specific circumstances, you *might* be eligible for Universal Credit.

To determine eligibility for Universal Credit, further assessment is needed regarding your earnings (if any), savings, and other household income. It's also important to note that the rules surrounding Universal Credit for those with Pre-Settled Status can be complex and subject to change.

Would you like me to ask you a few questions to begin exploring your potential eligibility for Universal Credit? It’s important to understand this isn’t a guarantee, but we can check if it’s worth pursuing further.

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information. The original scenario stated I'm claiming Child Benefit as a "Jobseeker," but Child Benefit in the UK is not dependent on employment status - it's available to anyone responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if in education/training). The agent confused my jobseeker status with my Child Benefit claim, when these are separate matters. The time limit would apply to jobseeker-related benefits, not Child Benefit.
