[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Sarah, it's lovely to speak with you. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me how old your child is?

[evaluation_judge]: My daughter Emma is 18 years old. She's just started university, but she's still living at home with me and commutes to classes.

[root_agent]: Thanks for letting me know, Sarah. Is your daughter currently undertaking what's called "Approved Education" – such as A-Levels or an NVQ Level 3 – or is she in "Advanced Education", like a university degree or a BTEC Higher National qualification?

[evaluation_judge]: She's at university studying for a Bachelor's degree. It's a 3-year course that she just started after finishing college.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Sarah. Just to be certain, is your daughter financially dependent on you, or is she fully financially independent while studying?





[evaluation_judge]: She's still financially dependent on me. That's one of the reasons why she's living at home and commuting to university rather than moving into student accommodation.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. As Emma is now undertaking advanced education (a Bachelor’s degree) and is financially dependent on you, unfortunately, you are no longer eligible to continue receiving Child Benefit for her.

Child Benefit typically ends when a child starts full-time advanced education, such as a university degree.

I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. Would you like me to explain this in a little more detail, or perhaps clarify anything about the rules?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, could you please explain why it stops for university education? I thought I might still get it while she's in full-time education.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Sarah. You are right to think you might still get it while she's in full-time education, but the rules differentiate between types of education. 

There's a distinction between "approved education" and "advanced education." Child Benefit can continue while a child is in approved education – things like A-Levels, or NVQ Level 3 qualifications. However, once a child begins “advanced education” – which includes university degrees, like the Bachelor's degree Emma is doing – Child Benefit usually stops.

This is because advanced education is generally considered a stage where young adults are beginning to become financially independent, even if they are still supported by their parents.

Does that explanation make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. So if she had been doing A-levels or some other non-university qualification, I might still be eligible, but because she's started university-level education, the benefit stops. Thank you for explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You've understood perfectly, Sarah. Exactly. If Emma were still in approved education, like A-Levels, you would likely remain eligible. But as she's started her Bachelor's degree, the rules state that Child Benefit is no longer payable.

You're very welcome. I'm glad I could clarify things for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit since my daughter is in "advanced education" (university degree), which matches the expected outcome in the scenario.
