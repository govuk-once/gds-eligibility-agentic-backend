[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Lisa, the mother of Mark who is currently in custody, to test the agent's knowledge about Child Benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Lisa and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Lisa, thanks for reaching out. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?





[evaluation_judge]: Hi, yes of course. My son Mark is 15 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lisa. And is Mark currently living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's not living with me right now. He's currently in a youth custody center.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Lisa. Is Mark in custody as part of a sentence from a court?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he was sentenced to 6 months in a youth custody center.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you, Lisa. And approximately how long has Mark been in custody now?

[evaluation_judge]: He's been there for 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Lisa. Generally, Child Benefit stops when a child is in custody for more than 8 weeks.

Since Mark is 15, in custody due to a sentence, and has been there for 10 weeks, it appears you are unfortunately no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or discuss any other potential benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: That's a bit disappointing to hear. Could you just confirm that my Child Benefit has definitely stopped now because he's been there more than 8 weeks? And will it automatically restart when he comes home?

[root_agent]: You're right to want to confirm, Lisa, and I understand your disappointment. Yes, that's correct – because Mark has been in custody for more than 8 weeks, your Child Benefit payments should have stopped.

Regarding restarting, no, it won’t automatically restart when he comes home. You will need to inform HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) that Mark is no longer in custody and then restart your claim. They will likely ask for confirmation of his release. 

Would you like me to provide information on how to contact HMRC to restart your claim when the time comes?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful. If you could let me know how to contact them when he comes home so I can restart the claim.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Lisa. You can contact HMRC to restart your Child Benefit claim once Mark is released through their website: [https://www.gov.uk/contact-child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/contact-child-benefit). You can also call them on 0300 200 3100.

It’s best to have Mark’s date of release ready when you contact them. They may also ask for other information, such as his National Insurance number.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for the information. That's all I needed to know for now about the Child Benefit situation.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit since my son has been in custody for more than 8 weeks (10 weeks), which exceeds the 8-week limit. They also correctly explained that I would need to contact HMRC to restart the claim when he's released.
