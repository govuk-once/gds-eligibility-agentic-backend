[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of a UK resident in this scenario.

Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Maria, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand what benefits you might be eligible for.

To start, could you tell me if you are the parent or legal guardian of a child?





[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I have a daughter who's 8 years old. She's been in the hospital for quite some time now, and it's been really difficult.

[root_agent]: I'm so sorry to hear that your daughter is in hospital, and that it's been a difficult time for you. 

To help me understand your situation better, has your daughter been in hospital for more than 12 weeks continuously?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she's been in the hospital for 14 weeks now. I visit her every day and spend hours with her. It's been a very challenging time for us both.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Maria. It sounds like you're being a very supportive mother during a tough time.

To assess your eligibility further, could you tell me if you regularly spend money on things for your daughter's upkeep, such as clothes, food, or treats, even while she is in hospital?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't actually need to spend money on those things. The hospital provides everything she needs like food and medical care. I just focus on being there with her every day for emotional support. I spend hours keeping her company, reading to her, and just being present, but I don't buy her things since the hospital has it all covered.

[root_agent]: Thank you for explaining that, Maria. I understand you're providing invaluable emotional support by spending so much time with your daughter.

Based on the information you've provided, it seems you may not be eligible for Child Benefit while your daughter is in hospital. This is because, while the hospital stay exceeds 12 weeks, eligibility also requires regularly spending money on the child’s upkeep, and it sounds like the hospital is currently covering those costs.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or would you like to explore other potential benefits that might be available to you?

[evaluation_judge]: Could you please explain a bit more about why I'm not eligible? I thought since I visit her every day and spend so much time with her that would count. It feels unfair that I would lose benefits just because the hospital is providing for her needs while she's there.

[root_agent]: You're absolutely right to question that, Maria, and it's understandable why you feel that way. It *is* tough when rules don’t quite align with the reality of a situation, and your dedication to visiting your daughter every day is wonderful.

The rules around Child Benefit and children in hospital are quite specific. While the length of the hospital stay is a factor – exceeding 12 weeks allows for continued benefit – the regulations also require that you continue to “regularly spend money” on your child’s upkeep. 

This means ongoing expenses like clothes, food, or treats. The exception is designed to cover situations where a child is temporarily staying elsewhere (like with family) and still requires financial support. In your case, the hospital is fully providing for your daughter’s needs, so the criteria of regularly spending money isn’t met, even with your frequent visits and emotional support. Unfortunately, simply being there with her, while incredibly valuable, doesn’t fulfill that specific financial requirement for continued Child Benefit.

I can certainly understand why that feels unfair, and I apologize that the rules are structured this way. Would you like me to double-check anything, or perhaps explore other types of support that might be available to families in your situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'd appreciate if you could tell me about any other support that might be available for families like mine. My daughter being in hospital for so long is already stressful enough without having to worry about losing benefits too.

[root_agent]: Absolutely, Maria. I understand this is a very stressful time, and I'm happy to explore other potential support options with you.

While I'm focused on Child Benefit eligibility based on the information provided, there are other avenues that might be helpful. However, to give you the most relevant information, could you tell me a little about your employment situation? Are you currently working, or are you currently not working?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm currently not working. I had to take time off from my part-time job to be with my daughter at the hospital every day. It's been impossible to work while spending so much time at her bedside.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Maria. It's completely understandable that you've had to prioritise your daughter and take time away from work.

Given that you are not currently working, you might want to explore whether you are eligible for Universal Credit. This benefit can provide financial support for living costs, and it takes into account your circumstances, including not being able to work due to caring responsibilities. 

Would you like me to ask you a few questions to get a better understanding of your financial situation – things like your savings and any other income you might have – to see if Universal Credit could be an option for you? Please be assured that any information you share will be kept confidential and is only to help me determine potential eligibility.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit. They accurately explained that while my daughter has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks, I don't meet the second requirement of "regularly spending money" on her upkeep, as the hospital provides everything.
