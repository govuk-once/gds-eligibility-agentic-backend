[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of a UK resident seeking benefits information. I'll engage with the agent under test until they provide an eligibility outcome, then evaluate if their determination matches the expected outcome in the scenario.

Hi, i'm Gary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Gary, it's good to speak with you. I can certainly help you with that.

To start, could you please tell me – do you have any children that you are responsible for?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have a son named Ben who lives with me. He's 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you Gary. And is Ben currently in approved education, or has he finished his education?

[evaluation_judge]: Ben left school in June. He's not in college or anything now, but he's registered with the local youth careers service and is actively looking for an apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Gary. 

Just to confirm, when did Ben leave school – was that within the last 20 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he left school in June and it's August now, so that's only about 2 months ago.

[root_agent]: Okay, that's helpful to know.

To assess your eligibility further, could you please confirm that you meet the UK residency rules?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm a UK resident. I've lived here all my life.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you.

Does Ben live with you full-time?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Ben lives with me full-time.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Is Ben currently in state-funded care, such as with a local authority?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's not in any kind of state-funded care. He just lives with me at home.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. Finally, would you say your income is over the threshold for receiving Child Benefit? (There is an income threshold, but I don't need the exact amount, just an indication).

[evaluation_judge]: No, my income is below the threshold.

[root_agent]: Thank you for answering all of my questions, Gary. 

Based on the information you’ve provided, you are likely eligible for Child Benefit for Ben, but this will be for a limited time. Because Ben is 17 and has recently left education, and is registered with a youth careers service looking for an apprenticeship, you can continue to claim Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when he left school.

Does this make sense?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense. So I can get Child Benefit for Ben for up to 20 weeks since he left school in June. That's good to know, thank you.

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Gary! I'm glad I could help clarify things for you. 

Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit for my son for the extension period of up to 20 weeks after leaving education, which matches the expected outcome from the scenario.
