[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Maria, it’s lovely to speak with you. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me how old you are?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 60 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. And could you tell me, do you currently have any children living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have my granddaughter Lucia living with me. She's 14 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. Could you please tell me, are you Lucia's parent?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm her grandmother. I've been looking after her because her parents are unable to care for her.

[root_agent]: Thank you for sharing that, Maria. Is there a formal arrangement in place for you to care for Lucia, such as a court order or fostering arrangement?

[evaluation_judge]: No, there's no formal arrangement. It's just an informal family arrangement we've made.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. Do the local council contribute towards Lucia's accommodation costs?

[evaluation_judge]: No, the council doesn't contribute anything. I pay for everything myself.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Maria. Just to confirm, are Lucia’s parents contributing financially to her care?

[evaluation_judge]: No, her parents don't contribute anything financially. I cover all her expenses myself.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. Based on the information you’ve provided, it sounds like you may be eligible for Child Benefit for Lucia. You are responsible for her care, you are not her parent, there is no formal arrangement like fostering, and the local council isn’t contributing financially. 

Would you like me to explain a little more about Child Benefit, or perhaps explore any other benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I would like to know more about Child Benefit please. How much would I be eligible for and how do I go about applying?

[root_agent]: Certainly, Maria. Child Benefit is currently £21.80 a week for your first child, and £13.70 a week for each additional child. As Lucia is your only grandchild in this situation, you would receive £21.80 per week.

To apply, you’ll need to fill out a form on the government website. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide a direct link, but if you search “apply for Child Benefit” on the gov.uk website, you should find it easily.

You'll need to provide information like your National Insurance number, Lucia’s date of birth and your bank details so they can pay the benefit directly into your account.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Child Benefit, or anything else at all?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for Child Benefit based on having an informal arrangement to care for my grandchild, with no council funding involved.
