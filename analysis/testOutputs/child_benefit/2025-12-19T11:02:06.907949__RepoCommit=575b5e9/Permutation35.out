[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Rashid and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Rashid, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation and whether you might be eligible, could you tell me your age please?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Are you currently in full-time education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm still in full-time education. I'm doing my A-Levels at the moment.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Are you married or in a civil partnership?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I recently got married to my girlfriend. She's 17 as well and has moved in with me at my parents' house.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Do you live with the person who is claiming for you, and do you depend on them financially?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I still live with my parents and depend on them financially. My dad wants to continue claiming for me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Just to clarify, is your spouse also in full-time education, or do they depend on someone else for financial support?

[evaluation_judge]: My wife is also in full-time education. She's doing her A-Levels too.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like your father may still be eligible to claim Child Benefit for you, even though you are married, because you are under 20, in full-time education, live with your parents, and your wife is also in full-time education. 

However, I'm an AI and cannot give definitive advice. It’s always best to double-check with the official government website or a benefits advisor to be certain. Would you like me to summarise the relevant points from the government website for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful if you could summarize the relevant information from the government website.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Here's a summary of why you might still be eligible for Child Benefit despite being married and under 20:

Generally, Child Benefit stops when a child gets married or enters a civil partnership. However, there’s an exception if the child is under 20, lives with the claimant (your parents in this case), and is continuing in full-time education. 

Also, it seems that because your wife is also in full-time education, this further supports your continued eligibility. The government doesn’t state that financial support *to* your wife is relevant, but that you are not financially supporting *your spouse*, and that condition doesn’t apply here.

You can find more details on the government website here: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility.



Again, I must stress that I am an AI and this is not financial advice, so it's a good idea to confirm this with official sources. Does that help?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined eligibility, noting that despite being married (which normally would disqualify), my situation meets the exception since I live with my parents, am still in full-time education, and my wife is also in education. This matches the expected outcome of "Eligible (via Exception)."
