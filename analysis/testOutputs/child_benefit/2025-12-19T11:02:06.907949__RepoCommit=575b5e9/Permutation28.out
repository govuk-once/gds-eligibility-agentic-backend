[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Maria, a US citizen visiting the UK on a tourist visa, to test the agent's ability to correctly determine benefit eligibility.

Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hi Maria, it's lovely to meet you. I'm happy to help you understand your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you please tell me how old you are?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 35 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. And how old is your son?

[evaluation_judge]: My son is 5 years old.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Are you currently employed, or do you have any income from work?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not working. I'm just visiting the UK at the moment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. And could you please clarify what type of visa you are currently using to be in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm here on a standard 6-month tourist visa from the US.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Maria. Just to confirm, is your son with you in the UK on the same visa, or a different one?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my son is with me in the UK on the same kind of visitor visa.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming.

Given that you are in the UK on a standard visitor visa, and not working, it's likely you may not be eligible for all benefits. To be certain, could you tell me which benefit you are hoping to claim? Knowing this will help me assess your eligibility accurately.

[evaluation_judge]: I was wondering if I could get any financial help while I'm here, maybe something like Universal Credit? My savings are running a bit lower than I expected during our visit.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Maria. Generally, people on a standard visitor visa, like yourself, are subject to immigration control, meaning they don’t have a right to reside in the UK for benefit purposes. This often means you wouldn’t be eligible for Universal Credit.

To be absolutely sure, could you confirm if you have any recourse to public funds? For example, are there any conditions attached to your visa that might allow access to benefits?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my visa just says "No recourse to public funds" on it. It's just a regular tourist visa that I applied for so my son and I could visit the UK for a few months.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Maria. 

Based on the information you've provided – that you are in the UK on a standard 6-month tourist visa with "no recourse to public funds" – you would unfortunately not be eligible for Universal Credit. This is because the rules state that people subject to immigration control, and without a right to reside, generally cannot claim the benefit.

I understand this might not be the news you were hoping for. Is there anything else I can help you with, or would you like me to explain this further?





[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for benefits. They accurately explained that as a visitor on a standard tourist visa with "no recourse to public funds," I lack the right to reside for benefit purposes, which matches the expected "Not Eligible" outcome in the scenario.
