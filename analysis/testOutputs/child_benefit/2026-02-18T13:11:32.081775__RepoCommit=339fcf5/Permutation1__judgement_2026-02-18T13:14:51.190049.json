All eligibility criteria from gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility were correctly applied. The agent also appropriately mentioned the High Income Child Benefit Charge for those earning over \u00a350,000, correctly noting it doesn't affect eligibility to claim. The eligibility_agent_payload correctly shows \"would_application_be_eligible\": true. No erroneous or misleading information was provided throughout the conversation."
