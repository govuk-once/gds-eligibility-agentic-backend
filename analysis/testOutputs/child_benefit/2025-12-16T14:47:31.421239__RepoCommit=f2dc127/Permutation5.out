[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Mark and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Mark. It’s good to speak with you. To help me determine if you’re eligible for Child Benefit, could you tell me, are you currently responsible for Lucas?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am. I'm divorced from Jenny, Lucas's mother. He lives with her, but I send £150 every month specifically for Lucas's food and clothes.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Mark. That’s helpful information. Given that you’re divorced and regularly contribute financially towards Lucas’s upkeep – specifically for food and clothes – exceeding the amount typically covered by Child Benefit, let’s move on to the next question. Is Lucas currently of school age?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Lucas is 10 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, great. And just to confirm, Lucas is 10 years old. Now, let's consider where Lucas lives. Does Lucas live with you currently?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Lucas lives with his mother Jenny, my ex-wife. But as I mentioned, I do contribute £150 per month toward his expenses.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that, Mark. It’s good to have that clarity. Considering Lucas lives with his mother and your ongoing financial support, let’s shift our focus slightly. Are there any other adults currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucas?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Jenny isn't claiming Child Benefit for Lucas at all.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for letting me know. That’s very helpful. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re responsible for Lucas, he’s of school age, he doesn’t live with you but you provide significant financial support, and no other adults are claiming Child Benefit for him – it appears you might be eligible. 

To be absolutely certain, could you tell me, are you a liable person? (A liable person is someone who can claim Child Benefit.)

[evaluation_judge]: I believe so. I'm Lucas's father and I'm providing regular financial support for him. Does that qualify me as a liable person?

[root_agent]: That’s a very good question, Mark, and it’s important we get this right. Let’s confirm. Are you currently employed, or receiving any regular income – such as a pension or benefits – that would make you a ‘liable person’ for claiming Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm employed full-time. I'm 40 years old and have a regular income from my job.

[root_agent]: Okay, Mark. That’s excellent information. With you being employed full-time and receiving a regular income, and considering your ongoing financial contribution towards Lucas’s upkeep, it’s highly likely you’ll be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Just to be completely thorough, and as per the guidelines, would you say that you and Lucas have a close and significant relationship?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, we definitely do. Despite not living together, I make sure to see Lucas regularly and stay involved in his life. I take him on weekends sometimes and make sure he has what he needs by sending that money each month.

[root_agent]: That’s wonderful to hear, Mark. It sounds like you have a very positive and involved relationship with Lucas. Thank you for sharing that. Based on all the information you’ve provided – your employment, your financial contribution, and your close relationship with Lucas – I can confidently conclude that you are likely eligible for Child Benefit.

Would you like me to outline the next steps for applying, or would you simply like to confirm that you’re satisfied with this assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like to confirm that I'm eligible before I start the application process. So just to be clear - even though Lucas lives with his mother, I can claim Child Benefit because I contribute financially to his upkeep and Jenny isn't claiming it herself?

[root_agent]: You’ve hit the nail on the head, Mark. Absolutely clear. Yes, even though Lucas lives with his mother, you *can* claim Child Benefit because you regularly contribute financially to his upkeep, and Jenny isn’t claiming it herself. That’s the key factor in this situation. 

I’m glad we’ve clarified that for you. Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding your potential application, or would you like me to simply conclude our conversation?

[evaluation_judge]: That's great news, thank you for clarifying. I think I'll go ahead with the application then. I appreciate your help today.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was eligible for Child Benefit since I contribute financially to my child's upkeep (more than the Child Benefit amount) and the child's mother is not claiming the benefit.
