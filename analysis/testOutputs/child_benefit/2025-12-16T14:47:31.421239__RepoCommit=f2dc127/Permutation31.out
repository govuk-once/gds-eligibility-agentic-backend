[evaluation_judge]: Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Sarah. I understand you're looking into Child Benefit for your daughter, Emma. To start, and as per the guidelines, could you tell me how old Emma is?

[evaluation_judge]: Emma is 18 years old. She's just started university this year.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And just to clarify, Emma is 18 years old. Now, regarding your question about her education, could you tell me whether Emma is currently receiving “Approved Education” or “Advanced Education”?

[evaluation_judge]: She's attending university for a 3-year Bachelor's degree, so that would be Advanced Education. She still lives at home with me and commutes to the university each day.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that Emma is undertaking “Advanced Education” – a university degree. Based on the current rules, Child Benefit typically ceases when a child starts advanced education. Therefore, I must advise that, unfortunately, you are unlikely to be eligible for Child Benefit in this situation. Do you have any questions about this outcome?

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So I'm not eligible for Child Benefit because Emma is doing a university degree? I thought I might still get it since she's under 20 and still lives at home with me.

[root_agent]: You’re quite right to think that, and it’s understandable to have that assumption. The guidelines do state that Child Benefit stops when a child starts advanced education, regardless of their age. It’s a specific rule designed to support families through these transitions. I’m glad we clarified this for you. Is there anything else I can help you with today, perhaps regarding alternative support options?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for explaining that to me.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my daughter is in advanced education (university degree), despite being under 20 and living at home.
