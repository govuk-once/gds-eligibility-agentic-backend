[evaluation_judge]: I'll now play the role of a UK resident seeking benefits information.

Hi, i'm Jenny and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Jenny, it's lovely to speak with you. I'm happy to help you understand which benefits you might be eligible for. 

To start, could you tell me how old your child is?





[evaluation_judge]: My son Arthur is 7 years old. He's actually been in the hospital quite a lot recently, which is why I'm asking about benefits.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Jenny. I'm sorry to hear Arthur has been unwell and spending time in hospital. 

To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me how long Arthur has been in hospital *in total* recently? It's okay to give me an estimate if you're not sure of the exact dates.





[evaluation_judge]: Well, Arthur was in the hospital for about 10 weeks initially. Then he came home for about 2 weeks, but unfortunately he got sick again and had to go back to the hospital after 15 days at home. He's been back in the hospital for 3 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Jenny. That helps me to understand the situation. 

Just to clarify, are you currently providing financial support for Arthur's day-to-day living costs while he is in hospital – things like food, clothing, or toiletries?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I'm not really providing much financial support for his day-to-day needs while he's in the hospital. The hospital is providing his meals and most of what he needs. I sometimes bring him a few small things but nothing significant in terms of cost.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying, Jenny. 

Given that Arthur has been in and out of hospital as you've described, and you aren’t covering his day-to-day living costs while he's there, do you know if you've been receiving Child Benefit continuously up to this point?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I've been receiving Child Benefit all this time. No one told me I shouldn't be getting it even when he's in hospital, so it's been coming in regularly.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Jenny. I appreciate you letting me know that you've been receiving Child Benefit continuously.

Just to be absolutely certain, could you confirm the date Arthur was *first* admitted to hospital in this recent period of illness? (Even a rough estimate of the month and year would be helpful).

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have the exact date, but it was about 15 weeks ago that he first went into the hospital for that 10-week stay.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Jenny. That's very helpful.

Based on the information you’ve provided, it seems Arthur has now been in hospital for a total of 13 weeks (10 weeks + 3 weeks), considering the time he was discharged and then readmitted within 28 days. 

Unfortunately, as you aren’t covering his living costs while he’s in hospital, Child Benefit usually stops after a child has been in hospital for 12 weeks. It appears you may no longer be eligible to continue receiving it. Would you like me to explain this in a little more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain more about why it would stop. I didn't know there was a 12-week limit.

[root_agent]: Certainly, Jenny. I'm happy to explain.

Child Benefit is usually payable for children up to the age of 20, as long as they're in approved education or training. However, there are different rules when a child is in hospital.

Generally, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for a child in hospital for up to 12 weeks. However, this 12-week period is cumulative. This means that if a child is discharged from hospital and then readmitted within 28 days, the time spent in hospital is added together. This is what's happened with Arthur – his initial 10-week stay, combined with the 3 weeks since his readmission, totals 13 weeks.

Also, crucially, if you're not meeting the usual costs of looking after your child while they are in hospital (like food, clothing, etc., which the hospital is covering), Child Benefit usually stops after the 12-week period.

I understand this can be frustrating, especially when a child is unwell. Does this explanation make sense? Would you like me to point you toward the official government guidance on this if you'd like to read it yourself?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes sense now. So since he was only home for 15 days between hospital stays, they count together and I'm over the 12 weeks. I should have been told about this. Is this automatic or do I need to tell someone he's been in hospital?

[root_agent]: You’ve understood perfectly, Jenny. The short time Arthur was home *does* mean the stays are counted together for the 12-week limit. And you're right, it's understandable you would have appreciated being informed about this sooner.

Regarding whether you need to tell someone – yes, you should. HMRC (Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the people who pay Child Benefit) usually stop payments automatically once they are aware a child has been in hospital for over 12 weeks. However, they may not be aware of the readmission. 

To ensure everything is processed correctly, and to understand any potential overpayments you may need to address, it’s best to report the change in Arthur’s circumstances to HMRC directly. You can do this through your online Child Benefit account if you have one, or by contacting them by phone. Would you like me to provide the details for contacting HMRC?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes please, that would be helpful. I'd better call them and let them know about the situation. If there's been an overpayment, I want to sort it out sooner rather than later.

[root_agent]: Absolutely, that's a very sensible approach, Jenny.

Here are the contact details for HMRC regarding Child Benefit:

**Phone:** 0300 200 3100 (Monday to Friday, 8am to 6pm)

**Website:** [https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit) - This page has information about reporting changes and managing your Child Benefit claim online.

It’s often helpful to have Arthur’s date of birth and your National Insurance number to hand when you call.

Is there anything else I can help you with today, Jenny? Perhaps information about other benefits you might be eligible for, now that your circumstances have changed?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit because Arthur has been in hospital for a cumulative total of 13 weeks (exceeding the 12-week limit), with a gap of only 15 days between hospital stays (less than the 28-day linking rule), and I am not providing significant financial support for his day-to-day needs in hospital.
