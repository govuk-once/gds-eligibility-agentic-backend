[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Leo and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Leo, I'm happy to help! To start, could you please tell me how old you are?


[evaluation_judge]: I'm actually not Leo. Leo is my son. He's 12 years old. I'm his mother.

[root_agent]: Apologies for the confusion! It's good to speak with you.

To understand your situation better, and whether you might be eligible for any benefits, could you tell me if Leo currently lives with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Leo doesn't live with me full time. He's in local authority care. He comes home to visit me every Saturday at 10:00 AM and then returns to his care home on Sunday at 11:00 AM.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. That's helpful to know. 

Considering Leo is in local authority care, how long has he been in care for – has it been longer than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, it's been quite a while now. He's been in care for more than 8 weeks.

[root_agent]: Thank you. And during those visits, from Saturday 10:00 AM to Sunday 11:00 AM, would you say Leo spends at least 24 hours with you each week?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. He's with me from Saturday 10:00 AM until Sunday 11:00 AM, which is 25 hours in total each week.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you've provided, it seems you may be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Just to be clear, are you Leo’s only parent, or do you share parental responsibility with someone else?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm Leo's mother and I'm raising him on my own. I don't share parental responsibility with anyone else.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Based on everything you've told me – Leo is 12, he's in local authority care for more than 8 weeks, he spends over 24 hours with you each week, and you are his sole parent – it appears you *are* eligible for Child Benefit. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today, or would you like me to explain the next steps for claiming?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm eligible for Child Benefit since Leo spends more than 24 hours with me each week (25 hours from Saturday 10AM to Sunday 11AM), despite being in local authority care for more than 8 weeks.
