[evaluation_judge]: I'll help test the agent by roleplaying as Gary seeking information about benefit eligibility for his son who recently left school.

Hi, i'm Gary and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Gary, it's lovely to speak with you. I can certainly help you with understanding your eligibility for benefits. 

To start, could you tell me how old your son is?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm 50 and my son Ben is 17. He's living with me at the moment.

[root_agent]: Thanks Gary. And has Ben recently finished his education – for example, has he recently left school or college?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Ben left school in June. He's not going to college, but he's registered with the youth careers service and is looking for an apprenticeship right now.

[root_agent]: Thank you, that’s helpful to know. Is Ben currently receiving any state-funded care or support?

[evaluation_judge]: No, he's not receiving any state-funded care or support. He's just living with me at home.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And to confirm, are you responsible for Ben financially?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm completely responsible for Ben financially. He lives with me and I take care of all his needs.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Gary. Finally, just to check, is your annual income over £50,000? This is because Child Benefit is gradually reduced if either parent earns over this amount.

[evaluation_judge]: No, my income is under £50,000 per year.

[root_agent]: Great, thank you for providing all of that information, Gary. 

Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you *are* eligible for Child Benefit for Ben. However, because Ben left school in June and is now 17, this eligibility is initially for a period of up to 20 weeks, as he is actively seeking an apprenticeship with the support of the youth careers service. 

Does that make sense? Would you like me to explain anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: That does make sense, thank you. So just to be clear, I'll get Child Benefit but only for up to 20 weeks from when he left school in June, since he's registered with the careers service and looking for an apprenticeship? What happens after the 20 weeks if he hasn't found an apprenticeship by then?

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Gary! You’ve understood correctly – you’ll receive Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks from when he left school in June, because he’s registered with the careers service and actively looking for an apprenticeship.

If Ben hasn’t found an apprenticeship after those 20 weeks, your Child Benefit will unfortunately stop. However, if he goes back into approved education – for example, starting a college course – or finds employment, his eligibility for Child Benefit may be reinstated.

Would you like me to provide more information about what constitutes “approved education” or the rules around employment and Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that's clear now. If he doesn't find an apprenticeship within the 20 weeks, the benefit will stop unless he starts a qualifying education course. Thanks for explaining that to me.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I'm eligible for Child Benefit for up to 20 weeks while my son is registered with the youth careers service and seeking an apprenticeship after leaving school, which matches the expected outcome.
