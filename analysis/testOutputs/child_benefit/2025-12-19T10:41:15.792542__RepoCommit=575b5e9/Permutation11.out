[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Karen and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Karen, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible for a benefit, could you please tell me the age of the child you are considering claiming for?


[evaluation_judge]: My son Ryan is 17. He's recently left school and started an apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Thanks, that’s helpful to know. Is Ryan’s apprenticeship a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. He's just started a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship here in England. He still lives at home with me.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. And to be clear, you are Ryan’s mother and are responsible for him?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm Ryan's mother and I'm responsible for him. He's living with me at home while doing his apprenticeship.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me, as Ryan is 17 and has started a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship in England, you are unfortunately not eligible to continue claiming Child Benefit for him. 

Starting an apprenticeship is a disqualifying event, even though he is still living at home. Would you like me to explain this in more detail, or perhaps discuss other potential benefits you might be eligible for?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit confused. Why would an apprenticeship disqualify me? I thought I could still get Child Benefit while he's training. Could you explain a bit more about why this is the case?

[root_agent]: You’re right to ask for clarification, it can be a bit confusing! Child Benefit *can* continue while a young person is in approved education, such as A-Levels or university. However, starting a government-funded apprenticeship in England is specifically considered a change in circumstances that stops Child Benefit entitlement, even though it *is* a form of training. 

The rules state that once a child starts an apprenticeship, they are no longer considered to be in “approved education” for Child Benefit purposes. It's different from staying in full-time education like school or college.

You can find more information about this on the government website here: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility.

Does that explanation help clarify things a little?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that does clarify things. I wasn't aware that apprenticeships would make me ineligible for Child Benefit. So I need to stop my claim now that Ryan has started his apprenticeship, correct?

[root_agent]: You are correct. As Ryan has started his apprenticeship, you will need to inform HMRC and stop your Child Benefit claim. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today, or any further clarification you’d like regarding ending your claim?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I understand now. I'll contact HMRC to end my claim. Thank you for explaining it to me.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my son started a government-funded apprenticeship in England, which is a disqualifying event for Child Benefit eligibility.
