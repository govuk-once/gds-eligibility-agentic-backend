[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a user in this scenario to test the agent's knowledge about Child Benefit eligibility in cases of shared custody.

Hi, i'm Pete and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Pete, it’s good to speak with you. To start, could you tell me how old your daughter, Holly, is?

[evaluation_judge]: She's 9 years old.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And just to clarify, are two people responsible for Holly?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both me and my ex-partner Sue are responsible for Holly. We're separated but we both look after her.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. Could you tell me how Holly spends her time between you and your ex-partner, Sue? For example, how many days does she usually stay with each of you?

[evaluation_judge]: I have Holly for 3 days a week, and Sue has her for 4 days a week. We both buy her clothes and food when she's with us.

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. Just to be clear, does Holly live with either you or Sue more often than the other?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Holly stays with Sue for 4 days a week and with me for 3 days a week, so she's with Sue slightly more.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. To help me determine your eligibility, could you tell me if you are currently employed?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm currently employed. I work full-time.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And just to confirm, are you responsible for paying for Holly’s clothes and food when she’s with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I buy all her clothes and food when she's with me for those 3 days. Sue does the same when Holly is with her.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing all of that information. Based on what you’ve told me – that you and Sue share responsibility for Holly, she spends slightly more time with Sue, and you both contribute to her care – I’m afraid I must advise that you are unlikely to be eligible for Child Benefit at this time. Do you understand?

[evaluation_judge]: Why am I not eligible? I thought both parents could claim Child Benefit.

[root_agent]: I understand your confusion, and you’re right to think both parents *could* claim. However, the rules state that only one person can receive Child Benefit for the same child. Because you and Sue are both responsible for Holly, HMRC would typically award it to the person she lives with the most – which is Sue in this case. Would you like me to explain the specific criteria for more detail about that rule?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain. I'd like to know more about how HMRC decides in these cases.

[root_agent]: Certainly. The criteria for Child Benefit, as outlined by HMRC, states that if two people are responsible for the same child, then the benefit is usually awarded to the person the child lives with most often. This is known as the ‘priority rule’.

In your situation, Holly spends four days a week with Sue and three days a week with you. As she lives with Sue for more days, HMRC would generally award Child Benefit to Sue. 

Do you have any questions about this process or would you like me to clarify anything further?

[evaluation_judge]: Has Sue already claimed Child Benefit for Holly? What if we both submit a claim?

[root_agent]: That’s a very important question. HMRC will likely investigate if both of you have submitted a claim simultaneously. If both of you submit claims, HMRC will carefully review the situation, considering the evidence you provide regarding Holly’s time spent with each of you. They will apply the ‘priority rule’ – awarding it to the person she lives with most often – and may request additional information. 

Essentially, submitting both claims at the same time could complicate the process and potentially lead to a delay in a decision.

Do you want me to explain more about how HMRC handles multiple claims in a shared custody situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, what happens if we both submit claims? We can't agree on who should claim it.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s a difficult situation. If you and Sue both submit claims simultaneously and cannot agree on who should receive Child Benefit, HMRC will investigate and make a decision.

They will consider all the information you both provide, including details about Holly’s living arrangements – which you’ve already explained as spending more time with Sue. They'll apply the ‘priority rule’, awarding it to the parent she lives with most frequently.

It’s possible that HMRC might contact both of you for further information or clarification. They may also require evidence, such as a written agreement about who is responsible for what aspects of Holly's care.

Essentially, when there’s disagreement, HMRC takes a formal approach to determine who is most appropriately entitled to the benefit. Would you like me to outline the steps HMRC typically takes in a situation like this?

[evaluation_judge]: So if we can't decide between us, and both submit claims, you're saying HMRC will likely award it to Sue since Holly stays with her 4 days versus my 3 days?

[root_agent]: That’s absolutely correct. Yes, if you and Sue both submit claims and you can’t agree, HMRC would likely award Child Benefit to Sue, given that Holly spends more time with her – four days a week compared to your three.

Is there anything else I can clarify about this situation, or would you like me to recap the key points?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think I understand now. Thanks for explaining how it works in our situation.

✓ The agent correctly determined that Sue would be eligible for Child Benefit rather than Pete since Holly lives with her more days per week (4 vs 3). This matches the expected outcome that Sue is eligible while Pete is not.
