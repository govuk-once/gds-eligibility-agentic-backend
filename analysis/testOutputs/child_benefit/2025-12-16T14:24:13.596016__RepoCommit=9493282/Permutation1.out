[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Sarah and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Sarah, it’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me, is the person you are claiming benefits for responsible for the child?

[evaluation_judge]: Hi there. Yes, I'm responsible for my son Leo. He lives with me and my husband Tom in our home in Manchester.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Now, could you tell me, is Leo under the age of 16, or under 20 and in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Leo is 8 years old. He's currently in primary school.

[root_agent]: Great. And to ensure we have a complete picture, does the applicant – which in this case would be you and your husband – meet the UK residency and immigration rules?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, both my husband Tom and I are UK nationals. We've always lived in the UK and are currently living in Manchester.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Just one more question regarding the living arrangements – does Leo live with you and your husband, or do you contribute sufficiently to his upkeep?

[evaluation_judge]: Leo lives with us full-time in our home. We provide for all his needs.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know. Lastly, is Leo currently in hospital or care for a disqualifying period?

[evaluation_judge]: No, Leo is not in hospital or care. He's living at home with us and attending school normally.

[root_agent]: Excellent. And just to clarify, is either you or your husband’s individual adjusted net income over £60,000?

[evaluation_judge]: No, neither of us earns that much. Tom works as a teacher and earns about £35,000 a year, and I work part-time earning around £15,000.

[root_agent]: Thank you, Sarah. Based on your answers, it looks like you meet the criteria for Child Benefit. Would you like me to summarise the key points for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please summarize the key points for me. That would be helpful.

[root_agent]: Certainly. You and your husband are responsible for Leo, he is under 16 and in approved education, you meet the UK residency requirements, he lives with you, and neither of your incomes exceeds £60,000. Therefore, you appear to be eligible for Child Benefit.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding this benefit, or any other benefits you’d like to explore?

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for confirming that. It's good to know we're eligible for Child Benefit. I don't have any other questions right now about benefits, but I appreciate the information.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am eligible for Child Benefit based on all the criteria being met (responsibility for the child, child's age, UK residency, living arrangements, child not in care, and income below the threshold).
