[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a concerned parent seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility for a child in custody.

Hi, I'm Lisa and I'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Hello Lisa, it’s good to talk to you. To start, could you tell me, is the child living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: No, my son Mark isn't living with me at the moment. He's been sentenced to a youth custody center.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know. Just to clarify, is Mark currently in custody or prison?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's currently in a youth custody center. He's 15 years old and was sentenced to 6 months there. He's been in custody for about 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. And to be certain, has Mark been in custody for more than 8 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he's been in custody for 10 weeks now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Based on the information you’ve provided – that Mark is in custody for more than 8 weeks – I’m afraid he will no longer be eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So I'm no longer eligible for Child Benefit because he's been in custody for more than 8 weeks? Is that right?

[root_agent]: That’s correct, Lisa. Due to Mark being in custody for over 8 weeks, you will no longer receive Child Benefit for him.

[evaluation_judge]: When would the payments stop exactly? Is it after the 8th week, or would I need to notify someone about this change?

[root_agent]: The payments would stop as of the date he’s been in custody for over 8 weeks. You don't necessarily need to notify anyone, the system will automatically adjust.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for that information. Is there anything I need to know about what happens when Mark is released after his 6-month sentence? Would I need to reapply for Child Benefit then?

[root_agent]: That’s a really important question. Once Mark is released from custody, you would need to reapply for Child Benefit. The eligibility criteria would be assessed again at that time.

[evaluation_judge]: Alright, thank you for explaining that. I appreciate your help with understanding the situation regarding Mark's Child Benefit.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit because my son has been in custody for more than 8 weeks (10 weeks), which aligns with the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
