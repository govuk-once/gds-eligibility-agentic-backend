[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Jessica and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, Jessica, I understand. To help me determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you tell me, are you responsible for any children?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm responsible for my son Liam who is 18 years old. He lives with me while he's studying for his A-levels.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Jessica. Just to confirm, Liam is 18 years old and lives with you while he’s studying for his A-levels?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. He's 18 and still lives with me at home while he's completing his A-level studies.

[root_agent]: Okay. And does Liam currently receive any benefits in his own right, such as Universal Credit?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Liam does receive Universal Credit. He claimed it to help with his personal living costs since he's estranged from his father and doesn't have any income of his own.

[root_agent]: Thank you for letting me know, Jessica. Based on that information, it appears you might not be eligible for Child Benefit. The rules state that you stop getting Child Benefit if the child starts receiving Universal Credit in their own right. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Liam does receive Universal Credit in his own right to help with his expenses since he's estranged from his father and has no income.

[root_agent]: Okay, Jessica. Thank you for confirming that. Based on your answers, it seems you are not eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So even though Liam is still in approved education with his A-levels, because he receives Universal Credit in his own right, I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore?

[root_agent]: That’s right, Jessica. The criteria state that receiving Universal Credit in a child’s own right will prevent you from receiving Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined I'm not eligible for Child Benefit since my son receives Universal Credit in his own right, which aligns with the expected outcome in the scenario.
