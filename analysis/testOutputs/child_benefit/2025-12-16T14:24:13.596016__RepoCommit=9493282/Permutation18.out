[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Raj and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. To help me determine your eligibility for Child Benefit, could you please confirm if your son, Dev, is currently enrolled in approved education?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Dev is currently in full-time education. He's studying for his A-levels at the local college.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Now, I need to ask – is Dev under the age of 20?

[evaluation_judge]: Well, actually that's why I'm calling. Dev just turned 20 last week. He's in the middle of his A-level studies, but he just had his 20th birthday.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying that. Given that Dev is now 20, he is no longer eligible for Child Benefit. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: So you're saying I'm not eligible for Child Benefit anymore since Dev turned 20? Even though he's still studying and hasn't completed his A-levels yet?

[root_agent]: You are correct. My apologies for not being clearer. The rules state that Child Benefit ceases to be paid once a child reaches the age of 20, regardless of whether they are still in education or have not completed their studies. I appreciate you pointing out my oversight.

[evaluation_judge]: I understand. It's disappointing but I guess those are the rules. When exactly does the benefit stop? Is it immediately on his birthday or at the end of the month?

[root_agent]: That’s a good question. According to the guidelines, Child Benefit payments typically stop at the end of the month in which the individual turns 20. Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official government page explaining this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that would be helpful. I'd like to read more about it. Thank you for explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! Here’s a link to the relevant information on the government website: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for providing that link. I'll take a look at it to understand the rules better. Is there anything else I should know about this situation?

[root_agent]: No, I believe you’ve covered all the key aspects of your situation regarding Child Benefit for Dev. The rules are quite specific about the age limit. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, perhaps regarding other benefits or information?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know about for now. Thank you for your help in explaining the situation about the Child Benefit ending when Dev turned 20.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome! I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. If you have any further questions in the future, please don’t hesitate to ask. Have a good day!

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you, you too!

✓ The agent correctly informed me that Child Benefit ceases when a child turns 20, regardless of whether they're still in approved education, which matches the expected outcome of "Not Eligible."
