[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Ali and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Ali, it’s good to speak with you. To help me determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you tell me, are you responsible for Maya?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Maya lives with us. She's 4 years old and was recently placed with my wife Zara and me by the adoption agency. We're approved adopters, but we're still waiting for the final adoption order from the court.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that, Ali. Just to be clear, you are both responsible for Maya, and you’ve recently had her placed with you by the adoption agency, while you’re still awaiting the final adoption order? Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Maya is living with us now as part of the adoption process. We're taking care of her full-time while we wait for the final adoption order to be granted by the court.

[root_agent]: Okay, Ali. And to confirm, you’re both taking care of Maya full-time while you’re still waiting for the final adoption order, is that right?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's exactly right. Maya is living with us full-time in our home. We're responsible for her care while the adoption process completes. The agency placed her with us, but we're still waiting for the legal paperwork to be finalized by the court.

[root_agent]: Alright, Ali. Thank you for confirming all of that. Just to be absolutely sure, do you understand that you can claim Child Benefit as soon as Maya comes to live with you, even before the final adoption order is granted?

[evaluation_judge]: I wasn't actually sure about that. So we can claim Child Benefit now, even though the adoption hasn't been legally finalized yet? That would be really helpful to know.

[root_agent]: That’s correct. You can claim Child Benefit as soon as Maya lives with you, and you don’t have to wait for the final adoption order. It’s great that you wanted to confirm that! Based on the information you’ve provided, it seems you are eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: That's really good news! So we can apply for Child Benefit straight away then? I'm glad we don't have to wait for all the legal proceedings to finish. Thank you for clearing that up for us.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Ali! I’m pleased we could clarify that for you. If you’d like to start the application process, you can find the details on the government website: https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit. Would you like me to help you find any specific information on that page?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly identified that I am eligible for Child Benefit since Maya is living with us, even though the final adoption order hasn't been granted yet. This matches the expected outcome of "Eligible" from the scenario.
