[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a UK visitor seeking benefits information.

Hi, i'm Maria and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Maria, it’s nice to meet you. I’m here to help you with that.

To start, could you tell me, are you physically in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am physically in the UK at the moment. I'm here with my 5-year-old son on a tourist visa from the US.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. Just to clarify, you mentioned you’re here with your son on a tourist visa from the US. Do you have a “Right to Reside” in the UK for benefit purposes?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure what "Right to Reside" means exactly. I have a standard 6-month tourist visa for myself and my son. We're from the US and I'm not working while I'm here. Does a tourist visa count as having a "Right to Reside"?

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying. A standard visitor visa generally subjects the holder to “Immigration Control” and doesn’t qualify for benefits. 

Could you tell me, do you have any settled status in the UK, such as Indefinite Leave to Remain, or any other qualifying right to reside, like being an EEA national with worker status?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have settled status or Indefinite Leave to Remain. I'm just here as a US citizen on a standard 6-month tourist visa. I'm not an EEA national either, and I'm not working while I'm here. It's just a temporary visit with my son.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that. Based on what you’ve told me – that you’re a US citizen on a standard 6-month tourist visa, not working, and without any settled status or qualifying right to reside – you are not eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: I see. So because I'm here as a tourist on a visitor visa, I'm not eligible for benefits. Thank you for explaining that to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Maria. I’m glad I could help clarify your eligibility. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I think that answers my question. I was just curious about what we might be eligible for while we're visiting. Thanks for explaining everything so clearly.

✓ The agent correctly determined I was not eligible for Child Benefit due to my immigration status (tourist visa with no right to reside for benefit purposes).
