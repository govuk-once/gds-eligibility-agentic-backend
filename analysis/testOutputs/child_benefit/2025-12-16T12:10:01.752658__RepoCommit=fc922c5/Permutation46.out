[evaluation_judge]: I'll play the role of Hans, a 30-year-old with Pre-Settled Status who has been unemployed and claiming Child Benefit as a "Jobseeker" for 95 days.

Hi, i'm Hans and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hello Hans, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you tell me, are you currently looking for work?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am currently looking for work. I've been searching for a job for about three months now, but haven't had much luck yet.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Just to clarify, you’re looking for work currently.

Could you tell me, do you have any children?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I have two children. That's why I've been receiving Child Benefit for the past few months while I've been looking for work.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming. I understand you have two children and are receiving Child Benefit.

I want to double-check something regarding your claim. Since you’ve been claiming as a jobseeker for 95 days, and you’re currently looking for work, are you aware that the jobseeker’s allowance has a limit of 91 days?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I wasn't aware there was a 91-day limit. I've been claiming for 95 days now as a jobseeker. Does this mean there's a problem with my benefit? I'm still actively looking for work, but I don't have any job offers at the moment.

[root_agent]: You’re right to be concerned. Because you’ve been claiming as a jobseeker for 95 days, and you don’t have a job offer or other resources, your right to reside for benefit purposes may be expiring. 

To be completely sure, could you tell me, do you have any other sources of income or support, such as savings or family help?

[evaluation_judge]: I don't have any significant savings. I've been relying mainly on the benefits since I lost my job. My family helps a bit with occasional groceries, but nothing substantial or regular that I could count as proper income or support. I'm really trying to find a job, but it's been difficult in my field.

[root_agent]: Thank you for providing that information, Hans. It sounds like you’re in a challenging situation.

Given that you’ve been claiming as a jobseeker for 95 days without a job offer and have no other significant income or support, it appears your eligibility for claiming as a jobseeker is likely expiring.

Based on the information you've given me, and the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit, are your children living with you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, my children are living with me full-time. I'm their primary caregiver. That's why the Child Benefit has been so important for us while I've been looking for work.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming that your children are living with you full-time.

Let me confirm – you’re currently claiming Child Benefit because your children live with you, and you’ve been claiming as a jobseeker for 95 days without a job offer. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I've been claiming Child Benefit for my two children who live with me full-time, and I've been claiming as a jobseeker for 95 days. Unfortunately, I don't have a job offer yet despite actively looking.

[root_agent]: I understand. Thank you for clarifying.

Given that you’ve exceeded the 91-day limit for claiming as a jobseeker and don’t currently have a job offer, it appears your eligibility for claiming as a jobseeker has likely expired.

However, you maintain eligibility for Child Benefit because your children live with you, as outlined in the guidelines. 

Is there anything else about your situation that you'd like to discuss regarding your Child Benefit claim?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm a bit confused. Are you saying I can still receive Child Benefit even though my jobseeker status has expired? Or am I no longer eligible for Child Benefit because of this expiration? I'm really concerned about supporting my children if I lose this benefit.

[root_agent]: That's a very valid concern, Hans. Let me clarify. Because your children live with you, you *are* still eligible to receive Child Benefit. The expiration of your jobseeker status doesn’t affect your eligibility for Child Benefit itself. 

It’s just that you can no longer claim as a jobseeker.

Would you like me to explain how you can continue to receive Child Benefit in this situation?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain how I can continue to receive Child Benefit. If I can't claim as a jobseeker anymore, what does that mean for my benefits? I'm worried about my finances and supporting my children.

[root_agent]: Okay, let’s talk about how you can continue receiving Child Benefit. Since you’re no longer eligible to claim as a jobseeker, you’ll need to continue your job search and meet the other eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.

Essentially, you’ll need to demonstrate that you meet the standard eligibility conditions for Child Benefit – primarily that you are a UK resident and your children are living with you. As long as you continue to meet those criteria, you should be able to continue receiving Child Benefit.

Are you familiar with the other criteria for Child Benefit, such as residency requirements and the age of your children?

[evaluation_judge]: I know my children need to be under 16 (or under 20 if they're in approved education), and they are. Regarding residency, I have Pre-Settled Status in the UK. Would that be enough for me to continue receiving Child Benefit even though my jobseeker status has expired? I'm not fully clear on how my Pre-Settled Status affects this situation now.

[root_agent]: That’s excellent that you’re familiar with the age requirements. And yes, having Pre-Settled Status in the UK *would* be sufficient to meet the residency requirement for Child Benefit. 

Pre-Settled Status is recognised as a valid form of residency for benefit purposes. It shows you have a right to live in the UK.

So, to summarise, as long as your children meet the age criteria (under 16 or under 20 in approved education), and you maintain your Pre-Settled Status as a UK resident, you should continue to be eligible for Child Benefit.

Do you have any further questions about how this might work, or would you like me to explain anything in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: I think I understand better now. But let me just confirm - since my jobseeker status has expired after 95 days (over the 91-day limit), am I now considered not eligible for benefits that require a right to reside as a jobseeker? I'm trying to understand exactly which benefits I'm still eligible for and which ones I might lose.

[root_agent]: You’ve hit on a crucial point, Hans. Yes, because your jobseeker status has expired, you are no longer considered eligible for benefits that specifically require a right to reside *as a jobseeker*. 

However, as we’ve discussed, your Pre-Settled Status still provides you with the necessary right to reside for Child Benefit. 

To clarify, you’ll continue to receive Child Benefit, but you will no longer be able to claim benefits that require you to be claiming as a jobseeker – benefits that tied your right to reside to that status.

Does that make things clearer?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's much clearer now. So I'll continue receiving Child Benefit because of my Pre-Settled Status and because my children live with me, but I'm no longer eligible for jobseeker-specific benefits since I've exceeded the 91-day limit. Thank you for explaining this to me.

[root_agent]: You’re very welcome, Hans! I’m glad I could clarify things for you. It’s important to understand your benefits situation clearly. 

Is there anything else I can help you with today, or would you like me to summarise what we’ve discussed just to ensure we’re both on the same page?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent provided incorrect information. While correctly identifying that the jobseeker status has expired after 95 days (exceeding the 91-day limit), the agent wrongly stated that I would still be eligible for Child Benefit due to Pre-Settled Status alone. According to the scenario criteria, once the jobseeker status expires without a genuine prospect of work, the right to reside for benefit purposes also expires, making me ineligible for Child Benefit despite having Pre-Settled Status.
