They have an agreement that Tom will join them after he finishes the course.\" This describes exactly the excluded scenario.\n\nThe agent incorrectly concluded: \"The fact that Tom's future employer pays for the course fees doesn't disqualify him, since he's not receiving a wage during the training period...\" This reasoning is flawed because the exclusion applies regardless of whether wages are paid - the disqualifying factor is the employer agreement itself.\n\nThe agent gave erroneous information without realizing the mistake, reaching a conclusion of eligibility when the correct determination should have been ineligibility."
