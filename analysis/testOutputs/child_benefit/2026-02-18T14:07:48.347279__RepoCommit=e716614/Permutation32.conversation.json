            "text": "Based on the information you've provided, I'm afraid **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** for your son John.\n\nHere's why:\n\nWhile Child Benefit can be claimed for young people aged 16-19 if they remain in approved education or training, the education needs to be **full-time**. Full-time non-advanced education typically means more than 12 hours per week of supervised study.\n\nSince John is only doing 6 hours per week at college, this doesn't meet the threshold for full-time education. Additionally, he's not registered with a careers service or enrolled with an approved training provider, which could have been alternative routes to eligibility.\n\nFor children under 16, you can claim Child Benefit regardless of their education status, but once they turn 16, the education or training requirements apply. As John is 17 and not in qualifying full-time education or approved training, Child Benefit would not be payable for him.\n\nIf John's circumstances change - for example, if he enrolls in a full-time course - you could potentially become eligible at that point."

Under Child Benefit rules, you can claim for children under 16, or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training.\n\nSince John is 17, he falls into the category where eligibility depends on whether he is in approved education or training. The key issue here is that John is only doing 6 hours per week of supervised study at college to re-sit GCSEs. \n\nFor education to qualify as \"approved education\" for Child Benefit purposes after age 16, it generally needs to be full-time non-advanced education, which typically means more than 12 hours per week of supervised study. With only 6 hours per week, this would not meet the threshold for full-time education.\n\nAdditionally, John is not registered with a careers service or enrolled with an approved training provider, which could have been an alternative route to eligibility.\n\nTherefore, as John is not in qualifying full-time education or approved training, the applicant would not be eligible for Child Benefit for him."
