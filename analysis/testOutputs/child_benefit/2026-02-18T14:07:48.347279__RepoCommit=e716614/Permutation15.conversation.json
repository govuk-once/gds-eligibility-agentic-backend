According to Child Benefit rules, when a child lives with someone else, you can only claim Child Benefit if you contribute **at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate** towards the child's upkeep.\n\nThe Child Benefit rate for one child is approximately \u00a325.60 per week. Your current contributions of \u00a310 per week (plus an annual birthday present) fall short of this threshold.\n\n**However**, it's worth noting that Emma's mother may be eligible to claim Child Benefit since Emma lives with her. If she's not currently claiming, she may wish to consider applying, as only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child at any given time - typically the person the child lives with."

Mike's contribution (\u00a310/week) is too low.\n\n* **Outcome:** **Not Eligible.**\n\n\n\n",

However, the child does not live with the applicant - she lives with her mother.\n\nAccording to the Child Benefit rules, when a child lives with someone else, you can only claim Child Benefit if you contribute at least the same amount as the Child Benefit rate towards the child's upkeep.\n\nThe applicant contributes \u00a310 per week for food plus one birthday present per year. This totals approximately \u00a310-11 per week when averaged out over the year. The current Child Benefit rate for one child is approximately \u00a325.60 per week.\n\nSince the applicant's contribution (\u00a310-11 per week) is significantly less than the Child Benefit rate (\u00a325.60 per week), they do not meet the eligibility criteria for claiming Child Benefit when the child lives elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, the child's mother (who the child lives with) is not claiming Child Benefit, but this does not change the eligibility requirement that the applicant must contribute at least the equivalent of the Child Benefit rate to be eligible when the child doesn't live with them."
