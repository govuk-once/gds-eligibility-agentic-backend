Both parents make separate claims for the child living with them.\n\n\n\n* **Criteria 1: Responsibility**\n\n    * *Question:* Is the applicant responsible for a child?\n\n    * *Response:* Yes, both are responsible for one child each.\n\n* **Criteria 2: The \"Eldest Child\" Rate Rule**\n\n    * *Question:* Who gets the higher \"Eldest Child\" rate (\u00a326.05)?\n\n    * *Response:* **Both.** The guidance states that if families split up and children are divided between parents (one lives with you, one lives with someone else), each parent is entitled to the full \u00a326.05 weekly rate for the eldest child in their specific household. They do not have to settle for the lower \"additional child\" rate for the younger sibling.\n\n* **Outcome:** **Both Eligible (Both receive the higher rate).**\n\n\n\n",
