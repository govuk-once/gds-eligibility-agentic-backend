I need to clarify something important about Emma's education.\n\n**When exactly did Emma turn 18, and when did she start her university course?**\n\nThis is important because Child Benefit eligibility for young people in education changes at age 18, and Bachelor's degrees are considered advanced education rather than approved education for Child Benefit purposes."

            "text": "Based on the information you've provided, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Emma**.\n\nHere's why: While Child Benefit can continue for young people aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training, a Bachelor's degree at university is considered **advanced education**, not approved education. Approved education refers to non-advanced courses such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, or NVQs up to level 3.\n\nSince Emma turned 18 in September and started her Bachelor's degree at that time (already being 18), your entitlement to Child Benefit for her would have ended. The fact that she lives at home and commutes to university doesn't change this, as the key issue is the type of education she's pursuing.\n\nI'm sorry this isn't the news you were hoping for, but I hope this clarifies your situation."

However, approved education or training means non-advanced courses such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to level 3, or similar qualifications. A Bachelor's degree at university is considered advanced education and does not qualify as approved education for Child Benefit purposes.\n\nEmma turned 18 in September and started her Bachelor's degree at university also in September. Since she was already 18 when she started the degree course, and since a Bachelor's degree is advanced education (not approved education or training), you would not be eligible for Child Benefit for Emma.\n\nChild Benefit for young people in education or training stops when they turn 20, or when they leave approved education or training, whichever comes first. However, since Emma is pursuing advanced education (a Bachelor's degree) rather than approved education, the benefit would have ended when she either turned 18 or left approved non-advanced education - whichever was the relevant stopping point in her case."
