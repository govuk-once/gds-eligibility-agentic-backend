You don't need to be the child's parent to claim - you can claim for a child you're looking after.\n\nThe key criteria are met:\n- Child is under 16 (or under 20 if in approved education or training)\n- Applicant is responsible for the child\n- Applicant lives in the UK\n- No one else is currently claiming Child Benefit for this child\n\nTherefore, the applicant would be eligible to apply for Child Benefit for Nina."

The user's statement \"I'm covering all her costs since she's been with me\" clearly indicated this is a private fostering arrangement where the user bears all costs (not the council), which is a key factor in eligibility for private fosterers.\n\nWhile the agent could have explicitly asked whether the council was paying for Nina's accommodation or a fostering allowance to be more thorough, the information provided by the user was sufficient to establish this was a private arrangement with no council funding. The agent's conclusion aligns perfectly with gov.uk guidance that private fosterers who are financially responsible for a child can claim Child Benefit, unlike those in formal council fostering arrangements where the council pays.\n\nNo erroneous or misleading information was provided. The eligibility determination was correct and well-reasoned."
