Since Chloe has been in hospital for about 14 weeks now, this exceeds the 12-week limit, which means your eligibility for Child Benefit has ended.\n\nYou should contact the Child Benefit Office to inform them of Chloe's situation if you haven't already done so, as you may need to stop your claim while she remains in hospital.\n\nI hope Chloe recovers soon and is able to come home. Once she leaves hospital and returns home to live with you, you would be eligible to claim Child Benefit again."

However, the expected outcome is ELIGIBLE (via Exception).\n\nThe agent failed to identify and ask about a critical exception to the 12-week hospital rule. According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, parents can continue receiving Child Benefit beyond 12 weeks if they are paying at least the same amount towards the child's upkeep as they receive in Child Benefit.\n\nThe test case explicitly states that the user (Mary) spends \u00a330 a week on books, pyjamas, and special food for Chloe while in hospital. This spending would satisfy the exception requirement, as it exceeds the typical Child Benefit payment (approximately \u00a325.60/week for an eldest/only child).\n\nThe agent's failure to ask about ongoing expenditure on the child's upkeep represents a critical omission. By not exploring this exception, the agent provided an incorrect determination of ineligibility when the user should actually remain eligible. The agent gave misleading information by stating definitively that eligibility had ended, without investigating whether any exceptions applied.\n\nThis is a complete failure as the outcome directly contradicts the expected outcome, and incorrect information was provided without the agent realizing the error."
