Since you mentioned that the local authority covers all of Leo's care costs and you don't contribute towards them, this means you wouldn't meet the eligibility criteria.\n\nI understand that you maintain a close relationship with Leo through his regular weekly visits home, but unfortunately, the eligibility rules specifically require financial contribution towards care costs when a child is in local authority care."
