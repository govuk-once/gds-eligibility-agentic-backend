            "text": "Based on the information you've provided, I'm afraid **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.\n\nHere's why: Child Benefit can only be claimed by one person for each child, and it's designed for the person who is responsible for the child on a day-to-day basis. Since your child lives with their mother and she's the one providing all the daily care - the school runs, meals, and general day-to-day looking after - she would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit.\n\nPaying maintenance, even though you're contributing financially to your child's upbringing, doesn't qualify you for Child Benefit when you're not living with the child or providing their day-to-day care. This is the case whether the maintenance payments are voluntary or court-ordered.\n\nSo in your situation, the child's mother would be the eligible party to claim Child Benefit, regardless of whether she's currently claiming it or not. You wouldn't be able to make a successful claim because you don't meet the requirement of being responsible for the child's day-to-day care."

When a child lives with someone else, the person who can claim is generally the one who the child lives with and who is responsible for them on a day-to-day basis.\n\nIn this situation:\n1. The child lives with their mother\n2. The mother provides day-to-day care (school runs, meals, daily care)\n3. The applicant does not live with the child\n4. The applicant only contributes financially through court-ordered maintenance payments (\u00a350/week), which they've indicated is not voluntary\n\nThe gov.uk guidance on \"child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else\" makes clear that Child Benefit is for the person providing day-to-day care. Simply paying maintenance, particularly when it's court-ordered rather than voluntary, does not establish eligibility for Child Benefit when the child lives with and is cared for by someone else.\n\nThe mother would be the eligible party to claim Child Benefit in this case, as she is the person responsible for the child and providing day-to-day care. Whether or not she is currently claiming doesn't change the applicant's ineligibility - they would not qualify to claim because they don't meet the requirement of being responsible for the child in terms of day-to-day care."
