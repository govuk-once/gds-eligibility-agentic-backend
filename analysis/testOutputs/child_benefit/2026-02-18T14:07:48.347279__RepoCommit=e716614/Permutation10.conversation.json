Since you're receiving fostering allowances from the local authority that cover Liam's accommodation and maintenance, this disqualifies you from claiming Child Benefit for him.\n\nWhile you are caring for Liam and he lives with you, the foster care payments you receive mean that Child Benefit is not available in this situation. This prevents duplicate support payments from different parts of the government system.\n\nIf you have any other children in your care who are not fostered through the local authority, you may still be eligible to claim Child Benefit for them separately."
