            "text": "Based on the information you've provided, I'm afraid **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** for Sofia.\n\nHere's why: Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 16, or for young people aged 16 to 19 if they are in approved education or training. Since Sofia is 18 and is not currently in education or training (she's working as a receptionist), she doesn't meet the eligibility criteria.\n\nChild Benefit typically stops when a young person turns 16, unless they continue in approved full-time non-advanced education (like A-levels or Scottish Highers) or approved training. Once a young person leaves education and enters full-time employment, they no longer qualify.\n\nIf Sofia were to return to approved education or training in the future, you could potentially become eligible again, but based on her current circumstances, an application would not be successful."

However, she is not in approved education or training - she left school two years ago and is now working as a receptionist. Since she is over 16 and not in approved education or training, she does not meet the eligibility criteria for Child Benefit.\n\nThe applicant does live in the UK and Sofia lives with them, which would normally satisfy the residency and responsibility requirements, but the fundamental requirement regarding the child's age and education/training status is not met."
