The agent correctly applied the rule that Child Benefit can be claimed for 16-19 year olds who stay in approved education or training. The test case explicitly confirms that the \"No One Left Behind\" programme is approved training for Child Benefit purposes. The agent's conclusion of eligibility matches the expected outcome perfectly. No erroneous or misleading information was provided. Both the conversational outcome and the eligibility_agent_payload correctly indicate eligibility."
