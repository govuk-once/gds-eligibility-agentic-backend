Approved training includes government-funded training courses such as Intermediate and Advanced Apprenticeships in England.\n\nSince Ryan is 17 and enrolled in a government-funded Intermediate Apprenticeship, this qualifies as approved training, which means you remain eligible for Child Benefit for him."
