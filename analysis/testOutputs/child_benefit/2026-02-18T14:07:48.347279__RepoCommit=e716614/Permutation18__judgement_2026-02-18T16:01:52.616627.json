Based on your circumstances, I'm afraid **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit**.\n\nHere's why:\n\nWhile you meet the main requirements (you live and work in the UK, you're responsible for your son, and he lives with you), the issue is your son's age. \n\nFor young people aged 16 or over, Child Benefit can only continue if they stay in approved education or training **and only until they turn 20 years old**. Even though your son started his A-levels before turning 20 and is still studying full-time, Child Benefit stops when a young person reaches their 20th birthday, regardless of whether they've completed their course.\n\nSince your son turned 20 last week, he has now passed the maximum age limit for Child Benefit eligibility, even though he's still mid-way through his A-level studies.\n\nI'm sorry this isn't the outcome you were hoping for. If you have any other questions, please let me know."

However, their son is now 20 years old (turned 20 last week)\n\nAccording to the Child Benefit eligibility rules, you can only claim Child Benefit for a child aged 16 or over if they stay in approved education or training, BUT only until they turn 20 years old. The benefit stops when the young person turns 20, even if they are still in approved education or training.\n\nWhile the son started his A-levels before turning 20 and is still enrolled in full-time approved education, he has now turned 20 years old. Child Benefit entitlement ends when a young person in education or training reaches age 20, regardless of whether they have completed their course.\n\nTherefore, the application would be ineligible because the son has passed the maximum age limit of 20 years old for Child Benefit, even though he is still in approved education."

The agent accurately applied the Child Benefit eligibility rules by concluding that the claimant is NOT ELIGIBLE because their son has turned 20 years old. The agent correctly explained that Child Benefit stops when a young person reaches their 20th birthday, even if they are still in approved education or training and haven't completed their course. This aligns perfectly with the gov.uk guidance which states that for 16-19 year olds in education, Child Benefit can continue only until they turn 20. The agent gathered all relevant information (age, education status, when the course started, living arrangements, and UK residence), applied the rules correctly, and provided clear, accurate reasoning. The eligibility_agent_payload also correctly reflects this determination with 'would_application_be_ineligible: true'. No erroneous information was provided at any point in the conversation."
