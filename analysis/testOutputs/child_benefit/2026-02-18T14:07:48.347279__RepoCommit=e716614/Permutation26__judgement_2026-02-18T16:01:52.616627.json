When a child lives with someone else, Child Benefit is claimed by the person who has main responsibility for the child.\n\nWhile the applicant does contribute \u00a315 per week towards the child's care, this financial contribution alone does not establish eligibility for Child Benefit. The key factor is that the aunt has main responsibility for the child and the child lives with her, which means the aunt would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit (if she chose to do so).\n\nThe fact that the child's grandmother also contributes financially does not change this assessment - the determining factor is who has main responsibility for the child's care, not who contributes financially."

According to https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, you may be able to get Child Benefit if contributing towards the child's upbringing by at least the Child Benefit amount.\n\nCritical facts the agent overlooked:\n1. Mo contributes \u00a315/week and his mother contributes \u00a315/week = \u00a330/week total\n2. This total (\u00a330) exceeds the Child Benefit threshold (\u00a326.05/week)\n3. The aunt does NOT claim Child Benefit (explicitly stated)\n4. According to the test case guidance, contributions from multiple people can be aggregated\n\nThe agent incorrectly stated \"Financial contributions alone don't establish eligibility for Child Benefit\" without considering the specific exception where contributions meeting the threshold DO establish eligibility when the child lives with someone else who isn't claiming. The agent should have asked about the total amount of contributions and compared it to the Child Benefit rate before concluding ineligibility."
