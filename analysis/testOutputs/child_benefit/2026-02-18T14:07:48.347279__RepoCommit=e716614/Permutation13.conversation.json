            "reasoning_for_eligibility_judgement": "Based on the information provided, the applicant appears to be eligible for Child Benefit for Maya. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The applicant has a child (Maya, age 4) who they are responsible for - she has been placed with them by an adoption agency and is living in their home.\n\n2. According to the gov.uk eligibility guidance, you can claim Child Benefit if you're responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training). Maya at age 4 meets this age requirement.\n\n3. The child lives with them in the UK, satisfying the residency requirement.\n\n4. Importantly, the eligibility guidance states that you're considered responsible for a child if they live with you OR if you're paying towards their upkeep at least the same amount as Child Benefit or the equivalent in kind. In this case, Maya is living with them as part of an adoption placement.\n\n5. No one else is claiming Child Benefit for Maya, and the applicant is not receiving Child Benefit from another country.\n\n6. Neither the applicant nor their partner are subject to immigration control with restrictions on accessing public funds.\n\n7. Crucially, the gov.uk guidance explicitly states that you can claim even if the child is not legally your own child yet, which covers the situation where the adoption order has not been finalized but the child has been placed with them by the adoption agency.\n\nAll eligibility criteria appear to be met for a full Child Benefit claim."
