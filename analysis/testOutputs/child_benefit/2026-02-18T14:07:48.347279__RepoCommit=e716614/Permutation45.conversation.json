Based on the information you've provided, **you would be eligible to apply for Child Benefit** for your daughter.\n\nHere's why:\n\n\u2713 You have a child under 16 who you're responsible for\n\u2713 Your daughter normally lives with you\n\u2713 You live in the UK\n\nImportantly, even though your daughter has been in hospital for 14 weeks, you can still claim Child Benefit because you're visiting her every day for hours. The rules state that while Child Benefit normally continues for up to 12 weeks when a child is in hospital, it can continue for longer periods if you regularly spend at least 4 hours a week with your child - which you clearly do.\n\nYour regular visits and the fact that she normally lives with you and will return home after discharge mean you meet all the eligibility criteria. You should be able to make a new claim for Child Benefit for your daughter."
