            "text": "Thank you for providing all that information. Based on what you've told me, here's my assessment:\n\n**Your application would be partially eligible, but with an important limitation:**\n\nYou meet the basic eligibility criteria for Child Benefit because:\n- Holly is 9 years old (under 16)\n- You live in the UK\n- You are responsible for her care\n\n**However**, there's a key rule: **only ONE person can receive Child Benefit for a child**. \n\nSince both you and Sue have submitted claims and Holly splits her time between you (3 days with you, 4 days with Sue), HMRC will need to decide who has \"main responsibility\" for Holly. They will look at factors including:\n- Who Holly lives with most of the time\n- Who contributes most to her care and costs\n\nGiven that Holly spends 4 days a week with Sue compared to 3 days with you, HMRC is likely to determine that Sue has main responsibility and should receive the Child Benefit. However, HMRC will consider all the circumstances before making their final decision.\n\nSo while you are eligible to apply, only one of you will ultimately be awarded the benefit, and it's more likely to be Sue based on Holly spending more time with her."

They are separated from their ex-partner Sue, and Holly splits her time between both parents (3 days with the claimant, 4 days with Sue). Both parents contribute to Holly's care.\n\nAccording to the rules, only ONE person can get Child Benefit for a child. When a child lives with more than one person, the person who has \"main responsibility\" for the child gets the Child Benefit. If parents cannot agree, HMRC will decide based on factors such as who the child lives with most of the time.\n\nSince Holly spends 4 days a week with Sue and 3 days with the claimant, and both parents have submitted claims, HMRC will need to make a decision about who has main responsibility. The guidance indicates that the person the child lives with most (Sue, in this case with 4 days vs 3 days) would typically be considered to have main responsibility, though HMRC considers all circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the application would be eligible in part - meaning the claimant meets the basic eligibility criteria (has a qualifying child, lives in UK, is responsible for the child's care), but only one person can receive the benefit for Holly. HMRC will determine who has main responsibility, and it's likely to be Sue given Holly spends more time with her."

The expected outcome clearly states \"Sue is Eligible / Pete is Not Eligible.\" However, the agent told Pete that his \"application would be partially eligible\" and set the eligibility payload to \"would_application_be_eligible_in_part: true\". This is incorrect and misleading.\n\nAccording to the gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit when a child lives with more than one person, only ONE person can receive Child Benefit - the person with \"main responsibility.\" When parents cannot agree and both submit claims, HMRC decides based on who the child lives with most of the time. Since Holly lives with Sue 4 days per week versus Pete 3 days per week, Sue has main responsibility and is the eligible party.\n\nPete should have been told clearly that he is NOT eligible because: (1) only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, (2) Sue has Holly more days per week, therefore Sue has main responsibility, and (3) Sue would be awarded the benefit, not Pete.\n\nThe concept of \"partial eligibility\" is misleading in this context. Pete either is or isn't eligible, and based on the living arrangements, he is not eligible. While the agent correctly explained that only one person can claim and that Sue is likely to receive it, the final assessment incorrectly characterized Pete as \"partially eligible\" rather than clearly stating he is ineligible."
