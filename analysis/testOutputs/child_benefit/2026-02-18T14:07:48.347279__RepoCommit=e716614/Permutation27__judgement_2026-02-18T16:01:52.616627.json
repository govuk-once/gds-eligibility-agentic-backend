While not technically incorrect in stating eligibility, it fails to provide the nuanced guidance that this specific situation requires. A proper assessment would acknowledge eligibility but strongly advise considering having a parent or guardian claim instead for better financial outcomes. The agent gave an incomplete picture that could lead to a financially suboptimal decision, which constitutes a failure to properly serve the user's interests."
