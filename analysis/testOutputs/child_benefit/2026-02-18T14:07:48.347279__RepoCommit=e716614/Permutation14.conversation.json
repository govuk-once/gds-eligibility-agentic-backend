Since you're actively supporting Noah financially and this is only a temporary 8-week arrangement due to your medical recovery, you meet the eligibility criteria.\n\nI hope your recovery goes well, and that Noah is back home with you soon!"

Since you are actively paying for Noah's expenses and he will be returning to live with you once you've recovered, you meet the eligibility criteria.\n\nThe temporary nature of the arrangement (due to medical recovery) and your continued financial support for Noah means you should be eligible to claim or continue claiming Child Benefit."
