Here's what this means for your situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\nSince your son has been in the youth custody center for 10 weeks, you are **not currently eligible** to receive Child Benefit payments. When a child is in custody or detention, Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks, regardless of whether you continue to have expenses for them.\n\n**Good News:**\nYour Child Benefit can **restart when your son comes home** after his sentence is completed. You'll be able to claim Child Benefit again once he is released and returns to living with you.\n\n**What you should do:**\n- You should inform the Child Benefit Office about your son's situation if you haven't already\n- When your son is released and returns home, you can contact them to restart your Child Benefit payments\n\nI understand this is a difficult time for you and your family. While you cannot receive payments during the remainder of his time in custody, you will be able to resume claiming once he's home with you again."

They were claiming Child Benefit before their son went into custody and continue to have costs for him while he's there (maintaining his room, buying clothes and toiletries, and travel costs for visits).\n\nAccording to the guidance, when a child is in custody or detention, Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks. Since the child has been in the youth custody center for 10 weeks, the person would no longer be eligible to receive Child Benefit payments at this time.\n\nHowever, the guidance also states that Child Benefit can restart when the child comes home. Given that the son is expected to return home after his 6-month sentence, the person will be able to claim Child Benefit again once he is released and returns home.\n\nTherefore, the application is eligible in part - they are not currently eligible to receive payments while the child remains in custody beyond 8 weeks, but they will become eligible again when their son is released and returns home."

While the agent correctly identified all the relevant facts - that the son has been in custody for 10 weeks (exceeding the 8-week limit), that Child Benefit stops after 8 weeks in custody, and that the mother is \"not currently eligible\" - the agent's final determination was incorrect.\n\nThe agent framed this as \"partial eligibility\" because the mother could claim again when her son is released. However, this is not a case of partial eligibility. The question at hand is about current eligibility given the present circumstances. The mother is simply not eligible right now because her son has been in custody for more than 8 weeks. The fact that she may become eligible in the future when circumstances change doesn't make her \"partially eligible\" now - it just means her future eligibility could be different.\n\nThe agent's payload also marked \"would_application_be_eligible_in_part: true\" which contradicts the expected outcome of \"Not Eligible.\" The correct determination should have been that the applicant is not eligible for Child Benefit at this time, with helpful guidance that eligibility can restart upon the child's release. The agent conflated current ineligibility with future potential eligibility, leading to an incorrect outcome determination."
