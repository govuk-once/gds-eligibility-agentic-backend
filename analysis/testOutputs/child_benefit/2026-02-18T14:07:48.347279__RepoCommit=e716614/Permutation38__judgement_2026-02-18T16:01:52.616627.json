This means you should receive payments for the most recent 3 months, though you may not receive payment for the full 4 months since your baby was born. The important thing is that you're eligible going forward and will receive the benefit from now on.\n\nSince you mentioned you've already filled in the form today, that's great - you've taken the right step to claim your benefit!"
