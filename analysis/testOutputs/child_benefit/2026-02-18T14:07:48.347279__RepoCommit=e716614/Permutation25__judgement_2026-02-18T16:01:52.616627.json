            "text": "Based on your circumstances, **you would be eligible for Child Benefit**.\n\nHere's why:\n\nEven though Leo is currently in local authority care, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks if someone in your household is contributing to the cost of his upkeep. Since your husband lives with you and is contributing \u00a330 per week towards Leo's care, this meets the requirement. The contribution must be at least the same as the Child Benefit amount, and \u00a330 per week satisfies this condition.\n\nLeo has been in care for 10 weeks, which is within the 12-week eligibility period.\n\n**Important note:** Child Benefit can only continue for up to 12 weeks while a child is in local authority care with these contributions being made. After that point, eligibility would cease unless Leo returns to live with you.\n\nI hope this information helps. If you have any other questions about Child Benefit, please feel free to ask."

The husband contributes \u00a330 per week to Leo's upkeep\n\nAccording to the government guidance on Child Benefit for children in care, you can continue to get Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks (84 days) if your child goes into local authority care, provided that you (or someone in your household) contribute to the cost of supporting your child during this time. The contribution must be at least the same as the Child Benefit or the child element of Child Tax Credit.\n\nSince the husband lives in the same household and is contributing \u00a330 per week (which exceeds the current Child Benefit rate for one child of approximately \u00a325 per week), and Leo has been in care for 10 weeks (which is within the 12-week limit), the applicant should be eligible for Child Benefit during this period."

The agent properly applied the rules for children in local authority care, specifically: (1) correctly identified the 12-week eligibility period for children in care, (2) verified that Leo has been in care for 10 weeks, which is within this limit, (3) correctly recognized that contributions from a spouse/partner living in the same household count toward the contribution requirement, (4) confirmed the \u00a330/week contribution meets the minimum threshold, and (5) reached the correct conclusion of eligibility. The agent's reasoning aligns with government guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care, which states that Child Benefit can continue for up to 12 weeks if someone in the household contributes to the child's upkeep. The agent also appropriately warned that eligibility would cease after 12 weeks unless the child returns home. Both the conversation outcome and the eligibility_agent_payload correctly indicate eligibility, matching the expected outcome."
