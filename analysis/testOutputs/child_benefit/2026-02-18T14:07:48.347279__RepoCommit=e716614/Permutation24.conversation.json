The applicant has a 14-year-old son (Tom) who is under 16, so within the age limit for Child Benefit\n2. The applicant lives in the UK\n3. Tom lives in a residential school paid for by the local council due to severe behavioral needs\n4. Tom returns home during school holidays\n5. The applicant continues to contribute to Tom's upkeep by purchasing clothes, toiletries, and other personal items\n\nAccording to the guidance on children in care, you can continue to claim Child Benefit for a child who is in local authority care if the child is expected to live with you for part of the year (such as during school holidays) and you continue to support them. The fact that Tom comes home during school holidays and the mother continues to provide for his personal needs demonstrates ongoing responsibility and maintenance.\n\nTom has only been at the residential school for 10 weeks and continues to return home regularly, which shows he has not been permanently placed elsewhere. The residential placement is specifically for educational purposes related to his behavioral needs during term time, not a permanent care arrangement.\n\nTherefore, the applicant would be eligible to claim Child Benefit for Tom."
