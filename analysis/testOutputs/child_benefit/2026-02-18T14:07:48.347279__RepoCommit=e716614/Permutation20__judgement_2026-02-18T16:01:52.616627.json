Based on the information you've provided, **you would be eligible to apply for Child Benefit** for your granddaughter Lucia.\n\nHere's why:\n\n\u2713 You're responsible for Lucia (aged 14, which is under 16)\n\u2713 She lives with you full-time\n\u2713 You're paying for everything she needs\n\u2713 You're a British citizen living in the UK\n\u2713 Nobody else is currently claiming Child Benefit for her\n\nYou don't need to be a child's parent to claim Child Benefit - grandparents and other family members can claim it when they're responsible for a child who lives with them. Since you're caring for Lucia full-time and meeting all her needs, you meet the eligibility requirements.\n\nYou should be able to proceed with making an application for Child Benefit for Lucia."

Lucia lives with the applicant full-time, and the applicant is paying for everything she needs - this satisfies the requirement of being responsible for the child.\n\n3. The applicant is a British citizen living in the UK - this satisfies the residence and immigration status requirements.\n\n4. Nobody else is currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucia - only one person can get Child Benefit for a child, and since no one else is claiming it, there is no conflict.\n\n5. According to gov.uk guidance on \"child benefit - child lives with someone else\", you can claim Child Benefit if a child lives with you, even if you're not their parent. The key is that you're responsible for the child.\n\nAll the eligibility criteria are met. The applicant is responsible for a qualifying child (under 16), lives in the UK with the right to reside here, the child lives with them full-time, and no one else is claiming Child Benefit for the child. Therefore, the application would be eligible."

Given this context and the user's clear indication of complete financial responsibility, the omission of this specific question does not constitute an error or misleading information.\n\nThe agent's conclusion matches the expected outcome (Eligible), the reasoning provided was sound and accurate, and no erroneous or misleading information was given. The agent successfully completed the eligibility assessment."
