Leo lives at home with them full-time and is not in hospital or local authority care for an extended period.\n\nAccording to the eligibility criteria at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit/eligibility, a person can claim Child Benefit if they're responsible for a child under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training) and they live in the UK. The applicant satisfies all these requirements.\n\nOnly one person can claim Child Benefit for a child, and since no one else is claiming for Leo, and the applicant (along with their husband) is responsible for him, they would be eligible to make a claim. If both parents are responsible, they can decide between them who claims, but one of them would be eligible."
