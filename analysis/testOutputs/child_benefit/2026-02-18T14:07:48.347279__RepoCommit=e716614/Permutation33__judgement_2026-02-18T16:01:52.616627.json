According to Child Benefit rules, for a child aged 16-19 to qualify under the education/training provision, the training must be \"approved education or training\" which specifically excludes employer-funded training.\n\nThe actor explicitly stated twice that the travel agency employing Bella is \"fully funding\" and \"paying for the whole course.\" Despite this clear information being provided, the agent failed to recognize this as a disqualifying factor. The agent asked if the training was a \"recognized qualification\" but did not probe into whether employer funding would affect eligibility.\n\nThe agent's final determination that the applicant \"would be eligible to apply for Child Benefit for Bella\" because \"she's in approved education/training (her recognized travel industry qualification)\" is incorrect. Employer-funded training does not meet the criteria for \"approved education or training\" under Child Benefit rules.\n\nThe agent gave erroneous information without realizing the mistake, leading to a completely incorrect eligibility determination that disagrees with the expected outcome."
