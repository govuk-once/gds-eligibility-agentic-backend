The aunt does not claim. Mo sends \u00a315 a week. Mo's mother (Zahid's grandmother) also sends \u00a315 a week to the aunt for Zahid.\n\n\n\n* **Criteria 1: Individual Contribution Sufficiency**\n\n    * *Question:* Is Mo contributing the full \u00a326.05 amount personally?\n\n    * *Response:* No, he only pays \u00a315.\n\n* **Criteria 2: Aggregated Contributions**\n\n    * *Question:* Can contributions from multiple people be combined?\n\n    * *Response:* Yes. The guidance states that contributions still count if more than one person is contributing, as long as the **total contributions** are worth at least as much as the Child Benefit. \u00a315 + \u00a315 = \u00a330, which covers the threshold.\n\n* **Outcome:** **Eligible.**\n\n\n\n",

Their 15-year-old son does not live with them - he lives with his aunt\n2. The aunt has main responsibility for the child's day-to-day care and makes decisions about his upbringing\n3. This is a family arrangement (not a hospital or care situation)\n\nAccording to the eligibility rules, only one person can get Child Benefit for a child, and this is generally the person the child lives with. When a child lives with someone else, Child Benefit is claimed by the person who has main responsibility for the child.\n\nWhile the applicant does contribute \u00a315 per week towards the child's care, this financial contribution alone does not establish eligibility for Child Benefit. The key factor is that the aunt has main responsibility for the child and the child lives with her, which means the aunt would be the person eligible to claim Child Benefit (if she chose to do so).\n\nThe fact that the child's grandmother also contributes financially does not change this assessment - the determining factor is who has main responsibility for the child's care, not who contributes financially."
