Importantly, according to UK government rules, you can continue to receive Child Benefit when your child is in care or detention for 12 weeks or less. Since Simon's stay in the secure psychiatric unit will be less than 12 weeks total and you expect him to return home afterwards, you remain eligible for Child Benefit throughout this period.\n\nIf you haven't already claimed Child Benefit, you should apply. If you're already receiving it, you can continue to do so during Simon's detention."
