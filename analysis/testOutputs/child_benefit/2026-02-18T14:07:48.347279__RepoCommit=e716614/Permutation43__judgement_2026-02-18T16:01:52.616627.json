The critical error is the agent's statement that \"A Modern Apprenticeship is typically approved training\" and \"Your son is in a Modern Apprenticeship, which counts as approved training.\" This is incorrect for Scotland. According to the Child Benefit rules, apprenticeships in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland do NOT qualify as approved training for Child Benefit purposes (only Welsh apprenticeships have a specific exception). Since the applicant lives in Glasgow, Scotland, the 17-year-old son doing a Modern Apprenticeship would NOT qualify for Child Benefit continuation. The agent gave completely incorrect guidance by stating eligibility when the correct answer should have been ineligibility, and provided misleading information about apprenticeships counting as approved training in Scotland."
