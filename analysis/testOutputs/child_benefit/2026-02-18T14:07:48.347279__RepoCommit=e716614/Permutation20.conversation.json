The applicant is responsible for a child (their granddaughter Lucia, aged 14) - Child Benefit can be claimed for children under 16 (or under 20 if they stay in approved education or training).\n\n2. Lucia lives with the applicant full-time, and the applicant is paying for everything she needs - this satisfies the requirement of being responsible for the child.\n\n3. The applicant is a British citizen living in the UK - this satisfies the residence and immigration status requirements.\n\n4. Nobody else is currently claiming Child Benefit for Lucia - only one person can get Child Benefit for a child, and since no one else is claiming it, there is no conflict.\n\n5. According to gov.uk guidance on \"child benefit - child lives with someone else\", you can claim Child Benefit if a child lives with you, even if you're not their parent. The key is that you're responsible for the child.\n\nAll the eligibility criteria are met. The applicant is responsible for a qualifying child (under 16), lives in the UK with the right to reside here, the child lives with them full-time, and no one else is claiming Child Benefit for the child. Therefore, the application would be eligible."
