The applicant has two children (ages 8 and 10) who are under 16 years old - meeting the age requirement\n2. The applicant and their wife are responsible for the children, looking after them and paying for their needs (food, clothes, housing)\n3. Although the family does not currently live in the UK (they are in Germany), the applicant is a member of the British Armed Forces posted abroad\n4. According to the eligibility guidance, you can claim Child Benefit if you're in the UK Armed Forces and posted overseas\n5. The applicant is not receiving Child Benefit from another country\n\nThe UK government allows members of the Armed Forces serving overseas to claim Child Benefit, which is an exception to the standard requirement of living in the UK. Since all other eligibility criteria are met (responsible for children under 16, not claiming from another country), the application should be eligible."
