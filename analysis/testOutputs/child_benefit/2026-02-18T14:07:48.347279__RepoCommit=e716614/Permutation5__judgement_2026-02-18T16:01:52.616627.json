This is a fundamental error.\n\nThe agent incorrectly stated: \"you can only claim Child Benefit if the child lives with you\" and \"your financial contribution...doesn't entitle you to claim Child Benefit since he doesn't live with you.\"\n\nThis is factually incorrect according to gov.uk guidance at https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-child-lives-with-someone-else, which explicitly states: \"If you do not live with your child, you can still get Child Benefit if you're paying at least the same amount as Child Benefit or the Child Benefit rate towards looking after them.\"\n\nMark is paying \u00a3150 per month, which exceeds the Child Benefit amount of approximately \u00a3113/month (\u00a326.05/week), so he meets this criterion. Additionally, since Jenny (the ex-wife with whom Lucas lives) is NOT claiming Child Benefit, there is no concurrent claim issue, and Mark should be eligible.\n\nThe agent failed to identify the \"contributing to upkeep\" exception that applies when a non-resident parent pays at least the Child Benefit amount toward the child's care and no one else is claiming. This represents a significant misunderstanding of the eligibility rules and resulted in the completely wrong outcome being provided to the user."
