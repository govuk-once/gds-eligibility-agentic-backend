Since you're receiving fostering allowances from the local authority that cover Liam's accommodation and maintenance, this disqualifies you from claiming Child Benefit for him.\n\nWhile you are caring for Liam and he lives with you, the foster care payments you receive mean that Child Benefit is not available in this situation. This prevents duplicate support payments from different parts of the government system.\n\nIf you have any other children in your care who are not fostered through the local authority, you may still be eligible to claim Child Benefit for them separately."

The agent asked appropriate questions to establish: (1) the child is of eligible age (12 years old), (2) the child lives with the applicant in a fostering arrangement, and (3) the local authority pays fostering allowances covering accommodation and maintenance. The agent correctly applied the rule that prevents claiming Child Benefit when the local council is paying toward the cost of looking after a child, explaining this prevents duplicate support payments. The outcome matches the expected outcome of \"Not Eligible\" and the eligibility_agent_payload correctly shows \"would_application_be_ineligible\": true.
