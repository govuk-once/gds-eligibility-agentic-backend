Based on what you've told me, I'm afraid **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** for Jordan.\n\nHere's why:\n\nChild Benefit can be claimed for:\n- Children under 16, **or**\n- Young people under 20 if they stay in approved education or training\n\nSince Jordan is 17 and is not in approved education or training (having finished his GCSEs last year without continuing to college or other approved education), he doesn't meet the eligibility criteria. Child Benefit would have ended on 31st August following when he left approved education.\n\nIf Jordan's circumstances change and he decides to return to approved education or training in the future, you may be able to claim Child Benefit again at that point, provided he's still under 20 years old.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about Child Benefit or Jordan's situation?"

Jordan is 17 years old and is not in approved education or training - he finished his GCSEs last year and has not continued to college or any other form of approved education or training.\n\nSince Jordan turned 17 in September last year and left education after his GCSEs, Child Benefit eligibility would have ended on the 31st August following his 16th birthday (or when he left approved education, whichever was later). As he is now 17 and not in approved education or training, he no longer meets the age and education criteria required for Child Benefit eligibility.\n\nWhile the applicant and Jordan both live in the UK (meeting the residence requirement), and the applicant is responsible for Jordan, the fundamental age and education criteria are not met, making the application ineligible."
