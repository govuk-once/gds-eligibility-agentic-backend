However, this does not affect your eligibility to claim Child Benefit during this time.\n\nYou should continue receiving your Child Benefit throughout Arthur's hospital stays. I hope Arthur recovers well soon."

The 12-week rule applies differently than you might think - you can keep getting Child Benefit for up to 12 weeks if your child goes into hospital or care (even if on a temporary basis). However, if your child goes into hospital or care within 28 days of coming out, the time they spent at home doesn't count as a break, and the time adds up.\n\nIn Arthur's situation: He was in hospital for 10 weeks, came home for 2 weeks, then went back into hospital 15 days (just over 2 weeks) after coming home. Since he returned to hospital within 28 days, these periods are treated as continuous. This means the total period would be counted together (10 weeks + 3 weeks = 13 weeks so far). \n\nEven though the combined stay exceeds 12 weeks when counted together, you remain eligible to claim Child Benefit throughout this period. You should continue receiving Child Benefit while Arthur is in hospital."

The 28-day linking rule applies (Arthur returned to hospital after 15 days)\n2. The hospital periods should be treated as continuous\n3. The cumulative total is 13 weeks (10 weeks + 3 weeks)\n\nHowever, the agent made a critical error by stating: \"Even though the combined stay exceeds 12 weeks when counted together, you remain eligible to claim Child Benefit throughout this period.\" This is incorrect.\n\nAccording to gov.uk guidance, Child Benefit can only continue for up to 12 weeks when a child is in hospital. When cumulative hospital time exceeds 12 weeks (with periods linked by the 28-day rule), eligibility ceases after the 12th week unless the parent is contributing at least the amount of Child Benefit to the child's upkeep - an exception the agent failed to inquire about.\n\nThe expected outcome is \"Not Eligible (after the cumulative 12th week)\" but the agent concluded the user is fully eligible. The agent's payload also shows \"would_application_be_eligible: true\" which contradicts the correct outcome.\n\nThis is a fundamental misapplication of the hospital stay rules that results in giving the user incorrect information about their benefit entitlement."
