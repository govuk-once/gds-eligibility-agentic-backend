According to the test case details, while marriage normally disqualifies a young person from Child Benefit, an exception applies when: (1) the married child lives with the claimant, and (2) the claimant is not financially supporting the spouse (or the spouse is also in full-time education/dependent).\n\nThe agent failed to:\n1. Investigate whether an exception to the marriage rule might apply\n2. Ask about the spouse's situation (education status, dependency status)\n3. Ask about financial support arrangements for the spouse\n4. Apply the exception that would render the family eligible\n\nThe agent gave an incorrect blanket determination of ineligibility based solely on marital status without exploring the relevant exception. This is a fundamental error that resulted in the wrong outcome being communicated to the user. The agent's payload also confirms \"would_application_be_ineligible: true\" which contradicts the expected outcome of \"Eligible (via Exception).\""
