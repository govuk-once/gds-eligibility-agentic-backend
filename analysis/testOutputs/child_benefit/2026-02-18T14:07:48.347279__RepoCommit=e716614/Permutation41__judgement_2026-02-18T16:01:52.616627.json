            "text": "Based on the information you've provided, **you would not be eligible for Child Benefit** in this situation.\n\nHere's why: The key rule for Child Benefit is that it's generally claimed by the person the child normally lives with. Since Ben and Jerry live with your ex-partner, your ex-partner would be the person who is eligible to claim Child Benefit for them.\n\nEven though you're contributing \u00a340 per week towards their support and your ex-partner isn't currently claiming Child Benefit, you cannot claim it because the children don't live with you. The primary eligibility requirement is that the child must normally live with the person making the claim.\n\n**What this means:** Your ex-partner (the person the children live with) would be the appropriate person to make a Child Benefit claim for Ben and Jerry. You might want to encourage them to apply if they haven't already, as it's a benefit that could help with the costs of raising the children."

The children live with the applicant's ex-partner. While the applicant contributes \u00a340 per week towards their support, this does not qualify them for Child Benefit.\n\nAccording to the Child Benefit rules, only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child. The person who can claim is generally the person the child lives with. If a child doesn't live with you, you can only get Child Benefit if you're paying at least the same amount (or more) towards the child's upkeep as the Child Benefit payment would be AND no one else is claiming Child Benefit for that child.\n\nEven though the ex-partner is not currently claiming Child Benefit, the children live with the ex-partner, which means the ex-partner would be the eligible person to claim. The applicant, who does not live with the children, would not be eligible to claim Child Benefit even if they are contributing financially, because the primary eligibility criterion is that the child normally lives with the claimant.\n\nTherefore, this application would be ineligible.

The official guidance clearly states that you CAN claim Child Benefit for a child who doesn't live with you IF you're paying at least the amount of Child Benefit towards their upkeep AND no one else is claiming for that child.\n\nIn this case:\n- The children live with the ex-partner\n- The ex-partner is NOT claiming Child Benefit (this was explicitly confirmed)\n- The user contributes \u00a340 per week\n\nThe expected outcome indicates that with proper allocation (\u00a326.05 to Ben, \u00a313.95 to Jerry), the user would be eligible for Ben (Full Rate) but not for Jerry. The agent completely failed to recognize this possibility and incorrectly told the user they were ineligible when they could actually claim for at least one child.\n\nThe agent also failed to inform the user about:\n1. The option to claim when contributing adequately and no one else is claiming\n2. The specific contribution thresholds (\u00a326.05 for first child, \u00a317.25 for additional)\n3. The possibility of requesting unequal allocation of contributions across children\n\nThis represents a significant failure in applying the Child Benefit eligibility rules correctly."
