The benefit is designed to go to the person who has primary responsibility for the child on a daily basis.\n\nEven if her mother isn't currently claiming Child Benefit, she would have the stronger entitlement as the primary carer with whom your daughter lives. If you both were to apply, the claim would go to her as the person with main responsibility.\n\nYour financial contributions are valuable for supporting your daughter, but they don't create eligibility for Child Benefit in this situation where she lives with and is primarily cared for by her mother."

Even if the mother is not currently claiming, she would have the stronger claim as she is the primary carer with whom the child lives. If both parents were to apply, the claim would typically go to the person with whom the child lives and who has main responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the applicant would be ineligible to claim Child Benefit for his daughter in these circumstances."
