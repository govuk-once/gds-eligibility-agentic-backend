Let me start with the first one:\n\nDo you have a child or children who are under 16 years old (or under 20 if they're in approved education or training)?"

            "text": "Thank you for that information. It's helpful to know that you have a child under 16 and that you're currently receiving Child Benefit payments.\n\nRegarding your question about charges, there is something important you should be aware of: the High Income Child Benefit Charge. This is a tax charge that can apply when either you or your partner has an individual income over \u00a350,000 a year.\n\nSince you earn about \u00a318,000 a year, this charge wouldn't apply based on your income alone. However, I need to ask:\n\nDo you have a partner, and if so, does your partner earn over \u00a350,000 a year?"

            "text": "Yes, that does affect your situation. Since your wife Emily earns \u00a365,000 a year, which is over \u00a350,000, the High Income Child Benefit Charge will apply to your household.\n\nHere's what this means:\n\n- You are still **eligible** for Child Benefit and can continue to claim it\n- However, because Emily earns over \u00a350,000, there will be a tax charge applied\n- The charge increases gradually: it's 1% of the Child Benefit amount for every \u00a3100 of income between \u00a350,000 and \u00a360,000\n- Since Emily earns \u00a365,000 (which is \u00a35,000 over \u00a360,000), the tax charge would be 100% of the Child Benefit received - meaning you'd have to pay back the full amount through the tax system\n\nBecause of this, you have two options:\n1. Continue receiving Child Benefit payments but Emily will need to pay back the equivalent amount through Self Assessment tax return\n2. Opt out of receiving the payments but still submit a claim (this protects National Insurance credits which can affect the State Pension)\n\nBefore I make my final assessment, let me confirm: Is the child living with you, and are you responsible for the child?"

Is that right?"

            "text": "Yes, that's exactly right! Since Emily is the higher earner (with income over \u00a350,000), she would be the one responsible for paying the High Income Child Benefit Charge through her Self Assessment tax return, even though you are the one who receives the Child Benefit payments into your account.\n\nThe tax charge is based on whoever has the highest individual income in the household, not who actually receives the benefit payments.\n\nNow, let me ask one final question to complete my assessment:\n\nAre you or your wife a UK resident, or do either of you have the right to reside in the UK (for example, through settled or pre-settled status, or working legally in the UK)?"

Since her income exceeds \u00a360,000, the charge would be 100% of the Child Benefit amount you receive.\n\n**What this means in practice:**\n- You can continue to receive Child Benefit payments into your account\n- Emily will need to register for Self Assessment and pay back the full amount of Child Benefit through her tax return each year\n\n**Alternative option:**\nYou could opt out of receiving the payments but still submit a Child Benefit claim. This way you won't receive the money, but you'll protect important National Insurance credits that count towards your State Pension entitlement.\n\nThe High Income Child Benefit Charge doesn't affect your eligibility - it's a separate tax matter that your wife would handle through her tax return."

They have a child under 16 years old\n2. The child lives with them and they are responsible for the child\n3. They are UK residents\n\nThe applicant meets all the core eligibility requirements for Child Benefit according to the gov.uk guidance on child benefit eligibility.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while they ARE eligible to receive Child Benefit, the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies to their household because the applicant's wife (Emily) earns \u00a365,000 per year, which exceeds the \u00a350,000 threshold. Since Emily's income is above \u00a360,000, the charge would be 100% of the Child Benefit received. This means Emily would need to repay the full amount of Child Benefit through Self Assessment, even though the applicant is the one receiving the payments.\n\nThe High Income Child Benefit Charge does not affect eligibility - it is a separate tax charge that applies after the benefit is received. Therefore, the application would be eligible, though the household should be aware of the tax implications."
