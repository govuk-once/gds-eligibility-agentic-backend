The person has a 14-year-old son, Oliver, who normally lives with them in the UK\n2. They were already receiving Child Benefit before Oliver went abroad\n3. Oliver has been at a specialist hospital in the USA for approximately 15 weeks for treatment of a rare condition\n4. The parent continues to contribute to Oliver's costs while he's there\n5. This is a temporary arrangement for medical treatment only, and Oliver will return to live with the parent in the UK after treatment\n\nAccording to the government guidance on children in hospital or care, if a child is in hospital, the parent can continue to receive Child Benefit. The guidance specifically states that Child Benefit can continue while a child is temporarily away in hospital. While Oliver is abroad rather than in a UK hospital, the principle applies as this is temporary medical care, the parent maintains financial responsibility, Oliver normally lives with the parent in the UK, and he will return after treatment. The parent was already in receipt of Child Benefit before the temporary hospital stay began, which supports continuity of the benefit during this temporary medical absence."

According to gov.uk guidance on children in hospital or care, Child Benefit can continue when a child is in hospital abroad if they only went abroad for hospital treatment. The agent properly gathered all relevant information: (1) Oliver went to the USA specifically for specialist medical treatment for a rare condition, (2) the parent was already receiving Child Benefit before Oliver went abroad, (3) the parent continues to pay for Oliver's costs, (4) the stay is temporary and Oliver will return to the UK after treatment, and (5) Oliver normally lives with the parent in the UK. The agent correctly applied the rule that allows Child Benefit to continue during temporary hospital stays abroad when the child went specifically for medical treatment. The conclusion of continued eligibility matches the expected outcome of \"Eligible\" and the agent's eligibility_agent_payload correctly indicates \"would_application_be_eligible: true\". No erroneous information was provided during the conversation."
