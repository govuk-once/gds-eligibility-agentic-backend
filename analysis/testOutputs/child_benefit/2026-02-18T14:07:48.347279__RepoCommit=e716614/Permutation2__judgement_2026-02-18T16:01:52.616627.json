The agent accurately stated that Child Benefit can be claimed for young people up to age 20 in full-time education or training, which aligns with gov.uk guidance. The agent made no erroneous statements, asked appropriate questions, and reached the correct outcome of \"eligible\" which matches the expected outcome. The eligibility_agent_payload also correctly indicates eligibility with sound reasoning."
