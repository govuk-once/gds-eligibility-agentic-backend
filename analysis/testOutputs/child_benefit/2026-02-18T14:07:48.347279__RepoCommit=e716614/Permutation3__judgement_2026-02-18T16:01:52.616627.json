According to UK Child Benefit rules, you can claim for children aged 16-19 if they're in approved education or training, OR for a period after they leave education - specifically, you can continue to claim Child Benefit for 20 weeks after a young person leaves education or training if they register with certain approved organizations like careers services\n\nThe fact that the son left school recently (in June, and it's now August - only a couple of months ago) and has registered with the local youth careers service means the parent should still be eligible to claim Child Benefit during this extension period while the son is looking for an apprenticeship.\n\nTherefore, this application would be eligible for Child Benefit."

The agent accurately explained that even though the son is not currently in education or training, Child Benefit can continue for up to 20 weeks after leaving education when the young person has registered with an approved careers service. This is consistent with UK gov.uk guidance on Child Benefit extensions. The agent's final determination of \"eligible\" matches the expected outcome of \"Eligible (for up to 20 weeks)\". The eligibility_agent_payload also correctly indicates eligibility with accurate reasoning. No erroneous or misleading information was provided throughout the conversation."
