I now have enough details to assess your eligibility.\n\nLet me carefully consider your situation based on the Child Benefit rules:\n\nAccording to the official guidance on Child Benefit for children in hospital or care, when a child goes into local authority care, you can continue to receive Child Benefit for up to **8 weeks** from when the child goes into care. After the 8-week period ends, you are no longer eligible to receive Child Benefit, even if the child regularly visits you at weekends.\n\nIn your case:\n- Jack has been in continuous local authority care for 3 months (approximately 12-13 weeks)\n- This exceeds the 8-week limit\n- Although Jack visits you every weekend (staying Friday and Saturday nights), he is still formally in local authority care during this time"

Since Jack has now been in care for 3 months (which is approximately 12-13 weeks), this exceeds the 8-week limit.\n\nEven though Jack comes home every weekend and stays with you on Friday and Saturday nights, the fact that he remains formally in local authority care means that the 8-week rule still applies.\n\nI understand this may be disappointing news, especially as you're maintaining such regular contact with Jack. If your circumstances change and Jack returns home to live with you full-time, you would be able to make a new claim for Child Benefit at that point."

However, the agent failed to recognize and apply a critical exception to this rule.\n\nAccording to official UK government guidance (https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-for-children-in-hospital-or-care), you can still receive Child Benefit even after the 8-week period if the child \"spends at least one night a week at home (or 2 nights in a row or 24 hours a week if they're in hospital).\"\n\nIn this case, Jack comes home every weekend and stays Friday and Saturday nights - clearly meeting the \"2 nights in a row\" exception. The agent was informed of this fact multiple times during the conversation but failed to apply the exception rule. Instead, the agent explicitly stated that the weekend visits don't matter and that the 8-week rule still applies.\n\nThis is a significant error. The agent gave incorrect information that would result in an eligible claimant being told they are ineligible and potentially losing their benefit entitlement. The agent's payload also confirms they determined ineligibility, which contradicts the expected outcome of eligible via exception."
