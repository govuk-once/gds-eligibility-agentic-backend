The assessment properly considered all relevant criteria: (1) the applicant is responsible for a 5-year-old child who lives with them, (2) both normally live in the UK, (3) the applicant has pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, and (4) the applicant is registered as a jobseeker and actively looking for work. The agent correctly identified that pre-settled status combined with being a registered jobseeker provides a qualifying right to reside for Child Benefit purposes. This aligns with the expected outcome that holders of Pre-Settled Status can claim Child Benefit if they meet specific \"right to reside\" tests, such as being a registered jobseeker. The agent's conclusion in both the conversation and the eligibility_agent_payload matches the expected outcome of \"Eligible\" and the reasoning provided is accurate and not misleading."
