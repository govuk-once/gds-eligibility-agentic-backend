However, the agent failed critically by not investigating income levels or mentioning the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC).\n\nThe expected outcome is \"Eligible (but subject to tax charge)\" which indicates this is the \"High Earner\" test case where one partner earns \u00a375,000 per year - well over the \u00a360,000 threshold for HICBC. The agent should have:\n1. Asked about the income of both partners\n2. Identified that income over \u00a360,000 triggers a tax charge\n3. Explained that at \u00a375,000, they would face a significant HICBC (approximately 75% of the benefit would be clawed back via tax)\n4. Mentioned the option to claim but opt out of receiving payments\n\nBy giving an unqualified \"you would be eligible\" response without addressing the tax charge implications, the agent provided misleading information by omission. The applicant would face an unexpected tax bill if they followed this advice without understanding the HICBC consequences. This is a material omission that makes the guidance incomplete and potentially harmful to the user's financial situation."
