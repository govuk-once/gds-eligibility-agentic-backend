However, a Higher National Certificate (HNC) is classified as **advanced education** (it's a Level 4/5 qualification).\n\nChild Benefit only covers non-advanced education such as:\n- A-levels\n- Scottish Highers  \n- NVQs up to Level 3\n- Similar non-advanced qualifications\n\nSince your daughter is studying an HNC, which is advanced education, she doesn't qualify under the age extension rules for 16-19 year olds, and therefore you wouldn't be eligible to claim Child Benefit for her.\n\nI'm sorry this isn't the outcome you were hoping for. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask."

The agent accurately explained that Child Benefit for 16-19 year olds only covers full-time non-advanced education (such as A-levels, Scottish Highers, NVQs up to Level 3).\n\n3. The agent properly concluded that since the 18-year-old daughter is studying an HNC (advanced education), she does not qualify under the age extension rules for Child Benefit.\n\n4. The eligibility_agent_payload confirms \"would_application_be_ineligible\": true with matching reasoning.\n\n5. This outcome aligns perfectly with the expected outcome of \"Not Eligible\" as specified in the test case metadata.\n\nThe agent asked appropriate questions to gather necessary information (child's age, type of course, living situation, UK residence/work status, and parental responsibility) and applied the eligibility criteria correctly according to gov.uk guidance. No erroneous or misleading information was provided."
