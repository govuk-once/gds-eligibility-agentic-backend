[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm John and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi John, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand if you might be eligible, could you please tell me your age?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm 17 years old.

[root_agent]: Thanks! And where do you currently live – with your parents, other family members, or somewhere else?

[evaluation_judge]: I live with my dad, Pete. It's just the two of us.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. Are you currently in education, or do you have a job?





[evaluation_judge]: I'm in education. I've left school and now I'm attending a local college to re-sit two of my GCSEs.

[root_agent]: That's good to know. Roughly how many hours a week would you say you are in supervised study or tuition at college? This includes things like lessons and scheduled study sessions.

[evaluation_judge]: I'm in college for about 6 hours a week for my GCSE classes. The rest of the time I'm mostly at home gaming.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, those 6 hours are *supervised* study or tuition – meaning a teacher or tutor is actively involved?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's right. It's 6 hours of proper classes with teachers. The rest of the studying I do at home by myself, but I don't do much of that to be honest.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for confirming. Do you receive any other financial support or benefits currently?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't receive any financial support or benefits right now.

[root_agent]: Thank you. Based on the information you've provided, and considering the rules around Child Benefit eligibility, it appears you may not be eligible. This is because, to qualify as "approved education" for Child Benefit purposes, a course generally needs to involve more than 12 hours a week of supervised study. 

Would you like me to explain this in a bit more detail, or are you happy with this initial assessment?

[evaluation_judge]: I'd like you to explain this in more detail, please. I didn't know there was an hours requirement.

[root_agent]: Certainly. Child Benefit can continue to be paid for young people aged 16-19 who are in approved education or training. However, the government has specific rules about what counts as “approved education”. 

For courses like the one you're taking at college, it needs to average more than 12 hours a week of supervised study or tuition to be considered full-time. Since your course is only 6 hours a week with a teacher, it unfortunately doesn’t meet that requirement.

Does that make the situation a little clearer? I can point you to the official government guidance if you’d like, but I am not permitted to provide links directly. Just let me know, and I can tell you what to search for on the gov.uk website.

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that makes it clearer. So because I'm only doing 6 hours of supervised study per week instead of the required 12+ hours, my dad wouldn't be eligible for Child Benefit for me?

[root_agent]: That’s exactly right. Because your course doesn’t meet the requirement of 12+ hours of supervised study per week, you are unfortunately not considered to be in approved education for the purposes of continuing to receive Child Benefit. Your dad would not be eligible to continue receiving it for you.



Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thanks for explaining it.

✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit since my 6 hours of supervised study falls below the minimum requirement of 12 hours per week to qualify as approved education.
