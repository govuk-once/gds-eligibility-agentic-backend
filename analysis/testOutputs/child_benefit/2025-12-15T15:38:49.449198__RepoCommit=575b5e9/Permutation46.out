[evaluation_judge]: Hi, i'm Hans and i'm looking to understand my eligibility for a particular benefit

[root_agent]: Hi Hans, thanks for reaching out. To help me understand your situation, could you please tell me how long you have been actively looking for work?

[evaluation_judge]: I've been actively looking for work and claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker for about 95 days now. I have Pre-Settled Status in the UK, but I don't have any job offers lined up at the moment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information, Hans. Just to confirm, when you say you have Pre-Settled Status, is that your current immigration status in the UK?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I have Pre-Settled Status as my current immigration status in the UK. I've been living here and looking for work for the past few months.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you. And to be clear, you've been claiming Child Benefit as a jobseeker *with* Pre-Settled Status for approximately 95 days now, and you don’t currently have a job offer?

[evaluation_judge]: That's right. I've been claiming Child Benefit with Pre-Settled Status for about 95 days now as a jobseeker, and unfortunately, I don't have a job offer at the moment.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming, Hans. Are you receiving any other form of financial support or have any other resources available to you at the moment?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't have any other significant financial support or resources right now. I've been relying on the Child Benefit while I search for work, but that's about it.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Based on the information you've provided, and the rules around claiming benefits with Pre-Settled Status as a jobseeker, it appears that your eligibility for Child Benefit may have ended. The rules state that you can generally claim as a jobseeker for 91 days with Pre-Settled Status, and you’ve now been looking for 95 days without a job offer.

Would you like me to explain this in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please explain this in more detail. I didn't realize there was a time limit. I thought as long as I had Pre-Settled Status, I could keep claiming Child Benefit while I look for work.

[root_agent]: You are right to ask for more detail, Hans. It's understandable to be unsure about these rules. While Pre-Settled Status *does* allow you to claim certain benefits, there's a time limit when claiming as a jobseeker. 

The rules state you can claim as a jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status for a maximum of 91 days. After that period, unless you have a genuine prospect of work – like a job offer – or other resources available to you, your right to reside for the purpose of claiming benefits often expires. 

As you've been claiming for around 95 days now and don’t have a job offer, it looks like you have unfortunately exceeded that 91-day limit. 

I understand this might be frustrating, and I want to be clear I’m just assessing your eligibility based on the information available to me. Would you like me to point you towards official resources that explain this rule in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: This is disappointing news, but thank you for explaining. Yes, I would appreciate if you could point me towards some official resources about this 91-day limit. I had no idea that my eligibility for Child Benefit would expire after a certain period. Is there anything I can do to maintain my benefits while I continue my job search?

[root_agent]: You're very welcome, Hans. I'm sorry to deliver disappointing news, but I'm glad I could explain the situation.

Regarding resources, the UK government website has information on eligibility for Child Benefit, including the rules around jobseeking and Pre-Settled Status. While I can't provide direct links, searching for "Child Benefit eligibility gov.uk" and "Pre-Settled Status benefits gov.uk" should lead you to the relevant pages.

As for maintaining benefits while continuing your job search, the key is demonstrating a 'genuine prospect of work'. This typically means having a confirmed job interview, or a conditional job offer. Without that, or other resources, it will be difficult to continue claiming. 

It might also be worth exploring other types of support available to you, such as Universal Credit, depending on your other circumstances. However, eligibility for Universal Credit as a Pre-Settled Status holder is also subject to certain conditions.

Would you like me to help you think through whether you might be eligible for Universal Credit, by asking you a few more questions?

[evaluation_judge]: ✗ The agent incorrectly asserted I was claiming Child Benefit "with Pre-Settled Status" rather than recognizing my status as a Jobseeker with Pre-Settled Status, leading to an incorrect analysis of my situation.
