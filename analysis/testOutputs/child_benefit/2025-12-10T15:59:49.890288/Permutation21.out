[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a UK resident in the described situation to test the agent's knowledge about Child Benefit eligibility in a split family scenario. I'll pose as Robert who has custody of Sam after divorcing Tina, who has custody of Ella.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello there. I understand you’re looking into Child Benefit eligibility. To start, could you tell me, are you responsible for any children?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I'm responsible for my son Sam who is 10 years old. He lives with me full-time since my ex-wife Tina and I divorced recently. Our daughter Ella lives with her mother.

[root_agent]: That’s helpful to know. Since Sam lives with you full-time, let’s talk about the rate of Child Benefit. Who gets the higher “Eldest Child” rate (£26.05)?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure about the rates. I just want to know what I'm eligible for as Sam's dad since he lives with me full-time. My ex-wife has our daughter Ella who is 8 years old living with her.

[root_agent]: Okay, I understand. In situations like this, where families have split up and children are living with different parents, each parent is entitled to the full £26.05 weekly rate for the eldest child in their household. So, you would receive the higher rate for Sam. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. Sam lives with me full-time since the divorce. So you're saying I would get the higher rate for Sam?

[root_agent]: Yes, exactly. Because Sam lives with you full-time, you would receive the full £26.05 “Eldest Child” rate for him. Do you have any other questions about your eligibility for Child Benefit, or anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: And what about my ex-wife Tina? Would she also get the higher rate for Ella who lives with her, or would she get a different amount?

[root_agent]: That’s a great question. Since Ella lives with your ex-wife Tina, she would receive the full £26.05 “Eldest Child” rate for her as well. Both parents are entitled to the higher rate when the children are living with different households, as per the guidelines.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for clarifying that. So just to make sure I understand correctly - I will get £26.05 per week for Sam, and Tina will also get £26.05 per week for Ella, since we each have one child living with us full-time after our divorce. Is that right?

[root_agent]: Yes, that’s absolutely correct! You will receive £26.05 per week for Sam, and Tina will receive £26.05 per week for Ella. It sounds like you’re both eligible for the full “Eldest Child” rate in this situation. Would you like me to confirm anything else about Child Benefit eligibility?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for the information.

✓ The agent correctly explained that both parents (Robert and Tina) would each receive the higher "eldest child" rate of £26.05 weekly for their respective children in a split family situation, which matches the expected outcome.
