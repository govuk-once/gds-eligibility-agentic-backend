[evaluation_judge]: I'll now role play as a UK visitor named Maria seeking benefit information. I'll engage with the agent and evaluate if they correctly determine I'm not eligible for Child Benefit due to my immigration status.

[root_agent]: Okay, hello Maria. I’m here to help you understand if you might be eligible for any benefits.

To start, can you confirm that you are currently physically in the United Kingdom?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, I am physically in the United Kingdom. I arrived about a month ago with my 5-year-old son. We're here on a tourist visa.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that.

Now, regarding your immigration status – do you have a “Right to Reside” in the UK for benefit purposes?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm here on a standard 6-month tourist visa from the United States. My son is with me as well. I'm not working while I'm here - we're just visiting.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for clarifying. Based on the information you’ve provided – that you’re here on a tourist visa and not working – it sounds like you don’t have a “Right to Reside” for benefit purposes. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, that's correct. I'm just here as a tourist from the US on a standard visitor visa for 6 months. I'm not working or anything like that.

[root_agent]: Alright, thank you for confirming. Given that you’re a US citizen here on a tourist visa and not working, you are not eligible for Child Benefit.

[evaluation_judge]: Thank you for letting me know that I'm not eligible for Child Benefit. So there are no benefits I can apply for while I'm here visiting with my son?

[root_agent]: That’s correct, Maria. Because of your visitor visa status and lack of employment, you wouldn’t be eligible for Child Benefit at this time. Would you like me to provide you with a link to the official information about Child Benefit eligibility, just for your reference?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent correctly determined that I am not eligible for Child Benefit due to my immigration status as a US citizen on a tourist visa without the right to reside for benefit purposes.
