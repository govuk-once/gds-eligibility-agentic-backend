[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Ali or Zara, the prospective adopters of Maya, to test the benefits eligibility agent.

[root_agent]: Hello, it’s lovely to meet you. To help me determine if you might be eligible for Child Benefit, could you tell me, are you responsible for Maya?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Maya is living with us now. She's 4 years old and was placed with us by the adoption agency a few weeks ago. We're still waiting for the final adoption order from the court, but she's fully in our care now.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to be clear, since Maya is living with you and you’re responsible for her, do you have to wait for the legal adoption process to complete before you can claim Child Benefit?

[evaluation_judge]: I'm not sure actually. That's one of the things I was wondering about - whether we need to wait until the adoption is finalized or if we can apply for Child Benefit now that Maya is living with us?

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s very helpful to know you were unsure.  To clarify, as Maya is living with you and you're responsible for her, you *can* claim Child Benefit as soon as she comes to live with you. You don’t have to wait for the final adoption order. Is that correct?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, that's really good to know! So we can apply for Child Benefit right away even though the adoption isn't legally finalized yet?

[root_agent]: Yes, exactly! You can apply for Child Benefit as soon as Maya lives with you, regardless of whether the adoption order is finalized.  

To make sure I’ve understood everything correctly, could you tell me your National Insurance number?

[evaluation_judge]: Oh, my National Insurance number is AB123456C. So to confirm, we're eligible for Child Benefit now that Maya is living with us, even though the adoption hasn't been finalized yet?

[root_agent]: Yes, that is absolutely correct. Based on the information you’ve provided, you are eligible for Child Benefit. Thank you for confirming everything. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you so much for the information!

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome. They correctly informed me that as prospective adopters with Maya living with us, we are eligible for Child Benefit immediately and do not need to wait for the final adoption order to be granted.
