[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as a user (Rashid's father) seeking information about Child Benefit eligibility. I'll engage with the agent under test until I receive an eligibility determination, then evaluate whether their conclusion matches the expected outcome.

[root_agent]: Hello! I understand you’re interested in Child Benefit eligibility. To start, could you tell me if Rashid is currently in approved education – for example, is he at school or college?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Rashid is still studying. He's 17 and currently doing his A-Levels at the local college.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, switching gears slightly, could you tell me if Rashid is currently married?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, he recently got married to his girlfriend. She's also 17 and has moved into our house to live with us.

[root_agent]: Thank you for that information. Just to clarify, does Rashid live with you and rely on you for financial support?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, Rashid lives with us in our family home. We provide for him financially while he completes his A-Levels. His wife also lives with us now, and we're helping support both of them while they finish school.

[root_agent]: Okay, I appreciate the clarity. Given that Rashid is in education, married, and living with you both receiving support, I’m going to check on a specific exception to the usual rules regarding marriage. Could you tell me, generally speaking, are you financially supporting your wife alongside Rashid?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, we are supporting both Rashid and his wife. They're both still in school, so we're providing accommodation, food, and other necessities for both of them while they complete their education.

[root_agent]: Thank you for confirming that. Based on this information – that Rashid is in approved education, married, living with you and receiving financial support, and you are supporting his wife whilst she’s also in education – it looks like you might be eligible for Child Benefit. 

Would you like me to confirm the final outcome for you?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, please confirm the final outcome about my Child Benefit eligibility for Rashid.

[root_agent]: Okay, based on the information you’ve provided, **you are likely eligible for Child Benefit.** The exception applies in this case because Rashid is in approved education, married, and living with you while you provide financial support, and his wife is also in education.

Do you have any other questions about this, or would you like me to explain any part of the process in more detail?

[evaluation_judge]: ✓ The agent provided the correct outcome, indicating I am eligible for Child Benefit through the exception that applies when a married child lives with the claimant and depends on them financially.
