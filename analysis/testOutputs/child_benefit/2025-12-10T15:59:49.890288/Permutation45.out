[evaluation_judge]: I'll role-play as Maria, who has been visiting her 8-year-old daughter in the hospital every day for 14 weeks without purchasing additional items for her.

I'll begin the conversation with the benefits agent now.

Hello, I wanted to ask about Child Benefit. My daughter is 8 years old and has been in the hospital for 14 weeks now. I visit her every day for several hours, but the hospital provides everything she needs - her food, clothes, and care. I'm wondering if I'm still eligible for Child Benefit during this time?

[root_agent]: Hello there. Thank you for reaching out to me. I understand you’re concerned about Child Benefit while your daughter is in hospital.

To start, has the child been in hospital for longer than 12 weeks?

[evaluation_judge]: Yes, she's been in the hospital for 14 weeks now. I go to see her every single day though, I don't miss a day. I spend hours with her to keep her company.

[root_agent]: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And just to clarify, do you regularly spend money on your daughter’s upkeep while she’s in the hospital – for example, on treats or clothes?

[evaluation_judge]: No, I don't spend money on her upkeep. The hospital provides everything she needs - all her meals, clothes, and medical supplies. I just visit her and keep her company, but I don't buy food, clothes, or gifts since the hospital already provides everything.

[root_agent]: Thank you for clarifying that. So, you don’t regularly spend any money on your daughter’s upkeep while she’s in hospital.

Just to be completely sure, could you tell me if your daughter is currently living with you, or is she in hospital care alone?

[evaluation_judge]: She's not living with me at all right now. She's been in hospital care for these entire 14 weeks. I visit her every day for several hours, but at the end of each day, I go home and she stays in the hospital. The hospital is providing all her care around the clock.

[root_agent]: Okay, thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me – that your daughter has been in hospital care for over 12 weeks and you don’t regularly spend money on her upkeep – it appears you are not eligible for Child Benefit in this situation.

Do you have any other questions for me today?

[evaluation_judge]: No, that's all I needed to know. Thank you for the information.

✓ The agent correctly determined I am not eligible for Child Benefit. The agent accurately applied both criteria: my daughter has been in hospital for more than 12 weeks (14 weeks) and I do not regularly spend money on her upkeep as required by the expenditure exception. The outcome matches the expected "Not Eligible" determination.
